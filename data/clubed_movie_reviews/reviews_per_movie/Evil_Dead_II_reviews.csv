Another Monster Mash...,"Always a tricky fish to try and fry, the second instalment of a growing franchise, recognising that the same as before just won't do, a need to break away from what's started and to brew, there's still plenty of gore and a great deal of splatter, without CGI, lots of matter gets scattered, some inconsistency, with the early story, but it soon moves along, although there's not really a song (why would there be), must have been lots of fun, making monsters to gun, making potions from notions, appendages that can run, it's quite dated today, though it had been ground breaking, but I enjoyed going back, got more hooked on the making - and It didn't make me laugh, and never did, and there's a good reason for that!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror Movie Played For Laughs; Extremely Entertaining,"This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story; a small amount of ridiculous theology compare to what usually is offered in this genre, and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.My main complaint is not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!There is no credibility in here, but that's okay since I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making rubber-faced wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence as not much more than just tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. It's great fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi and Campbell are back for a bigger and juicier sequel!,"Evil Dead II (1987) After the huge success of the first film, Sam Raimi andBruce Campbell reunite for this Quasi-Remake/Sequel.  Ash and his ladyare off on a nice trip through the woods.  They stop off and rest inside anold cabin.  Does Ash realize that he's been here before, or hasn't he? Raimi and company (armed with a bigger budget and over the top special effects) bring us the second installment of the Evil Dead series.  This film focusesmore on black humor and camp instead of shock and horror.  Technicallythis film is far superior to the one that was release a few years back and in many ways it's a better film.What a better way to spend the night?  Watch Evil Dead II with some ofyour friends and let the party begin!  Leave all logic at the door.Remember, this is a movie, and a fun one at that.Highly recommended!A++",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
DIABOLICAL entertainment for the wicked!,"""The Exorcist"" made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering ""what the f*** just happened?!"". The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! ""Evil Dead II"" makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that ""she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (""dead by dawn!""), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a sui generis Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the ""A Farewell to Arms"" joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. ""Groovy!"". ""Dead by Dawn"" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here.The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore.Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a ""solo"". Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him.The gore here is great, glorious. You get decaps, mutilated bodies, a hand cut off, bleeding demons, etc. Blood spread all over the cabin is the common denominator. One of the goriest movies of all time.Watch ""Evil Dead II"" to witness one of the most creative, brave, and goriest movies of all time. It delivers something for everyone. It has action, gore, spectacular camera angles, and some action! Check out Ash V.S. possessed Henrietta. * After it, phrases like ""join us!"", ""swallow this!"", and specially ""groovy!"" will be part of your daily vocabulary.Recommended for every Horror fan in the world. This movie is an obligation to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An electrifying roller coaster ride of a movie!,"This film, is without a shadow of a doubt, one of finest, most imaginative comedy horror films ever made.  Raimi, has put all the aspects of the film together in masterful fashion.  The camera work and sound effects are pulsating, and the timing is perfection.  And in Bruce Campbell, the film as a lead actor who gives an exceptional performance.  Campbell plays ""Ash"", an everyday, supermarket attendant who suddenly finds himself thrown into the unusual situation of having to defend himself against, zombies, evil spirits and even his own possessed hand, just in order to survive the night. I laughed, I gasped, and I gripped the arm of my chair throughout! If you like your comedies, black and hilarious, and your horror, gory and sensational, then look no further.

The best Evil Dead movie of all time my personal favorite,"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy.This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the ""B"" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red.The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise.Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical ""avert your eyes"" blood and guts.Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Violent, gruesome, over the top, a GREAT movie!","Nonstop fun as a group of people are trapped overnight in a remote cabin and tormented by the evil dead.Not really a sequel to ""The Evil Dead""--more of a remake. Director Sam Raimi expected this to be R rated and figured most people never saw the unrated (meaning it was X) first one. So, he decided to just redo the movie--just quicker, less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy (the first one was dead serious). He did it, cut some gore but it was STILL unrated. So it was released (with the gore never put back in) and, like the first, didn't do too well. And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!Basically once the movie gets going it never stops. It's more a comedy than a horror movie--a very SICK comedy! Hands are cut off, eyeballs go flying, BUCKETS of blood are thrown around, knives and axes are used, etc. If you go expecting a horror film, you'll be disappointed. If you approach it as a sick comedy you'll love it! I recommend this highly but only if you have a strong stomach!The sequence with Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his possessed hand is a horrific and comedic highlight. Cool ending too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepy and scary horror feast with  plenty of gore ,  guts  and loads of blood","Amusing and terrifying bloodfeast in which Ash/Bruce Campbell returns for a second round when he takes refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the people into evil demons until only Ashley J. Williams remains to battle the evil . This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell) , none too bright hero , who finds caught between scary monsters located into a ghastly cabin in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . As the lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holds up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack . As Ash along with his shotgun , and his chainsaw finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ and subsequently to confront a nasty witch . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc .An eerie , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , and filled with primitive special effects , by using stop-motion technique . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous version ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating . Highly adequate make-up and appropriate special effects with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the eighties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . The producers insisted upon using different colors of blood to avoid an X rating , this proved futile, as the MPAA gave the film an X anyway ; after cuts, they received a more desirable R rating . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as improbable hero . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . This one is Bruce Campbell's favorite film of the trilogy ('The Evil Dead', 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', and 'Army of Darkness' in which Ash is hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time) . There appears cameo by Sam Raimi as the first Medieval knight to raise his sword and give his speech before hailing to Ash and the Zombified Henrietta was actually played by Sam Raimi's little brother , Ted Raimi . Thrilling as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Peter Deming , though most of the film was shot on a set built inside the gymnasium of the JR Faison Junior High School in Wadesboro, North Carolina .The motion picture was well directed by Sam Raimi , but many scenes were deleted from the movie and according to official reports, all of them and original version of the movie are lost . All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and compellingly directed by Sam Raimi . Its sequel was this ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) also starred by Sarah Berry , Dan Hicks , Kassie Wesley DePaiva , Ted Raimi , among others . And ¨Army of darkness¨ who finds Ash accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., as he is trapped in the middle ages where attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home ; this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were low-budget , it was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Come to sweet Henrietta!""","Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick and perhaps my favorite horror film (top five at least). Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination.

It's not the original,"I may be in the minority here, and that's okay, but this movie pales in comparison to the original. It seems like the director was trying to make a low-budget B horror movie, but instead they ended up with something that can't even be compared to the first movie. The original ""Evil Dead"" was excellent, but this one cannot live up to it. Rather than delivering on both the funny and scary aspects, this movie fails at both. If you haven't seen the original, this might be entertaining, but I still wouldn't recommend it. This movie is the epitome of a ""set-up"" movie, connecting the story from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Army of Darkness"", but it does so in an unsatisfying way. Don't waste your time, rent and watch the first one, but leave this one alone.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

From somebody who knows nothing about the first film..,"...but has thoroughly enjoyed the second one since it came out in 1987. From reading other comments apparently history has been rewritten in relation to the first, but I can't speak to that. Let me just say that if you haven't seen the first one the second one fills in enough details that you know what is going on.The film starts with Ash and girlfriend Linda taking a romantic weekend trip to a cabin. It's a cabin that Ash knows about, but says he does not know the owners, thus he really doesn't know their whereabouts. He says they'll just claim to have gotten lost in the woods if they show up. The cabin is actually where Professor Knowby brought the recently discovered Book of the Dead. We know this because Ash finds the tape recorder and plays Knowby's entries. On the tape Knowby speaks aloud the words that are supposed to resurrect the evil dead - those evil spirits that inhabit the forest and world around us. Once brought to life they can apparently manipulate objects and possess people at will, in search of a way back into this world via possession and a way to harvest souls for hell. Those spoken words do their work, and the evil dead are brought back to this world. Well it is nighttime, and since that is when the evil dead are active they immediately begin to make Ash's life a living hell.Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie is on her way to the cabin with more pages from the Book of the Dead where she thinks her parents are doing research. She has with her a research assistant, and two locals who show her a way around the destroyed bridge that leads over the canyon to the cabin - a bridge destroyed by the evil dead to trap Ash where he is.There is confusion at first as Ash fires a shotgun through a closed door when he hears the four trying to enter the cabin - considering what he's been through up to that point that's no wonder. Likewise, at first Annie looks at the blood and destruction of the cabin and thinks Ash killed her parents. However, it is soon obvious what the real enemy is here, one you cannot see or hear, one that can possess anything, anyone, or even just part of a person. It can make the dead appear as they did in life, it can make the living appear as demons. One particularly creative thing done here is that you see things occasionally from the evil spirits' viewpoint as they rush through the woods, making an awful roaring noise, headed towards the cabin.The action and the chaos just never lets up from the time the forces of evil first attack the cabin. It's hard to describe, and I know it sounds strange, but there is enough tongue in cheek humor merged with some really riveting horror, that you don't feel completely drained from the intensity of it all. For example, when you have both a possessed lamp and a possessed stuffed deer head laughing at you, things get both so horrible and funny that you feel you are watching a satire of a horror film. Only the very end confused me a bit, and maybe that is because I haven't seen the first film. I'd recommend it as horror well done in a different and creative style.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Extremely cheap, yet well crafted film:  loads of great scenes!","Sequel or remake? There has always been a huge debate whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake, since the second film contradicts the story that occurred in Evil Dead. Such as, the ending of Evil Dead ends with Ash being chased down by the evil spirit which deceased the other characters. However, after the paraphrase of events at the start of Evil Dead II, which only features Ash and Linda and Ash is once again hit by the same evil spirit. That's where the story begins in the second film.So, the book was destroyed in The Evil Dead, whereas it appears again in Evil Dead II. This certainly isn't a huge factor. Actually, if one can recall James Whale's 1935 masterpiece sequel entitled Bride of Frankenstein. There is no question that director Sam Raimi used the Whale masterpiece as the blueprint for his sequel. In Bride of Frankenstein, the film starts with a prologue that recaps the events of the first film, however, completely contradicting the entire ending of the film which is where the sequel starts. I understand that Raimi was going through legal issues, so he was forced in this position to contradict the first film, but he certainly used the way that made Bride of Frankenstein the classic in remains. Not to mention, in Frankenstein, it is a straightforward horror film, whereas in the sequel it is a macabre, satirical film that uses the blend of horror and black comedy at it's finest. No doubt Raimi's Evil Dead II uses the same concept.So is Evil Dead II a sequel or a remake? It is undoubtedly a sequel! A fairly good one as well, that in many ways surpasses it's original prototype. It's certainly not one of the most visually inventive, relentless, and truly original films ever made as some claim it to be, it's not even one of the top films of it's very own genre. However, it remains one of the best full-on gore slapstick's ever seen. The script is witty, and well written (mostly on the part of Scott Spiegel). It's no secret that one of films main inspirations was The Three Stooges, along with many other slapstick comedy's. Though it's director Raimi's unbelievable POV shots, weird lighting, stop motion animation, moving hand held camera, etc. that makes the film work.That being said, Evil Dead II just isn't a grade-A horror film, it isn't on the level of the classics such as, Peeping Tom, Freaks, Nosferatu, Vampyr, The Phantom of the Opera (silent), The Man Who Laughs, etc. It does not have much of a plot. It has very little acting, little continuity, and no logic. Evil Dead II is a classic cult horror film in every sense of the word. You simply have to come along and experience it for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dead by dawn,"Evil Dead 2 (1987) the sequel once again directed by Sam Raimi was very entertaining to watch, but I do not think this movie is outstanding. This movie is silly throughout the whole runtime, but even though I liked the first movie I liked Evil Dead 2 (1987) more. It does not take itself too seriously so you can have fun with the effects, and certain moments that make it as memorable as possible, while also being creepy from time to time.I liked Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, and thought he was good in the movie. He is slowly going even more insane during the movie that makes for some funny scenes, he goes through a lot because of the undead creatures attacking him, along with building up to being an awesome character by the end. Plus, Bruce Campbell does a lot of stunts and deals a lot of damage in a way that is believable and impressive.I do love the practical effects they show off throughout the whole movie, even if it can look silly from time to time it is impressive how it is shown. There was good makeup and effects, and a lot of practical gore effects because of all these dead creatures attacking in many ways. The fact they put a lot of effort into the effects shows how much they wanted to try and scare you, even if it was low on the budget when making it.Particularly good stunt work with the actors, and the cinematography is cool. The camera shots can look weird enough to fit what is happening, and the way they shoot these locations are in effective ways, along with weird camera angles and movements of the actors and the undead creatures that makes the movie entertaining to watch. Plus, there are some transitions from scene to scene in this that I thought was cool on how it was shot and edited together.The Evil Dead 2 (1987) was better than the first and I thought it had more entertainment value than the first, even though I was entertained by the first movie. This movie does not take itself too seriously, which makes it fun, funny, creepy, and enjoyable to watch from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Sequel to the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror indeed,"This is the type of film we really wish we made ourselves before some else thought of it. It's intelligent but not entirely complex ... entirely enjoyable yet a serious piece of film making ... everything adds up to cult status. It's the type of film your uninformed friends (or mine at least, I'm surely surrounded by fools) dismiss as trash without giving it a chance.Raimi showed us the thrills, chills and blackly tinged laughs he could bring about in the first in the series on a virtually non-existent budget. Here with just that little bit more he retreads old ground but everything still works ... probably more effectively too! Seeing some of props used and slightly off production values (the 'muppet' headless girlfriend in the shed, the demon head stuck to camera attacking Ash towards the end, Ted Raimi's ripped old lady from hell suit and the quickest of glimpses of set floor boards during one stage of shooting) shows how Raimi was still constrained by budget issues.Seriously though, who cares ... this film has 6 different colours of blood, some seriously funny slap-stick scenes (didn't think I'd say that anytime soon) and a chemistry between lead Campbell and director Raimi that let the jokes flow freely.Campbell proves himself a master of face contortion, self-harm as well as flipping himself over! So many classic scenes in such a short space of time ... my favourite being when Jake is dragged into the cellar and a torment of pink blood comes pumping out. The camera work is as dynamic and as fast paced as in the first outing, the shot of ash standing by the remains of the bridge at the start of film standing out for its grandness among otherwise less cinematic shots.The film leads on nicely to the 3rd installment in the series with one-handed Ash getting sucked into another dimension to face the undead in jolly olde England (or something like that). It really is no wonder that the in-store geeks/pop-culture snobs of High Fidelty described Evil Dead II as the greatest movie of all time.'Groovey' indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The 1st ED felt like a horror you knew what it was but with 2 I didn't know if I was meant to be spooked or laugh just left me confused.There are some brilliant scenes in this movie and I recognise they took the film edle hands directly from this movie along with other films going forward.Wasn't all that gory with many scenes cutting away from what's happening but it's obvious what's going onI love the character ash and his chainsaw but the story didn't really seem to go anywhereI wanted to love it after all the positive reviews but I left more confused suppose I'll have to watch the 3rd now to find out what actually happens or is that going to confuse me even more.Still don't know if this is a sequel or prequel,5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Movie Ever Made...,"... in the evil dead series. From the very beginning I couldn't stop smiling... every time I saw Bruce Campbell i laughed and every time there was a fight I chuckled. It is an extremely fun movie with a no mercy attitude. Sam Raimi perfects his shaky cam shots and first persons and makes for the most enjoyable experience in a long time. The plot is sturdy (identical to Evil Dead) and the technology is painful (purposefully). The movie moves leisurely from event to event. The supporting cast are stupid and bring more trouble to the film (a much needed element) and the best part is, the carnage starts 5 minutes into the movie. A no-think great movie, possibly the best movie the horror genre has turned out in the last 20 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sam Raimi tried to make it less of an X rated by making the blood splatter coloured green, blue and a little bit of red added in (a little bit in evil dead standards) but still became an X rating.

"Awkward, confusing start turns into insane, over-the-top horror comedy","RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Evil Dead"" chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva).The first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but it's decidedly comedy horror. It's entertaining for what it is, but it's hindered by a confusing opening ""recap"" that doesn't match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn't have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later ""rediscovers"" that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film.Once you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative it's as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and she's a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 24 minutes and was shot in Wadesboro and (studio) Wilmington, North Carolina, with supplementary work done in Detroit.

One of the Greatest Horrors of the 1980's,"Sam Raimi's sequel to the original 1981 Evil Dead. There was more of a budget for Evil Dead 2 and was created from the original story line but with a bit of a punch to it.Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a vacation to a small cabin in the woods, romantically entangled they love the place and the area. Ash finds a book and a strange knife in the basement, the Necronomicon Ex- Mortis (the book of the dead)which the dead spirits and demons come to life by reading pages in the book. A romantic holiday soon turns into a nightmare.This movie seems to have it all. Gore, suspense, great camera angles, storyline, script, dark comedy scenes and quotes.Highly recommended",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Goes in a totally different direction than the original,"This is a funny movie, no really! Although The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II share numerous plot similarities, the tones of the features are significantly different. While both movies contain elements of satire, the first is much more of a straightforward horror endeavor than its sequel. Evil Dead II raises the stakes by introducing outright slapstick and one-liners into the mix. Consequently, the ""scare level"" of the movie drops a notch. It is still possible to be unsettled by Evil Dead II, but far less likely than by its predecessor. It's interesting to note the way Ash changes between The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. In the former, he's a geeky guy who ends up being a reluctant hero of sorts. In the sequel, he's a none-too-bright macho dude who's out to get the ""Dead-ites"". By the end of Evil Dead II, he has an impressive arsenal of weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun and a chainsaw. Evil Dead 2 is a worthy sequel to the first Evil Dead, but the tone is so different you must go in with a perspective.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's kind of a remake, but then again it kind of isn't....Sort of!","Evil Dead II once again sees Ash (Bruce Campbell) battling the evil demons in a run down cabin in the woods with his teenage friends. Its the centrepiece of the Evil Dead Trilogy and yet it feels a little like a remake of the original, it does follow on from the events of the first film but the similarities between the two are very apparent.Once again there is plenty of horror, gore and chills; but this time there is even more humour than in the first outing, and once again it is a great film.The character of Ash and the direction of Raimi combine well again and this time the effects have improved a little too.7/10 I still prefer the first film, but in truth they are about as good as each other.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as I remembered it,"I remember thinking Evil Dead 2 was amazing back in the 80s when i saw it but re-watching it now it seems overshadowed by the later Army of Darkness, which is very similar in plot and intent but considerably more substantial, funny and clever, I think. If you have seen Army of Darkness, I think you may find Evil Dead 2 redundant. Both are basically satires of horror and not the least bit frightening! Bruce Campbell is an excellent physical comic actor, but he goes way beyond Evil Dead in Army of DarknessI am interested now in seeing the original Evil Dead which I understand is more of a straight horror movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
how does THIS get such a high rating? it was so stupid!,"This is possibly the dumbest film ever made...don't waste your time. the first one was brilliant and legit freaky, but this one was more a comedy than a horror film. if you're expecting to be scared, don't bother.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entirely bonkers wild masterpiece,"So much screaming, blood, silliness, and badassary!

A trip into a world of horror and comedy!,"The Evil Dead trilogy still comes through as top notch, low budget, scary movies in the style of such titles as Nightmare on Elm street. This particular chapter of the trilogy _ Evil Dead II _ gives us as much as you can expect from a sequel, and more. That is to say, you must expect more ghoulish demoniacal possessions; more hand-held camera movements; and more, much more BLOOD! However, Evil Dead II starts to separate it self from other movies in this genre (and its prequel for that matter), particularly in a growing non-sense comedy style witch very smoothly sets in. Although one might think that horror and comedy don't mix, Sam Raimi really pulled it off. For that purpose its clear that Bruce Campbell gets ""carte blanch"" with his character Ash. You can't help to laugh in some of the scenes inside the lodge with his over the top performance. But don't worry, because the horror and gore side of the movie is still there, all the way to the end. So, if you were a big fan of the first movie, and are not in the mood of something a bit different, don't watch this. On the other hand, if you can keep an open mind about it, then you'll get a great trip for sure. Enough said! I don't want to spoil it for you!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,"The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. This movies great for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says ""make your own movie to just make a movie"" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is ""Manic, inspired genius. A great time!"" and in my own words ""It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
evil dead II is a excellent mix of comedy and horror,"The directing is breathtaking and the monsters looks

Campiness further strengthened,"""I'm fine... I'm fine...""
""I don't think so. We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does that sound ""fine?""I never imagined myself cracking up like that in a horror film. I'm not kidding when I say my face hurts from laughing. I anticipated something along the lines of its predecessor, unrepentantly campy but dead serious with the horror stuff. The unexpected comic relief caught me off guard, and I broke into laughter. The film's departure from the expected serious tone made for a refreshing and enjoyable viewing.This was a laugh-out-loud ride from start to finish. I'm not sure how anyone could be frightened by this; the sound effects, the visuals, the screams (man! Those screams) made me laugh out loud several times. Overall, it was a lighthearted and entertaining experience that left me feeling amused and cheered up. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh and some thrill.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than the First,"Sam Raimi is an expert at horror films. From his writing to his cinematography, he has developed such an iconic style, which is always a treat to see. Evil Dead 2 takes all the best elements of that and puts it over the top in the greatest ways. Even better than the already amazing first film, the sequel sees Ash (Bruce Campbell) taking on the deadites once again. It is a joy to watch Campbell at work, as you can tell he loves the material and is having a blast in the role. The film is genuinely scary and sends shivers down your spine with the gruesome slaughtering and mutilation throughout. The score and audio in general is masterfully used to put you on the edge of your seat and give you feelings of uneasiness at every creepy moment. The franchise really takes form in this installment and it open the doors to an exciting continuation for our hero. With Evil Dead 2, horror has never felt so fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do not read the book,"I found myself tittering a lot when watching this film which is strange as it is supposed to be gore laden horror film. Sam Raimi along with his leading man, Bruce Campbell deliver a low budget, manic, effects filled horror film with lashings of comedy.Ash (Bruce Campbell) is taking his girlfriend Linda to a secluded where he find a tape recorder and a book. The tape was found by a professor who translates the the book of the dead which unleashes malevolent spirits that possess Linda, leaving Ash to chop her head off. Later on Ash hand starts to attack him as it turns evil due to Linda's bite. Ash has to cut it hand off.Later on the professor's daughters turns up with a few other people but faced being attacked by possessed people and the only way out is to read a passage that drives the evil away.I do not know how Raimi managed to do some of the special effects and gore in such a low budget, there is stop motion animation, a tribute to the manic slapstick comic styles of the Three Stooges and Tex Avery. Campbell's broad acting style certainly gets results here.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This belongs in the horror movie hall of fame,"Evil Dead 2 (1987) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline for this picture follows our friend Ash on a hot date on his way to a little cabin in the woods. What he doesn't know is the family that was there before him found an ancient book that has unleashed spirits like you've never known inside the house. As they try to survive the cabin they get some uninvited guests which only complicates matters...This movie is directed by legend Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) and stars Bruce Campbell (Bubba Ho-Tep), Sarah Berry (CHUD II), Dan Hicks (Intruder), Kassie Wesley DePaiva (Days of our Lives), Ted Raimi (The Midnight Meat Train) and Denise Bixler (Booker).The settings and use of smoke machines to enhance them are absolutely awesome. The makeup, masks and special effects are tremendous, especially for this era. Everything that happens inside the cabin is magic. The hand scenes in this will always be horror gold. Ash Vs Linda and Vs the Hand are hilarious sequences. I could watch those scenes over and over again. I also adored the conversation at the bridge. The plot and storyline, while virtually identical to the first film, still has so many original and unique elements. The gore is legendary and the blood splatter is elite, like being sprayed from a hose good. The use of the camera to create the monster in the woods is very smart and the ending is absolutely awesome.Overall, this belongs in the horror movie hall of fame and is an easy 10/10 and absolute must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a classic,"THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC FILM!!!Classics must have some level of merit. I can confirm that this film is neither funny nor scary (contrary to other reviews).When compared to modern films (as I firmly believe all old films should be) this film does not stand up. The acting is poor, the script is poor, the pace is poor and the special effects are poor.This film should not have a 7.7 rating when decent modern films (including horrors, horror comedies and other genres) that are clearly of a higher quality (in all of writing and performance) are getting sub 5* ratings.The previous reviews on this film just demonstrate that the age of a film can (unduly) cause a film to have a higher rating.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Groovy""","This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy most people refer to ""Evil Dead 2"" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre.8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Iconic and gruesome fun,"Taking up his impactful ""Evil Dead"" from 1981, Sam Raimi delivered a fantastic reimagining of his vision.Within 10 minutes, ""Evil Dead II"" manages to descend into absolute madness of the best kind, with a protagonist that became an absolute horror icon. I dare you to find another example of a perfect blend of horror and comedy, a wildly free camera that serves as the second protagonist and a more influential low-budget, basically one-location film.In my opinion, it was this film that cemented Sam Raimi as one of the most imaginative and humourous genre directors of our time, and it hasn't lost any of its appeal to this day. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A profoundly disappointing ""sequel"" to one of my all time favourite horror movies.","'The Evil Dead' is one of my all time favourite horror movies. It's a classic example of what can be achieved on a very low budget if you have ideas and enthusiasm, and twenty years after it was released it holds up very well. The first movie was lot of fun without being deliberately FUNNY. Things aren't the same in 'Evil Dead 2', which is basically a remake trying to pass itself off as a sequel. The tone is very different this time around. The subtle black humour of the original has been replaced by blatant self-parody, and Three Stooges inspired slapstick. Many people absolutely love this approach and regard this as the best in the series. Well I'm sorry I'm not one of them. I think Bruce Campbell is cool too, but this movie is just an excuse for Ash to mug at the camera and throw out cheesy one liners. I wouldn't mind so much if the results were actually funny, but they're not, just silly. There's no suspense or unease in 'Evil Dead 2', something I really admired about the original, and to me, the supposedly more sophisticated special effects aren't half as effective. I don't hate this movie, I'm just profoundly disappointed by it. I can't see any reason to prolong this slamming. You either like this kind of splatter comedy or you don't. If you do it's probably essential viewing, but if you're like me and prefer horror more than comedy then you might be in for a tedious experience. My lack of enthusiasm for 'Evil Dead 2' doesn't spoil my enjoyment of 'The Evil Dead'. That movie is still a horror classic and I recommend it to everyone.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Made on the cheap, just like the first one.","Despite Sam Raimi's ultra low-budget film ""The Evil Dead"" becoming a bit of a cult favorite, somehow this did not catapult Raimi to A-director status and he had a hard time financing this follow-up movie. Oddly, however, Stephen King came to the rescue. Apparently he loved the first movie and wanted to see a sequel, so he financed this film. But it's obvious that this sequel is STILL a cheapo movie.The story appears to pick up exactly where the first movie ended. If you see them one after the other, you will notice a few differences...the cabin, the age of Bruce Campbell and a few other details. While it appeared as if Ash (Campbell) destroyed the evil dead by dismembering them and burning ""The Book of the Dead"", somehow this is NOT the case and once again the demons begin attacking once again. But, because most of his friends were completely dismembered, the demons actually possess his hand...leading Ash to begin fighting with himself. This makes it obvious that the tone of the second film is more comedic than the first.While Ash is busy fighting off evil, a couple Yuppie-type researchers are heading to this same cabin. Apparently, they are interested in the book and the professor's research. Eventually, they find their way there along with a couple idiots and now it's these five versus evil...much like the first film.The movie uses many gallons of blood just like the first film and once again, Ash is drenched from head to toe in blood. The amount of blood makes the film pretty unrealistic...which is good because if it was ultra-realistic it would be much tougher to watch. In addition, the film uses more stop-motion than the first film...and I must say that it's incredibly cheesy. The budget constraints of the movie are VERY obvious in these scenes.Bruce Campbell reportedly liked this film best of the various Evil Dead films, though I know some fans prefer the funnier ""Army of Darkness"". I could see why Campbell liked this second one, as it didn't have all the problems getting made like the first one...where he had to put up his own money just to get the film completed...which is odd for an actor to do.My feeling about both ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"" is that young filmmakers would be very well served to watch these films...along with other horror films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" (the 1968 version) and ""Bad Taste"" as they are great examples of horror done on the cheap. Plus, Sam Raimi, George Romero and Peter Jackson all went on to excellent careers in films thanks to the cult-like following these movies received. So, while they might be cheesy and cheap, they prove that these are not serious problems if you can still manage to construct an enjoyable horror film. While I am not a fan of gore horror, I do certainly respect what these movies achieved and think they are well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A perfect mix of horror and comedy at an amazing pace,"The two main genres this film represents are horror and comedy. The jokes and scares are blended together in a perfect smoothie, the scares in the movie are so silly and over the top it becomes funny but the aspect of horror still remains by having the exaggeration still base around the macabre and the sinister. This perfect blend of horror and comedy produces the perfect emotion in the viewer which I call ""nervous laughter"" (Another pretty much perfectly crafted blend of these two genres is in Shaun of the Dead when the two main characters first meet the zombie girl named ""Mary"").The low budget style which permeates the film helps not only creates more laughs but also makes you smile and kind of inspire you in a weird way. The fact that a string holding a flying eye can be clearly seen and a hand can be seen opening a door to help let the camera through it and the fact that the zombie's make-up can be seen peeling off makes you view them not as goofs and mistakes but as little jokes. It's hard to describe the feel a low-budget films gives you but it can be summed up by showing that the director (in this case, Sam Raimi) wants to make a film so much they will put their heart and soul on putting script to screen despite the fact it may be god-awful in it's effects and presentation. Also, I think this movie is a movie that makes people into film makers. If a talented director uses rather rubbish effects but makes the film great nonetheless then maybe you can even if you don't have that much money. Money is not what makes a film, it's the heart that does. Many big blockbusters are emotion-less machines (Star Wars prequels, Transformers). But dedication in a film gives it heart (Peter Jackson's early movies and El Mariachi).The pacing in this film is also ridiculously amazing. There is literally (and I do mean literally) constant horror and comedy. There is no scene without a joke or scare or both like I said earlier. Some may say that the cutting back to the scene where the people get off the plane is slow but it goes on for about a minute and no more. This persistent of the genres make this one of the most entertaining films of all time.Honestly I'd skip the first Evil Dead movie and go straight to this one. Not only is the first film covered in this one in 5 minutes like it's a ""previously on..."" but also the scares are scarier and there is more jokes, there being very few in Evil Dead 1. See this movie if you love being entertained, I think it would be very hard to find someone who doesn't like this movie, unless there one of those stupid people who think violence in films is evil.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Video nasty gold.,"Generation X enough to remember the sheer pleasure of watching a video nasty that escaped the UK banned hit list and lax 80's video store staff who gave no hoots you were 9 years under age to watch it.Now that prepubescent hype has had decades enough to calm down - does it still hold up?Well, kinda - it's definitely a gory hoot, cheap vhs gore that is. I guess the appreciation of the creativity of the effects (and budget restraints) are more part of its charm, than the quality by today's standards. (It's ok to admit films you cherish as a memory are a bit rubbish and still like them).Think more pantomime horror than scary, with over the top hammy acting and all, but it all works like a bloody charm.Square jawed hunkster Bruce is just throwing himself into the crazy and I think it's legacy has a lot to do with his charisma and craziness, like a male model meets Nicholas Cage mash up type thing.I still love the swooping, swoosh noise camera panning chase through the woods and house, that's something that does still look cool in the 2020's but not so much the stop motion stuff.It's short enough to ride through til the end, it gets on with it pretty quickly so no unnecessary padding at the start. Everyone loves that eyeball swallowing and it's definitely more lighter and comedic than the first. (The trees restrain themselves better in this one as well ! )I probably watch this every year or so, I wouldn't say it's a favourite horror, just a familiar one. I wouldn't blame first time watchers for wondering what all the fuss is about, but I think a good chunk will like the dark silliness of it all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely horrible and lacking all redeeming qualities.,"No one can seriously look at this film and consider it anything other than a crock.  Poor acting, poor direction, poor script and cheap camera tricks do not add up to a masterpiece.  I pity anyone who likes this film as they do not know anything about film.  Completely devoid of fear and humor, the childish attempts at humor should fail to entertain even the most simple-minded folk.   Whereas some films are so bad that they become enjoyable, this film grates on my mind knowing that something this bad exists and is still lauded.  Sam Raimi should apologize for creating this genre, and Bruce Campbell should be black-listed.  Spraying multi-colored liquids does not induce fear, and that is not a cinematic vision.  A true waste of film, and 80 minutes.0 stars out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bruce and Raimi are pure Genius,"Raimi is well known for his Spider man series but not as much as his evil dead series which is equally as good maybe even better.This is a gore fest mixed with great comedy and the cheesy quotations from Ash makes the film even more enjoyable.This film is remarkably much better than the original Evil Dead but don't be so surprised first read on By mistake i stumbled upon this film thinking it was actually a zombie film, sorry if you expected that but in all honesty its more of a ghoul kinda film. If no one agrees with me then write a complaint but to me a zombie is something that is slow, non Witty, dumb and don't talk thats not at all what is portrayed in this film.Acting is very over-dramatic but it's supposed to be so don't think you've bought a rubbish film when you switch on. Great direction from Sam raimi and definitely worth waiting for EVIL DEAD IV.If you want a good hour and so of gore slash and thrash then this is a perfect film for you, if you like black comedy same again, if you like old films then this again is the one for you. It's a true tribute to some of the best film legends you'll see. In some way you can kinda say this is one of the best horror films made if you can label it that.But anyhow this film is definitely in my top five films of all time Buy it, rent it and enjoy it 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is this really a... sequel?,"I still can't understand yet if this is a sequel or a remake. There's no connection between Evil Dead and it's ""sequel"" Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn. If you've seen Evil Dead 1 then you should know the drill with this one. While this isn't in anyway at all a bad movie, it doesn't do much to go above and beyond the gory glory of its older, and superior, brother. Dead By Dawn pretty much kicks off from the very beginning with people being possessed by the dead. This version has a bit more of a twist, and this is also the movie where Ash gets his signature ""boomstick"" and chainsaw arm. Dead By Dawn also focuses more so on being a horror comedy, still leaning more towards horror, instead of being a full fledged horror like the older brother. It does succeed in doing this, but falls short at a few parts. Overall this is a worthy... uh... sequel? It's got a two in front of the name so I guess we can call it that. Just realize that there is NO connection (at least that I could find) between this and Evil Dead 1. I highly recommend it to those already fans of Evil Dead 1.

Best horror movie ever,if there was one movie that makes me wish I could go back to being 11 years old and watch again for the 1st time it's this one. Starting out as a terrifying demonic scare fest then with ash through his ordeals becoming a badass. I remember being one of the 1st kids to see this one right before going to summer camp and of course had all the other kids in my cabin convinced it was a true story and that happenened in these cabins. That the demons and necronomicon were real and still here. Convincing them that the counselor's all knew about the evil but were too afraid to mention it and that's why they slept in the locked main building and left us kids alone outside all night. Of course that came back to bite me when it was time to go to bed and my imagination would catch up to me and I would start to think what if I'm right and it's really out there😨? I guess compared to today's standards of human centipedes and hostel todays youth would probably find it bland but this one will always hold a special place in my heart.... The year I went to camp with the evil dead and survived =O. I have to wonder if I traumatized any of my fellow campers who hadn't seen this movie with my tales of terror about this movie lol. Eventually some of the kids were so scared they were moved to the locked main building and the counselor's weren't happy with me.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Who's in my fruit cellar? Someone with a fresh souuuuul! ***** out of 5,"Ah, what can I say that hasn't been said before? I mean seriously. Evil Dead II is a work of horrific/comedic genius! This is a film that kind of reminds me of one of those spook houses that come around at halloween time. You walk through it and while it's scary and all, it's also when you find yourself laughing at the same time.This is just a terrific spook filled, gross out, barrel of laughs.This is also the movie that made Bruce Campbell the icon he is. Sure he was great in Evil Dead, but this one established him as the true chainsaw wielding, talk backing hero. Groovy.There are a ton of memorable lines here. Oh, and the acting by the co-stars is definitely a step up from the previous entry. Not that it matters.

A General Look at the Second Chapter of a Horror Classic,"This film isn't necessarily better than the first one overall, but there's a huge difference between the budgets of the two. The first film was made with just $350,000, while the second had a whopping $3.5 million budget. That's a significant leap, yet the quality of the makeup doesn't reflect such a difference. In fact, this might sound like a bold statement, but the makeup in the second film is weaker compared to the first.The storyline in the first movie was logical and easy to follow; it was clear where the story began and ended. However, the second film starts off very quickly, and events unfold so suddenly that it can feel a bit jarring. In terms of the screenplay, the first film is far superior, with a stronger and more well-constructed narrative.That being said, this is just my personal opinion. The Evil Dead series is a classic in the horror genre. For those who haven't seen it yet, I strongly recommend watching it. Experiencing this series is a must for any horror fan!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

screw everyone who thinks this movie sucks,"This is a great movie! Not as gory as the first, but who cares. This one is actually a horror/comedy, also a sequel/remake. Evil Dead II has so much more in it, that you forget it's really a remake. But in many other ways it's not.Let's get this out of they way. Yes, it is a remake, but hardly so. The film get to business very quickly. The first seven minutes of the film is kind of a retro of the first film. Then when the demons first possess him (but the sun scares it away) is right where is first film left off. Now the second epic really begins. But there are scenes that are back in there.SECRET: In ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", there is a scene where someone is watching The Evil Dead on T.V. In response to this, Freddy's glove can be seen somewhere in the ""fruit celler"".This film is really a comedy. What's more comedic than a man who has a battle with his own hand, or a laughing lamp. This is where the sarcastic side of Ash really kicks off. RENT THIS FILM!! A must-see for fans of horror/comedy like Braindead (also called Dead Alive).Rating: 7 out of 10 ""Groovy..""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even better than the first,"After a slightly confusing recap, Evil Dead II kicks of the carnage pretty much instantaneously and simply doesn't let up until it's final few moments. Delivering a superior sequel that's faster, funnier with even more gore and cements Bruce Campbell's Ash as a bonafide horror icon.Bruce Campbell endures another onslaught of various bodily fluids being thrown at him in hilarious fashion but this time around really shows that he's also a great physical performer with a standout sequence where he fights his own hand and then transitions into a hardened action star for the ages by the end (his delivey of 'groovy' is perfection).Sam Raimi's direction is even more skillfully chaotic than before, the camera has never been more alive and the set pieces are more inventive, incorporating a variety of tricks and effects. The budget has also clearly gone up but in a way that thankfully doesn't sacrifice the cheap charm of the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Evil Dead II is a great horror film with dark humor elements, more euphoric and has a chaotic energy that makes the movie just so much fun to watch","Evil Dead 2 is a rare case in cinema. As Bill Warren points out in the book Evil Dead - The Archives, the production is a sequel that doesn't exactly continue the historical precedent, like a kind of ""A Thousand and One Nights"" horror version. Six years after the success of Death of the Demon, Sam Raimi and his team returned for a second film, this time bolstered by the production company of Dino De Laurentis, making the financial problems of the first part a distant memory. The production came at a defining moment in the history of the horror genre.Slasher movies were in decay. Nightmare Hour, Halloween and Friday the 13th were the main franchises at the time, but they were already showing signs of fatigue. Killer Toy, the remake of The Killing Bubble and this sequel to Death of the Devil, are some of the facts that pointed to a new direction for horror movies.In the film, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda go to the cabin hidden in a dark woods. When they reach the place, they discover the Book of the Dead, awaken evil forces from the forest and a bloodbath, viscera and severed limbs mark yet another immersion of the viewer in the macabre-comical universe of Sam Raimi. This time, a group of people, including an archaeologist and his ""almost"" protagonist daughter, appear to increase the count of bodies transformed into demonic beings.The character of Evil Dead 2 is already different in the way of filming, since the photography, costumes and ambiance seem much cleaner than the rusticity of the original film, which makes one wonder what the real intention of its director would be. There are many factual coincidences between the story of this and the other film, starting with the role of Ash (Bruce Campbell), the trip he takes with his beloved Linda (this time played by Denise Bixler), to the trip to the same cabin in the other chapter, now called Knowby. There is no mention of the previous misadventure, but it is not exactly clear whether the facts occurred or not, since Ashley's first contact with the evil creatures takes place in a scene that seems to mix reality with fantasy.For die-hard fans of the first movie, this sequel comes as a shock. The direction taken by the director is different: there is the graphic violence of the predecessor, but the bet on the assumptions of humor gains greater prominence. The fabulous camera that zigzags the woods, through subjective framing, one of the best technical details of the first one, is back in this one, allied to the excellent sound work and the great lighting support, more sophisticated features due to a more structured budget. There is also a care in explaining what was previously a mystery. The recording that accompanied the book now has a narrator named Raymond Knowby (John Peaks), who would have found the Morturum Demonton in an ancient ruin, called the Castle of Candar. The plot bifurcates, between the moments of the origin of this artifact and those of the couple's interaction in the cabin. Everything that involves Linda's reappearance after being decapitated takes an openly trashy and playful approach, this being the biggest change in posture in Raimi's approach. This whole idea serves very well the purpose of showing the mental confusion that the hero goes through, in a moment of extreme existential crisis.Ashley's intentions are divided through hilarious scenes, in which he begins to struggle with himself, trying to resist the domination that was imposed on the other characters and that finally came to him. The rotten hand that inflicts him pain and agony awakens all of Campbell's genius canastry, since his character must demonstrate a clear spiritual duplicity. Ash's bloodshed horror show is interrupted by the arrival of Annie (Sarah Berry) the heiress of the house and the doctor's daughter Jake (Dan Hicks), Bobby Joe (Kassie Wesley) and Ed (Richard Domeier), who would go to meet the deceased and heartless archaeologist. The classic events start to repeat themselves, including the scene of sexual violence. The main character is taken by the thing, which proves that even he is not immune to the opponent's powers, a feeling maximized by the entrance and exit of the trances he has.Many consider Evil Dead II as a remake since much of what was present in the first movie is here, only this time Sam Raimi has a considerably bigger budget, so he redoes the first Evil Dead, but this time extrapolating what was done before and with a different execution, one more focused on the comic part. Here Raimi brings together two radicals, the horror and comedy genres, not that this is anything new or innovative, but he makes moments that at first seem like they're more on the horror spectrum, which should scare you, and makes them funny because of the execution, whether it's the visual gags, influenced by The Three Stoges' humor, or how absurd and exaggerated the scenes are, mainly because of the violence and the gore. Raimi also constantly changes the tone during the film, and that's without breaking the moment or making one scene seem out of place from the rest of the film, and all these changes fit with the situations they're placed in, which makes this film so fun. To watch since it always surprises you and does it satisfactorily. It's practically a roller coaster, but Raimi also knows when to stop and let the viewer breathe, not letting the movie get tiring.All the seriousness that inhabited the first moments of the film is put aside after an hour, during the preparation to face the incorporated beasts. As in Evil Dead, this number two also serves as an inspiration for many other products of the horror subgenre, which mimic both the use of animatronic creatures and the indiscriminate use of improvised weapons as a bodily supplement, with electric saws giving way to effective limbs. Sam Raimi flirts more with fantastic style this time around. He brought some visual elements that remind us of gothic and literary and cinematographic references.The second film in Sam Raimi's trilogy is full of funny scenes like the dance of the decapitated and possessed corpse of Linda, Ash's girlfriend, in a sequence filmed in traditional stop motion (a technique developed with extreme skill by Ray Harryhausen in dozens of films ago). More than 50 years ago). Another moment of refined dark humor is when Ash's right hand is possessed by a demon, forcing him to cut it off. He tries to kill his own hand that makes obscene gestures and makes weird noises. In addition to the priceless sequence where a moose head hanging on the wall as hunting trophy and various other inanimate objects from the cabin start to give huge and annoying provocative laughs against Ash, who was immersed in a true universe of madness. In fact, the hero was all the time being tormented by terrible hallucinations and manipulations of his mind by demons, constantly confusing reality and fantasy.As a curiosity, in an exercise in deep good humor, Raimi showed the cover of a book in the form of an anthology by several authors, entitled A Farewell to Arms, in a reference to the new condition of Ash's possessed hand, decapitated from his original arm because ""arms"" also means ""arms"".Another curious and different fact was the use of green blood in the mutilation sequence of the demon that had possessed Ed's body. There are also several prominent scenes, such as Ash's violent blows with a chainsaw against Linda's severed head; or the various bloodbaths, in real floods to wet even the spectators; or the scene where Bobby Joe swallows a hideous eye of the possessed Henrietta, nerves and all, or the fierce attack of the forest's possessed trees against the cabin walls.The conduct of the film is interesting, as it manages to bring together all the mess that is a mixture of elements in the final moments, bringing together the post-apocalyptic Mad Max style with time travel to the medieval era, challenging the narrative limits that a horror film can be to allow. A Hallucinating Night 2 loses a bit in quality to its original, and is clearly a mimicry of ideas inspired by the first volume, but it's still expensive thanks to the total delivery of Campbell, who wins over audiences even in his dramaturgical limitations, making it his own charisma the alloy that holds together all the dissonant elements of the confused and playful argument.Still, Evil Dead II is a great horror film with dark humor elements, backed up by a significant budget and more developed special effects than its predecessor (not that it means much, as stop motion effects today sound totally outdated, which curiously increases even more the comic sensation we should feel when watching the scenes). This sequel to the 1981 classic is euphoric and has a chaotic energy that makes the movie just so much fun to watch. Raimi's love of the B movies is what makes this movie so unique. In the end, Evil Dead II is Raimi's interpretation of the appeal of the B movies and his celebration of them, and by satirizing them, Raimi makes a memorable movie. Throughout its 85 minutes, there are a series of absurd situations, but what can you expect from a work that is inserted in so many categories, including horror and the fantastic? Giant monsters, menacing trees, very caricatured demons and many horror scenes mixed with hilarious moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slap Stick Slasher Flick,"The plot of this movie is more of an evolution than a sequel to the original. It is a re-telling. The budget is higher, for certain. The camera work, writing, directing, and acting are all a big step up. The plot is more involved and goes somewhere.For years I thought the original was better. It was definitely scarier, and well, more original. But this sequel has a sense of humor. The first movie was only unintentionally funny.

The perfect sequel!,"Evil Dead II (1987) follows Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda as they go to a cabin in the woods where an evil force unleashes and takes over Linda's body. This film really is the perfect sequel. I love this film just a little more than I love the first one! It was so much fun and so rewatchable, I can't get enough of it!Visually, this film is completely groundbreaking. There were some amazing POV shots, and the transitions between shots were really good! I loved the shaky cam once again and there were some cool focus shifts. The film used brilliant stop motion, it created some very creepy visuals that make this film instantly recognisable. Also, the colour palettes were nice and all the shots were well lit. The film was gruesome whilst being very tasteful with what it shows.The sound design in the film was eerie, using a lot of background noise to create tension effectively. The score itself was super over-the-top which I found worked so well with the tone of the movie! It was so instantly recognisable!This film introduces some cool new characters well, and of course Bruce Campbell is still incredibly charismatic as Ash Williams. I remember completely falling in love with Ash when I first watched this, and nothing has changed since! The acting is over-exaggerating and this is what gives the Evil Dead films their charm! The dialogue was equally as fun too.This film was a lot goofier than the first one, but I absolutely love this, it's genuinely so much fun to watch! I was immediately hooked, and the pacing is very fast and stays consistent to make the movie a very fun watch. The tension is high and the ending is completely crazy which sets the next film up well!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hey! Whatta Ya Say We Have some Champagne, Hey Baby?!""","In EVIL DEAD 2, Director Sam Raimi re-imagines, re-vamps, re-invigorates, and resets his original film. In addition, he parodies it, casting Bruce Campbell as the sort-of-hero-containing-all-Three-Stooges-in-one-body, Ash! The other characters are mere cogs in this maniacal machine. Within seconds, it's clear that none of what is transpiring is in the least bit serious, and that Raimi and Campbell are having a blast!Looking back, this movie was unlike anything else of its era. Almost every scene is a classic. The frantic, roving, chasing camera is a life force all its own! The story, about the legendary Book Of The Dead, is just an excuse for the Director to run amok, creating one of the most memorably loony experiences ever snared on film! Your ribs will ache, even while you're bombarded by oceans of blood, pus, and goo!For his part, Bruce should have won an honorary Oscar Meyer Wiener for his unnatural, hyper-animated performance. Oh yes! You WILL believe that his right hand is a separate character, and you'll never read A FAREWELL TO ARMS in quite the same light, again! Annnd, indeed, you WILL believe that eyeballs can fly!

More coherant than the original,"This film seems to replace 'Evil Dead', and recreates the story again. However it is an improvement in many regards.some really creepy horror stuff here, less bloody and messy than the last film which is a good thing. This movie is also a bit more capable in the visual department and overall was an OK watch for something regarded as having a cult following.I don't know, it is an average affair altogether, it shows some more interesting details and does set up the 'Army of Darkness' film quite well.7/10, In my opinion skip 'Evil Dead' and watch this movie followed by 'Army of Darkness' for a crazy comedy horror adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best!,"A very fantistic horror experience!  This movie is a true classic, its a pleasure to watch this ""horror"" film over and over with friends.  Although the scary scenes in the first film are no where to be seen in this partial remake, they are happily replaced by comedy and an almost spoof like feeling.  This movie is one big bloody cartoon.  The character of Ash played by Bruce Campbell is no longer the squemish wimp of the first film, he is transformed into the one-liner spitting, chainsaw weilding action/horror icon of the next film; Army of Darkness.  And the gore from the first film is still here, only this time in higher quanities and different colors. For those who have not seen the first film but have seen the more mainstream Army of Darkness, check this film out cause you are in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ridiculous, but fun","Ridiculously campy, stupid, yet amusing, Evil Dead II is an improvement over the original, even if it's hard to take it seriously. The film features, yet again, a stellar performance from Bruce Campbell, although this time it's simply because of how campy he is in it. Without him, the film would be sure to fail, and Campbell totally encaptures the insanity that is this films script. In short, the film doesn't make a lot of sense. One of my biggest gripes with it, is the fact that it has almost no continuation at all from the original, as if the first film never even happened. Instead we are greeted to a few minutes of what is semi-like what happened in the original flick, and then absolute madness and mayhem. Never fret though, because as dull as the original may have been throughout its dragged out corpse of a runtime, Evil Dead II is able to capture that same runtime with much more entertaining results. The results are bonkers, but its makes for a funny and by far amusing time, even if it does provide for some cringe-like moments. In the end, Evil Dead II is by far not perfect, but an enjoyable horror-comedy romp that is far more entertaining, and thus more impressive than its predecessor.

First of all, the humour. It's excellent!! Moviegoers who love to see those 'Scary Movie' flicks, should see this film, and see how a film can take laugh of some horror cliches.

Swallow This!,"I realize that a lot of people will disagree with me on this but I thought Evil Dead 2 was the weakest of the trilogy.

While many of the gore scenes in Evil Dead 1 were literally so disgusting that one felt inclined to turn away; the gore scenes in the sequel were just goofy.

Insanely entertaining,"This is one of the greatest horror films ever made. It is a horror film and it is a tongue-in-cheek comedy. Everything about this is pretty much spot on. There is plenty of violence, there is much comedy, it is very fast paced yet it still remains jumpy and edgy. It really has to be seen for anyone who even has a passing interest in horror. This is the pinnacle of the series, it takes everything that was setup in the first film and builds upon it. The third film has a more action orientated and the 'remake' more of a horror leaning, the series is probably the most similar of the following franchise entries. This is not a remake of the first but the first 6 minutes is a recap. The rest is a rollercoaster of horrific images and stunning effects considering the budget with insanely over-the-top acting and enough dark humour to keep anyone happy.

Evil Dead 2: Exercise in non-stop over-the-top jumbles!,"I found Evil Dead 2 to be quite different than the original. While it does have the same basic plot, Evil Dead 2 goes for more over-the-top comedy and silliness. That is what makes it so good. I have to be honest, the beginning had me confused, but as the film goes along, I grew with it. Some of the scenes, like the hand scene, and the talking lamps and animals were hilarious. But I did not find it quite as amazing as the first. I could not connect with the other characters as much, and I did find it got repetitive in the end. However, it is a classic and easily one of the ten best horror films ever. Bruce Campbell was also stronger in this film and more secure",,Anonymous,Horror

Quick Reviews!!,"A favourite of horror and gore fans everywhere, and virtually a remake of the first film as Ash again finds himself trapped in a house in a solitary forest which becomes overrun with zombies and deadites. That Necromonicon is at it again! Campbell again steals the show, one of the most under-used and underrated actors around. Raimi keeps the film moving at a quick pace, and some of the camera work, including the chase shots through the house as doors explode off hinges, lots of strange POV shots etc etc show his flare as a director if not as a storyteller. But the main selling point is the gore, of which there is lots, and the set-pieces involving a flying eye and a possessed hand. Again the effects are good by today's standards-with today's technology, stop motion could be very effective. 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worthwhile Sequel,"While this film overall isn't as entertaining as the original, it's still a worthy sequel that get's it right:keeping enough and changing enough.After an inaccurate recap(for many reasons out of their control)the film begsn right where the original leaft off with Ash exiting the cabin at sun rise. However, the rising of the sun means little as Ash is trapped in the woods still. Add onto that a group of people come to the cabin to check things out, getting caught in the middle.The biggest problem with this film is not the more comedic tone. The biggest problem is all these new characters. They are the most annoying bunch of twits to ever enter a horror movie. The film would've been miles better if Ash was leaft alone to deal with these demons. They really bring the film down. The cast from the original weren't exactly 3 dimensional but they were likable at least.As for the tone of the film, I'm sure even those who haven't seen it have heared that it's a much different breed. While the film took on an overall dead serious tone with some cheese, this one is all about cheese and guts. It surprisingly works. There are some very hilarious moments in this film and watching Ash transform into his action hero esquire self that would take over ""Army of Darkness"" The effects are more polished then the original and the acting from Campell improved, although I can't say the same for the other actors in this bunch. The make up is equally as good as the original, and to top that all off is a uinque, darkly comical ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Firm favourite,"A long and firm favourite film of mine ever since a life-changing viewing at a tender age, EVIL DEAD II remains for me the pinnacle of the comedy/horror hybrid genre. Packed with inventiveness, wit, and energy in every single frame of every single scene, this is movie-making par excellence. The story begins by recapping the original movie (reshot, eliminating all characters aside from Ash and his girlfriend) and then moves into even more thrilling territory as a new story unfolds. Full advantage is taken of the increased budget, so that we get better sets, better costumes, better make-up, and most of all better special effects. The latter really make a difference (on what is still a relatively low budget movie), packing in tons of weird and wonderful demons and monsters including plenty of imaginative stop motion effects which are worked well into the blend.If THE EVIL DEAD was the film that first introduced the skills of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell, then EVIL DEAD II is the film to show that the original 1982 hit wasn't just a one-off wonder and that instead both star and director had staying power which would outlive the series. Raimi does some fantastic things with cameras and builds on his efforts in the first film, sometimes paying homage to his original shots and often taking the film in directions he was unable to explore the first time around. Fans may wish to note that the emphasis is on comedy over horror this time around and a perfect balance is struck between the two genres – plenty of laugh out loud moments interspersed with genuine terror and creepiness makes for good times a plenty.The film belongs to the athletic Campbell as Ash and he really carries it along on his shoulders alone. Almost half an hour of the movie consists of Bruce acting on his own and when the other characters do eventually arrive, it is a testament to his acting skills that you wish that he'd instead been left on his own for the entire movie. The film is packed with action and incident and tons of imagination. One great, never-before seen moment follows another, highlights including the chainsaw fight in the work shed, the hand possession (still the best ever put on screen thanks to Bruce's dynamic performance) and the entire finale sequence which is simply blissful.The script is witty and concise without putting unnecessary dialogue into the mouths of the characters and things are rounded off by another fantastic Joe De Luca score which really emphasises a number of key moments. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent with especially notable turns from Sarah Berry as the tough heroine, Danny Hicks as a truly loathsome slob, and an unrecognisable Ted Raimi buried inside a rubber suit as possessed hag Henrietta. Blood flows, limbs and heads are lopped off at regular intervals, yet the film remains light-hearted and fun all through this thanks to the party atmosphere prevalent through. Truly a classic landmark piece of film-making, which sadly has not been bettered since. I think it's fair to say that there's no film quite like this to be seen anywhere else, and it remains even now one of my all time favourites that I can watch and enjoy over and over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Back to the cabin in the woods...,"Director Sam Raimi's over-the-top recap of his early low-budget horror flick ""The Evil Dead"" from 1981 is an improvement over its grainy, ghastly predecessor, a demon barf-fest which was made for about $400,000 and sparked a cult-following on home video with slacker teenagers. Raimi's budget on this one was a little over $3,000,000 and it shows. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash, a university student taking his girlfriend to a cabin in the Tennessee mountains while the owners, a professor and his wife, are away. Things are just starting to get cozy when Ash comes across an ancient book in the professor's study, the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis--or, the Book of the Dead--along with the professor's taped thesis on the archaeological find in which he unwisely recites the incantation to resurrect a demonic spirit (it works). Raimi shows off a wickedly imaginative sense of gruesome glee (not apparent in the first film), as well as a film scholar's eye for classic movie references, visual jokes and an audacious talent for breathlessly-paced mayhem. Buckets of red, green and black guck get sprayed all over the screen, with prime recipient Campbell taking the brunt of it (he's a good sport rather than an actor). While Raimi has since proved in his mainstream films that he is more than adept at a solid narrative flow as well as a kinetic visual style and a keen sense of editing that sets the pace for his pictures, these techniques remain out of reach for him here (as well as a talent for handling actors). All types of cinematic tricks are brought out of the toy-box (everything that three million dollars could buy in 1987), but the picture is merely made up of episodes. It's a showoff piece for the filmmaker; he's in the process of developing his craft--and having a grand old time--but the set-ups have no follow-through, and the whole doesn't equal the parts.

Worth Viewing For Bruce Campbell's Manic Act Alone,"The second instalment in the Evil Dead saga is more a rehash than a proper successor and also puts more emphasis on the absurd comedy than the horror aspect. A labour of love that's made with passion and told with unabashed verve, Evil Dead II delivers the campy delights, gleeful fun & splatter horror as expected but it is also lacking the tension & atmosphere of the previous film.Co-written & directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man & Drag Me to Hell), the story follows an almost similar path as its predecessor and serves as both a remake & a sequel with the comedy aspect dialled up to the max. Raimi's direction exhibits a dynamic energy, and it is evident in the wicked execution of the elements. The tone is far too lighthearted, full camp & aiming for ridiculousness of the highest order.The special effects team create magic with the limited resources, relying on make-up wizardry & stop-motion animation to deliver the set pieces while Bruce Campbell's maniacal performance is key to establishing & selling the tone the story is aiming for. But the comedic bits are overdone to the point of parody and while this silly ride is fun to watch, I found the excessive dilution of horror to be a drawback and not a feature.Overall, Evil Dead II is a wild, deranged & ludicrous offering that brims with manic energy, over-the-top idiosyncrasy & special effects creativity and even though I can see why it has garnered such an incredibly devoted following over the years, the film as a whole doesn't really appeal to my taste. Worth viewing for Campbell's downright hysterical act alone, this comedy of terrors is a roller-coaster ride that fans of the original will embrace outright.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Evil Dead, too!","I have no interest in involving myself in the pointless debate about whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake. It really doesn't matter, there's an argument for both sides and so the endless debates will, of course, go nowhere. What is not up for debate is that the movie begins with a recap of what happened in the first film, and then there is another group that heads out to the woods to spend a weekend in the creepy cabin in the woods. They discover a recording of a man studying the Necronomicon, The Book of the Dead (also found in the cabin), which included incantations that bring forth all manner of bad things.Soon the movie becomes strikingly similar to the original, resulting I suppose in the controversy about whether it's a remake or a sequel. Personally, it feels like a rethinking of the first movie, where certain ideas and effects are fleshed out in ways that the financial constraints of the original film wouldn't allow, as well as a beefing up of the significant comic relief. Indeed, for all it's blood and gore and self-mutilations and animated severed limbs, this is one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen.One thing that is shown in part II is a visual presentation of the evil force in the woods, which is sadly a disappointing attempt to add more complex special effects into the movie, but the majority of the film will be remembered as Ash's truly classic battle with the evil force in the cabin, which ultimately starts to take over his own body, but he is able to stop it by cutting off his own possessed hand. Love it or hate it, this stuff has never been done in a horror movie before, and that's not the only genuinely original thing. Even furniture becomes possessed and laughs hysterically at Ash, and we laugh along with them. This is about as fun as gore films can get!I think that one of the best things about the original film was its meager budget, but the best thing about the trilogy as a whole is that it is a horror film that is intended almost exclusively for horror fans. Bring a date to watch this movie and I'm willing to bet that you will find yourself lonely in a hurry. Evil Dead II is packed with horror thoughts and ideas that seem to have come out of nowhere, they are so over the top and unique. Ash is attacked by a severed head, a headless body, and his own severed hand in the movie, along with countless other beasties, and the effect, due in no small part to his hilarious reactions, is horror entertainment of the highest order.Of course, the budget is bigger now, but Raimi was able to take more money and still retain the same feel of the original film, except that he was able to give us more detail and use more effects this time around, but definitely without selling out. Whether he did this later in his career is up for debate, but in the first sequel in the Evil Dead trilogy, it almost seems like he took more money from bankrollers who expected a more accessible horror film and then tricked them, giving us a movie that is still intended for the original fans.Raimi soon moved away from the gritty horror genre with more accessible films, like The Quick and the Dead and the astonishingly brilliant A Simple Plan, before moving into mainstream Hollywood with the Spiderman movies, but it is the simplicity of the Evil Dead films that his fans will always remember with the most fondness. It is telling that the Spiderman juggernaut is known, among fans, and being directed by the guy who made the Evil Dead films, and not the other way around. Peter Jackson, on the other hand, will always be associated with the Lord of the Rings films, while his own early horror films are all but forgotten. For horror fans, there are not many truer films than the Evil Dead series",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror and Comedy perfectly blended together!,"Just in time for Halloween, a horror comedy that hits all the right notes. While many were expecting a remake, they got more, a lot more! While there are some frights and some blood splatters, there's plenty of cartoonish comedy that makes a real good time, yet gives enough blood for the gore fan as well (though thankfully it's not as graphic as the first that the squeamish can enjoy this in safety as well). The zany antics inside the haunted house are unpredictable and when they happen, they tickle the funnybone well! There's a good amount of bestiary, the best creature comes in the climax so creative and frightening you'll have to see it to believe it, rendered in nice stop-motion animation, you won't mind if it's movements are a little jerky. Finally there's Ash himself, he goes from being a complete goofball to a macho badboy over time, in fact his transformation is too good to reveal here.

While some may say it's more of a remake then a sequel, i would have to say that i love the way it works as a semi-remake/sequel together in one film. The film is over-the-top gory and has many good laughs to make it a horror comedy classic for the 80's! the make-up effects by KNB are excellent along with the nifty low budget special effects and has more of the same charm that made the original so dang popular.While the first one is an excellent and gory as hell scare-feast, this sequel stands as a comical and bloody yet slimy feast for the eyes, ears and nerves alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Would Have Worked Better Without Humor,"Evil Dead 2 wasn't a bad film. I just think it would have worked better without the humor.The first Evil Dead movie was a truly frightening film. There was no humor in sight. It was a film that made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.Evil Dead 2 was a comedy. In my opinion comedy and horror don't mix that well. How can you expect to be scared by a film when you know that a laugh is just around the corner? The Evil Dead didn't take itself too seriously and it just got crazier as it went on. The final scene was just a bit too crazy for me.Evil Dead 2 can probably be enjoyed by comedy fans or those who have not watched the original. However, fans of the original who are expecting to be scared probably will be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Horror
Too similar to the first one.,"Just for the record, this is not a remake, but a sequel. Sam Raimi could not get the rights to re-use scenes from Evil Dead so he re-shot some of them to explain what is going on and how Ash and Linda got to the cabin. But there still is a major sense of deja vu.Ash barricades himself into the cabin after the events in the first film and finds himself going crazy. The furniture starts laughing at him, his reflection talks to him and an evil force is determined to take him over. It manages to possess his hand and so he cuts it off. It starts scuttling around the floor on its own and randomly attacking him. Strangers show up in the hope of finding the Professor, who was staying there, and lock Ash in the cellar. They assume he is responsible for the bloody carnage.People die, people turn into monsters - same old same-old. It's hard to imagine why this is such a cult favorite when it is obviously a badly made movie. Or perhaps Raimi just works the best he can with a low budget (although many times higher than the original) and the shoddy production values are a result of that.He goes over the same ground he did before, except with more resources for gore and mayhem. Very little of this makes sense and none of it is scary. There are a couple of good moments, like when Ash's hand beats him up and when he is chased through the house by the unseen evil force. Campbell is a terrific physical actor and he is a delight to watch, but I doubt whether he understood what on earth he was doing, or why.Having a low budget does not excuse a bad storyline and although this looks more professional than Evil Dead, it still looks like a student film. The best part is the cliff-hanger ending that leads to Army Of Darkness.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

brilliant film-making,"Here is one of the great bad movies! A legendary artwork from the genius of Sam Raimi and beloved of myself. Terrific sight gags, a lean and mean Bruce Campbell as Ash, and soul swallowing demons! Ash and his woman Linda want some time alone so they shack up in a deserted cabin. Unfortunately it was being used by professor Knowby while he translated ""The Book of the Dead"" and when Ash plays the recording evil spirits are summoned. Having to chop up your girlfriend makes you a little loco and when demonic forces are screwing with you it just gets worse. About half the film chronicles Ash's struggle against insanity and the unholy terrors. When everyone else arrives they misunderstand the situation of course, heck - there's some maniac with a bloody chainsaw and shotgun in the Knowby's cabin. They learn soon enough Ash isn't perfectly sane but right on track with his assessment of the situation. Unfortunately the newcomers aren't the hardy breed though, and they fall one by one. In the end Annie is able to recite the passages to dispel the evil with her dying breaths but Ash is dragged through the time warp and into the medieval past. I really love this movie, the Hand is a riot! More movies should use the idea of the main character's hand becoming possessed and menacing them. Like... ...""Dirty Dancing!"" Now what if Swayze's hand had become possessed and he was trying to deal with that while doing the Tango or something. Hey, what about ""Forest Gump?"" Hehehehe! (Say this in a Gump voice.) And mah hand was acting all funny like, it even tried to stab me. Momma never said nothing bout no hand trying to stab me so that jus didn't seem right.

A creative installment of the classic horror series,"When the first EVIL DEAD came out in 1982 or whatever 80 something it was gore after gore after gore in such a small budget and it became known as one of the most shocking films. Then when EVIL DEAD 2 came out director Sam Rami give it a new turn on the first one. And also adding a very good blend of slapstick humor into it.Ash (Our well known hero) is back on the road to the cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda (The one with the missing head) this time and all too soon they came upon the book of the dead and release the demons upon the woods and same as the first one Linda gets killed in the same style and new characters and scenes came along, Annie along side with her boyfriend Ed (Soon to be Evil Ed) comes to the cabin to put the missing pages together and the redneck Jake and his girlfriend comes for the ride. The new moments added Ash's hand coming to life running around a dead old women coming out of the basement and a new spin on the attack of the forest (they do much more than raping)and added crazy comical moments into it which works very well.EVIL DEAD 2 is one of those well creative turns in low budget film-making, sequel to EVIL DEAD and prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ultimate Cult Classic!,"For whatever reason, I've been on a horror kick for the past few months, which is odd because it's a genre for which I've never had much love. I've seen some good and some bad but it all made me want to go back to one of my favorites. A movie I had seen in over a decade: EVIL DEAD II. There is so much awesome in this movie and I'm pretty sure anyone reading my comments on here has already seen this movie so I'll probably just use this space to share my love for it. In an age where the new horror movies flooding theaters on a yearly basis are near carbon copies of each other, following the same formulas and hitting the same notes, just remember we'll always have Sam Raimi's cult classic to fall back on. The argument could be made that EVIL DEAD II is more comedy than horror, but any movie that features supernatural tree rape and loads of chainsaw violence are going to have a foot in the genre. The movie is essentially the same premise as the original: Ash Williams brings his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods for some romance but finds a tape recorder containing readings from the Necronomiconthe Book of the Dead. As the words are spoken aloud, an ancient evil awakens and terrorizes Ash, driving him to the point of insanity. But hope is not lost as he is soon joined by a handful of visitors, one of which might be able to decipher the texts and find a means of sending the evil back when to the depths of Hell.Where do I begin? I love pretty much everything about this movie. It is the ultimate low budget movie that proudly displays the love of the craft from everyone involved. The cast and crew endured less than favorable shooting conditions and minimal resources but their desire to create a memorable piece of horror/comedy fun drove them through it all to create the epic-ness that is EVIL DEAD II. Sam Raimi and crew have an obvious goal of pushing the envelope of taste to the very edge without going over to the point that their movie never would've seen the light of day. When you think about it, the violence in EVIL DEAD II is pretty brutal. Decapitations, stabbings, dismemberment, blood and ooze everywherebut it's all done with this screwball tone that makes it less cringe-inducing and more laughable. When a character is dragged to their death through a basement trap door, it's accompanied by gallons and gallons and gallons (and gallons) of blood pumped from below in tidal wave proportions. Ash cutting off his demon-possessed hand is preceded by a Three Stooges-inspired fight between Bruce Campbell and himself in the kitchen. While the movie is still totally inappropriate for kids for the content, there isn't a whole lot you could consider ""scary"" about this horror classic. Even if you the humor injected through the film's total absurdity isn't enough to keep you laughing instead of screaming, the film's minuscule budget ensures that nothing here will be sending you screaming from the room.I love, love, love the practical effects of this film. Raimi shoots for the moon with only enough budget to cross the county line, but he uses every conceivable trick to craft his film. Miniatures, matte paintings, and puppetry give this movie a perfect retro vibe. Creature effects are done with rubber suits and make-up, and camera tricks are used to perfect cheesy effect. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell, the man who became legend thanks to his role as Ash Williams, hero of the EVIL DEAD series. I honestly don't believe anyone but Campbell could've pulled off a character like Ash. Equal parts stone-cold hero and bumbling moron, Ash wages a one-man war against the Evil Dead. When the series was rebooted with EVIL DEAD in 2013, I enjoyed the movie but the one thing it could never recreate would be this character (and I'm glad they didn't try). Campbell gets it. He and Raimi knew just what this character needed to be this time around and they absolutely nailed it.EVIL DEAD II is a movie that needs to be passed down through the generations, whether it be by friend of family. I was introduced to the series by a friend when I was in high school; he had the movies on VHS and we binged on them in a single night to introduce them to me. When my daughter gets old enough, you can be sure I'll be sharing this movie with her. EVIL DEAD II is a classic. It's rare that director and his crew do so much with so little, especially in an age when most movies do the exact opposite. Keep the love for this movie alive and share it with future generations of fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
comedy horror genius,"This is one of those rare events.... a sequel better than the original. Raimi, Tappart and Campbell deliver in spades what the original lacked.

Short review,"I tried so hard to love this and the first evil dead but I can't. I liked the first one more as I thought the characters were more entertaining, in the evil dead 2 two of them are almost unwatchable for me. Jake and Bobby Joe aren't Tuco levels of annoying but it's close.The makeup and effects have improved since the first movie but I like the older effects more. There was a certain charm to the original evil dead. The small budget and the inevitable problems that come with that like, poor audio and bad ADR, I find things like this charming when they can't really be improved. The evil dead 2 was made for 3.5 million and I think the audio and ADR has gotten worse, the music has gotten worse and the actors are worse. Yes there are obviously technical improvements, but with such a huge increase in budget everything should all be improved.I didn't like the even more comedic tone than the first one, some jokes were good but most didn't land for me. Like I said Bobby Joe and Jake are really annoying and not funny at all, they ruined a lot of scenes for me. I stuff with Ash chasing his hand around was pretty good and him later getting a chainsaw arm is funny and very badass.The ending was pretty good and the foreshadowing of it was really great. I'm assuming it sets up army of darkness very well. I hope it does as it would be a great setup for a sequel and I really want to love an evil dead movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie,"No quite as good as the original, but it is an entirely different genre. As some people hate this movie, and some love it, I will give a basic summary and small thoughts.Ash (Whose last name is never mentioned throughout the series) and his girlfriend go to a cabin in the tennessee back-woods (Where in the original also contained two friends and a sister, cut due to no need) where they unknowingly resurrect the dead. Ash is left alone, and round 2 begins. As the night dwells on, he completely dismembers his girlfriend, lops off his possessed right hand, and continues to fight along side the cabin owner's daughter and a redneck couple. The owner's daughter, Annie, confronts her possessed dead mother, and the final fight between good and evil begins. Has the good won, or is an earlier event that Ash experienced the precursor of something bigger? I've already told you too much.This is not a remake unless you watch the first five minutes period. The rest goes in a totally different direction.And from now on, anyone who starts a subject: This Movie Sucks! will be removed from the boards.

The second flick in this series a gory good time.,"I did not remember this movie being as funny the first time I saw it, but then I was just a kid. Now years later with my sense of humor effectively warped I had quite a few chuckles. This is of course a sequel to ""The Evil Dead"", but then it is not quite a direct sequel. The first part of the film sort of recaps the first, but then it doesn't. You will notice only Ash and his girlfriend are shown at the cabin. The cabin is significantly better looking on the inside and there are various other differences as well. Still, this does not detract from this film as I like this one better than the first. Campbell as Ash is great, the first part of the film is like a one man show of someone doing a self torture stand-up. You get to watch a man have his hand possessed and proceed to beat the crap out of himself. And the scenes of Ash laughing along with the rest of the cabin is like a demented episode of Pee-Wee's playhouse. Soon though others arrive, of course they are just fodder for the evil dead to possess and kill. The effects are good for the most part, and where they are not so good it is usually done in humorous manner. The chainsaw arm is cool, and it is a nice ending as well considering the third part. I kind of wish Sam Rami and Bruce would make more horror movies as they are very good at it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Ultimate in Comedic Terror,"Although Dead By Dawn is an amusing and often entertaining sequel to the classic 1992 horror film The Evil Dead, DBD pales into comparison when claiming it is ""too terrifying"" as one promotional poster did.There are quite a few problems I have with this film. One is that it is referred to as a ""sequel"", which if you watch this film straight after you have watched ED, you will notice some major continuity errors, such as: the disappearance of Scotty, Cheryl & Shelly from the storyline. In fact at the beginning of this film we even see Ash (Campbell) and Linda (doing a terrible job is Blixler, who has replaced the wonderful Betsy Baker) arriving at the Cabin alone, and now the run-down almost empty cabin we saw in the first film is a fully furnished and deluxe cabin, with a fully done out kitchen. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but the fact is if you're going to make a sequel to a film, at least try and make sure everything makes sense.. I mean it really couldn't have been that hard for Raimi to re-watch the first film and get some of the continuity right. Also, another thing is why Ash stopped being a Deadite in sunlight? That didn't make sense at all, since there is no reason why light would affect the force of the ED.The other problem I have with DBD is it's decent into mass commercialism. One of the great things about ED was that it was an independent film, and had such a freaky atmospheric feel to it. DBD has none of that, it's like mass marketed film made for all the eye candy horror-wannabes who wanted to see Ash return to fight the big bad evil. And instead of getting a great sequel to a great horror film, we have gotten a horrored up version of Ash doing an I-Love-Lucy smashing kitchen plates on his head, and going completely crazy.Now that I have said the negative, let me go on to say that as a stand-alone horror film, apart from ED. DBD is actually quite a good film. It mixes comedy, with horror(although once again the Deadites in this film, are more like Hollywood zombies than those seen in ED), and has some quite hilarious scenes such as Ash battling Knoby's now Deadite wife Henrietta (played brilliant by a young Ted Raimi), and the laughing deer & lamp in Knoby's study, which added such weirdness to the film. The ending which falls into the next film in the ED Trilogy, Army of Darkness, is also quite well done.All in all, don't watch DBD straight after ED, in fact look at DBD as a remake, rather than a sequel, because then you will enjoy it much more.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Comedy far ahead of its time...,"Watched this film last year for the first time without the context that the first 10 minutes is a short recap of the first film because Sam Raimi couldn't use any of the previous footage as it belonged to the studio and I think it baffled me a bit too much to fully appreciate the whole film. This time around....to me this is cinema.This feels to me like I'm watching both Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi at the height of their powers.The silly slap stick moments coupled with the excellent camera work and physical comedy you end up with a true horror comedy masterpiece that just feels so ahead of it's time in terms of the kind of movies and horror films that were being made at the time.A script with some of the most iconic one liners and on the nose moments, a stand out being when Ash places a bucket over his possessed hand and then places a stack of books on top, the top book being 'A farewell to arms'. Chefs Kiss. Also when they explain some of the Necronomicon lore at the beginning of the film and the narrator states that the book suddenly disappeared and then the book just spirals off screen. So hilarious.The make up is genuinely amazing and practical effects are so scary, Deadite Ash being a personal favourite.Truly, truly a perfect movie in my eyes.

"""Swallow This""","Evil Dead 2 is the epitome of what a Horror/Comedy should be. It knows exactly what it is, and doesn't take itself to seriously. That being said when it's time to crank the gore/scares up it doesn't hesitate. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash, and puts on an amazing performance carrying this film on his back. He created a character that is still a Horror icon to this day.The plot is simple but effective, just like in the first. The climax is great, and the ending is epic. A lot of people get this film confused as a remake of the first. The reason the recap is different is due to Sam Raimi not having rights to the original.

The best film ever made,"They said Bruce Campbell overacted in this film. This is ridiculous, he was more composed than I'd be if my partner was killed and I was left alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere possessed by demons who are trying to kill me whilst playing around with my nerves and laughing at me. He deserved an Oscar for this film. The faces he makes are the exact faces you would expect to see under such circumstances. He even runs through walls to escape them, he must have put all his energy into the role. He displays mental anguish so well that you feel it with him, it almost made me cry, it's not so much a scream inducing film as a n emotional roller-coaster. Whiile watching it for the first time my face slowly contorted into the very same expression Ash has when he is released from his possessor (the demon) and emerges from the mud. It stayed like that for around two minutes afterwards. The only tacky bit is the opening credits, the rest is pure genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good Film,"Evil Dead 2 (1987)*** (out of 4)Ash (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend out to a cabin in the woods where they read the Book of the Dead, which unleashes evil forces and soon Ash must battle more demons. I'm not a die-hard fan of this series but you always have to give credit where it's due and there's no question that this is one of the hardest working B movies in the history of cinema. I've always looked at this sequel as more of a remake of the first film. Where the first film went for terror this film certainly goes for campy laughs. I must be honest and say that I really don't find this film funny but for some reason it still works for me. I think it works because Raimi and Campbell are so busy at trying new things that you can't help but sit back and be entertained by what's going on. The opening thirty-minutes are very good with the fast paced action and the Three Stooges inspired humor. The special effects are the highlight of the film as they show you what can be done with a very low budget. The chainsaw arm has become part of horror history and rightfully so as it's a great little joke that goes a long way. The gory effects are also highly entertaining no matter if the blood is colored red, green or black. I'm not a big fan of Campbell either but there's no doubt he rules this film with his maniac style performance. The supporting cast are all rather bland but that really doesn't hurt the film too badly. Again, I didn't care for a lot of the humor in the film but this is still one of the most creative films ever made and with that it mind there's no doubt that this is recommended to fans of the genre.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's all about the chainsaw...,"Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell come back to the woods to try and capture what made the prequel so great, and almost succeed. I prefer it's predecessor, but that is not to say this is not a good film. The reason is not because this is an inferior film, they're just very different. The original had vomit-inducing ultra-violence and shriek-inducing scares and thrills with a tad of black comedy thrown in here and there. This is the exact opposite, where the scares and violence are toned down, but the comedy and camp value has been scaled up.For reasons that don't make any sense to me whatsoever, ED2's first ten minutes or so are a recap and mild remake of the first, supposedly due to the fact that Raimi could not get permission to use footage from the original to put in this sequel. I don't know about you, but I don't see how that's necessary. Rarely do sequels include exact footage from the original, even more rarely is it needed. So for what it's worth, I've heard all of the reasons and it just doesn't add up. Fortunately though, this doesn't matter much and does not take away from the film as a whole...it's just not exactly a sequel and not exactly a remake. But it is, exactly, a very entertaining film.Now what I do prefer in this film compared to the original is that the characters act in ways that are slightly more plausible. The first film had me screaming at the screen trying to help out the characters. Don't go outside, look behind you, and for God's sake, get the damn chainsaw and go to town on those nasties! Saw their friggin' heads in half! Here, my voice was saved a bit as Ash must've heard my advice from earlier and decides to bust out the bad boy flesh eating zombie stomper and shred their minion asses into oblivion. Never have chainsaws been so much fun.We are also treated to the same wild and uninhibited camera work from Raimi, something that made the original stand apart from the rest of the genre for that attribute alone. Raimi does not disappoint here. His frenzied technique fits perfectly and he knows it. Watching the Darkness from the woods chase Ash as he tries to escape into and through the house is truly an awesome sight. As for the camp value, unless you're dead, you'll find some humorous elements here amongst the insane absurdity. And I will state, for the record, that I enjoy this film's ending much more than the original's.A delightful addition to the horror/comedy genre, and a different although worthy sequel/remake. If you liked the original, you'll find something interesting herein.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Within the cabin,"While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie ""Within the woods"" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time.We do get a ""previously on Evil Dead"" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is not Evil Dead,"No, I don't get it. We came from one of the best horror movies ever to a vulgar comedy/horror. I can't understand why Sam Raimi would like to destroy the atmosphere of the first movie, but I see that a lot of the people prefer this silly approach, which doesn't make sense to me.If you are a real horror fan, you will stick with the exceptional first movie and forget the two sequels. Then you can return for a great remake in 2013.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best movie...ever,"This is, without question, my favourite movie, and one of the best done films of all time. It strikes a happy medium between ED1 and AoD, and it works amazing. Bruce Campbell is a god, and he shows it in this film. A macho guy who is dumber than a box of nails, who can spew punchlines like no other (well maybe Freddy comes close).Of course, this movie would be nothing without Sam Raimi, one of the best, most underrated directors in the past 20 years. Despite landing the spidey movies, he still deserves more credit for his work. Some of his camera work is revolutionary, and he is great at torturing Bruce, especially in this film.If you haven't seen this film, you must go get it now. I've seen this film a countless number of times, like the other 2 ED films, and this one is by far the best (although they all rock). Groovy!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
this movie was a little too goofy for me,the humor in this movie doesn't work that much for me. it's not nearly as good as the people on here say. it's not as good as the first one. the second depends on humor more than scares like in the first one. but the thing is the humor isn't that funny in evil dead II. in fact it's almost never funny. but there are a few interesting things in evil dead II that make it semi-ok.i give it ** out of ****,,Anonymous,Horror
Actually.....Should be called...Evil Dead: Redone,"It is just the first one redone with better special effects, and few different actors, and does pretty much what the first one did but more gore. Actual F-words added. If you look up information of the movie from the director, he says, it is same movie just redone. He just titled it as a sequel. Also, he said he prefers this one over his first one. He just did not like how the first one turned out. So, he redid the movie. So, this is more a remake, than a sequel. Even if you saw this one and not the first, you would not get much difference except different actors and more gore and swearing. That is, it. I think it is better because of the more gore. I think the story is exactly the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome film,"Although I prefer the hardcore horror of part 1, part 2 offers creativity of a whole new thought. Now with his hand possessed, Ash not only has to fight toothless redneck tow-truck drivers, a preppy scientist, ghosts, and a trashy redneck woman, but he now has to go mano-a-hando with his own hand. Now the hand communicates through sounds and gestures as it tries to draw Ash into its web of evil.As these people start to fool around and be as ignorant as possible, it is once again Ash who has to save the world. Now, with a chainsaw where his hand once was, a shovel, and his trusty boomstick, Ash fights the main cog in the evilness. A large, Freddy Kruger-like beast who makes Ash's hair turn grey (A la Nightmare on Elm Street). As his new girl/friend/love interest reads from the Necronomicon, Ash fights this truly large beast, and deadites. As the final battle ends, Ash gets thrown into oblivion, only to land in medieval times...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A silly splat-stick horror classic-but not the film I wish it was.,"Back in 1987, when I emerged blinking into the daylight having just witnessed the long awaited sequel to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, I was too embarrassed to publicly admit the tinge of disappointment that I was feeling. With fans and critics alike hailing the film a masterpiece, I didn't feel comfortable expressing my less than glowing opinions. Now, 22 years later, having just revisited the film, I feel ready to come clean: I don't LOVE Evil Dead II.There. I've said it. I feel better now.It's not that I hate the film either-on many levels it's very entertaining and Raimi's direction is certainly kinetic, ensuring that boredom is never an option-but it just isn't what I expected or wanted from the sequel to one of the greatest horror films of all time.Gone is the all-out visceral horror of the original; Evil Dead II's violence is less graphic and very cartoonish, with extremely watery blood and one deadite even bleeding green. Instead, Raimi gives us slapstick comedy, Three Stooges style, with star Bruce Campbell performing a series of silly comedic set-pieces that require him to smash plates on his head, perform pratfalls, and pick a fight with his own hand. Very amusing, I'm sure... but scary?? No siree!Raimi starts his film by virtually retelling the entire first movie in the first ten minutes and then proceeds to throw in a few more characters to kill off: Bobbie Joe and Jake, a couple of expendable hicks, heroine Annie Knowby played by Sarah Berry (who has the most irritating scream in the history of horror), and her pal Ed Getley (Richard Domeier). Meanwhile, Ash (Campbell) gets do his physical comedy thing whilst spouting a few quotable bits of dialogue for the fans to repeat ad nauseum.As the film progresses, there are a few effective jump scares as the dead unexpectedly pop into frame, one particular scene in the fruit cellar manages to raise the tension (at least until the monster appears and the comedy starts again), and a memorable finalé leaves the film on a high note, but in my opinion, Evil Dead II sorely needs more horror and less cheese.I give Evil Dead II 7/10, which isn't that bad I suppose, but I wish it was a 10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dead and Loving It!,"Evil Dead 2 is, in so many ways, better than the first Evil Dead. First of all, the decision to turn the franchise into an all-out horror comedy, thank you a million times over. It's insane sense of humor makes this one of the funnest movies you will ever watch. The ridiculousness never relents. The demonic creatures get crazier and crazier with every new one that appears. The blood and guts fly, with every color of the rainbow. The camera zooms at hyper-speed in ways I'll never wrap my mind around. If all of that isn't enough, we are formally introduced to batshit crazy Bruce Campbell. A horror legend... scratch that.. a comedy legend is born. Ash is the coolest horror protagonist ever created.

Who's laughing now?  I am!,"Man, I love ED2.  If you've heard of this and are researching it on IMDB, then odds are you've already seen it, so there's no need to explain what it is about.  It follows the first rule of a horror/comedy which is don't make the monsters funny, make the characters funny.  When the monsters become funny, the horror is lost, and a stupid movie is born.  Funny things can happen TO the monsters, but they themselves cannot be the source of the laughs, and that's the case with ED2!  The deadites are truly menacing and there are some great scares, but Ash the hero is the one who draws the laughs.  Scared out of his mind and a bit on the slow side, Bruce Campbell acts the way a normal person probably would under these circumstances, namely he screams in terror and fights for his very life.  The best horror/comedy ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead 1.5,"Let's be honest: Evil Dead II is basically the more refined version of the first movie by way of plot hole, a rewriting of script, and change-up of an ending. It's not a true-to-form ""remake"" or ""reboot"" or anything like that.
That said, it's still a great movie with cult status. The set pieces are well put together, the effects, and an entertaining script. It also sets up a sequel that had just as much entertainment value.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Middle part of the trilogy, lose some horror, add some humour","The movie starts with a stripped down version of the first Evil Dead. The first movie ended with a thing coming very fast at Bruce Campbell and he screaming. After 5 minutes or so of getting to that part, the evil force or whatever it is carries him a few meters and transforms him into a monster. But then the sun arrives to turn him back.What follows next is basically the first movie, but with a lot more humour and a completely different ending. This movie was actually the last I've seen from the Evil Dead trilogy and it makes the smooth transition from the pure horror flick that was the first movie to the funny third part.I think watching all three movies one after the other gives one insight not only into the makings and evolution of Evil Dead, but also of the entire horror/fantasy/monster genre from 1981 to 1993.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first movie but funny,"Pretty much like the first movie but more faster to get back to the cabin and this one has comedy in it. This one is more professional this time round and it shows through the filmmaking. It's got all the gore still too. Ash in this film is very different as he has more of a charismatic charm to him and is more goofy with comedic moments. We get an insane Ash who is more confident with killing. The movie keeps things the original had like more repeats of possession and then kill them and same again, it had horror elements too when the others showed up and lots of screaming. The film can again be boring in parts leading up to things too. This movie has some iconic lines such as ""Groovy"" too and the fantastic suit up of Ash with his iconic chainsaw as a hand. There is more solid lore behind the book and the evil in this too. It's still got the same issues the previous film had but less of it and by adding comedy and an almost comic book like element to the mix made it more entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't understand the hype.,"When watching this film, I got the serious impression that ""Army of Darkness"" ended up being a kind of sequel or spin-off to this work, considering the themes involved and the persistence of the main actor, Bruce Campbell. Both films have similarities, and it's hard not to think about it.Sam Raimi is one of those directors who have made a name for himself in horror cinema, but I can't help but think that this is one of his poorest works. ""Evil Dead"" is dark, it's bizarre, it's full of gore and scenes that make you want to throw up your popcorn, but it's not the kind of film I would watch again. With a miserably low budget and a lot of creativity, the director manages to disgust us more than to scare us, and there is little in this film that can really instill fear or dramatic tension. In fact, there are scenes that dangerously border on comedy.Bruce Campbell does what he can, and what he does is enough to guarantee protagonism due to the absolute lack of a capable and competent cast. The actor is not completely devoid of ability or talent, but he seems to have limited himself to this, and similar films. It goes without saying that the rest of the cast doesn't even deserve a mention in this review, as they are absolute amateurs or people who made mistakes in their profession. And of course the Necronomicon, a book created by the fantasy imagination of H. P. Lovecraft, has a relevant role in the plot and is absolutely fearsome. In the midst of this funny disaster, what saves this film a little is the way Raimi takes the opportunity to study cheap visual and special effects, and the results he can get from them. Buckets of paint, raspberry juice, bizarre synthetic makeup similar to carnival faces, we have almost everything.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh that hand!,"Whether ""Evil Dead II"" was a remake or a sequel doesn't matter. What does is that it's an ultra-super-cool movie with every gross crazy thing that you could imagine! The plot (loosely) concerns Ash (Bruce Campbell) going back to the cabin and having to battle the evil spirits once again. But of course, the whole thing is really an excuse for a series of gags involving blood, eyeballs, and finally Ash's hand. In my opinion, the whole hand sequence should be registered as one of the greatest scenes in movie history, right alongside the Yellow Brick Road in ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Slim Pickens riding the bomb in ""Dr. Strangelove"". Only stuffy rich people would be incapable of liking this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Groovy! A lot of fun, even if it's not a masterpiece or anything","A spawn of the same cult film pool as such diverse projects as ""The Goonies"" and ""Donnie Darko,"" the ""Evil Dead"" series is similarly one popularized (and yes, to some extent overrated) by its endless legion of fans, most of whom were teenagers when the originals came out, and are now in their twenties and thirties. Each film separated by six years, ""Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness"" (or ""Medieval Dead"" as some fans enjoy referring to it as) all certainly hold a certain low-budget fanbase appeal. None of them did very well financially, at least not in theaters (particularly the third, which had the largest budget and flopped on initial release), but the same can be said for ""Donnie Darko,"" the ""flop"" of 2001 that went on to do very well on video and has played continually at midnight showings across America, enticing new fans every day.""Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"" stars Bruce Campbell as the returning Ash, the hapless hero who visits a remote wilderness cabin with his girlfriend only to inadvertently unleash the Deadites from another world. After his girlfriend is possessed and murdered by one of the demons, Ash finds himself fending for his life in the cabin and enduring endless physical pain.This is a film set free of logic, cohesion, and reality. Ash murders his possessed girlfriend but never really seems to mourn his loss. Soon he's cutting off his own hand and doesn't really seem to miss it very much in the following scenes (he replaces it with a chainsaw  a clever idea that nevertheless is totally and utterly ridiculous). If I cut off my hand, I might be sort of upset, but not Ash  he doesn't really seem to mind, and it doesn't seem to hurt him very much, either, as he immediately wraps it in a bandage (which must have a magical effect, because blood never stains through the fabric). Furthermore, Ash never seems to fear death from blood loss, or the fact that when he returns to civilization, he might have a hard time convincing local authorities that he's not responsible for the murder of his girlfriend and the visitors who show up midway through the film and all proceed to quickly die painful deaths at the hands of the Deadites.No matter. That's not the point of this film. ""Evil Dead II"" is pure fun, and nothing more. With this in mind, its strong fanbase comes across as being rather intimidating  visiting any ""Evil Dead"" message board will reveal some people who seem to thrive on this film, daily reciting quotes, acting out scenes, and dreaming up scenarios for the (pending) sequel ""Army of Darkness II."" That begs the question: Is ""Evil Dead II"" really deserving of its critical and public acclaim? Having been referenced by Jack Black in ""High Fidelity"" as the film you must see in order to stray away from devolving into a ""movie idiot,"" ""Evil Dead II"" is a fun experience with a charismatic, energetic lead performance and a clever and witty script. Before I saw ""EDII,"" Black's recommendation in ""High Fidelity"" (""there's so much blood!"") was a joke -- a parody of the macho male ""action, sex, nudity, loud music"" attitude. After having seen ""Evil Dead II"" I realize that Black was right -- the blood and guts really do make it worth seeing  they almost become a punch line to the joke, such as when a body is dragged into a fruit cellar by a demon and a spew of excessive fake red water drenches the heroine as the corpse is churned into a million pieces.So, no, it's not a masterpiece and it probably isn't quite deserving of its strong reputation. It's that type of movie, where you kind of enjoy it for the cheese factor  and don't try to heavily criticize its flaws, because to do that would be way too easy. And obvious.The film is more of a remake than a sequel, recapping the events of the first film, dropping three characters, and generally picking up somewhere in the middle. For example in the original ""Evil Dead"" Ash stumbles upon the Book of the Dead, and he does so again in this movie. Many events are totally re-filmed as if they never occurred. It's a rare beast of a sequel  somewhere oddly in between continuation and smug self-parody.I personally prefer the original ""Evil Dead"" if only because I find the horror elements stronger and the ""comedy"" far less goofy (if there are even any traces of comedy in the original at all). ""Evil Dead II"" goes a bit too far sometimes  the dancing furniture is lame, for example.However, no one can say this series lacks originality. Instead of presenting us with a banal representation of the original film, director Sam Raimi reunites with Campbell and creates a whole new beast  packed with excessive physical humor (think: ultra-violent Three Stooges on a macabre level), self-parody, tongue-in-cheek humor, and what Campbell himself described as ""splatstick"" comedy. On top of that, Campbell is much better here than he was in the original (where he seemed to be a pale shade and more cowardly version of the typical action hero persona)  Ash is still somewhat of a coward but Campbell lends his character a great sense of irony here that if anything only establishes Ash as one of cinema's most iconic characters.Overall, ""Evil Dead II"" is a really fun ride, with a superior performance from Campbell. It may not be on the same level as the original in terms of horror or just general enjoyment, but it's still a blast. Groovy, baby!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Skip first one and see this one twice,"When I first saw ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) many years ago, I was disappointed. I gave up on franchise and made terrible mistake. ""Evil Dead II"" is what its name says but also much more than that. At the beginning movie reboots the story from ""The Evil Dead"" and then continues where it left off. Story is painfully stupid and characters make stupidest possible movies in a given situation. But it does not matter at all. There's no introduction or characterization, it's complete madness from the start. The movie is an unstoppable bloody over-the-top action, exaggerated out of all proportion, with a camera that savages all over. Shots that shake and move in all directions, scenes from the first person and a lot of slimy liquids of all colors splashing everywhere. And in the middle of all that Bruce Campbell, whose acting deserves at least nomination for Oscar. The man is damn genius and I can not wait to see him in ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Ash vs Evil Dead"". Without delay, tonight.

"The best gory 80's ""Evil Dead"" sequel movie ever by far terrifying, creepy my personal favorite horror film of all time","This is basic horror creepy terrifying movie of the 80's with the original movie ""The Evil Dead"" (1981). I love this film to death and I love the original horror movie. The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn are the master of horror movies of the 80's they are masterpieces both. The first two movies are my favorite horror films of all time. Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel both wrote an excellent script are real bloody slasher rated - R movie. Bruce Campbell is back as Ash and he is much better than he he was in the first movie. With a shotgun and a chainsaw he is a bad-ass. Sam Raimi fantastic directed the sequel, Robert G. Tapert excellent produced this movie.So the low budget fan fair that made The Evil Dead a success are at it again with Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn. This one picks up where the first left off as Ash drives back to the cabin with his girlfriend Linda in the woods and accidently they unleash evil spirits from the book of dead Henrietta that constantly terrorize Ash. Of course there wouldn't be a sequel without some intent to return to the horrific scene of the crime. That said Evil Dead 2 is gory as the original even goriest.I love the other actors and actresses Sarah Berry as Annie she was likable who helped out Ash fighting against evil demons. She did a good job. Kassie Wesley as Boby Joe was the hotest sexy babe she was so hot and so damn beautiful sexy I love her so much. I love her performance in this movie. Denise Bixler as Linda she had only a few scenes in here she was good. Bruce Campbell is a bad-ass fighter against evil dead spirits that terrorizes him. His hand get's alive and try's to kill him, so he cut's his hand off ballsy.I love when Ash jumps on a witch Hehnrietta in the basement and her eye jumps and fly's direct in to Bobby Joe's mouth when she screams groovy awesome. Love Ash's line Swallow this, groovy. Ash shooting with a shootgun his hand. Linda becomes possed by evil demon and Ash with a shovel in his hand hits Linda's head off. There is a lot of blood in this. A lot of horror really love this film to death. I love the woods where they filmed when Bobby Joe (Kassie Wesley) tries to escape, but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. That is basic Evil Dead movie from the first one and not Army of Darkness.The sequel was filmed in North Carolina, USA the cabin is still there the filming loactions of this film are on YouTube. Of all the movie sets in the world and film locations. I've noticed by far evil dead is the most popular film series. There's been a lot of people visiting,morristown Tennessee and Wadesboro North Carolina. What started out as 3 college guys filming a movie. Became a world wide fan base. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Robert G. Tapert. These movies made Bruce popular. Even the next generation of kids is visiting the film locations.

The Flaming Groovy!,"Yes indeed, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are back to shake some action with this remake of their own The Evil Dead (1981), only this time with more money and more overt humour. A quick prologue sets things up nicely, then BAM! Ash (Campbell) and his squeeze are in the cabin of doom and about to be part of a night of unholy demonic terror.It's a nightmare of the black comedy kind, where Raimi and Campbell invite us to a party and then gleefully pummel us into submission - and we sado-masochistically enjoy it! Ash has grown a pair of cojones and decides to fight back against the demonic forces, cue mucho action with chainsaw and shotgun. There's a quip on the tongue for our hero as well, even as he is battered from pillar to post to make the action work.Raimi isn't interested in extraneous scenes or exposition, he strips it bare as the pic hurtles along, all while he brings his technical skills with camera and sound design to the fore. The humour is often outrageous, dementedly so, while it's nice to find a group of film makers who don't feel the need to now throw blood and guts at the screen every other scene just to make a formulaic impact.Bonkers, chilling and devilishly funny. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fast paced, hilarious, and creative (funniest horror movie)","The Evil Dead (first movie) was a good movie. It was cheap, it was self aware at its own cheapness, it had some hilarious jump scares, and it had great timing with its humour. It always knew how to hold something scary long enough to make it funny.Evil Dead II is almost the exact opposite of The Evil Dead, but in a good way. While The Evil Dead's humour generally revolved around showing someone die for 5 minutes or just how obnoxiously long it takes to fight the evil. However, Evil Dead II is INCREDIBLY fast. Not only does it have a short run time, but so much happens to quickly that it makes the movie hilarious. The movie is so half- assed and so quick that it is hard to catch your breath because the jokes keep on coming. This is literally the funniest ""horror"" movie I have ever seen.The movie starts with a brief recap of the first movie at the beginning (and yes, this movie has a recap and is NOT a remake; as some would like to believe). The movie then quickly leaves us off with where the first movie ended and continues from there... and man does it take off. Non-stop weird shots, strange angles, ridiculous concepts, dancing zombies, laughing furniture, demented hands, and tons of really fake looking blood. The movie has so many continuity errors in itself that the errors are their own joke. Sometimes the possessed people will have different colored blood, sometimes the clothes will change on actors, and supposedly sometimes there are multiple actors playing the SAME character! The movie is a joke on every level.DEFINITELY watch Evil Dead II. While it does work as a standalone movie, I think part of its humour comes from how different it is from the first movie. The Evil Dead felt like a b-movie that was aware of its lameness while Evil Dead II feels like a full fledged comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reboot of the Original,"Actually, the second part should be a continuation, but in the end a reboot came out. Since the first part was temporarily prohibited, the director was forced to do a reboot. For the second part Sam Raimi also had ten times as much budget available as for the first part. The difference to Part I is that dance the devil II is equipped with macabre humor and some slapstick inserts. This makes the film more accessible to everyone. Of course, this is an aspect that comes to misunderstandings for real horror fans. The camera rides are impressive. Because the horror comes back by the close shots and the camera guide again. But as in the first part, the handmade masks are the real eye- catcher of this film. On the other hand, one finds that the second part has also lost its character by its humor and the slapstick...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love me some Ash!,"Okay, it's a 9 star movie, in MY world.
The evil dead saga is a different type of movie that attracts ""different people"" such as myself.
Unlike ""Evil dead"" 1981 version, the following evil deads introduced funny camera work, silly scenes, and funky catchphrases to forever change the horror world.
Bruce Campbell takes a serious beating while fighting undead, and just bad luck (and some good luck).

Very funny,"A very funny ""horror"" film - whether the intention was to be funny is unknown, but the poor special effects and acting leads me to that belief.

Groovy,"If the Evil Dead is a great Horror passion project, the Evil Dead II is a masterclass of a sequel. Taking all the passion and unique style from the original film, this film is the refining and perfection of that. Whilst we again get to see Ash go insane, we get see to see a man trapped in the house for a second time, no way out, there's no escape to the evil.What can I say though, the film is just a great Horror Comedy, it mixes the style, the stranger elements and refines them in a way that is funny but still keeps the same style of scares. It also holds one of the most iconic characters in the whole of cinema. The script, the effects, the direction and all the elements of the film are just incredibly well done.There are also problems I have with the film such as the way that the whole of the last film feels retconned due to the recap they had to make because of Sam Raimi and Co not having the rights to the footage from the first film but that's just a small part of the movie and allows it to stand on its own as a great sequel.Great Horror Comedy, on par or even better then the first, truly iconic. I give this movie a Groovy/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blood-Soaked Insanity,"Few movies have left an impression on me quite like this one. I remember after I finished watching it, my only reaction was, ""what the f*** did I just watch?"" It was one of the greatest movie-watching experiences I've ever had. Evil Dead II is quite simply one the greatest horror movies of all time.The first movie was a straight-up horror, with some sporadic dark humor thrown in. This one ups the comedy, but thankfully, not at the expense of the horror. Don't be fooled, there are some truly frightening scenes in this movie. And yes, the blood flows frequently, with one scene in particular possibly ranking as one of the goriest of all time. All different colors of blood and other bodily fluids show up along the way. But it's main influence probably comes from The Three Stooges. Sam Raimi's love of the The Three Stooges shows throughout the film's many comedic set-pieces. From a demon who can't stalk fast enough, to Ash fighting a possessed hand, and even some crazy antics with a flying eyeball. There are so many classic scenes in this movie, and all this is due to the absolutely awesome performance by a certain Bruce Campbell. This is the role that made him a B-movie legend; a role he was born to play. He would make an excellent Jim Carrey in some parallel universe, as he handles the physical comedy extremely well. The supporting actors do well in their respective roles, but Bruce steals the show completely.Everything from the masterful and innovative camera work, to the somewhat dated but extremely effective special effects, simply complete the package of what is one of the greatest horror / comedies of all time. Sure, sometimes the seams show, with various puppet strings and other goofs visible, but it's that same charm that elevates this movie to cult status. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, even if just once.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best of the trilogy...,"When watching the ""Evil Dead"" movies you have to keep an open mind, and an open stomach. Being a huge fan of movies with lots of gore I can give you the statement that this is one film that doesn't shy away from the fun. Although the director, Sam Raimi, did in fact take a few steps (like changing the color of the blood) in order to avoid an NC-17 rating - and a lot of good that did, eh?The beginning of the film is basically the same (but revised) thing as the first ""Evil Dead."" Big-chinned Ash(ley) travels with his girlfriend to a quaint log cabin on, what seems to be, some deserted mountain. But odd things happen after he plays a tape recording that reads aloud passages from the Necronomicon: the ""book of the dead."" The primary difference between this one and the first ""Evil Dead"" is the group of victims that fall to the wrath of the evil dead. Rather than a group of friends, it is a group of strangers, who all get tortured in horrible ways (especially Ash) till either their demise or the end of the movie. One particularly lovely scene involves a headless, naked, female zombie ballerina dancer whom pursues Ash with a chainsaw.Anyway I recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of the horror genre or anyone who just likes a fun ol' movie, but doesn't mind the sometimes extreme ridiculousness that comes along with it. But although this is a great film be prepared for major scenes of continuity.*Gore: 10/10*Suspense: 1/10*Overall: 7/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than 'The Evil Dead',"'Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn' is essentially a remake of the original 'The Evil Dead', extended and made more professionally and with more experience than the first.Beginning with a short recap of the first movie, we join the sole survivor Ash. He is trapped in the cabin, slowly going mad as deadites torment him. Soon he is joined by Annie Knowby (the daughter of Professor Knowby, the archaeologist who recorded the incantations from the Necronomicon), Ed (Annie's boyfriend or something), a redneck named Jake and his girlfriend Bobbie Joe. Yup, Bobbie Joe...Now the forest has more victims to claim, and it isn't long before the deadites are back in full force. At first it seems like a rehash of the first movie, but as the events progress you can tell it is smarter than the first. Essentially the same story, but the horror scenes are better and more varied than the first, more comedy, the special effects are much much better. We also get to see Ash progress from the terrified survivor to the Cult-God 'Army of Darkness' Ash that we all love. Bruce Campbell rules. Going from the scared-pretty boy, Ash turns into the deadite-killing, one-liner spitting, King of Awesomeness.Hail to the King, baby.

A stylish and slick horror movie that's not afraid to make fun of itself,"The problem with most horror movies is that they take themselves way too seriously.  Fortunately, 'Evil Dead 2', doesn't fall into this category. 'Dead' proves to be as funny as it is gut-wrenching.  The plot involves a man (Bruce Campbell) trapped in a cabin haunted by hellish demons.  Sure, some of the scares are standard horror gimmicks (i.e. zombies, severed hands, etc.). No matter, the film's strength lies in its satirical approach toward itself.  Most of the horror in the movie is purposefully made over-the-top and it works, in terms of humor. It's also a kick to watch Bruce Campbell, who also starred in the first 'Evil Dead', act like crazed psycho throughout the movie.

A horrible lack of ideas and originality,"One friend of mine, who was normally likes movies that I like, absolutely wanted to show me this movie and said that it would be a funny and very gore horror movie that wouldn't not take itself serious at all. My friend had presented me ""Shaun of the dead"" and I liked the mixture of horror and comedy in this movie. I also like ""Scary movie"" and ""Final destination"", horror movies that go into a funny and ridiculous direction. I even saw movies from the legendary Ed Wood such as ""Bride of the monster"" or ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and I thought that they were trashy, but very charming and atmospheric somehow. I think that I can consider myself as an open-minded person that finds this genre of horror comedy at least interesting.I am really sorry to say this, but this movie is just complete rubbish. I know that this movie wants to joke about serious horror movies but after the first two or three sketches and the first ten minutes of surprising absurdity of this film, the whole thing is just not funny any more and you are waiting that there is some development, something original, something crazy to come, but that isn't the case. The childish jokes are repeated within the eighty minutes of the movie and become really annoying. The acting is particularly bad, the substance of ideas is running low, the dialogs are more than awful, there is nothing shocking or surprising, there are many mistakes in the movie and I could continue this list eternally. I know that those were the intentions of the director, but it is too much of everything and just not funny or entertaining anymore after ten minutes. All the movies that I have mentioned in my introduction are more original and funnier than this piece of garbage. I really tried to laugh, to put myself on a very low and childish level and took some beers during the film in the hope that it would help, but it didn't. It just helped me to almost fall asleep during this so-called cult movie but as I wanted to watch this completely and until the very end, I continued to torture myself. The only other horror movie that I know that is as awful as this one is Rob Zombie's ""House of thousand corpses"".Even if some people find this ""cult"" movie funny and entertaining with its charming trash, I think that this stuff doesn't deserve such a high rating at all, when the other films that I mentioned are mostly rated about at least two points below this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Rack for Sam Raimi...,"...to put his off-beat brand of humor on sums up Evil Dead 2.

Actually, ED2 does tend to drag in spots while Ash is alone in the cabin, but picks up a bit once a new batch of cannon fodder...I mean, the rest of the cast show up.

The Macabre Dance on LSD,"It's simple: Evil Dead 2 is Sam Raimi waking up one day and saying, ""Alright, guys, restraint is for the weak, and I'm about to blow everyone's minds."" And it works! If the first movie already felt like Raimi was screaming at us with gallons of blood, this sequel is like a full-blown collective hallucination. It's as if the guy downed some shrooms before hitting ""action,"" and honestly, we thank him for it.If you thought the first Evil Dead was messy, prepare to get slapped by this second installment. But it's not grim, Saw-style gore. No, here it's blood spraying like a cartoon. Want a possessed hand flipping you off and a chainsaw as a prosthetic? You got it. This movie is an out-of-control skid between horror and Looney Tunes. Think Tom and Jerry, but with Satan pulling the strings.Bruce Campbell is basically the Chuck Norris of slapstick. One minute, he's a badass hero, and the next, he's the horror genre's favorite punching bag. The guy gets smacked around by trees, fights with his own hand, and plays amateur exorcist in a wooden cabin, all with facial expressions worthy of Jim Carrey on crack. He's not just acting; he's gladiator-level battling in the arena of absurdity.Then there's the Necronomicon, the cursed book that turns a simple getaway into a demonic possession festival. Between the tree rapists (yep, that's a thing), deadites jigging like it's a nightmare ballet, and time-traveling portals, you feel like you're stuck in a video game that's glitched beyond repair. Even Doomguy would have thrown in the towel by now.Evil Dead 2 isn't just a horror movie; it's a UFO of a film. An insane blend of gory chaos, dark humor, and '80s exploitation cinema. It's pure, adrenaline-fueled genius, a controlled madness that rewrote the horror playbook. It's a cult classic for those of us who enjoy our movies overflowing-with guts, particularly.So, if you're looking for a film where entrails fly, chainsaws become an extension of the body, and the laws of physics take a vacation, Evil Dead 2 is your jam. And all of it served up by Bruce Campbell in ultimate survival mode. A masterpiece in its genre. Sam Raimi, thank you for this deliriously fun ride through hell.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"I have mixed feelings, but I still found it fairly entertaining","This movie kind of lost me from the get-go, since I was wondering why the hell Ash would go back to this cabin, after all that happened in the first ""Evil Dead.""  Now I'm reading that this was actually supposed to be a remake of the first ""ED.""  Why a director would want to remake his own movie, I don't know, but I'm sure all the ""Evil Dead"" enthusiasts out there could come up with some logical reasoning behind the creation of this sequel, so I won't get too much into it.The scenes in the opening go by like flashes of lightning, and sometimes the effects are too overwhelming to digest.  Raimi obviously had a bigger budget, so it seemed like he wanted to take full advantage of this bigger budget, but at times he just gets way over the top.But I became more engaged in the film when the additional characters came into play.  Like the first ""ED"" I wish it could've had a little more plot, but also like the first ""ED"" I sensed Sam's joy in making the film.  Like a teenager making a student film, he jumps at any chance to create visuals that'll make the audience go ""Wow.""  And there are some truly original visual sequences, which combine his knack for visuals and slapstick comedy. The scene where Bruce beats up on himself is classic.  I also loved it when Bruce, armed with his chainsaw, uttered the line ""Groovy.""  And if you're looking to buy the DVD, it has a great commentary track that's definitely worth checking out!All in all, I still won't regard this as a ""good"" film, but it has its moments and serves as pretty good entertainment.  But I still wish Raimi could've tempered himself a little bit with the f/x sequences.My score:  5 (out of 10)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
More 'splatstick' than scary; it isn't quite as good as the first but it balances its humour and horror expertly.,"More 'splatstick' than scary, the second instalment in the cult franchise cranks up the goofiness but wisely retains the horror, resulting in an entertaining flick from start to finish. My only real hesitations with 'Evil Dead II (1987)' come thanks to the numerous continuity errors that come from its bizarre 'recap' opening (a result of a rights issue, as I understand it). These are especially noticeable when watching the first two 'Evil Dead' films back to back, and almost make this feel like more of a stand-alone than a sequel. Its first few scenes are really rather hard to get through (although they're still well-made) because not only do they undermine the events of the previous movie, they also don't act as an engaging opening due to how rushed and inconsequential they seem. Having said that, after about ten minutes (and some mental gymnastics), the plot starts to act as a proper follow-up to the events of its predecessor and it settles into a proper sense of pace. When all is said and done, this is a really enjoyable picture. Who knew that seeing Bruce Campbell go crazy in a cabin (which this essentially is for its entire first half) could be so genuinely compelling? Though it's ridiculously over-the-top and is intended to provoke chuckles, the piece retains the off-kilter vibe, gore and occasional suspense required to make its silly humour work in its horrific context. Basically, it balances its two core elements incredibly well. While it isn't quite as good as its predecessor (despite its numerous technical improvements), it's still an inventive, ambitious, energetic and thoroughly entertaining experience. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Greatest Film Ever Made!Tm,"The Greatest Film Ever Made! This is my description of Evil Dead 2, you will probably want to ask why the sequel to a crappy 1982 gore-fest is the Greatest Film Ever, but I'll get on to that later.The film starts with a re-run of the first Evil Dead, only it has been re-shot. In this new version, only Ash(Bruce Cambell) and Linda go to the cabin, not five of them as there originally was. This pretty much renders the first film obsolete, but it should clarify that this is not a re-make, but a sequel. After this 'mini-Evil Dead' Ash is thrown through the woods on an unseen revolving crucifix. Then the film really starts.Ash is alone in the cabin, where he slowly becomes insane, and his hand becomes possessed (""Give me back my hand!"") It is at this point in the movie that the audience should realise that this is not a straight horror film. It is a comedy-horror. When Ash's hand is possessed we see the best pysical comedy ever seen! Easily beatng Jim Carrey beating himself up in Me, Myself & Irene.Then some people come to the cabin and the film shifts into blood-soaked high gear, and we are taken on a rip-roaring rollercoaster of a ride, ending up in the best set-up for a sequel ever!Now, you are probably still wondering why I have called it the Greatest Movie Ever. It is because no other film has combined so many genres and made it work. It has Horror. It has comedy. It has action. It has a bit set in Medival times. It has cheese(Bruce Cambell's performance in the first 5 minutes). There's a sort of romantic-thing going on between Ash and Linda (Yes, I know, It's disgusting). I could go on.

Imaginative low budget comedy horror,An American horror comedy. A story about a man whose romantic break in a remote cabin goes terrifyingly wrong when he accidentally unleashes an evil force that possesses his girlfriend. This is a consistently lively and ghoulish horror film with plenty of slapstick comedy and engaging special effects. Its strength is its black humour which naturally arises from horrific events taken to extremes. The film has higher production values than the previous installment and Bruce Campbell is riveting in his over-expression and camped up characterisation.

The Freakest Wactrg,"""The Exorcist"" made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering ""what the f*** just happened?!"". The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! ""Evil Dead II"" makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that ""she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (""dead by dawn!""), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a suit generous Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the ""A Farewell to Arms"" joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. ""Groovy!"". ""Dead by Dawn"" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here.The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore.Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a ""solo"". Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice sequel...,"""Evil Dead II"" is a Horror movie and the sequel of ""The Evil Dead"" in which we watch the only survivor of the previous movie trying to survive in a remote cabin in the woods. After some time and many fights, a group of strangers arrives there from a secret path that disappeared after their arrival. While the demons continue their attack the group trying to find a method to stop the evil and escapes from the cabin.Since I had already watched the first movie I had high hopes for this movie and I was happily surprised with the outcome. I liked this movie because it remained in the same pattern as the first one and became even more interesting and with the same amount of suspense. As the first movie consisted of a simple and at the same time interesting plot so, did this movie too. Much of suspense, many action scenes and good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I liked again the interpretation of Bruce Campbell who played as Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams and in my opinion, he was the best in this movie and Denise Bixler who played as Linda. For one more time the direction which was made by Sam Raimi it was amazing combined action and horror scenes with some comic relief moments.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Evil Dead II"" is an interesting movie with a great plot which continues a great way of the first movie. I recommend everyone to watch this sequel because I am sure that you will have a great time watching it and if you have already watched the first movie like me then I believe that you won't be disappointed by it at all. If you haven't watched the first movie then, in my opinion, you should watch the first movie and then the second in order to be prepared and understand what is it all about.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A weird sequel, but nonetheless awesome to watch. Kiss your nerves goodbye.","I will start with a common question regarding this movie; is it a sequel or remake? Well it's sort of both. Having seen the previous film helps, but isn't really necessary. The director Sam Raimi claims that is is a sequel, and that the differences between the first movie and Evil Dead 2 ""flashbacks"" is because of ownership rights to the scenes from the prequel which lead to them having to re-shoot them. In my opinion the differences is so extreme that it should qualify as a remake. But nonetheless Evil Dead 2 continues the story of the first movie.Now this movie is definitely a bit of a cliché, but that's what makes it so great. Imitating it's predecessor in so many ways, evil dead, living trees, demons, chainsaws, it's simply a very enjoyable horror film. Alos where the first one may have left you feel a little uncomfortable, this movie makes you feel better with it's more humorous tone. I actually think they made a little fun of themselves making this movie.And what more can I say about Bruce Campbell, than that he's awesome. In the first movie he spent most of the time freaking out and surviving almost on pure luck. In this one however, he's merciless. He grabs a chainsaw, a shotgun, says ""Groovy"" for some reason, and kicks ass. The thing that makes the Evil dead trilogy some memorable is definitely Bruce Campbell himself.Once again I feel I've got to mention, this movie is R rated for a reason. It's not as gory as the first one, and as I mentioned it a little funnier than the first one. So just don't show it to any kids, I would say anyone over 13 or 14 could get through it as long as they got the nerves for it. The movies tag-line was ""kiss your nerves goodbye"", and their not holding back.So for this hilarious and nerve wrecking horror masterpiece I give a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An evil sequel that keeps the legacy of the original film alive.,"Evil Dead 2 (1987) :
Brief Review -An evil sequel that keeps the legacy of the original film alive. Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 is hardly connected to Evil Dead, even though we have the leading actor and his character returning once again. The first film ends with Ash Williams' scream as an evil force attacks him in the last frame, leaving us with a strong presumption that he is dead. Part 2 opens with the same character driving a car and returning to the haunted house. Similar to the original flick, he finds a recorder and plays the chants that awaken the dead evil force to come to earth. His girlfriend is possessed and killed, and he too becomes possessed by the same evil power, but sunrise saves him for a while. He can't go back, and when the sun sets, the evil forces come alive again to strike at him. Four new adventurers join him and are attacked by the evils while one of them is searching for her mother and father, who were there for a few days and recorded the tape before getting killed. They are also possessed and are trapped in the cellar, transforming into unbearable evils that threaten these five people. Ash and the others try to survive, but it's extremely difficult. Just like its predecessor, Evil Dead 2 is also very brutal, violent, and unwatchable. I was eating my food while watching the film, and I felt like vomiting several times. The red bloodbath, green blood, slashed hand, middle finger, skeleton body, trees, climber, and chainsaw-you can't get over any of it. There is so much horror content, including macabre faces and filthy creatures, and the visual effects put you in an uncomfortable position. Raimi goes a notch higher with his horrifying material, despite having a similar plot and screenplay. There is a good twist at the end regarding the ""other world,"" which opens the door for new ideas. Overall, Evil Dead 2 is everything you need from a hyped sequel. A textbook on how to create a sequel without tampering with the original source material.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dont like the way that things turn,"I was really worried about this movie. When i saw the genre where it belongs(comedy, horror, fantastic) and i compared to the first one where only the genre of horror where it belong. Evil dead 2 is a movie that i couldnt finish. Its clearly a copy of the first one but without the same taste. It have clearly the same classic story and i couldnt finish it. It felt very different of the first one, i dont recognize the same qualities as the first one and i didnt found any real plus value to the first one and i found the comedy pretty poor and not really funny.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The element of comedy spiced it up...,"While I never really understood why they decided to slightly change the storyline a bit from part one to the continuation in part two, then it is still an interesting approach. And ""Evil Dead II"" is in fact a rather good movie; a sequel that actually surpassed its predecessor.The added element of comedy might not have been welcomed by all viewers, but I think it was a stroke of genius. It helped redefine the franchise that is ""The Evil Dead"". And the increased budget did of course help too.""Evil Dead II"" is a good combination of horror and comedy, and Bruce Campbell really was allowed to showcase his talents in this movie and made it clear that he is without a doubt the only one capable of being Ash.The effects in ""Evil Dead II"" are upped quite a lot compared to the first movie, and it really did help the movie. So there is a wider audience appeal to the sequel compared to the first movie.Similar to the first movie, the storyline is well-thought through and is coherent. It is easy to follow and you would be way off if you wouldn't enjoy this movie - but that is of course my personal opinion.If you are not familiar with ""Evil Dead II"" then it is about due time that you sit down and watch this great horror comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love this kind of evil,"These are one of those sequels you like so much, you choose it over it's predecessor. Evil Dead 2 is like one terrifying ride, you don't really wanna get off, where special effects, whizzing camera shots and angles rule which are used exuberantly. It's ongoing, that flying human eye which Campbell nearly swallows, which wouldn't go down too well, I always remember. These are the reasons is why this movie is so much fun. BC, a Raimi favorite, the lone survivor of the first, returns with his sweetheart back to the scene of the crime, so to speak, where all those demon forces and evil spirits are long gone, we hope. By example here, sometimes hope doesn't work, where so begins another frenetic and maddening and unreal experience, where soon Campbell's the only one to carry it off, and in that case, it's a blessing as through the business of the role, his crazed, and chaotic self can also bring humor to his performances. BC is one of those bloody good but underused actors, where here re really see what he can make out of a role. If opting to choose an Evil Dead to watch (we won't mention Army Of Darkness cause that's crap) I would of already picked this one, without second thoughts. It's one thorough and exhilarating roller coaster of horror. Poor Campbell, he's reliving a mayhem of hell, left to fix up this madness, his work cut out for him, all cause that other couple opened the bloody cursed book again, with it's human skinned pages of flesh That hairy, crossing broken bridge shot, was awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent remake - or sequel,"Anyway, from the same director Sam Raimi, you could not get deceived, even if he did exactly the same thing as he did for the previous movie, but with a far bigger budget, and - the most important- with a total freedom, compared with the crap that he will give us in 1992, a huge budget this time, still compared with the first two films. And bigger budgets means working with those producers from Hollywood crap industry, those business men tied to the stock exchange, the stock market and who want every dollar to be used for the large audiences pleasure. So, before enduring the third film of the franchise, take advantage to enjoy this one. It is really exciting fun, for any horror fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Stellar Sequel,"Evil Dead II is a sequel that doesn't sound like it should work but it does. If I were to pitch a Evil Dead sequel that's basically a remake but with a much goofier tone to the point where it's much more a comedy than a horror movie.But nevertheless, Evil Dead II is impressive and so much fun to watch. Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams is single handedly the greatest part of this movie. He is so much fun to watch and the fact that he seems to be having so much fun playing it makes it so much better.You really don't need to see Evil Dead in order to see Evil Dead II, and while I still prefer the original, I can definitely see why so many prefer the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unique, entertaining, unforgettable.","It's easy to understand why the 'Evil Dead' films were so successful and has such a big following. They are really well made! These films are visually head and shoulders above films made around the same time.'Evil Dead 2' plunges the viewer immediately into the deep end. There literally are no introductions and the mayhem ensues within the first few minutes, and never lets go until the credits roll. This is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, disgusting horror, and amazing visual and special effects. It truly is unlike anything you've ever seen.Sam Raimi is back in the Director's chair and Bruce Campbell is back as Ash - the poor victim of the demonic onslaught. In this film, he deals with much, much more than he can handle - and its wonderful! 'Evil Dead 2' is even more demented than the first film. It is disgusting and gross, with bucket loads of blood and guts. The make-up and effects are mind blowing! Some scenes are downright silly and stupid, yet it works so well within the genre of the film. This is a very unconventional film, after all. There's a scene where lamps and furniture in the house start laughing, and - as insane as it sounds - it truly is a wonderful scene, capturing the very essence of Ash's disturbed mind.As I said with the original 'Evil Dead', these films will not appeal to everyone, so choose your audience wisely if you intend showing these at horror movie nights. Whichever way you look at these films - whether you love them or loathe them - they are unique and incredibly well made.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Who tf writes these reviews?,"This film was one of the worst it's ever been my misfortune to sit through. It's too noisy by half, stress-inducing and completely unfunny. Normally, I'm quite partial to a Sam Raimi film but this was a massive fail, I'm afraid. I'm the same age as Sam so suppose my sense of humour will be of the same generation but this was appalling. Maybe it was funny in 1987 in the way I found Porky's mildly amusing in 1982 but it certainly isn't in 2023. Not to me, at any rate. I'm asking myself why I even bothered watching right through to the end but I'm the same with books too, once I've started them. The only reason I've given it 1 is because there was no Zero option.

Pure Splatter Film Horror Comedy,"1987, splatter film sequel to the 1981 movie The Evil Dead, which is also directed by Sam Raimi, and also starring Bruce Campbell.

"Hail to the king, baby.","I never saw the first Evil Dead, and I plan to, but I did see Dead by Dawn. HOLY FISHSTICKS BATMAN! I've never seen anything quite like this. Geniously fusing horror with comedy (not to mention Bruce Campbell's trademark one-liners), you've got yourself one freakishly enjoyable splat-fest.......And if you can't tell by my enthusiasm for this movie already, that's a good thing.From what I've heard (darn you all who have seen the first movie!!!!!), Evil Dead II is essentially a remake of the first, but going to a less darker, less scarier tone. The comedy has been upped though.The overall story is this: Ash (Bruce Campbell) and girlfriend Linda go to the infamous abandoned cabin for a weekend alone, in director Sam Raimi's trademark beat-up Oldsmobile (in practically every one of his films, with the exception of ""The Quick and the Dead""....Cause you wouldn't see one of those in the 1800's...). Ash discovers the Necrimonicon, the book of the dead, and its ritual dagger, and makes the mistake of playing the reel-to-reel tape of the owner of the cabin reciting verses....Which (surprise!) awakens the evil spirits and captures Linda. After trying to destroy Ash, it's off with her head, and I'd give everything away if I said any more.Surprisingly, more people know about this film then the landmark original, which sparked as much controversy as it did acclaim (it was personally reccomended by Stephen King), and one-upped the original by boasting a bigger budget, better acting by the front man (Bruce Campbell even admitted that in the first film he was still perfecting his acting skills and may have gone a little overboard), tongue-in-cheekiness, and an overabundance of gore, which all horror fans should be happy to hear.So, before I ramble on till Kingdom come, go and watch this movie. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dead in the Woods.,"Plain and stupid low-budget horror fare that is so short on ideas that it basically rehashes its terrible predecessor early on. When the new story actually starts (about 20 minutes in) we get to see four more dumb people that join B-movie ham Bruce Campbell out in that spooky cabin in the middle of nowhere. Co-writer/director Sam Raimi once again showed his early career shortcomings with ho-hum ideas that are more nauseating than interesting. This film goes for black comedy in an unconventional way and this takes what little suspense there was completely out of the series. Considering the success of ""The Evil Dead"" (a total waste of film in my opinion), one would think that the slightly bigger budget would have been used on important things like actors and screenwriters, but instead they burned the money on more sickening and visually inferior makeup effects. Trash. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",,Anonymous,Horror
Ashes to Laughter,"Evil Dead II, directed by Sam Raimi, is a distinctive fusion of horror and comedy that builds on the cult following of its predecessor. The film follows Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) as he finds himself back in the same cursed cabin, battling demonic forces and spiralling into a nightmarish descent into madness. The film leans heavily into slapstick gore and surreal humour, offering a chaotic and exaggerated tone that defines its unique appeal. While Evil Dead II is widely celebrated for its inventive style, its fast-paced, over-the-top approach may not resonate with viewers expecting a more straightforward horror experience.Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash stands out as a highlight, capturing the character's gradual breakdown with a remarkable mix of physical comedy and relentless energy. His exaggerated expressions and slapstick antics make Ash both a memorable and unique protagonist, especially as he faces increasingly bizarre and grotesque horrors. Campbell's portrayal is both amusing and unsettling, encapsulating the film's commitment to merging horror with absurdity.Raimi's direction brings a dynamic flair to the film, with inventive camera angles, energetic movement, and practical effects that heighten the chaotic atmosphere. The creative use of low-budget techniques and practical effects gives the film a distinctive, often grotesque style. However, the constant barrage of exaggerated horror and surreal visuals can become overwhelming, making it difficult for some viewers to engage deeply with the film's narrative.Although Evil Dead II has become a cult classic, its commitment to slapstick horror may not appeal to all horror fans. The blend of comedy and grotesque violence, while innovative, sacrifices the suspense and tension that define more traditional horror films. It focuses more on visual spectacle and shock value than on creating sustained scares, and as such, may not satisfy viewers looking for an atmospheric or serious horror experience.In conclusion, Evil Dead II is an inventive, energetic film that stands out for its bold style and camp appeal. While its chaotic tone and emphasis on absurdity may leave some viewers wanting more substance, it remains a beloved entry for fans of over-the-top, surreal horror-comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the funniest horror movie ever,This cult classic is a must see.  It is so ridiculously funny while consistently following the footsteps of the horror genre.Sam Raimi definitely has something going here with an excellent performance by Bruce Campbell. I love the incredible POV shots done in this film.  The shot design of the film is just so awesome. This is definitely a must see for all film students and also ppl who are interested in sound design because sound is the key factor that makes this film work so well.

"Hail to the King, baby...","Sequel/remake of the classic Evil Dead, this time focusing more on the humorous aspects of slicing and dicing people.Evil Dead 2 is obviously not meant to be taken seriously. It's a horror film, but not as much so as the original. What we have here is a bunch of guys having fun with effects and and a camera. It's all very tongue in cheek, and fortunately very entertaining.You don't care about continuity problems, goofs, or dodgy effects. There's an amateurish charm over the film that works just fine. It's nice to see that you can have a film with many faults without someone going back after-wards trying to cover up their mistakes and make it look better (Yes George Lucas, I'm talking to you.)The central thrust of this film is of course Bruce Campbell, who oozes of charisma as he picks up his chainsaw, ready to take on the undead. The rest of the cast are obviously just cannon fodder, but who cares?Evil Dead 2 is also interesting for its surreal tone. At times, it feels more like an art film than cheap horror. There are flaws, after all it really is a cheap horror flick, but the sheer enthusiasm and warped comedy that's gone in to this film makes up for much of it. [7/10]",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best Evil Dead.,"Evil Dead 2 is by far superior to the original Evil Dead which was pretty poor indeed. Despite what a few people say about this movie it IS a remake of the original but made so much better in every single way. Ash is cooler, there are some comedy elements but still has a twisted horror feel to it that no other horror movie has. Some of the effects are a little bit dodgy but this was made slightly before the days of CGI. Ash is darned cool as a normal guy coping with the pressures of demonic spirits and without this man the film would be mediocre at best. I love the way the demons (not zombies! morons!) walk, very twisted and scary. The follow up to this called Army Of Darkness pushes the comedy even further which in a way spoils it. Evil Dead 2 is a horror with comedy element but Army Of Darkness is a comedy with horror elements which is about as scary as an episode of Hercules or Xena. Watch this and then Army Of Darkness and forget about the first one. Evil Dead 2 is fantastic in nearly every way and should be watched by anyone who remotely likes a bit of horror with a side dish of comedy. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead 2 Different.,"When I watched The Evil Dead I instantly fell in love with it. And when I was told there was a sequel I said ""Hell yeah gotta buy it!"" I put it in the DVD player and was instantly confused. It doesn't leave off with the first one. It tells a completely different story. The original started with five people heading toward a cabin in the woods. Then in this they dropped three of them. But that wasn't to bad. I could have lived with that until I began to notice Sam Raimi started to take more of a comedic approach toward this movie. In the first one it was grueling terror as said in the sub title. But in this one, it was as if they put the three stooges in a horror flick. Still a good movie, but was disappointed in the changes made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Groovy . . .""","When Ash (Bruce Campbell) decides to take his girlfriend, Linda, away for a romantic weekend he gets more than he bargained for. Upon playing a tape in the cabin they're staying at, Ash releases an unseen force which brings the forest to life – and his weekend to a halt.Sam Raimi, now with a bigger budget, decided to employ all the over the top effects he couldn't afford when he directed the original. This remake/sequel is as good as it gets for most horror aficionados, but many argue its existence was unnecessary. It's the film that started Sam Raimi's career and a step into Hollywood for Bruce Campbell's chin (inside joke).The first film was made on a shoe-string budget and quickly reached cult status due to its creative use of very little. The second had a lot to live up to and it's not hard to see why the team were happy to rehash it.Direction: 9/10 (Sam Raimi is hungry for it. You can see him forming as a director) Cinematography: 8/10 (Peter Deming really used every part of the budget to make it work) Editing: 9/10 (Fantastic combination of shots to over-animate the performances) Acting: 8/10 (Bruce Campbell is the capital B in B-Grade acting.

"Like the first, this has next to no plot., but it's one of the funnest movies I've ever seen.","The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy stays about the same each film in quality and entertainment, but as they go on each one is more silly than the last in seems. The first ""Evil Dead"" was funny in a morbid way. It had some very dark humor, and was more of a horror film than a comedy. This movie has many horror elements to it, including several jump scenes and a very creepy atmosphere, but this a comedy. People who take this as a horror movie will probably be disappointed, but most people it seems in the first few minutes will figure out that this is meant to be funny, not scary.To (sort of) retell what happened in the first film, the first 10 minutes of the film show a different but similar story as the first movie, including leaving off exactly where that one did. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is stuck in the woods in a cabin haunted with ""Deadite"" demons that possessed his girlfriend and caused him to dispose of her. The demons are brought to life through a professor's recording of the Book of the Dead, and the professor's and a few others end up in the cabin with Ash. Blood, guts and hilarity ensues.Some say this is a remake of the original, and it's not, though it is similar to the first. Both take place in the cabin, though this one obviously takes place right after the first. Where most sequels pale in comparison to the originals, this one was even better than the first. The special effects were amazing. The over the top direction and acting were hilarious, including one scene where a moose head in the cabin begins to laugh and it's obviously infectious because soon the whole cabin including Ash in uproariously laughing. Weird and funny creatures are around every corner, as are the one liners from Bruce Campbell that go with them. There's little plot, but that's a good thing here so we get to see more creatures. One problem in this is the ending. It's a great, though bizarre cliffhanger, so make sure to have a copy of ""Army of Darkness"" to pop in right after to pick up where this leaves off.Overall, this is a hilarious, sort of scary comedy/horror film that takes from many genres making it an extremely fresh film. It's probably the best of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most imaginative films ever,"I first came accross this film in a documentary on TV, and was desperate to see it. When I finally did I was definitely not disappointed and I have seen it many times since. It never gets boring because it is so eccentric, and I never fail to love watching it. It is both gruesome and hilarious, although it does get pretty painful at times. The special effects are fantastic, and the zombies are so evil and so entertaining, which is unlike most zombie films where they are, frankly, pretty boring. The bit where all the furniture and ornaments start laughing at Ash is probably my favourite bit, because it is so surreal. Bruce Campbell is just wonderful. He has a slightly cartoonish appearance which fits in with the whole feel of the film so perfectly.

"I liked it more than the first one, a lot more","The first Evil Dead was a stupid 70's horror movie.  If anyone else tries to tell you otherwise, don't believe them.  I'm not saying that I didn't like the movie, I like it a little.  I just thought it was a cleche 70's horror movie. It had original scenes, but the plot was stupid and unoriginal, and the dialog was just as cheesy as the 2nd movie.Now that I've said that, I'll talk about the second movie.  The movies have a lot in common, many of the same scenes from the first movie are remade in this film.  The big difference is that this movie is just as stupid, but it doesn't take itself seriously.  It's a comedy.  It's sort of a spoof of the first movie.  The first movie was serious, and tried to scare you, but this movie tries to make you laugh.  When you're watching this movie, try and keep a ""Pulp Fiction"" frame of mind: dark comedy with gory, unpleasant images.I'm not saying this movie is a hall of famer.  Not at all.  The plot is far too stupid and the dialog is far to awful to win any awards of any kind. Evil Dead 2 just as stupid as the first movie.  Only this movie has the balls to admit it, and LAUGH IN YOUR FACE!My only major problem with the movie is that they try to summarize (redue) Evil Dead One in the first few minutes.  And it sucks.  I wasn't too wild about the first movie, but this redue is awful.  It should have been cut out all together.

Have an open mind to appreciate this movie.,"In my opinion, you had to have grown up during the time a movie like this was made and have an open mind about the style intended. I enjoy reading positive reviews from younger people who are seeing them years later and have that appreciation of a time when you had to rely on practical effects (the lower the budget, the worse they were) and battles with the studios over content and very few options for ratings.I think practical effects are far more impressive, no matter the budget, when you had to use your imagination and your hands to create the effects. Though CGI can be impressive, it's still being programmed into a computer. I'd rather see someone's ""art"" in creating creatures and gruesome body parts than someone who created with CGI.This movie was meant to be cheesy and over the top, that's what makes it great. It was outside of the box and it grosses me out and makes me laugh at the same time. That deer head or when Ash ""fights"" with his own hand are classic. The copious amounts of blood is obscenely overdone but that's the point. It's as fake looking as it is because they were trying to avoid an X rating; didn't work so it's unrated and through ""Rosebud"" pictures.These types of movies aren't worth giving a crappy review on because it's redundant - of course it's a crappy movie, it's suppose to be. It's like bashing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" because the wires were showing or the daytime/nighttime changes in the same scenes. It's an extremely low budget trainwreck that you can NOT look away from. They are not meant to be thought provoking-cinematic masterpieces.They are simply light hearted - or heart ripping - campy fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not the original,"Why can't this movie be half as good as the first? I may be alone here, and that's fine, but this movie makes any low-budget B horror movie look professionally done.  For as good as the original was, this movie is as bad? I can understand if you missed the original, this may be entertaining... no, I can't understand.  This movie tries to be funny and scary, but succeeds at being neither.  Watch, rent, and buy the first one, but leave this one alone.  This movie is the definition of a ""set-up"" movie.  How can the director get from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Army of Darkness""?  Make a pathetic excuse of a movie to attempt to bridge the two.

Maybe the Best Horror Flick Ever Made,"Yes, absolutely. And yet it is so simple in its plot: Dumb, lovestruck teens venturing out to a cabin in the woods and awakening a dark evil, with decibels of screams and buckets of fake blood - some of it green, of course.But the devil is in the execution: Raimi has filmed a hell of a ride, an over-the-top, theatre-like extravanganza that leaves the audience exhausted and spent. All of the classical horror elements he brings are pushed to their grotesque maximas, without taking itself too seriously, which makes it a perfect balance of Lovecraftian horror and grim comedy.There is stop-motion in there, but what steals the show is the camera work, the way it moves and how one scene melts into one another. And also, Bruce Campbell, who bears half of the movie on his shoulders alone... thus became a fan legend.Rarely is the second iteration of a cinematic precedent is as good as its predecessor, but this isn't the case here, as this movie stand on an equal, if different footing than the original. The Evil Dead II (Death by Dawn) is an essential entry in every horror fan's filmography.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brutal, Bizarre, Unique and Hilariously Entertaining","'Evil Dead II' is the sequel Sam Raimi's debut horror masterpiece 'Evil Dead' from 1981. Although this sequel is more of a soft reboot than an actual follow-up, but that doesn't matter as this movie is one hell of a fun ride from start to finish. Reimagined to the point of mimicry and yet infused with a dark comedic style, this movie is like a twisted fever dream of insanity that's saturated with a mass amount of gore and bathed in a morbid atmosphere. This outing blasts you with an abundance of horrific moments in over-the-top antics until you're literally lost in a demented world where anything can happen.The Plot = Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) who along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) heads out into the woods to spend some time at a remote cabin. Once there they find an ancient book and a tape recording and after playing it, they accidently unleash evil spirits that takes possession of Linda and Ash is left alone to fight the demons, until another group arrives to the cabin and even more mayhem ensures.The movie manages to do what so few horror films can pull off successfully and that's blend comedy with horror thanks to its heightened sensibility and off the wall charm as a gory slapstick ride, you'll never forget. This is one of those rare breed of genre films that can make it happen. One of the many elements that makes this movie work is the performance by Bruce Campbell whose absolutely iconic in his legendary role of Ash Williams, he infuses a more physical comedic style to his role, which goes perfectly with the strange off-beat tone of the production and it totally works, he nails the perfect pitch between the comedy and horror elements and proves to be the real star of this brilliant outing.The other essential element that makes this movie work is the kinetic style of Sam Raimi's direction with its wild cinematography, supercharged tracking shots and impeccable visuals which gives a distinct and unique flavour to everything. This is one of my fave movies by him and its just an outstanding achievement in 80's horror.Overall 'Evil Dead II' is one of the most original, entertaining, brutal, and bizarre horror films of all-time of not just the 1980's but all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead II (7/10),"Considered by many, Evil Dead II is the most fan and critically received film in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. From my point of view, the sequel's big mistake was not adjusting the script to follow Part 1 with more fluidity. I get the fact that the movie rights weren't given to Raimi and the first half of Part II was a more simplified recap but there was seriously nothing wrong with the first Evil Dead, it was fantastic and no need rehash it. Picking up where the first film left off would have been a better way to go about it. Aside from that, the film exponentially gets better as it progresses. Raimi does a great job making the film more chilling with better makeup artistry and a well written script. It takes a certain taste to enjoy the Evil Dead movies, so take a chance and its likely you'll find yourself being a part of the huge cult following of Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovey - Bruce Campbell's fight for life!,"Sequel/remake of ""Evil Dead"" finds Bruce Campbell, one of cinema's most abused heroes, still battling those pesky demons, this time with the help of a hick, the hick's girlfriend, the daughter of the professor who unleashed the pesky demons, and the associate professor of the professor who unleashed the demons. Along the way Bruce exchanges his right hand for a chainsaw.I definitely liked this one better than the original, don't ask me why. Lots of stylized imagery and dark humor (severed hand gives former owner the finger) but no tree rape scenes.

One of the best movies of all time,"This movie takes the same plot as ""The Evil Dead,"" and delivers it with twice the amount of laughs and enjoyment. While the remake in the 2000s didn't try to overdo the Comedy elements in the movie, this one took it to the next level. The chainsaw arm scenes make this movie one-of-a-kind and one of the ultimate Horror movies of all time. While the first movie featured tree-root-rape, which detracted from the viewability, this one features miniature Bruce Campbells and a house full of laughing decorative ornaments which create insanity as well as entertainment beyond any expectations. The graphics from the first movie are only slightly updated, but that's all the edge this completely classic film needed to make the difference. By giving the zombies a Comedic element, it changed the script forever of zombie films and is completely non-replicated.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Really good!,"Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepy Evil Dead isn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre cliché right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-De-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great,"I liked the first Evil Dead and I finally manage to rent the second one. The whole debate on whether or not this is a sequel or a remake did create some confusion when watching, though, but afterwards IMDb gave some real answers though. Thank god for that site, huh?I was going to start the review by saying how much better Evil Dead II is story-wise, but since it's a sequel and all the inconsistencies in the beginning are there mostly to give a short recap, I can't really say that anymore. Instead I can say that while Evil Dead was mostly horror, ghosts and blood, Evil Dead II gives something new to the story, it gives lore. And for me, interesting lore is always a big plus. The audience wants to know more, they are intrigued.And luckily Evil Dead II is a wonderful introduction to the Army of Darkness, which is like a big promise on more lore and background to the movies.But pretty much whatever I said about the first movie goes here too. The cinematography is weird but interesting. Time is used effectively - movie is only 80 minutes long yet a lot manages to happen in that 80 minutes. The effects are completely awful but mostly they make creepy situations even creepier.In short, Evil Dead II may be a weird sequel but it gives something new to the story and I really want to see Army of Darkness already.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hail to the King (baby),"'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn' – is it a sequel? Is it a remake? The argument rages to this day. However, ultimately, who cares? It's awesome! Well... if you like seeing grown men screaming as they're repeatedly covered in a variety of different-coloured bodily fluids. Luckily, I do.Ignore the original 'Evil Dead' (yes, it was fun – for the time – but this one's head and shoulders over it when it comes to special effects, gore and characters). Whether Part II is a remake or sequel, it basically covers the entire of the first film in the opening ten minutes and then gathers steam from there. It is basically the original 'cabin-in-the-woods-movie.' So many times since we've seen a group of annoyingly-good looking teenagers head out to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, only to meet their end at the hands of something pretty nasty. But, back in Evil Dead/Evil Dead Part II's day – it was actually quite an original prospect – especially when it's done as well as this.Yes, the prospect of people being stuck in a remote location and hunted by someone out of this world isn't that revolutionary, but it's the way it's done here that makes 'Dead by Dawn' a classic. Here the hapless humans are hunted by, not just the undead, but the 'evil' dead. If you're unclear of the difference, the evil dead aren't just your run-of-the-mill zombies, but demons who just look like zombies, but are a hundred times more powerful and are completely insane.If the gore and general craziness of seeing a man fight his own (possessed) hand isn't enough for you to get you to watch this, you have Bruce Campbell as the central character, Ash. After this performance the B-movie world had a new cult hero who has gone on to not just star in the sequel, but countless computer games, comics and most recently a TV show. Basically, Ash is a chump – a stupid, sexist idiot who causes more problems than he actually gets round to solving. He is definitely not your average Hollywood hero – and the film is all the better for it.Ash makes Evil Dead. Evil Dead would just be another horror film without Ask. If you don't believe me – look into the remake of Evil Dead that completely omitted him (and I'm not counting the 'too-little-too-late' cameo at the end of the film). It was rubbish. Or rather it was just another horror film. If you like your horror films, B-movies, or just wise-cracking insane heroes battling even more crazy demons, give this one a go. It's groovy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes it's a better looking film but it somehow feels small, in terms of the pure scope and imagination of the first.

The only real difference is, better quality all round, a little more blood (well, you can never have too much blood) and a sublte movement of toungue, now pressed more firmly 'in cheek'. In summary: Bruce Campbell (King of Chin) screams a lot, comically falls over a lot, cuts off his hand and generally acts smoother than a frictionless-moleskin.

A classic horror film,"I haven't seen the original Evil Dead, so it's hard to know what to think of this film. But I really did enjoy it and consider it a classic horror film above most others. It also throws in a rare mixture of comedy to the boil, which contributes highly to my 7/10 rating.It is a VERY well-made horror film; fantastic camera-work, realistic blood and gore, and the actors chosen are perfect for their roles, especially the sexy young Bruce Campbell as Ash; although in this film, you are made to not care for the victims.Is it as genuinely frightening as films like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Ring""? No. Sometimes it is extremely scary, but the main aim is not to scare the living bejesus out of you like I've heard the first one did, but to make you laugh as well, and the result: it works better than I had ever imagined.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, and likes their horror movies extremely gory.

A slightly unnecessary but not unwelcome sequel,"So there I was thinking the first film was a bit bonkers... then along comes Evil Dead II.If you enjoyed the first one, then the second will give you everything you loved dialed up to 11. In some ways this is good and in some bad.It doesn't have the same horror feel as the first film due to the injection of more humour and slapstick elements, but it does deliver more action and more gore, and also a lot more 80s cheese (GROOVY!!). I think Evil Dead II is more self aware and leans into this in a joyous and carefree fashion which makes it very enjoyable.In terms of plot a lot of this film feels redundant as it is just retconning the first instalment and treading over the same ground. The plot points are largely the same, with some scenes and sequences practically replicating scenes from the first film. As with the first, there are also some very dated stop motion effects which are pretty jarring, but charming at the same time.I'm not quite sure why this is better reviewed on IMDb (at time of writing by 0.2 points) than the first film, as I think it was definitely worse and didn't really build off of the first film enough.

Instead of ash and his friends getting stuck in the cabin and attacked by the evil dead. Its only him and his girl friend who are attacked. With a quick re-write of the story at the beginning of the film, it then takes off into a hilarious ride of a movie. There's still lots of horror, gore and death to go around, but again the movie is more funny then anything.The main reason the film is good is because of Bruce Campbell.

What's worse, its special effects and production values are incredibly bad: obvious dolls as zombies, toy bridge and car for the early bridge scene, special effects which hardly look real for a moment.Add in some pretty bad acting and you should have an horrendously bad movie. However, it almost works.The amateurish nature of the production gives the movie a lightness and unintentional humour that keep you entertained. Plus there are some intentional funny moments. The movie could just as well be labeled a comedy as a zombie movie.Unfortunately, the humour doesn't quite negate the pitiful other aspects of the movie. The last few scenes involve the usual zombie vs human and supernatural crap and the movie ends in chaotic fashion.Good for a few laughs though.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
one helluva ride,"EVIL DEAD 2 is a cinematic rollercoaster that flies off the tracks and just keeps on going.

"""Who's laughing now?!""","(I just found out Raimi has authorized a re-make of ""Evil Dead"", which is what ""II"" essentially is. If a series is obviously not quite done, why stop, go back, and remake what you have already done. If Bruce Campbell is not available, leave Ashe alone! I am sick of ""do-overs""! It worked for ""Dawn of the Dead"", but not ""Texas Chainsaw"", and ""Shaun of the Dead"" was better than them both! EDII is a better film than ED, and I will never be convinced that you can re-make the first film better than the original re-make was done. Does that make any sense? Don't fix it if it ain't broke.) I originally saw this film in a theater(in Connecticut, when I was 17), and I will never forget how seriously I took the film, up until Ash has a laughing fit with every ""inanimate"" object in the room(the lamp is still my favorite). That was the day I realized there was more to horror than...well, horror. There is humor, however dark; there is anguish, no matter how badly acted(here I refer to the first film); and there is something quite amusing about a hand that gushes gallons of blood.

Brief appraisal of my favourite film,"Don't be fooled by the title, this is no dumb slasher film. Evil Dead II combines Sam Raimi's trademark style with some of the funniest moments ever seen in a ""horror"" movie. While the familiar ""camera chasing people through the forest"" filming technique is remarkably good at building tension, some of the most horrific scenes in the film may actually make you laugh out loud. You'll root for the hero as problem after problem is heaped on him, but you'll never want to be in his shoes!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Join us...!,"Want to see some movie with a bunch of friends? Look no further - this movie is just perfect. The Evil Dead II is a half re-make and half a second part. The beginning is almost the same as in part one - the main character (Ash) is driving with his girlfriend to a cottage. He finds a tape-recorder, plays the tape, and through the voice recorded on the tape wakes up the dark powers drowsing in the forest. Because of strange accidents and coincidences - a couple of people get to the cottage and the killing may begin. The hut turns into a slaughter house, fingering hands get nailed by shotguns, girlfriends' heads get cut off by spades, blood spills in outrageous streams and you laugh your brains out. The unbelievably funny violence is served with grace and lightness. Finally - Ash becomes a real hero with a sawn-off shotgun and a chain-saw - Duke Nukem of the eighties. It all ends kind of surprisingly and I really don't want to spoil the surprise, so I won't tell you how. So - just go get get it and don't take it seriously...you will be entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Comical remake of the best horror movie of the 80s.,"When you have to describe this film in one sentence it's like this: Evil Dead part 1 where 50% of the gore is replaces by hilarious slapstick and one-liners.Yes, it's more of a black comedy with some nasty gore than all out splatter like the first movie. You can't take a movie seriously in which a sawed off hand gives it's former owner the bird. It's almost as if the writers of ""the Naked gun"" dropped by for a visit.Almost a replica of the original, the story follows the same road as in the first. Ash drives to a cabin in the woods with a new girlfriend, accidentally brings the demons back to this world and hell breaks loose again, only to make the movie become one big joke. First of all, it's totally incomprehensible why Ash would even THINK about setting foot in a cabin again, let alone willingly speak out the lines that would bring out some evil force. Did he suffer from amnesia after what happened to him the first time? It's almost as if Sam Raimi, the director said: ""ignore the first movie, and start with this, then go see Army of darkness"".If his intention was to make a comic book like horrormovie, he succeeded. The brilliant photography is almost another spirit as it races through the woods, tilts and spins.Bruce Campbell is fantastic as an anti-hero, especially when spitting out one-liners. However, never is this movie scary or shocking as the first movie, and that's always what i go for when watching a horror movie. As a spoof it's hilarious, as horror it's only average. However it's still an extremely entertaining and brilliantly shot film, so personally i'll give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Slick and stylish -- a perfect Christmas movie.,"What would Halloween be without ghouls, phantasms, or Bruce Campbell? The Evil Dead series has a fanatic following akin to The Rocky Horror Picture Show and UHF. In the spirit of all cult picks, it has its own idioms and terminology. Evil Dead was scary, but Evil Dead II with its over-the-top gore and a sense of humor, which is sorely lacking from most horror films, became an underground classic and turned its leading character Bruce Campbell into a cult hero. Think of Night of the Living Dead meets the Three Stooges.Ash (Bruce) takes his girlfriend up to a deserted cabin. What harm could there be in borrowing a place for the night? However, evil incantations are said and his fiancée becomes one of the living-impaired. He is forced to dispose of her and in the meantime is attacked by a powerful force that lives in the woods. For the better part of the film, the phantasm is never seen. We see through its eyes as it follows Ash knocking down trees or trying to break through doors. This is always a good approach to horror, because the fear of the unknown and not showing the specter right away is psychologically more terrifying. It is very effective and frugal for low-budget films. In most horror films the creature seems silly and the audience's fear is taken away.Later in the film, we get the superfluous humans who come to the cabin to find out what happened to dear-old archeologist dad. He wrote them that he had found the Necronomican (sp?) -- the book of the dead. Now these friends and family of this archeologist are going to be fodder for the apparition. They will be turned into 'deadities', the living impaired, so that Ash can dispose of them in interesting and shocking ways. Ash has to live to see the sun light or he will be dead by dawn.What sets this film apart from others in its genre is style and humor. In one scene, Ash's hand is possessed and he has to cut it off or the hand will do him in. After he lobs it off with a chainsaw and it escapes its imprisonment from a pail covered by the book, Hemingway's Farewell to Arms, it runs amok like an evil Thing from The Adam's Family. This scene is played off like a Three Stooges skit and the possessed hand alludes to Dr. Strangelove.Try to find all of the movie's allusions. The many horror ones are obvious -- all of George Romero's films, several unknown B-films, the original Evil Dead, and mucho, mucho mas. Now try to find all of the Scorsese allusions.I like this film on a multi-faceted level. Bruce's performance is an understatement of panache and ruggedness. The over-the-top gore is done with stylistic humor. The humor helps the more squeamish viewers. The direction of Sam Raimi is quite good. The sequel Army of Darkness is a good movie too. This film is entertaining to watch and not just around Halloween. Just watch it with the lights off and a chainsaw next to you.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Roller Coaster Ride,"Evil Dead 2 was once again directed by Sam Raimi and it's supposedly a sequel to the original The Evil Dead, although I see this film as more of a remake of the original with a bigger budget and a different goal. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite films of all time, it's a film that took many chances and I respect Raimi for going through hell to create that project. Evil Dead 2 had about 10 times the budget of the original film, so is it good?For the most part, I really like Evil Dead 2. It's a completely different film than the first one. The first one was actually trying to be creepy and campy. This one is a straight-up slapstick comedy with horror and gore elements in it. And it really works. For me, the first minutes of the film that are focused entirely on Ash are just as good or even better than the original. And for me, that's saying something. I know a lot of people prefer this over the original film and I can definitely see why. Ash becomes the iconic character people have grown to love and the film is just hilarious and crazy. Some things don't make any sense at all, but it's established by the tone of the film that it doesn't matter. However I do think this is a flawed movie, at least for me. And yes, I do prefer the first movie in the franchise and I'll explain why.Ash is one of the coolest characters in movie history. He's funny and delivers some of the best One-Liners ever. Every second of the film he's in frame is gold. However, the film deviates into this subplot of other people getting in the cabin with Ash and for me personally, I don't like any of them. To the extent where I just want them to die, quickly. If the entire movie focused entirely on Ash, it would have been great. Instead, when these people reach the cabin, some of the focus is taken off him and it just hurts the movie for me. Also, in Evil Dead 2 there are many jump scares that seem to be there for the sake of being jump scares. In the original there were some, but they all felt earned and they came when the movie needed them. Here, they're just all over the place.In my opinion, Evil Dead 2 feels more than a roller coaster ride than a movie. It's crazy, the gore is ludicrous and nothing really makes sense. Again, these are positives. However, I do believe the movie should have been entirely about Ash and they should have brought down the jump scares. But again, the costumes and makeup are amazing and the effects are great. The ending also pretty much sums up how insane this movie is. It's a flawed movie, but an entertaining and enjoyable one. Funny as hell, too. It's worth your time.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
one of the greatest horror/comedy films of all time,"This is bar-none one of my favorite movies as well as a truly satisfying piece of entertainment. This time around, in addition to terror, Raimi showcase his comedic genius as well. This is one of the few movies I've seen besides the Godfather II, and Aliens and Terminator 2 where the sequel was superior to an original that wasn't half bad. Bruce Campbell is amazing as Ash, and gives a wonderful performances as the square-jawed hero. This is similar in tone to the darkly comedic Roger Corman/Vincent Price collaborations based on Poe's stories such as Masque of the Red Death except, arguably, better. Raimi uses some great camera techniques similar to the ones in his first movie (the good old strap a board to a camera and run technique was pretty much invented by Raimi). The special effects are great too. A absolute must see for horror movie buffs and those with a strong stomach and a dark sense of humor, as well as anyone who's ever read a comic book (Raimi's visual style and the manichean notions of good/evil are heavily influenced by that). The only cons to the film are its basically a remake of the first film with the newly introduced comedic overtones (so some might feel like theyre watching the same movie) and a larger budget. Quite honestly, the first film was scarier since it lacked comic relief. While not for those with weak stomachs, and despite similarities to the first film, Evil Dead II still comes extremely recommended. Tons of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An absolutely excellent follow-up to Evil Dead!,"I have to say that this is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. Bruce Campbell gives one of the finest and funniest performances i've seen. The film's constant movement from one horrific happening to the next leaves you wondering how Campbell's Ash retains any threads of his sanity. Even when it's just him in the cabin dealing with a variety of gruelling experiences Campbell gives every scene his all, filling them with a strange mix of disgust and humour. The scene where Ash has the entire room laughing at him (including the furniture!) has to be one of my favourite bits, it's almost as if Campbell himself has finally lost it. Raimi's direction is superb, I love the rushing camera movements and angles. This is a great film which relentlessly throws comedy, horror and gore at you (and Campbell) in vast quantities. If you're looking for something which will entertain you, scare you, and gross you out at the same time then this is definitely the film for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

the cinematic equivalent of noodles,"Cult films are a funny group of films, some receive that status due to being so bad that they are actually good, other are just iconic and memorable, and you can always have films that started movements in either fashion or culture. If Evil Dead 2 is any of the above it would be the second one - iconic and memorable - due to the moments that are created throughout the film, moments such as 'groovy', ash having a fight with his hand, the camera on the end of a stick, there are loads. But for all the iconic moments, is this example of cult cinema actually any good? Well here's the funny thing - I appreciated the tension and the progression of the plot, the comedy and the scares (however wafer thin), I enjoyed it all. But at the same time I didn't really enjoy it, it felt as though there was something missing. Now maybe, now I've grown up a bit cinematically since I last seen it, so its references and its nuances don't thrill me in the same way that they once did? I don't know.

Overdone,"Ash and his girlfriend Linda head to a remote secluded cabin and soon upset a bunch of demons when they decide to play a mysterious tape recording left by a professor whom is nowhere to be seen. Soon Ash finds himself in a desperate battle with the undead, but he soon unwittingly gains some assistance from an unknown quartet...I liked the first Evil Dead film and sort of think of it as a 'rough diamond' - it wasn't perfect, but sparkled at certain moments. Unfortunately, this sequel just didn't do much for me I'm afraid...In order not to be too negative, I'll try and get some of the positives out of the way first; for starters, this film is fast-paced...very fast paced... in fact it's very much in your face from the get-go. For this reason, the film is superficially entertaining and thanks to its frantic pacing it is never dull or boring.Now let's look at the negatives; well the narrative isn't quite as well developed this time around, there isn't the camaraderie or dynamic between the characters that existed in the first film. The undead are even more ridiculous now; I get that Raimi went more down the comedy route with this sequel and whilst it may have worked in the 80's the whole thing is just too whacked out and silly to take serious today. I wouldn't have minded the zaniness if it was funny or the horror if it was scary, but ED 2 doesn't really achieve either and to be honest I found it a little bit embarrassing to watch.ED 2 ups the ante and is far more overblown than the original, but as I've said before sometimes a 'less is more approach' is needed and for me this was quite a ridiculous film that fails in almost every area (the only reason it gets a 4 is because it covered its 90 minutes fairly quickly).",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

I feel like someone just walked over my grave.,"Somewhere between a remake and a sequel, we have Evil Dead II. It is interesting how this movie has divided many horror fans. Some don't like the comedy aspects of the film, and some of us seem to feel that it fits in pretty well with the over the top nature of the story. I am one of the latter horror fans. Let's face it, the first movie was a great horror movie, but how much more could you do with it? Would you rather see a sequel in which Bruce Campbell is attacked by demons for an hour and a half? Sam Raimi did a great job coming up with ways to keep it all fresh, and the comedy was one of those innovations. All that said... I still like the first movie better.One thing that part II does better than part I is the character development. The characters are a lot more personality driven in this installment. Hats off especially to Dan Hicks for the greatest redneck role ever captured on film. I'd love to see him in something else.While there are shortcomings here, this one still makes it into my top 10 list (along with part one).A final note: If you've seen part I and then see part II but don't like the comedy angle... don't see Army of Darkness because you'll hate it.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

There wasn't a clever pun or a clever twist that subtly pokes fun at the horror film industry in the entire movie.To add to it all, the low budget effects, acting, everything. I like plenty of ""cult"" films: ""Buckaroo Banzai"", ""Last Action Hero"", ""Monthy Python and the Holy Grail"", ""The Blue Brothers"", because I realize that bad can become good, if it's campy and kind of fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.

Another Case of Cabin Fever,"Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell reunite for this ""follow-up"" to the goriffic hit EVIL DEAD.

We get more sophisticated special effects, including a hand with a mind of its own (one of the BEST scenes in any horror movie). If one word could describe this movie it would be GONZO. The violence can be repulsive at first, but suddenly turns a bit cartoonish and you end up looking at some twisted cross between a George A.

Interesting Special Effects but Wildly Overrated,"Personally I like the original Evil Dead which was a bit scarier since it was less ridiculous, and I also like the 2013 Evil Dead remake even more. This cult film is exactly that - a cult film. It is outrageously overrated for what it is. Evil Dead II doesn't cultivate any particular sense of atmosphere and the characters are all caricatures who barely make any sense.The ""country couple"" doesn't match - it's some toothless middle aged goon with a hot redneck girl, maybe that's supposed to be one of the jokes...? And the alleged humor just isn't funny. If anything, Evil Dead II is rather disturbing in its weirdness. I can see this film scaring kids under 14 because of how trippy and weird the special effects are. The entire film feels like the world's worst acid trip, and that is not a compliment.The element of dark nature and folklore which would have otherwise made this a decent folk horror film are all overshadowed by the excessive attention shown to the monsters and their destruction. I do not believe for a second that nature is attacking anyone, though the 2013 Fede Alvarez film somehow used all of these elements correctly, and actually made them interesting and scary.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Iconic,"Groovy. - every other Evil Dead 2 review quoteThe beginning of the movie confused me so much I kept thinking about it through the whole movie. Later I watched Bruce Campbell's explanation on Youtube and couldn't believe how ridiculous the whole story is ( they couldn't get the rights to their own movie LMAO). Anyway, I liked the first one more because it was more serious and scarier for me. That one guy who threw pages was so annoying.

Groovy. Groovy Movie.,"I saw this the other night in a theater full of people who applauded and laughed and cheered at every line.

For example, there are multiple pretty effective jump scares, and also multiple really effective laughs.Sam Raimi's directing skills shine and it makes me think about how much the Daniels (directors of ""Everything Everywhere All At Once) were probably inspired by them
It makes me want to watch ""Army of Darkness"".Also, by the way, when Bruce Campbell says, ""Groovy"" I couldn't help but think, ""This is cinema.""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
good horror-comedy,Though Army of Darkness (Evil Dead 3) was an action-comedy the first two films are horror-comedy. Ash and his girlfriend Linda stay the night at a cabin that belongs to an archeologist who was studying the book of the dead. The evil that was awoken by the book kills Linda and several humorous attempts to take out Ash. Ash troubles increase when a group of people comes to the cabin one of which is the daughter of the archeologist. The film makes good use of creepy and funny elements to tell its story. The setting of the story is set up well and the film gets right down to business instead of dragging along. Funny of use the blood splashing all over the place especially the face. Lessons Learned: Dead people look like walking rubber from a distance. Trees can leave their places so they can attack cabins. Trees have faces well sort of.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you expect a horror, you're likely to be disappointed, and if you expect a comedy too... but...","There are very mixed opinions about this movie I see, some trash it cos it's not a real horror, others say (well, 'write' actually) the jokes are pretty weak (and not even real jokes, after all) and so it does not even work as a comedy. Many others, on the contrary, are enthusiastic about it. Well, IMHO, the deal here is just to understand what this stuff really is, and if I had to describe it in one word I'd say it is ""grotesque"". Don't focus your attention on the horrific elements, not either on the funny elements, but rather on the total weirdness of the whole. Yes, this movie is a gem of weirdness, it's a caricature of a horror movie; it exaggerates the stereotypes of that genre, therefore ridiculizing them (but not necessarily presenting them as plain funny).The first one of the series I saw was... well, the last: ""Army of Darkness"", and I really enjoyed it as a comedy, so I managed to see this one, thinking it was pretty similar and guess what? I was disappointed 'cause I considered it more of a horror flick than of a comedy. Then I read the comments here and realized that for many other guys happened the opposite thing: they saw the 1st Evil Dead, enjoyed it as a horror, and expected this sequel to be something similar, but they were disappointed 'cause to them this looked more like... a comedy.What's the moral of this rigmarole of mine then? Here is: if you're looking for a horror movie get rather the first Evil Dead, and if you're looking for a comedy get rather Army Of Darkness; ED2 falls in between but nevertheless it got its own appeal, with its odd moments and weird hysterical characters (Yeah, Ash rules, but what about the witch in the cellar?). If tragi-comic, absurd and grotesque situations charm you this is definitely worth a go.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bruce Campbell shines in the best terror movie of all times!!,"After the succeed with Evil Dead I, Sam Raimi had to prepare a sequel as soon as possible. Five years after ""The Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn"" appeared with a great expectation.One curious point is that the film is not a continuation of the ""Evil Dead"". It's a remake of the story, quite changed but still the same base. Instead of being a pure frightening horror movie, Sam Raimi included the comical part of the action. And with the performance of Bruce ""The Master"" Campbell, the movie became an incredible success.The combination of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi has created one of the best terror movies of all history. Evil Dead was the first and the best, Evil Dead II improved several things from the first of the saga, and the ""Army of Darkness"" concluded the Evil Dead Trilogy with a film full of adventure and less horror.But, in my opinion, Evil Dead II is the best of the three, because it's frightening & funny at the same time, Campbell rocks in the film with his outstanding performance, and the effects are very original and well-done for a non-commercial production.Just say that Evil Dead II is a must see for everyone who likes the horror genre!! 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

WOW,"I first heard of the EVIL DEAD series when I saw a review of one of the new DVDs last year. I searched the IMDB for more info and got it, telling myself, ""You gotta see these movies.""

He told me they were pretty good, and so I finally got to the local Movie Gallery(ED1 was out at Blockbuster) and watched them over a weekend in December. They blew me away. Evil Dead II stood out, however. I don't know if it was because of the style it was shot, the humor, action, horror, or what, but EDII had quickly become my favorite movie. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are my heroes, and I watch the DVD( a must for anyone) almost weekly. This movie is the definitive movie for casual, obsessed, etc. fans everywhere.

It's gotten better!,"My favorite movie in the entire series is ""Army Of Darkness"", but it's great to look back at these movies and see how they got better with every single entry. I keep hearing that AOD was the one that was quoted the most, but I'm fairly certain this is the one that's the most well known. It's so funny because I've seen so many brief clips from this movie before. Whether it's Ash's hand hitting himself with the dishes, the final scene, or the laughing furniture, it was just great to see all this stuff put together! Thank you for letting me know more about pop culture!It does have a few flaws in that it is hard to put together with the first film. Of course, I don't care because the end result is so awesome. I am really impressed by the special effects in this. Normally, I don't care for stop motion because it always seems to stick out in a live-action film. This actually did it rather well. I'm not sure if stop motion counts as practical effects. There's a lot of good creativity with the monster designs. It's great to see the series become wackier and bigger as time goes on, all leading up to my favorite entry at the end. I have now seen every movie in the original series. The characters are pretty likable and Ash is as good as ever. It's great to see a horror movie series where the most recurring character is actually the good guy. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ashe, his character name, is by far one of the best heroes of all time, who else could battle dead lovers and monsters as creative as what Sam Raimi, the king of Zena and Hercules, could come up with.

Best of all, the good guys all die!The second... well, even Bruce once said that they went the wrong direction with it and it didn't work.  Instead of a horror, we're given a slapstick comedy.  Scenes seems to happen because they wanted to, and it's UNfunny.What a waste.  My wife was interested in seeing this movie becaused she was suprised how good the first was, but she left after 10 minutes, and I finished it.  After it was done I had NO intention of watching the third movie because from the little I saw it was done in the same style.If you like the first one, that bears nothing on the second.  They are compeletly different styles of movies.I can't really make a recomondation because some like it, some don't.  You won't know until you try.

It also features well done stop motion animation in some parts. The characters are also very likeable, especially Ash.

The story basically takes off where the first film left us, but this time the director and all his crew manage the perfect balance between comedy and gore/horror.

Combined with Raimi's unique camera angles, moving shots and great sense for directing this creates a creepy yet hilarious ambiance which doesn't disappear until the very end of the movie. The backup characters are all really funny and typically dumb, and all the monsters costumes and make-up are perfect.

Best of the Trilogy,"First and foremost, I want to say as a horror fan and a person who is intense with details, Evil Dead II is not a remake. Yes, Evil Dead II did take a lot of things from the original but that should not be taken as a negative. Most sequels from its originals do not stick with the formula, making the sequel not as enjoyable. When someone thinks of the best sequels, nobody can give you more than Terminator 2 or Godfather Part II. Evil Dead II fits in on the list. Bruce Campbell breaks out and shows his heroism in this movie. He is on the offensive, not the defensive like the original. With this in mind, it is clear that the spook appeal is gone from the original. Even with this said, Evil Dead II still contains the occasional jump-out-of-your-seat thrills.My suggestion is to not come into this movie thinking you will be scared out of your wits like the first one. Evil Dead II is rather a joke on the movie and horror itself, than a Halloween or Friday the 13th film that never seems to lighten up. Sit down and watch Evil Dead II for the enjoyment. The ratings for this film do not lie- IT IS THE BETTER EVIL DEAD movie. In wake of the Spider-man sequel coming out soon, you should not be worried. This movie is a good reminder that Raimi can pull of a better sequel that matches or surpasses the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Groovy,"Ash takes his girlfriend to a secluded cabin in the woods for a romantic getaway but after listening to a suspicious tape recording they find themselves targeted and trapped in the forest by an ancient, demonic spirit.A pseudo sequel / reboot of the original Evil Dead from 6 years earlier, Evil Dead is just as scary but a lot more humorous in its story telling. I'm not a horror movie buff by any means but when I was younger, Evil Dead 2, was one of the few horror films I somewhat liked. I remember seeing Army of Darkness (Evil Dead 3) long before Evil Dead 2 and initially I was disappointed because it was a completely different type of film ... Army of Darkness was a medieval action film with horror elements whereas Evil Dead 2 was just an outright horror (or so I thought when i was a teen). I liked the makeup effects and the whole ""Book of the Dead"" backstory but otherwise I only intially watched it to better understand Army of Darkness which I loved. I watched a 4K remaster recently and the transfer was so clear and colourful it really improved the film. Not only that but it's funny, like really funny! I never noticed when I was younger the amount of absurdity and slapstick alongside the scary makeup and sound effects. It all intertwines so perfectly and to top it off, Bruce Campbell gives the performance of his career. I have a lot of favourite scenes, the whole film really! Although SOME of the stop motion effects are looking dated now, it adds to atmosphere and I've always found stop motion scarier than some more recent CGI effects. One thing this film doesn't quite have over the original is a good opening set-up. Ash and his girlfriend arrive at the cabin and then straight away they're attacked by this unseen spirit... if you've seen Evil Dead 1 you will know what's happening but if you haven't, I can see it being a bit jarring and confusing for a few minutes.Final Verdict:
I highly recommend this film to not just horror fans but film buffs in general. It will have you laughing just as much as you squirm but it's a very unique movie. Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash Williams is one for the ages!

I would say this film is a remake of the original rather than a sequel. The makeup and effects are fantastic throughout the film, i actually think part 2 was better than the first, the same as Aliens was better than Alien. There are not many horrors out there, especially the 80's type, where the sequel was better than the first. The story line is very similar to the first film but more detail and depth is incorporated into part 2. The gore level is pretty good, i think sadly some scenes may of been cut or removed before video release, but still there are a good few demons and demonic creatures popping up throughout the film.

There's no other way to put it: this isn't clever, its ridiculous! Its so too much it hurts your eyes!Same here, if not quite as bad. Raimi has a bigger budget this time, so he decides to throw away all the credibility of the original. Like the worst sequels, he takes it that because there was a first movie, then absolutely no buildup is necessary in this one: we can have zombies within the first ten minutes, people cutting up their girlfriends and hardly seeming surprised, etc. There's just no lead-in! Maybe at a drive-in, but even there your audience aren't laughing with you, they're laughing at you.Clearly Raimi and I have different ideas of what makes entertainment: this, to me, is just too ridiculous. Its like watching a horror movie do standup comedy. Its just constant riffing, a collection of sketches, not a cohesive movie. If that's your thing, check this out. For me:5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I'll swallow your soul!"" ""Swallow this!""","Sam Raimi and company meld horror and humour in this one-of-a-kind, lively sequel to the ""original experience in gruelling terror"". They know very well that sometimes when things are simply insane, all you can do is laugh. They begin by recapping the first movie, although they have to tell the story differently, not being able to obtain the rights to use archive footage. Then they launch into one of the most uproarious assaults on the senses that genre fans will ever see. Written by Raimi and fellow filmmaker Scott Spiegel, it has a delightfully over the top nature yet stops short of winking at the audience (the actors play everything very straight, as well they should). Basically, this is as fun as the genre can get.When poor, poor Ash (Bruce Campbell, now a co-producer as well) is nearly drowned in blood, or what looks to be ink, or whatever, it's impossible not to chortle. And Raimi continues to pay tribute to slapstick comedy with the films' most memorable sequence, in which Ash is victimized by his own possessed hand.One has to hand it to Campbell; this guy is one hell of a good sport, putting up with a lot as Raimi & co. Set up to abuse him as much as possible. He's flying through trees, landing in puddles, being tortured physically and mentally, yet somehow he gets through it all. Here he's also starting to show signs of the character he would become in ""Army of Darkness"". The new cast members acquit themselves well, and some of them get roughed up pretty badly, too: Sarah Berry is Annie, daughter of the professor who started the whole mess in the first place, Dan Hicks is scruffy rube Jake, Kassie Wesley DePaiva his girl Bobby Joe, and Sam's younger brother Ted is a riot as the possessed version of Annie's dear old mom.Indicative of the nature of the film is when an eyeball pops out of a witches' head and flies right into Bobby Joes' mouth, not to mention the moment when objects in the cabin, including a lamp, laugh their asses off. Elements such as grasping trees and the ""Force"" p.o.v. Cam return, and the special effects are pretty damn amusing, especially the ""Rotten Apple Head"" we see towards the end of the film. As in the first ""Evil Dead"", we do get some valleys in between the various peaks, but things do build nicely towards an energetic finale.The ending, paving the way for ""Army of Darkness"", is pretty ingenious and features a cameo by none other than Sam himself. That hilarious poster promises a great time for the audience, and delivers on that promise.A comedy-horror classic.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Possibly the Best in the Genre,"After making the mistake of going to a cabin in the woods in ""Evil Dead"", Ash Williams returns to the same cabin in the woods for ""Evil Dead II"" (although there is dispute whether this should be considered a sequel or a remake). When the evil dead are awakened by the incantations from the Necronomicon, only Ash has the sheer audacity to try and stop them from taking over the world.This film does not have the best special effects ever, relying heavily on stop-motion animation and odd camera angles. The acting is more than a little campy. The plot is thin, particularly since it is a rehash of the first film. The action is a little bit silly. And for a horror film, it has virtually no swearing or nudity and much of the blood is not even red.But still, a great many people consider this the greatest horror film of all time (with all due respect to ""Jaws"") and I consider it easily in the top ten of horror films (Internet Movie Database ranks it 45th). Even Roger Ebert, notorious anti-horror, gives it three out of four stars. And here is why.This film shows what can be achieved with little money and a big imagination. Backwards filming, stop-motion animation, puppetry. Modern directors would rather use computers than rely on trick shots, but this film shows that costumes and Jell-O can go a long way. I am so sick of ""scary movies"" that try to scare me with some futuristic cartoon. Why not give me blood, gore and have fun while doing it? Could any film have been more fun than this?The plot: a man and his girlfriend stay in a cabin and unleash the spirits of evil which can only be stopped with a careful reading of an ancient book. The same exact plot as ""Evil Dead"", this is basically a remake with a bigger budget with an injection of slapstick comedy and the removal of a crucial rape scene. (I understand why the rape scene was removed, but this was the most memorable part of the first film and it is strange they would neuter their bigger film.)Sometimes the camera shots go too far. Sam Raimi likes some strange angles (see ""Intruder"") and he likes to use the zoom button on some weird objects a few too many times (though this gag is taken even further in ""Army of Darkness""). The first twenty minutes has by far the most strange camera shots you will see in almost any film, and more than in the rest of the movie combined. People new to the film might find this overbearing. Heck, even I do not completely get it.What works here is that we have all the Raimi regulars, who offer that perfect chemistry. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who are rarely far apart, offer some of the finest films in the past few decades. But do not forget co-writer Scott Spiegel, who also wrote ""Intruder"" and is a long-time Raimi associate (and played a great wandering minstrel for ""2001 Maniacs""). Ted Raimi, Sam's brother, is a must for any good Raimi film (although his solo work, like ""Skinner"", is sometimes lacking).And do not ever count out Danny Hicks, the redneck trouble-maker in this film (""Jake""). He has been with them for ""Intruder"", ""Maniac Cop"", ""2001 Maniacs"", ""Darkman"" and the upcoming ""My Name is Bruce"". Hicks is probably the most unsung of the troupe, and hardly deserves that backseat reputation. Hicks met Raimi on this film and has been with him ever since, and I can speak from personal experience when I say he goes out of his way to promote love for the horror genre.When it comes down to brass tacks, this group works because the point here is to have fun... and because that is what horror is to me, fun. Fun with chainsaws. And if horror is fun, this film is one of the best horror films the world has to offer. How that ends up getting a guy the ""Spider-Man"" franchise is beyond me. But as the tagline says: ""Kiss Your Nerves Goodbye"", and also your worries, too, if you need a good laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Arguably Invented The GenreStill The One To Beat,"An Unrestrained Sam Raimi Directs this Sequel as if He has lost His Marbles. This is on purpose of course, because the Self-Reflective and Genre Satire is nothing Less than an Original Take that has become a Staple in the Horror/Comedy.

Dancing with the devil,"THE HORROR FILM. Ok, subjective, and under the influence of being an 80s/90s horror kid. But an absolute pearl in any case in the shocker biz, which is not infrequently run by dilettantes, especially today. In the remake, Raimi adds a pinch of humour to the concept of the first film and, even more importantly, a huge ladle of cinematic art. The result is a masterpiece in picture and sound, which, despite the higher but still low budget compared to the first, never seems cheap, like, for example, the often juxtaposed Braindead. Where many films have a few iconic sequences, this one has countless, which means: this classic can be watched over and over again without wear and tear.P. S.: a great Bruce Campbell in the role of his life!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Follow-up to a Low Budget Classic,"This follow-up to the low budget masterpiece brings more comedy to add to the horror. The mythology of The Evil Dead also grows. I got the chance to check this film out in the theater for my most recent viewing to revise this review. The official synopsis of this film is the lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holes up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack.Now I know there is a lot of speculation about this film. My interpretation of it is that since they could not get the rights to use footage from the original film, they just decided to give us a recap sans Ash's (Bruce Campbell) sister and the other couple from the original film. This one just has him and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) going to the cabin. Everything that happens the morning after the original night is the beginning of this film technically. It does violate continuity and after this last viewing it actually bothered me more. Example is the Necronomicon is burned at the end of the first film, so it really shouldn't be here.I do happen to love that the film then starts to build on the mythology from the Necronomicon and the demons. I originally thought that the new part that the demons die by dawn was violating continuity, but after viewing this it doesn't. I like the concept that they are bound to the darkness. The one question I have here though would do the words that bring them to life need to be spoken each night or would have come back when the dark does every time. Ash plays the words the first night he gets there, but we know that they were spoken when the professor was there with his wife. I do just think that that was the film showing us that, but they would have come regardless.For the story of this film, there are some issues I have that came from the original one. Like what constitutes some people to get possessed and others that don't, but I do feel that this one is a little bit better about it. I also like that this one builds on the story with bringing more pages of the Necronomicon so they can actually have a shot at defeating the evil that is after them. As stated, this one actually is conscious of the comedy and definitely uses it to its advantage. I actually think it adds something to the film since Ash has his moments where he is descending into madness and the comedy actually makes it that much more real. There is some slapstick during the fight scenes with the Deadites, but I don't think that hurts the film at all.Now the editing of the film is good. The film builds tension throughout. It introduces things around the midway point that makes you wonder if anyone will make it out alive and at the climax it does all come to a head. I thought the film ends in a solid way, building to the next film. I love how it actually plays out in the end.The acting in this film is much better than the previous one. We get more from Campbell as he starts to become the Ash that we know and love. You can tell that from the original to this one he is honing his craft. I thought Sarah Berry as the professor's daughter was good. She is cute, but believable as an archeologist. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley DePaiva were great as the redneck couple. It is crazy because DePaiva is also really pretty, but has enough country to be believable in the role. I also have to give a shout-out to Ted Raimi, younger brother of writer and director Sam Raimi. Ted appears as Possessed Henrietta and the suit he wore made him sweat enough to fill buckets. Plus the contacts when they were in you couldn't see out of them. He is one of the scariest parts of the movie and it was great.Effects of the film were really good as well. This film had more of a budget, but they stuck with the practical effects. Part of that was probably the time the film came out, but I thought they were still great. The blood looked good. I thought it was interesting that they changed the color of it sometimes to prevent an X rating, but I think it works, especially when it comes to someone who is possessed. Now I will say there are some things with possessed Linda that don't look great. It doesn't ruin the film, but I noticed them. This also applies for Possessed Henrietta and other Deadites at the end of the film.The sound design of the film was good also. The score definitely helps to enhance the scenes by building the tension. I also thought the voices of those that are possessed were good. It comes off as creepy and even after a few viewings of the film makes me feel uneasy. The haunting melody that Ash plays in the beginning of the film recurs a couple of times and I thought it fit for what they needed. That is definitely something that is a positive for the film.Now with that said, this film is great. I love that this is a sequel, but it actually took what made the first one great and added on it. I still prefer the original to it, but this one deserves to be in the conversation. This one adds comedy, yet it doesn't hurt the film. I thought the acting was much better. The story is good and the editing help to build the tension needed to a satisfying climax. I do have some issues with violating the continuity though. The effects were great aside some issues with the movements of a character. Sound design was also really good as well. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing as I feel it is a great sequel to a horror classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sequel/Remake ups the comedy and makes a hilarious and scary cabin-in-the-woods classic,"Picking up right after the event of the first film, following a quick recap using new footage since the filmmakers couldn't use footage from the first film, ""Evil Dead 2"" the picks up with a new group of disparate characters trapped in a cabin in the woods that's under attack by the titular deadites and hope to survive the night with the lone survivor of the first film, Ash Williams. Although the film is a continuation, the story is essentially a remake of the first film, but with a bigger budget, better special effects, and better actors. The key players return for the sequel, notably director/co-writer Sam Raimi and lead actor Bruce Campbell as Ash, both much more polished at this point in their careers. Filmed seven years after the original, Raimi had directed the bigger budgeted Coen Brother scripted comedy ""Crimewave"" and Campbell had three films under his belt (including an appearance in ""Crimewave""). Two other talented folks who joined the sequel. One was cinematographer Peter Deming, his first film, who'd go on to become Raimi's regular DP as well as going on to shoot major films such as ""Twin Peaks"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and ""From Hell"". The other major addition this sequel was special effects artists Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman, and Greg Nicotero, who following their work on ""Evil Dead 2"" formed KNB EFX, who have done everything from ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to ""The Walking Dead"" to ""Reservoir Dogs"" to ""Misery"". Beyond the film being superior to the original on a technical level, it's much funnier far more clever than the original. The dancing stop motion skeleton doing a Fred Astaire-like dance, Ash doing battle with his own severed hand, or this hilarious ending that sets things up for a wonderfully absurd sequel all make this film a very cheeky take on horror film tropes. Campbell really ups his comedy chops for this sequel, particularly when it comes to some very funny slapstick bits involving his hand ""turning bad"" and his mock heroic moments (which he'd go one to perfect in the third film in the series). The practical special effects and the complete absences of CGI offers old school horror fans a lot of nostalgia and retro charm as well, particularly director Sam Raimi's brother, Ted Raimi, as the Possessed Henrietta in the torn hag suit. Those are the parts everyone remembers about ""Evil Dead II"" but the sexy tobacco chewing Bobby Joe, played by Kassie Wesley, is a lot of fun, as is her hillbilly boyfriend Jake, played by Dan Hicks. Interestingly, Bobby Joe was inspired by Holly Hunter, who was a roommate of Raimi in the 80s along with Joel Coen and Frances McDormand. He wrote the part for Hunter, but producers overruled him and wanted someone ""sexier"". Overall, ""Evil Dead II"" is a classic. It's more openly comedic than the first film, but still manages to be scary and is a rollercoaster of fun, even if it is absolute fluff. FUN FACT! When Kurt Russell first met Bruce Campbell on the set of ""Escape from L.A."" the first think he said to Bruce was, ""Say 'work shed'"".",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

more entertaining than the first; a great party flick,"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, distinguishes itself from the original in that this time the hero Ash (the unmistakable, often hysterically funny hero of the Evil Dead trilogy, Bruce Campbell) isn't the last one on the line in the kind of unique, nearly art-film (not to scare off people, I mean more like WAY low-budget) horror-filled treatise on the teenagers-down-to-one. This time, Ash is like the hero of a Saturday afternoon matinée special or updated drive-in flick that's been allowed by the censors to show whatever's inside the creator(s). Sam Raimi, the mad genius behind this trilogy and films like A Simple Plan, The Gift, and the recent Spiderman 1 & 2, doesn't keep his material high and dry for too long. In fact, not much is too low-brow in the horror book. He pulls almost every trick out of this book, so the speak, to get the audience into a shocked, but (with the proper sense of humor) amused mood at the lengths the 'curse' will take Ash and the other visitors.And from a film-making standpoint (this is aside from the fact that the story's a clever send-off of tongue-in-cheek, ultra-violent Italian horror films), it's all bravura thanks to the great make-up and special effects. Two of the fx crew, Greg Nicotero and Robert Kurtzman, made this as their official, outstanding proving grounds before heading off to start KNB effects, which has worked on array of action and horror films. And always there's a cruel, if totally and timely un-realistic turn waiting for Ash and the others, as Raimi and co-writer Spiegel maintain the zombies and such. The highlights include the little hand that could (provided by Nicotero), a ""mother"" laid to rest in a fruit cellar, and a flock of trees awaiting in the forest outside the cabin (which, for me, was more frightening and disturbing when done in the first film).Aside from the onslaught of ridiculousness, and rebellion against being embraced by any mainstream audience, it's something of an acquired taste. Though it's gained a hefty cult following, and rightfully so, you show this to any random audience of today and the effect may be the same as when it first came out - some will love it, and some may almost puke or walk out. But it's the kind of film, like the first as well as the wonderful Army of Darkness, that displays Raimi's inspired talents with a lens, and it grows on you. Not to mention, it makes a fine old party movie with friends; it's the work of a real comedic talent, not just of a sensational stylist.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Evil Dead 2 brings comedy and horror together and makes it work on so many levels.Now, it does start of differently and has a different story, I heard because Sam couldn't reserve the rights to the original story.

Slapstick horror classic,"This particular movie is my favourite of the entire Evil Dead trilogy. It's a slap-stick horror-comedy classic! The first movie didn't impress me much because it was over-hyped when I was in high-school, and I didn't find it as horrific as it was made out to be. In fact, I tended to view the first movie less than scary for having monsters in it that reminded me of muppets!Anyway, this movie continues the plot of the first movie-the dire consequences that ensue when the notorious Tibetan Book of the Dead is read aloud, namely, the unleashing of lots of demons intent on killing humans.This movie contains some paradoxical time travel scenarios, which is most enjoyable.The hero of the movie has some great scenes involving parts of his body being possessed and how he goes about defeating the demon possessing him. It is riotously funny!If the first movie in this trilogy was a muppet horror movie, the second was pure slap-stick comedy and mind-bending plot-lines. The last movie in this trilogy I tend to remember as being like one of those matinée sword and sandal epics-like ""Jason and the Argonauts"". Really, three movies, yet three different genres.For the second movie, get together with some mates, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the strangeness and silliness that ensues.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true grindhouse movie!,"About the time Spider-Man 2 was about to hit theaters in the summer of 2004, not only did I started watching the first film on DVD but also wanted to experiment Sam Raimi's other features. I was at a dollar store where I saw the widescreen version of Evil Dead II sitting around in a case where I bought the film and became both entertained and interested in more of Raimi's work.Evil Dead II is the sequel to the infamous Evil Dead where Ash (Bruce Campbell) drives off to the woods with his girlfriend to get a little action until an evil spirit manages to possess Ash's sweetheart turning her into a monster. He kills her before realizing that the cabin is haunted where in some scenes he'll be possessed into a demon monster forcing him to chop his own hand off. Other characters from a babe scientist and her husband and a pair of locals go to the house to discover that something evil is in the house and discover what's going on before it's too late and they're all dead.The film is both scary and funny, but the special effects make it truly realistic where an NC-17 rating was almost added unless the blood wasn't red on all scenes. Even for an early Sam Raimi movie, I love how Bruce Campbell manages to blend in humor and seriousness at the same time where I couldn't help myself but laugh, especially the way Raimi likes to torture his actors.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best movie in the history of the universe.,"I wasn't able to get into the Evil Dead trilogy at first because I watched them all out of order. I was put off by the over the top juvenile humor in Army of Darkness, but I now realize it was just an extension of what Sam Raimi was perfecting here. This is an awesome black comedy featuring some of the sickest slapstick I've ever seen in a movie, and loads of dry humor (example: horrible demonic noises start coming from behind a bedroom door. Girl points to door and says, ""It's in there"").The first half is basically a one-man comedy show starring the amazingly talented Bruce Campbell, who makes an idiot redneck into one of the most memorable movie heroes ever. In fact, when other people finally reach the cabin, it slows the whole thing down. That's my only complaint: the movie is too long. It would have worked better as a short. For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version). I'm not watching this to see a damn search party, for heaven's sake, I'm watching it to see Bruce Campbell fighting off possessed body parts with a chainsaw and saying things like, ""You're going down!""If your idea of a good movie is black humor combined with old-fashioned slapstick, this is the movie for you. It's a shame Sam Raimi abandoned stuff like this to make trendy crap. I'd rather watch insanity like ""Evil Dead 2"" than the Spiderman movies any day. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Little creepy yet very laughable.,"When I first show this movie, I was confused with why did some stuff change from the first and why is it all goofy. I did some research to realize it was basically a ""requel""(a remake sequel) because the movie was own by a different company and the ratings for this movie change. I did look back at the movie and see what it was trying to be and I like Sam Raimi's style.The atmosphere of this movie is horrific and goofy at the same time, which I think works for this movie since the first movie was corny as well, but very gruesome. Bruce Campbell back as Ash goes through a lot of torture in this film which makes him lose his mind in a funny. Mostly of the movie is funny but relates understandable by going over the top. I think most people like this movie so much is because of the story and with Sam Raimi's campy element, it makes it more like a dark humor.Some people will hate this style of the movie, but going back the first film it did the same thing just more embrace. The movie tries to be scary in the funny way and that's fine because that's is what it's going for. Creepy but funny. Heck, there are some effects that are some effects in this movie that are visible to see and you can tell this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously.

"""Swallow This!""","After a brief prologue that serves as half remake, half re-cap, ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" continues the unfortunate adventures of Ash (Bruce Campbell) and the demons that inhabit the cabin he once shared with his friends. Much more stylized and over-the-top than it's predecessor, ""Evil Dead 2"" is certainly not for everyone. However, if you've seen enough horror movies in your day and can recognize and appreciate pure entertainment when you see it, you'll have a blast with this sequel.What is normally sacrilege for horror movies is a gift here. Forsaking a conventional plot, ""Evil Dead 2"" instead delivers shock after shock topped with mountains of gore, so much so that if it were real, any sane person would start vomiting. By the time we're well into the second act, the cabin is wall to wall with blood and the first film has officially been outdone. Don't be mistaken, however; this movie is not just gore for the sake of gore. It's always there to serve a punchline and to further stimulate the over-caffeinated vibe the movie has going for it. And if you thought the first movie was brutal, brace yourself, because its sequel doubles up on just about everything. To describe what happens in this movie doesn't do it justice. Hell, no mind-altering substance known to man can compete with ""Evil Dead 2""!Returning to his signature role, Campbell plays Ash quite differently than in the first film. Becoming the anti-hero, Ash whips out quotable line after quotable line, becoming an instant fan-boy favorite. Along with an ever-resilient Campbell, director Sam Raimi is back in the saddle and he's letting loose. For whatever reason, it seems like Raimi has more artistic confidence and less pressure and, in turn, delivers one of the purest, most unbridled horror film of the 80's. ""Evil Dead 2"" plays almost as a gift to horror fans who had become complacent and grown tired of the typical slasher fare of the 80's. Almost as an oasis of the genre, it's a movie that you can come to time and time again when you're not in the mood for anything in particular, but know you want to have a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pleasant Valley,"People are always groaning about Hollywood's tired practice of churning out weak sequels to popular movie to make a few bucks. Well, I contend that not all sequels suck- in fact, a few even improve upon the originals, like the classic ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"".Technically, I suppose ""Evil Dead 2"" is more of a remake of ""The Evil Dead"" than a real sequel, as it starts out from a fresh beginning with one returning character, the amazing Ash (as played by the amazing Bruce Campbell). Ash ends up trapped in the woods by an unseen demonic force that turns his traveling companions into laughing, maniacal ghouls. For most of the movie Campbell pulls off a one man show, fighting the possessed house, his girlfriend's severed head, even his own hand in an amazing performance full of slapstick and character. Eventually more characters show up, including a love interest for Ash who sports some of the ugliest socks I've ever seen.This is an amazing, one of a kind movie. It is relentlessly clever, throwing one great idea after another on screen (the only disappointment is the final, climactic appearance of the demon, which isn't very scary). It's got way more personality than the first one, as well as better make-up and a great sense of humor.The Ash character appeared in another movie after this, ""Army of Darkness"" which is a totally different kind of movie than this  (a comedy/adventure set in medieval times), but still recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Groovy Sequel!,"""Evil Dead II"" (1987) significantly improves upon ""The Evil Dead"" (1981), in regards to the cinematography, pacing, fear factor, fight choreography, practical effects, script writing, and the ever present danger of the horror villains from the previous movie.Sam Raimi once again crafts creative scares, this time with a slightly larger setting to work with, making more use of the forest that surrounds the cabin to complement the tension of scenes filmed in the cabin, which remains one of the most recognizable settings in any horror franchise. His unique combination of horror, action, and comedy gives this movie a feel that is on the border between horror that is goofy and serious.Bruce Campbell is at his best here, putting a lot of relatable personality and incredible charisma in Ash Williams, making the character iconic. Having a singular main character actually serves the story really well, making every experience of the character easily felt by the viewer.Overall, ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) is easily one of the best horror movie sequels ever made, taking what worked in the first movie and improving upon them significantly.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your time,"I'll keep this short and sweet....if you are a TRUE horror fan, don't waste your time nor money on this sequel.  The first Evil Dead is a classic, this sequel was, well, like watching Married with Children.  Horror mixed with humor does not work.  I mean, the wasted time in this flick on the possessed hand that he cant escape from?  Too much.  Definitely not a horror movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nothing more than simply ""entertaining""","Evil Dead II is one of my favorite movies but not for the quality of the movie necessarily.  Surely not for the acting and storyline.  People that tear it to pieces don't realize what was put into it, what movies were out at the time, and really don't have an understanding for what goes into low-budget cinema.  People that are in love with Evil Dead II have an undying appreciation for what is in the movie.  If you're looking for Oscar quality acting, you won't find it here, but the directing is amazing, and it's hilarious.  There's a reason they used green blood (MPAA), you can see the set and strings if you look hard enough, and Bruce Campbell is one of the best overactors in the biz (next to Jeffery Combs).  If you haven't seen it, check it out, just because everyone should, just know what it is ahead of time.  It's in my opinion, one of the most ""ENTERTAINING"" movies of all time.  It never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The goriest horror comedy of the 80's!,"Meanwhile ""The Evil Dead"" was a goriest but serious film, this sequel/remake is a goriest comedy horror film. I laughed a lot and I was scared too, the film locations and the cinematography are really creepy ones. Bruce Campbell is a great actor playing Ash again. The supporting cast is great too. Fear and laughs with great special make up effects and gore. Masterpiece! Sam Raimi is a master.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definition of a cult classic,"Evil Dead II is a great flick. It has the creepy haunting horror aspects, the jump out of your seat scenes, plenty of gore for those who need it, and loads of comedy.Sam Raimey really captures the feeling of seclusion in and around the cabin. One of the great things about the movie is that the 'monster' is't the zombies as much as it is the intangible evil spirit.There are spots where the effects can be cheesy but it actually adds to the films charm. The characters are great as well: The Daughter of the archaeologist and her preppy boyfriend, the backwoods hillbilly and his charming girlfriend. Then there is Ash. Its worth seeing for Ash's one liners alone.I love how the house in the woods looks like it has 3 rooms from the outside but when ash is running through it there is like 20 rooms. I found this to be an improved upon remake of the first Evil Dead.Enjoy",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Evil Dead II (1987) More money, more quality","After a very interesting first film, the sequel to Evil Dead seems to be trying to change some events from the previous film, but this does not interfere with the experience at all. Now, with more money, the second film manages to expand this universe a little more and create a much more violent film, but at the same time, funnier. The way they manage to mix horror and comedy works very well and this is undoubtedly the greatest success of the film. Bruce Campbell manages to make a very good character and certainly one of the most memorable in horror. It is clear that the quality is superior to the first film because of the money, since it is possible to notice a great advance in the makeup. This sequel managed to surpass the first film and create one of the most memorable in history.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely brilliant horror comedy,"Those of you who think that this is a sequal to the Evil Dead are very much mistaken. Before watching this you should discard all knowledge of the original otherwise the plot is nonsensical.The hero once again is Ash (Bruce Campbell), the setting once again is the cabin in the woods (see what I mean? why go back somewhere your friends were killed?).Ash takes his new girlfriend to the cabin for the weekend and as you can guess the forces of evil are summoned, just like in the original. Unlike the original, more characters are introduced later in the film, rather than have all the characters introduced at the start and picked off one by one.This method allows for some extremely funny moments involving Ash battling not only the evil alone, but his own hand (watch the movie and you will see what I mean).Once the new characters are introduced the comic element of the film fades away, and apart from a few brilliant and incredibly timed one-liners the film reverts to the gore-based orientation of the first.I have to say that this film is more of a remake of the first than a sequal. But the film is funny and will satisfy horror fans. It is one of the few films that knows when to stop the comedy and resort to the horror, which many films have tried but few have pulled off successfully.And the events of this film lead up nicely to the Evil Dead's true sequal, Medieval Dead - Army Of Darkness.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great and funniest remake-sequel,"If you saw the first Evil Dead, you found a gory experience, and a bit disturbing (at least, I did). But, in this sequel, Ash, the starring character, comes back to the damn cabin from the first movie, and does everything as if nothing ever happens. So, he discovers (again) the tape recorder, they listen the translation from the Necronomicon Ex Mortes, and (Have I said ""again"" before?) AGAIN they summons the Evil Spirit from the Woods. But, the black humor, the terror some times, the performance of Bruce Campbell (as well as the rest of the cast) is awesome. And much more, if we see that these movies are make with a very low budget... well, there are masterpieces. There are great funny scenes (like the ""posessed hand"" waiting for Ash to reload the shotgun), huge bloody scenes (like Ash cutting his own hand and blood literally covering his face) and a little primitive FX, but well handled, which makes this movies (THREE of them) real classics, and, from my point of view, real CULT MOVIES.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
No-holds-barred...,"This time around, Sam Raimi throws in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink. It's an odd mix, bloody horror and slapstick humor (see Charlie Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR, in particular the scene where a man is lynched from a lightpost, and you'll understand what I'm getting at here). Not that it can't be done, of course; we've seen it done, and done well, in movies like THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.;  but it was more than a little strange to walk into a theater to see the sequel to one of the spookiest shoestring-budget shockers of all time, THE EVIL DEAD, and find oneself laughing one's head off. Money changes everything. Raimi indulges himself (to the point of overindulgence), and yuck follows yick in this no-holds-barred assault on the senses. Although I prefer my horror straight, I'm also able to laugh when the opportunity presents itself, and Raimi kept me laughing throughout this one. EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN qualifies as an immensely ENTERTAINING film, but I'm not sure if I'd classify it in any way as a ""horror"" film (in title only, perhaps)...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
GROOVY!,"This is movie is a blend of 80s campiness, slapstick, and fun gore that makes it, in my opinion, the best horror comedy to date. Fair warning: it's pretty gross and low budget, and I know people that hate this movie. If you are a fan of any other movies in this series, you'll think this one is amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very entertaining horror movie.,"I can't fully rationalize why I think Evil Dead II is the weakest of the original three, but even then, it's not far behind The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. It's wonderfully in between the two tonally and genre-wise, blending comedy and horror well while the original keeps things generally horror-focused and the third movie is a fantasy/comedy movie that's basically horror-free.The others appeal to me a little more for their very different reasons, but Evil Dead II is great for giving a bit of both in one very well-balanced movie. I watched it this time around with a very funny commentary track (have got to write about it soon), so that might've made me come away this time around feeling more of the humor than the horror.But watched without the commentary, this is also seriously good stuff. I'd still rank it third for all the entries in the original trilogy, but I can understand why some would call it the overall best - it delivers all you'd want from the Evil Dead series in one film, and I do hope the future movies in the series (likely without Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell's involvement, but a guy can dream) eventually turn back towards the goofier side of things eventually.(Complete tangent and a perhaps unpopular opinion, but I do also feel this way about the Japanese Godzilla films - Shin Godzilla was creepy and satirical, but still generally serious, and Minus One was quite intense/dramatic. Both of those two films are very good, but we haven't had a live-action Japanese Godzilla movie featuring him beating up other monsters in almost 20 years, and I'm ready for it).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite of the trilogy,"Evil Dead 2 is the best in the series for me as it has the best combined elements of the original as well as Army Of Darkness. The pace is quicker , the overall quality of the pictures is better as the budget is bigger and Bruce Campbell has matured as an actor and had more experience acting between Evil Dead 1 and 2 . There are more elaborate f/x and visually the film looks better across the board. There also is the introduction of splatstick comedy but stays on target with the horror by maintaining an unsettling , brooding atmosphere . Lots of splatter and gore and a great blend of horror and comedy . I love all 3 Evil Dead films , but Dead By Dawn is my personal fave. As well as one of my favorite tracks from the 1st Deicide album.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Evil Dead 2"" - A Hilarious and Terrifying Horror Comedy","""Evil Dead 2"" is a remarkable sequel that significantly amplifies the humor compared to its predecessor. With a rating of 9/10, the film masterfully balances horror and comedy, offering audiences an unforgettable experience.The story picks up some time after the events of the first film and once again follows protagonist Ash as he confronts the demons and spirits of the forest. Director Sam Raimi skillfully infuses dark humor and a series of bizarre and absurd scenes to create a unique atmosphere that elicits both laughter and fear.The humor in ""Evil Dead 2"" ranges from slapstick moments to clever wordplay and exaggerated reactions from the characters. This approach adds a distinctive dynamic to the film, setting it apart from other horror movies. However, the comedy serves not only as an entertaining element but also as a counterbalance to the demonic threat, resulting in an intriguing interplay of tension and humor.The performances are solid, with Bruce Campbell once again shining as Ash, showcasing his comedic talent. His ability to embody both the seriousness of the situation and the humorous aspect of the story makes him a charismatic character that the audience can easily connect with.Visually, ""Evil Dead 2"" offers a blend of impressive practical effects and creative camera angles. The detailed design of the demonic creatures and the exaggerated violence provide the necessary shock and thrills, while the dynamic camera work captures the energy and madness of the film.It is important to note that ""Evil Dead 2"" may not appeal to everyone's taste. The emphasis on humor and the stylized portrayal of horror may deter those expecting a more serious and chilling film. However, it is precisely this unique blend of horror and comedy that makes the movie so entertaining and distinctive.With its successful use of humor, convincing performances, and impressive visual effects, ""Evil Dead 2"" deserves a rating of 9/10. For fans of the original film and enthusiasts of horror-comedies, this movie is an absolute highlight that captures the spirit of the original while forging new paths.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfectly balanced gore and comedy...,"Serving as a sort of remake, sort of sequel to the original Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2 condenses a revised version of the original film into the first act, before taking the end of the previous film and expanding it into an absolutely ridiculous and slapstick gore fest, with Ash just trying to survive the night.Ash and his girlfriend Linda go to a cabin retreat in the middle of nowhere (sans their 3 friends), and find a recording of an archeologist who had recorded himself chanting passages from the book of the dead. Playing this back awakens an ancient evil, which possesses Linda - and what ensures is probably one of the greatest comedy/horrors ever put to celluloid.I liked the Evil Dead, but its shoestring budget and obviously inexperienced makers held it back. Evil Dead 2, I think its fair to say, is probably the film they wished they could have made in the first place. It has a much bigger budget, much better effects, a better script... and the addition of intentional comedy makes it stand out among the sea of other 80's horror films that take place in a cabin in the woods. Bruce Campbell is great as Ash here, and its a good job too as his character pretty much carries this whole film. Even the ending is a bizarre little scenario which has you simultaneously going ""what the ****"" while also wondering how any potential sequel may work.All in all, Evil Dead 2 is great fun. It's silly yet disgusting, campy yet well made, funny yet horrifying.... and in my opinion is easily the best film in this series.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Great Follow Up To The First Film,"Evil Dead 2 is a follow up to the first film, but at times feels like a slight retelling due to the recap of the first film not being exactly how it happened originally (due to them not being able to obtain the rights to use footage from the first film). The horror is still there, but this time with a good amount of humor infused too. I feel that the humor did work and makes the film a lot of fun, even though personally I wasn't falling out of my seat laughing. Bruce Campbell's performance is much cheesier in this one, but it makes you love his character. I actually think I enjoyed this film more than the first. While the first is a great horror movie, this one is just so much fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slapstick horror at its finest!,"The sequel to ""The Evil Dead"" has arrived in ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn!"" The plot is practically the same; Ash is attacked, his girlfriend killed and everyone else gets slaughtered...is that a spoiler? Nah, because this is what Evil Dead films are...a showcase for Bruce Campbell to get the s*** knocked out of him! So even though the formula is the same, how is this film so much fun, and perhaps, arguably, better than the original? Well, the budget has been anted up from ten bucks to fifty bucks and the film, unlike the original which tried harder to be an actual horror movie, is a laugh riot! Albeit dark humor, there are several scenes with Ash losing his sanity before our eyes that are just hilarious. If there was one drawback: not enough gore. But all in all, ED2 is great entertainment that has plenty of awesome camera angles, great one-liners, a severed hand, and touches of horror and comedy mixed to perfection! Thank you Sam Raimi, Bob Tapert and Bruce Campbell.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A look through the eyes of a truly insane man,"This is my theory on Evil Dead 2. I believe the whole, or most of the movie is told from an insane killer's perspective. Looking at life through the eyes of a nutball. A demented man thinks zombies are killing his friends. When in actuality he's doing it. When he finally figures out that he is responsible for at least one of those murders he says a book made him do it. He buries the bodies of his victims and continues on in his demented little world. He does thing and sees things only a truly truly insane person would. Would a sane man cut off his own hand? Would a sane man see bookshelves and clocks laughing at him. Would a sane man think that little versions of himself are out to kill him. Ash is obviously a paranoid delusional schizophrenic with suicidal tendencies. Sam Raimi slyly makes it look as though Ash believes all this is happening to him but in actuality he is probably a loner cabin dweller gone off the deep end. But it's really violent and really really really funny. #24 on my top 100.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just as demented and crazy as it's predecessor,"Heading off to a cabin in the woods, the reading of a demonic book unleashes a horde of vicious demons that plague a man and others that arrive there looking to translate the work forcing them all to fend off the beings.This one is easily among the top films in the genre. What works so well for this one is that there's far more emphasis on this one being unbelievably funny and hysterical as its utilizing physical slapstick comedy to do it's terrorizing and torture, resulting in this one containing numerous side-splitting gags. The possessed-hand material is superb slapstick comedy, from it striking him in the head with plates and grabbing at his face while the scenes of him hunting the disarticulated hand around the cabin are hilarious, Ash being tormented by the baying laughter and howling from the stuffed animals and furniture in the room and the over-the-top reaction to the situation by dumping gallons of blood from minor wounds. As well, there's tons of times here involving him tripping and stumbling over something, beating himself into the walls or with furniture to dislodge something stuck to him or puts on numerous factional distortions that are all quite hilarious. Still, beyond the hilarity this is still first and foremost a horror film so there's a lot of big scenes here that go for the chills and jumps quite effectively, from the opening battle with the possessed girlfriend in the woods and the ensuing POV chase through the woods into the cabin, a great battle with the reanimated body and the series of attacks down in the cellar all provide plenty of that. The finale is where all the best action is, as the possessed individuals become much more bold and daring in tormenting the remaining survivors, the humor gets dropped and the pace quickens substantially which not only highlights the nearly flaws-less make-up on the possessed, deformities and wounds as well as the fantastic finale that mixes some rather impressive action alongside the black magic workings featured here which makes this one all the more fun. There's really only one area here that holds this down which is the clumsy way this brings everyone together, letting him stay there along for a long period of time and sloppily bringing the group in later on. The cutaways don't do much and makes it seem like forever before they get there. As well, especially early in the movie, not a whole lot made sense. One character is possessed by the creatures, and remains so for the early part of the movie, then all of a sudden, in the middle it disappears and never comes up again. It's weird that something that powerful could be gone just that easily. Otherwise, there's not much this one gets wrong.Rated X/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sequels rarely come any better than this,"Evil Dead 2 is one of those very rare films - a sequel that surpasses the original. Where the original film was a straight ahead horror flick, this one adds comedy to the mix. In different hands such a move would prove disastrous, with both the horror diluted and the comedy not funny enough. But comedy-horror is probably the sub-genre that ultimately suits Sam Raimi's sensibility best. His kinetic direction, fast paced editing and reservoir of inventive ideas are put to their best use with the addition of comedy. While star Bruce Campbell turns in a truly hilarious star-making performance as the hero Ash. His knockabout acting style is something of a revelation here. Both men peak in this movie.It's technically a sequel, with events from the first film recapped in the early scenes. Once Ash is picked up by an unseen force and propelled through the forest we are at the point just after the first movie ended. To be honest though, it feels more like a remake than a sequel. A lot of important details are dropped from the first movie, such as the two other companions. But whatever way you want to look at it Evil Dead 2 benefits from the higher budget at Raimi's disposal. The make-up is rather good and there are better special effects throughout.Where it really scores though is in its brilliant combination of genuine horror with proper laughs. There are many scenes of pulse-pounding tension, there's a horrific hag in the cellar and loads of bloody splatter violence; this is offset with moments of inspired comedy mayhem such as the possessed hand or the demented laughter scene. There are many individual moments of originality sprinkled throughout though. Campbell is a real asset here; he understands the nature of the role perfectly. He's not just a great physical actor but also delivers numerous funny lines right on the button.The Evil Dead 2 is a triumphant combination of slapstick and over-the-top horror. You can't take it serious of course. It's like a gory comic-strip come to life. It's a movie that deserves being called a cult film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Too much blood and too many plasticine ghouls are not scary at all. naive FXs add to general misery and make the whole affair a real comedy stick. Campbell is OK, and he is very funny, even when using his chainsaw. But the whole movie is a just a cheap video as if to some 80's song a la Thriller. Monsters? Funny and unconvincing. Horrors? Nope, none of that. Suspense? Hardly ever. Fear? No, smiles all around. Some films do not stand the test of time, this is a typical example. I know, the 3 rd part was a pure comedy/parody.

Groovy!,"Evil Dead II (1987) is not only the best movie of the Evil Dead Franchise, not only is it the best movie in Sam Raimi's filmography, it is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.Positives for Evil Dead II (1987):
This movie takes everything that I love about the first Evil Dead movie and it cranks it up to 100. In this movie, Ash Williams becomes the horror icon that we all know and love from this franchise and that is all because of the performance by Bruce Campbell. Campbell takes the generic final guy from the first movie and makes him a total badass, hell he has a chainsaw as a hand in this movie. The side characters in this movie are more interesting than the ones from the original. The gory and blood is even more shlocky and more over the top, there's even green and blue blood in this movie. The Deadites in this movie are even more crazier and more terrifying in this movie. This movie also adds some comedy into the mix and it works perfectly. And finally, this movie ends in an insane way that perfectly sets up Army of Darkness (1992).Overall, Evil Dead II (1987) is everything that I would want from a sequel and it absolutely delivers in that department.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very similar to the original, but still great entertainment.","The opening of Evil Dead II consists of mostly a montage of shots of the Necrinomicon 'the Book of the Dead' and a spoken narration that goes, ""legend has it it was written by the dark one, Necrinomicon Ex Mortis roughly translated Book of the Dead. The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond, it was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared."" Ashley 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are traveling by car deep into some woods to a remote mountain cabin. After some brief romantic shenanigans Ash finds a tape player. He decides to have a listen, the tape recording was made by the cabins owner Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks). He talks of traveling to a an ancient castle and discovering the Book of the Dead. Professor Knowby continues and explains that the Book of the Dead spoke about passageways to another world and contains demon resurrection incantations. Ash continues to listen, Professor Knowby begins to translate aloud the incantations which awake the evil spirits within the woods. All of a sudden Ash hears the sound of breaking glass and when he investigates he finds Linda has disappeared. Ash goes outside and starts to look for her, she turns up and is possessed. She attacks Ash but he chops her head off with a shovel. Ash buries Linda and quickly finds out he is trapped as the bridge he used to get to the cabin has been destroyed. He heads back to the cabin where he must try and survive to the morning and the safety of the sunlight. Meanwhile Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry) Professor Knowby's daughter and Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have landed at a nearby airport with the missing pages from the Book of the Dead and decide to head straight for the cabin. They soon find out that the bridge has been destroyed but hire Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva as Kassie Wesley) to show them to the cabin via a trail through the woods. Once there they find the cabin in a bad state, blood on the floors, a blood stained chainsaw, no sign of Annie's parents and Ash covered in blood holding a shotgun. They lock him in the fruit cellar. As the night draws on it becomes apparent that Ash isn't alone in the cellar and as the group start to be reduced in number by the evil spirits the survivors start to realize that the woods contain evil that wants to kill them all, Dead by Dawn! They must try to find a way to defeat the evil and try and save themselves. Co-written and again directed by Sam Raimi with a much improved budget, who like the original has a small cameo at the end as a medieval soldier. This is another great film, again full of cool camera tricks and angles and memorable sequences, it's no surprise Raimi has gone onto great success in Hollywood with Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004). The script by Raimi and Scott Spiegel moves like a rocket, just the way it should but I couldn't help thinking it was a little too similar to the original, in fact I'd sooner call this a remake rather than a direct sequel. Lots of great scenes and cool one liners in this, like when Ash puts Linda's decapitated head into a vice and tightens it up, as Linda's head laughs and taunts Ash he points at it and says ""your going down!"" just before Linda's headless body bursts into the work shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw. Or when Ash is looking at himself in a mirror after he had just killed Linda and says ""fine"" his reflection suddenly jumps out, grabs him and says ""I don't think so, we just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw, does that sound fine?!"", the shot ends with Ash's reflection strangling the real Ash but the camera zooms out to reveal Ash's own hands around his throat. A sequence where the possessed Linda is dancing as her body spins around independently of her decapitated head, which remains in the same position looking towards Ash throughout the spin. A funny sequence where Ash's own possessed hand beats himself up, smashing plates and bottles over his head and punching himself in the stomach! Ash goes onto cut his hand off with a chainsaw and puts a bucket over his still alive possessed hand and puts some books on it, one of which is Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms! A really nice touch of black humor. Or the getting tooled up scene in the work shed where Ash fixes the chainsaw to his wrist and saws the barrel of his shotgun off after which the camera zooms in on his face and he quips ""groovy!"". A short dialogue scene where Ash thinks he heard a noise in a bedroom and wanting to take a look he says ""we'll all go in together"" to which Jake answers ""hell no! Your the curious one"". Or the shots of a stag's head over the fireplace that comes alive, turns to Ash and starts to laugh at him, and a rocking chair in the corner of the room that starts to creepily rock on it's own. Again Raimi goes overboard with the 'dead cam' point-of-view shots, and continuous unbroken shots where the evil spirits follow Ash around the cabin breaking doors down and the like, I could probably carry on but hopefully you get the idea. Acting is much improved over the original and Campbell is still great as Ash. The effects are also much better this time around, according to the booklet supplied with my DVD no less than three FX groups were brought together to make Evil Dead II work. Having said that rather disappointingly there isn't much on screen gore. When anything graphic is supposed to be happening it's usually off screen or rather tame, Ash's hand amputation is off screen, when Ash kills Linda it's in shadow, when he kills 'Evil Ed' with an axe it's mostly off screen, Bobby Joe's death isn't seen and Jake death is just a ridiculous amount of spurting blood from cellar that looks like red water. Some of the effects look dodgy particularly the stop motion animation and living severed hand sequences. The ending in which the evil is turned into a physical being I thought was a bit over ambitious and a turned out a little flat. Overall another great film, I was just a bit disappointed by the restrained gore and violence when compared to the original, by comparison in the original when Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and her headless body falls on him, a large amount of blood from the wound squirts out all over his face. In the sequel when Ash decapitates Linda there is not a single drop of blood spilt and when Ash dismembers 'Evil Ed' when his blood splashes over the walls it's green and looks more like washing up liquid. However, I highly recommend it to horror fans and is still one hell of an entertaining horror film that's great fun at the same time. Watch it, as soon as you can.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

More of a Remake than a Sequel but Still delivers the goods.,"An couple by name of Ash (Bruce Campbell) and Linda (Denise Bixler) has decide to stay in the cabin for the weekend. When Ash plays an old tape recorder has the power to awakening the dead. Since the Evil is there to haunt them. Ash has to fight them to survive from the Evil Dead with the help of four people (Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie Wesley and Richard Domeier), who came to the cabin unexpectedly.Directed by Sam Raimi (Spider Man 1 & 2, Crimewave, Darkman) made an excellent sequel to the original. But the film does feel more like a remake at times. The film has enough dark humor, action, gore and style that it will keep you watching.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) with an good digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's best extra is the running commentary track is by the co-writer/director:Raimi, actor:Campbell, co-writer:Scott Speigel and Make-Up Effects Artist:Greg Nicotero. DVD also has 30 minutes featurette, theatrical trailer, game trailer, photo galleries and Bios from Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell. This DVD is Digitally Remastered in THX Picture Quality and Sound. The film's overtly slapstick may turn off some horror fans (Raimi's tribute to The Three Stooges in the film). But it's unique and a one of a kind film. Sam Raimi's brother-Ted Raimi plays the Demon Hernietta. (****/*****).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Worthy Success to Horror Classic,"The Evil Dead II takes everything fans loved from the original and ramps it up to one thousand, but is that such a good thing? The direction from Raimi is very present once again with fantastically creative shots and quick zooms that are such a staple of his. The story is way more fleshed out here, with interesting flash backs that give the original an entirely new perspective. The special effects are better than the original, and we get to see a lot more of what the evil entity is. But with all the positives this movie has, it is just missing something that I cannot put my finger on. The original felt so genuine, and I think the low budget helped increase the tension and horror of the possessions. Here the tone is a little campier and I just don't resonant with it as much as the original. It is still a great film, and one of the better horror films of the 80s, but I do not hold it as high as most unfortunately.Score: 81% ✅

one of the best and most entertaining horror movies in history,"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is a cult classic horror-comedy about which you just cannot forget while picking up your favorite horror movies. Director Sam Raimi evidently is in luck to sequels because Spiderman 2 is also superior to the 1st part. What is the biggest virtue of Evil Dead 2 is undoubtedly its originality in attitude towards seemingly worn out story. Evil finds its way to real world thanks to mysterious book called Necronomicon. Brave Ash (great Bruce Campbell) whose girl has changed into zombie is forced to fight and overcome evil powers. Raimi has really no interest in developing some kind of complicated story here, his film is just a wonderful, daring exercise in horror combined with comedy. It seems that director's inventiveness has no limits and viewers has no option but to cheer and laugh their head out while Ash's attempts to oppose evil. Ash with his chainsaw and sewn rifle is undoubtedly an icon of horror movies. His nonchalant behavior mixed with shrewdness works superbly no matter what bizarre challenges he has to face. The flick contains a wide range of ingenious special effects and first-grade gore scenes in no way disrupting the simple, but convincing plot. Besides, the camera work is often unconventional and many intriguing tricks occur. To sum up, Evil Dead 2 is one of the best and most entertaining horror films in history. Highly recommended if you haven't seen it yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A groovy cult classic!,"Before anyone even attempts to watch any of the Evil Dead films, they need to understand that there is zero continuity in the series. Absolutely none. What happens in one film is totally different in the other. Apparently this was done in Evil Dead II because the filmmakers could not obtain footage from the original film to put into the sequel, so they decided to redo it altogether – completely different from the first film (I assume they just did this for kicks in the third, even with the big footage excised from this film).After a brief interlude about the Book of the Dead (or Necronomicon Ex-Mortis as it's called in the film), the film opens with Ash (Bruce Campbell) taking his girlfriend Linda up to an isolated cabin in the woods for a little R & R. He finds a tape recorder and the Book of the Dead on a desk in the cabin; he plays the tape. Turns out, it's a recording from the previous owner of the cabin, and by subsequently playing the tape, Ash wakes up the evil spirits within the forest – the Evil Dead.This is a bad thing, as it literally takes Linda, leaving Ash frightened and saddened at the same time. He goes into the woods to look for her, but eventually only finds a possessed being in her body coming to attack him. He decapitates her, buries her in the ground, and goes back to weep within the cabin. Some how, all of this takes place within the first ten minutes of the film.What follows is probably one of the single most bizarre films anyone will ever see: fog runs rampant; blood of every color flies everywhere; a man loses his hand to demonic possession and then further attaches a chainsaw to replace the stump; tree branches attack and further abduct a woman and that's just the start. To explain anymore of the film would completely take away and ruin the remaining 74 minutes of the film.This is the movie that made Bruce Campbell a cult B-movie God. His acting is off the wall, never the least bit serious. This is the cult actor in his prime, before he became known for bit parts in cheesy movies and a successful novel writer. He gets beaten up throughout the film as well, leaving a lot to say about how far actors have to go for their directors.Speaking of directors, can anybody believe the man who went on to create the hugely profitable Spider-Man series started off with movies like this? Sam Raimi created his entire legacy with this film, and the rest of the series; one can easily see how much it has influenced his later work. Remember that scene in Spider-Man 2 where Doctor Octopus attacks all of the surgeons and doctors operating on him after his accident? With the crazy camera angles and totally random chainsaw? The scene is straight out of Evil Dead II. And the influence extends to all other horror films as well. Peter Jackson, Oscar winning director of The Lord of the Rings series, credits Evil Dead II as one of his early influences, as do many other directors.The influence and the legacy of this totally silly, but undeniably, cult film can be felt all over the film industry – and it continues to influence to this very day. A definite film to see.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Groovy!""","The sequel to the gory, atmospheric horror flick The Evil Dead is really more of a (black) slapstick comedy... something there was a hint of in the first. Here, it's pushed all the way through... it's cartoony and provided you're into the humor, fun. I found it more cool than fun, honestly; never been into laughing at pain, no matter whose it is. But there's no doubt about it; this film is cool. It's also very much a 'guy' film... get 'the gang' together, call up all your guy friends and get a copy of this film, preferably an uncut one. You'll love it. So did I, no doubt about that. The better part of the film is basically a remake of the first... new characters and new plot points, but the progression and such is the same. The situations are the same, but the ways in which we get to them are different from the first film. It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go ""Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?"" The plot is interesting, new and old parts alike. It's not Shakespeare, but it keeps your interest. The acting is the same fairly low standard as that of the first. The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?). The editing is excellent, just as the case was with the first. The special effects have improved... harder to figure out than those of the first, and that says quite a lot. The budget is higher(ten-fold, according to this very site), and it's most definitely noticeable. The emphasis throughout all of the film is mostly on humor and 'coolness' factor, very little on scares and horror. There's about the same amount of gore, at least as far as I could tell. The film is worth watching for just about any guy... regardless of maturity, really. There are things here that will make every guy watching it go ""way cool!"". One scene in particular had said effect on me... around the one hour mark, involving a chainsaw and a shotgun... anyone who has seen the film already know what I'm talking about, and I won't say anymore so as to not spoil it for anyone who hasn't. See it for yourself; you won't regret it. I recommend this film to any fan of Sam Raimi, gore, the first The Evil Dead, slapstick and/or Bruce Campbell. Of course, all guys should check it out. The film has such a thick 'guy' vibe, it should almost be mandatory for guys to watch it. Anyway, if you fit into one or more of the aforementioned groups, get a hold of this flick and watch it. Chances are high you'll love every second of it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Superb,"Gory, bloody, gut-wrenching and hysterically funny at the same time. A true masterwork. I loved ""The Evil Dead"" because it was the first film that really terrified me (""The Exorcist"" came close, but I was eating pizza at the time, so the impact was slightly diminished). But ""Evil Dead II"" takes everything to another level. Don't go to an isolated cabin in the middle of a malevolent forest - you know it's going to turn out bad. BUT - if you choose to ignore everything sensible (i.e. don't go there in the first place), be prepared to confront the Devil in all his forms.

Much the same as the first,"It's nearly as good as the original, and it has the same problems as well. It's just as fantastically directed, has better effects, and Bruce Campbell truly personifies Ash in this one, but the supporting cast is weak at best, the story is lame, and the pacing is even more strange. The beginning of the flick, with just Ash alone in the cabin doing his best horror slapstick, is so excellent that you just want it to span the entire film, but, unfortunately, it does not. Another silly story and some more stupid characters are in store, instead. From that point on, it just feels like a remake of the original, making it rather boring and somewhat of a chore to sit through.

Evil Dead II,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story picks up right after the first film. The first seven minutes of the film are a recap of the first film with some minor changes. The story in this movie is way better then the first. The entire movie is full of suspense and thrills.The acting is once again B movie quality. There are some humorous senses throughout, but the over the top acting kinda makes not funny. Bruce Campbell's character Ash does have some awesome senses which make him seem like a badass.The gore and the monsters are the best part of this film. The monsters are detailed, hideous creatures that bring a great sense of terror. The gore is also great.Pros: Compelling story, awesome monsters, fast pacing, some humorous parts, Bruce Campbell's Ash is bad, and great use of goreCons: B movie acting and an over the top ending that seemed out of placeOverall Rating: 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first but still plain bad!,"Better than the first but a few funny scenes doesn't make something as stupid as this one good. To top it all the film opens with a fake recap of the last film, where only Ash and his girlfriend is in the cabin, this is just utterly confusing and idiotic. There was no need to recap this at all. Apparently Raimi lost the rights to the first film and had to reinvent what happened.We them get some of the worst acting I have ever seen from Bruce Campbell, which includes screams worthy of being in troll 2 and a few stupid one liners. We are also introduced to some other bad actors who play the children of the scientist who started it all and to top it all throw in a super cliché red neck couple.Luckily this one gets even dumber than the first which in a way makes it so bad that it's borerline entertaining and at times somewhat funny. I get that it's just a goofy comedy with lots of gore but I would place this on the level of Date Movie. How people can like this film leaves me confused. However the fact that it gave me a few smiles and the fact that it wasn't too boring compels me to give it a generous rating. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil dead 2? SOUNDS GREAT!!,"Well, since i only watched the movie last night, i can get straight to the point. This movie is fantastic! The first Evil dead was scary with lots of violence and gore. Evil Dead 2 has less gore, less violence and is funny! Sam Raimi was very smart to think about putting comedy in this great sequel. The good thing is that the comedy is not over exaggerated (Unlike like Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness) so it keeps its horror genre over all. I would be lying if i said this movie was perfect, but it was pretty damn good! i was disappointed with the remake of Evil Dead 1. The entire first movie was crammed in fifteen minutes, eliminating all of the characters except Ash and Linda. Then it skips straight to the part where ash lops off Linda's head with a shovel when she is possessed. It made me think that all ash had done in the first movie was gone and it seemed that he had no experience with the deadits anymore. In about 15 minutes into the movie, it goes on from where Evil Dead left off. Ash gets hit with the unseen evil force and gets thrown against a tree. When he recovers, it is night time again and the deadits have returned. My personal favourite part is when he battles his own possessed hand.Evil dead 2 is the most perfect sequel for the most perfect movie. Sure, I thought Sam Raimi went a little too far when Ash starts dancing with the laughing lamp but, hey! It was funny! The ending is hilarious too.I recommend this movie to all horror and Evil Dead fans! The great thing about this one is that you don't have to watch Evil Dead to get Evil Dead 2.GREAT Sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Dawn of Splatstick,"Shaun of the Dead. Undead. Dead & Breakfast. Bubba Ho-Tep. Without Evil Dead II, it is more than likely that none of those films would exist. This film really did usher in a brand new form of both horror and comedy. A form that is now lovingly referred to as ""splatstick"".Before I even begin the plot summary, I will say that if you have not yet seen The Evil Dead, DO NOT watch Evil Dead II. By no means is it a stand-alone film. That said, the story is of Ash (Campbell), the hero from the first film, who, like in the first film, must do battle with evil demons summoned by the ancient ""Book of the Dead"". That's really about it.So what is it that makes Evil Dead II so special and so different from The Evil Dead? What makes it more than a cheap rehash? The answer is simple: humor. The Evil Dead was a low-budget classic of frightening, gory horror, and while there are certainly some very funny moments of extremely black humor (it somehow manages to make a man decapitating his girlfriend with a shovel seem hilarious), it was a rather intense and horrifying ride. Evil Dead II, however, is just the opposite. It has moments of frightening horror, but it is really a screwball comedy reminiscent of The Three Stooges (whom director Sam Raimi is an avid fan of). Gags include a projectile eyeball flying into someone's mouth, guffawing possessed furniture, a possessed headless corpse putting a chainsaw in its own neck, and my personal favorite, a sequence involving a possessed severed hand and a copy of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms. Trust me, it all sounds much darker in writing than it is in the film; it's all quite light-hearted (as much as possible considering the subject matter, anyway). This type of bloody macabre humor would come to be known as ""splatstick"", and would be utilized in many more films to follow.Yes, there were a few splatstick films prior to Evil Dead II (Re-Animator comes to mind), but what really sets II apart is its sheer inventiveness. Everything just feels so fresh and exciting, even today, as the film is approaching its twentieth anniversary.And of course, no review of this film would be complete without at least one reference to B-movie icon Bruce Campbell's performance, which can only be described with the word ""awesome"". He's not quite achieved the level of bada*s-ness he's at in the second Evil Dead sequel, Army of Darkness (which is in a class all its own), but he's getting there.Evil Dead II's influence is widespread and undeniable. While it is personally my least favorite of the Evil Dead series (I look to The Evil Dead for horror and Army of Darkness for comedy; II feels like a slightly diluted mix of the two), it is still a classic and essential viewing for any self-respecting horror fan.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One Of The Best Horror Films And Sequels Of All Time. A Classic Horror/Comedy.,"Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is one of the best Horror films and Sequels ever made that brilliantly mixes Horror,Comedy,great direction,an excellent performance from Bruce Campbell and great special effects. Those are the reasons Evil Dead II is one of my favorite Horror films,one of my favorite sequels and one of my favorite movies of all time and why Evil Dead II is a true Horror classic.Taking place right after the events in the first Evil Dead,our hero Ash(Bruce Campbell) is still at the cabin in the woods still trying to fight off the flesh possessing ghouls. Now with a group of strangers also in the cabin,Ash and the group must stay in the cabin and trying to fight and survive The Evil Dead or the demons will swallow their souls.Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is such an amazing and brilliant Horror film because while it still has the scary feel of the first film,ED II takes on a different direction by adding Comedy into the mix and gives viewers one of the most insane,crazy and over the top Horror films of all time. Mixing Horror and Comedy together is never easy,but director Sam Raimi manages to pull it off so flawlessly. Raimi fills up the film with funny and imaginative slapstick and mixing it with over the top gore,making us laugh and squirm at the same time. Raimi is obviously a huge fan of The Three Stooges(even calling the stunt men fake Shemps)and Raimi applies that same slapstick Comedy and hilarious suffering with this film,especially with the character Ash. The character Ash goes through such maniacal and hilarious torture from either the demons or himself that you'll wonder if he'll make it out alive or lose his mind and that's one of the great things about the film. Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin and Raimi knows this because Raimi balances out both Horror and Comedy by taking the most horrifying situations and making them funny and also taking the funny situations and making them horrible and it's done in a smart way. EDII is one of the few films that can wonderfully and greatly mixes hilarious Comedy and over the top gore and the only films that can match it are other Horror Comedy classics such as The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Dead Alive just to name a few. EDII and those other great Horror films are apart of the great Horror sub genre called Splatstick(a mixture and combination of Comedy and gore). Even though there is a lot hilarious Comedy,Raimi still knows that EDII is at heart a Horror film and Raimi gives viewers a lot scary,intense and suspenseful moments,using the demon POV shots with great effect and crazy insane energy using loud sound effects and dark atmosphere and Raimi lets his imagination run wild. This movie is like the first Evil Dead on a bad acid trip and you're coming along for a crazy ride. The movie's violence and gory scenes,while toned down from the first film(most of the blood and gore is red,green and blue)is still great and intense and matches the violence of the first film. The main character Ash is a lot different from the first film,where in the first one he was scared and heroic but in this film he's tough and heroic and willing to face the demons head-on and spitting out great one-liners,even though he still shows fear and terror. Ash is one of my all-time favorite movie characters cause of this film. The ending is great cliffhanger ending and is a good set-up for the follow-up Army Of Darkness and will have viewers laughing. There's been debate over the years about whether or not EDII is a sequel or a remake of the first film. While a few scenes are a remake of the first film,the whole film is a sequel and has it's own creativity and originality like the first film and is a classic like the first one.The cast does a good job. Bruce Campbel gives a brilliant,hilarious performance as Ash,saying great one-liners,being tough,funny,taking out the demons with an iron fist. This performance made Ash a classic character of the Horror genre and made Bruce Campbell a B-movie icon,a Horror icon and a Genre movie icon. An excellent performance. Sarah Berry does a good job as Annie. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley give funny performances as rednecks Jake and Bobby Joe. Theodore Raimi(Sam's Brother)is funny and freaky as Possessed Henrietta. Richard Domeier does a good job as Ed,Annie's boyfriend. Denise Bixler(Linda),John Peakes(Professor Raymond Knowby)and Lou Hancock(Henrietta Knowby)give good performances as well.The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent,with Raimi bringing manic,crazy energy to the film with great angles,close-ups and the POV shots of the demons and Raimi also does well in the scary and funny scenes. Great direction,Raimi.The music score by Joseph Doluca is impressive and memorable and fits in with the insane,crazy energy of the film. Great score.The special effects by K.N.B FX group are excellent,well-done,gory and at times very realistic and work for the film.In final word,if you love Horror films,Cult films,Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell,I suggest you see Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn,a Horror classic that will stand the test of time and stay with you forever. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not gory like everyone seems to say (for some reason),"Awesome movie, atmosphere very similar to the original, despite its increased budget, but the gore is way down in this one....if you are hoping for a gorefest like the first one, and are expecting it because of what you have heard, then you will be very very dissapointed. The violence in this is more of the 'beating up bloodlessly' variety, any gore that it DOES have, is either offscreen, with tastefully low amounts of blood splattering (at most) or large amounts of watery blood spraying out of walls or (in one case) from under a trapdoor.....or to rubber monsters, with no actual gore or guts or any of that. This doesn't make it any less awesome a movie, but it HAS been continuously misrepresented as being gory, (and even as gory or more so, than the original)It has a great performance from Bruce Campbell, who i do not think is capable of a non-magnetic performance. The atmosphere IS indeed creepy and dark and cold looking, and nicely grainy, so it LOOKS like the kind of splatter movie that it isn't. It is also very very funny, and well made, which creates a kind of viewer dichotomy while watching it, because the humour and the aesthetic do not match- yet it meshes so well.So, to summarise, be wary of expectations of splatter (like the first) as you will not get it. Watch it for its other qualitties, and you will most likely love it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy,"The sequel to The Evil Dead. The first movie was an excellent example how you can be creative if you don't have the money for a lot of effects. And thus playing with camera-work to create the illusion that there is something happening.In this sequel, which is partly a remake, we see some of the same scenes as in The Evil Dead, but made with more money. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good. But Raimi adds something more to his film. Ash, the main character, was kind of a wimp in the first film but now quickly grows into a mean moron who is a wonder in one-liners. If you want too see a movie with historic one-liners (and hilarious scenes), you should see this one. At one point in the movie, Ash just keeps spitting them out. Again this is a nice masterpiece from Raimi, who sets his name as the inventor of horror movies with humor and also develops the character for the third film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
BanZai!!!,"This is Sam Raimi' finest moment.I gotta say this movie will haunt me for the rest of my days - Bruce Campbell took me to the edge and back again from normality to madness and then back again briefly until they brought out the sequel - Army of Darkness.This Movie made me feel like I was there and that is rare, sure there are others with the same effect but this one added years to my biological state and now I am prepared for the Evil and I hope Sam is filming.But seriously if you haven't watched it then give it a go and be prepared for something special, something of legend in the world of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn9 out of 10 demons agree it's more convenient to kill people in a tent than people in a cabin.Unfortunately, the couple in this horror-comedy has no sacrificial campers on their lawn.Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend (Denise Bixler) decide to stay at a cabin in the woods.After settling in, Ash uncovers a recording from the previous lodger that reads from an ancient tome: Necronomicon Ex-Mortis.Playing the passages aloud awakens an evil entity in the cabin, which then possesses Ash's girlfriend.Meanwhile, the daughter (Sarah Berry) of the man on the tape shows up with her research assistant, her hillbilly guides and missing pages from the book.More a remake than a sequel, director Sam Raimi works the kinks out of his own original by infusing humour and introducing filmdom's most revered anti-hero.Incidentally, the easiest way to de-terrify a cabin in the woods is clear-cutting.
