Classic Spins: Re-living Spider-Man 2 in 2023,"I recently delved into a spree of superhero movies, but amidst the modern glitz, I felt it was time to revisit a true classic - Spider-Man 2. The movie presents a timeless story with solid tent poles and a strong focus on character development.Upon rewatching, I found myself enthralled once again, appreciating its ability to be repeatedly enjoyed. The visuals, though impressive in their time, might not stand up as strongly in the year 2023. Nonetheless, they still manage to convey the essence of the narrative effectively.While the antagonist could have been portrayed with greater strength, the character's development and writing were commendable, adding depth to the plot. However, it is the protagonist, Peter Parker, who steals the show with his compelling performance, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, Spider-Man 2 remains an awesome classic that stands the test of time. Despite minor visual limitations, the film's engaging story and well-crafted characters ensure you won't be bored, making it a worthy watch for both fans of the superhero genre and newcomers alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Takes every element from the first film and improves on it!,"It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience.First off, the acting in the second film has improved tremendously. Tobey Maguire feels more right in the second film. I found him quite shallow in the first film but in the second one he seems to have developed more depth. More nuances have found their way into his acting in the second film making the character more believable and less of a square. Kirsten Dunst is never a good actress but I found her a little less annoying in this film than in the first and therefore I felt I could tolerate her presence. James Franco is decent but still has a problem with portraying nuances which basically means that in order for his performance to work he has exaggerate every emotion his character feels. As it is with most superhero movies the villain is the most interesting character and Sam Raimi couldn't have picked a better actor than Alfred Molina to play Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock. I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe but I didn't like his performance in the first Spider-Man film very much and therefore I was delighted when Alfred Molina turned out to be a far better villain than Willem was. His performance was both menacing and nuanced and even though the character isn't always directly in control of his actions (making him somewhat misinterpreted) Molina's performance makes the character highly credible and undoubtedly the most interesting character in the film.The effects have improved which is logical considering that it has been 2 years since the first film hit the cinemas. Also I found that Doc Ock was much better suited for flashy moves and cool fights than Green Goblin ever was so in that aspect the film is far superior to the first film as well. Especially the train fight will, I think, go into history as one of the best hero/villain showdowns in history if not the best. The computer effects have become slightly more subtle making the film seem more polished. There were still a few unfortunate scenes were the CGI was pretty obvious but overall the effects have improved dramatically and received a well earned Oscar.The musical score continues in the same epic fashion from the first and Danny Elfman does an exceptional job as usual. The score is both thrilling and epic but it is also subtle when it has to be and that aspect of the score works wonderfully as well. Elfman has some experience in super hero scoring (having done both Batman and Hulk aside from Spider-Man) and it shows as the score is very appropriate and fitting. Two thumbs up on the music.In terms of story telling the second film is also far better than the first. I found the first film to be very unoriginal in terms of its story. Anyone who has just an ounce of knowledge into the myth of Spider-Man knows the story beforehand and thus the film becomes very predictable and boring quite frankly. The second film did not have this problem. It was a breath of fresh air. The story seems to flow more from the heart this time around. Raimi proved in the first film that he could take a situation from the comics and translate it reasonably to the screen. In the second film he proves that he can make a highly original story as well and make it entertaining. It should also be added that Spider-Man 2 has a lot more of the humor like the kind that appears in the comics. J.K. Simmons who was one of the elements in the first film returns in his role and he is absolutely hilarious. He truly embodies the spirit of J. Jonah Jameson. There is also a very funny elevator scene which should be mentioned.Some people complained that Raimi has turned mainstream with the Spider-Man films. That is a load of rubbish and Raimi proves it by adding some elements from his cult films, the Evil Dead series. He even lets Bruce Campbell tell Spider-Man off as if to symbolize that he hasn't forgotten where he came from.All in all Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first film in the franchise in almost every way imaginable Spider-Man 2 is twice as engaging, entertaining and heartfelt than the first film in the series.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie has a criminally low rating,"7.3/10? Seriously? Most mediocre MCU films get a better rating than that. This movie is up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero movies. This movie was loved when it came out, now it's cool to hate on the trilogy. Spider-Man 2 improved on all aspects of Spider-Man 1. Peter is struggling to be Spider-Man, and the movie illustrates that very well. The action is better than lots of movies today, most notably the train fight scene. Danny Elfman provides an unforgettable soundtrack. This movie and the trilogy shouldn't be overlooked as some cheesy 2000s movies, because they paved the way for the MCU as we know it today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just rewatching in 2020,"I was a kid when I watched this in cinema back in 2004
I just want to say after all these years after a few version of Spider-Mans and all the MCU movie.
This one is hands down the best Superhero movie.
It has everything done within 2 hours. Perfectly caught up what it left of from the previous Spider-Man and Toby Maguire will always be my Spider-Man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another excellent superhero movie,"This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excitement and entertainment!,"Now this is a super-hero movie, filled with crazy action scenes, great effects, funny moments and a little cheesiness. I can't explain why I like Spider-man movies so much, I even liked the 3rd movie which I admit it wasn't very good, but it was entertaining and it even managed to be very emotional for me.Spider-man has always been my favorite super-hero. There's just something about a super-hero fighting crime, struggling to pay the bills and trying to find time to study. It certainly was a hero that revolutionized the basic concept of the rich hero which has a secret base filled with costumes, weapons, gimmicks, wheels, etc. That AND Spider-man's charisma appealed to me, he is a funny character, he wears a funny costume (not too ninja-like that's for sure) and he has awesome powers! He is not an indestructible mutant nor a green beast with infinite strength... or even a guy who bursts into flames or shoots laser-beams outta his ass! He IS a simple hero and has enough to be cool and interesting, spider powers! After all he is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man! And by the way, the original Spider-man created a hardening, sticky liquid/glue or whatever it is called, making his own web, because in spite of his initial superhuman powers, Peter Parker was also brilliant teenager and used that great intellect to his advantage. That good analysis and perception of his also saved his ass numerous times (I confess I used to be an avid reader of the comics and follower of its never-ending story).And this movie delivers all that, it shows how great of a super-hero spider-man really is, his crazy-ass awesome villains, his cheesy jokes, his athletic and jumpy fighting style, it's all awesome to be seen! And for action fans, be it chaotic scenes, be it car chases, sword fights or fisticuffs action, there are some scenes in this movie that will for sure please all of you. Starting from the Bank robbery all the way to the train stopping, it's candy for my eyes... Spider-man vs. Dr. Octupus, one of my favorite fights in Cinema history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Go watch this movie right now,"This movie it's not just a good superhero movie, but a great film. The source material has been analyzed, and overall studied so It would make the fans happy, but a great superhero movie understands that this is not just for the fans, It's for the whole public, so the screenplay and the dialogue that sometimes sounds a little corny is very well writen. The CGI effects still looking good at this point, watching Spider-Man swinging around it's just amazing. Peter Parker's story arc it's perfect, for the people he interacts with he is just another nerdy guy who doesn't understands the meaning of puntcuality, but for us (the audience) he is the perfect protagonist. This movie is made by someone who understands the character and undertsands about cinema, and that man is Sam Raimi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"When Peter Parker struggles with his life, suit changes.","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 outstrips its predecessor and has a perversity and quick-wittedness that hardly seem to belong in a comic-book movie. Tobey Maguire is a good choice for the title role, since his faraway look and sleepy voice seem rather more l'uomo vague than dynamic crimebuster. Alfred Molina makes for a much better supervillain than the first movie's Green Goblin. There is something weightless and flimsy in the spectacle of Spider-Man swinging between scrapers. The cinematographer, Bill Pope, finesse a crisply shot New York with comic-book overlay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding sequel.,"The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good spider man movie.,This spider man movie is pretty good but it isn't as good as the first one but it is still pretty good because it has lots of action in it not as much as the first spider man movie but it still has lots of action in it it has a pretty good screen play to it Tobey once again does a great spider man in this spider man movie the acting in it is pretty good the actors are good the villains are good i think the guy who play doc ock does it pretty good.

So make sure that you rent or buy spider man 2 because it is a really good spider man movie.Overall score ******* out of ************* out of *****,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"When it's not boring, it's mostly dreadful","This film wants to be a drama, a love story, sci-fi movie and action extravaganza all at the same time, and then just screws up everything.The action scenes are not bad, but really not that different from the first movie.As far as sci-fi goes, it's all fiction and no science. The whole idea of professor Octavius and his ""great invention"" is completely unconvincing and seem extremely far fetched, not unlike the plot twists. But then, it is a comic-book-movie.But where this film really goes south is the drama/love story. It's an endless string of clichés, the characters are cardboard and the only thing truly dramatic is the quality of the dialog. Both the characters of Peter and of Mary Jane are so hopeless and indecisive that you end up hoping the bad guy kills them, just to get it over with. The pace is excruciatingly slow, so during the seemingly endless dialogs, ones eyelids tend to get very heavy.Even the jokes in the movie don't work that well. It *tries* too hard to be funny, but it just isn't. The only exception is the scene in the elevator, that was hilarious.If all of this isn't bad enough, the studios Morality Department also got hold of the script somewhere along the line. They injected a large dose of those wholesome ""American Values"", talking at lenght about American Heroes and rolemodels etc. Almost made me physically sick.I still would have given it 3/10, but right now it's in the top 250. Even if you're not a harsh as I am about this film, then let's at least agree that in the history of cinema, surely we can find at least 250 films that are better than this one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best one out of the trilogy.,"Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE GODFATHER PART II, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, ALIENS, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, THE DARK KNIGHT, and others.SPIDER-MAN 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments.Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city.This movie in many ways is another kind of ""coming of age"" story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene.Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such an awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare.Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, a lot of dancing around between the two, but it doesn't come off as overly dramatic. James Franco's Harry Osborn also has a meaty development. Peter and Harry's friendship is put to the test as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. Watching their friendship deteriorate works seamlessly with all the other moving parts driving the story.The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is.Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with SPIDER-MAN 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Up until that point, I don't recall moments in other superhero films where the civilians really interact with a superhero outside of just being saved, so it was a new element that also caught me off guard in a good way when the film first released. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J. K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments.Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. For early 2000's standards, the visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's a perfect combustion, never feeling overstuffed.I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Review 1: Spider-Man 2,"Spider-Man was almost the perfect comic book movie and perhaps released at the best time. When audiences get bored with what genres normally cook up (mostly horror) we the viewers always look for the next best thing. For a while, horror movies were all the fad, but these movies can become boring extremely fast and Hollywood must find something completely opposite from horror to try and keep our attention. So, what might be completely opposite from horror? Well first, lets make a list of what is opposite from horror. Happy is one, action is another; good guys always winning might be another. So, what might be a good opposite for horror is a comic book movie. Now, a lot of money comes from what Hollywood had to offer for comic book movies. Some are failures (Electra) and others are hits. For the most part, most of them are hits. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. We begin with Peter Parker continuing his job as Spider-Man, but all is not well. Peter's friend, Harry Osborn, hates Spider-Man and wants him dead. Because of Peter's relation with taking photographs of Spider-Man, Harry has problems with Peter that only continue to grow worse as the movie goes on. The main villain of this movie is Dr. Otto Octavius who later becomes Dr. Ock. In a freak accident, he is connected to his invention of arms that are suppose to help him with an even bigger invention. His wife is killed in the process and the arms attached to him seem to have complete control of what he does. Deeply grieved, Dr. Ock runs away and hides, but not for long. He comes to terms with what he has become and starts his life as super villain. As usual, it is up to Spider-Man to save the day, but something is not right. Spider-Man seems to be losing his powers and has no control of what is happening to him. It is true that this film is better than the first entry, but only by a little bit. It seems though, that scene were Peter saves the people a train was little over it when everyone on the train discovers he is Spider-Man. Overall: A--Ben Russell",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not as good as most say","I'm not bashing this movie. I like this movie, and I even own a copy of it in my growing DVD collection. However, upon viewing it a second time it's not as good as I originally thought. In fact, I find it damn slow. The fight scenes between Spidy and Doc Ock are great, but they are few and far between. And there's too much philosophizing/moralizing for my taste. Still, it's worth the investment in time and money. Toby is good as Spiderman, but the standout performance is Alfred Molina, who should get a Best Support Actor nomination, although that's a pipe dream.Hopefully, Spiderman 3 will be more action-based, now that his moral conundrum and romance buildup resolved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favourite film of all time,"Inspired by the recent news about Tobey's likely return to playing the web-slinger in the MCU's Spider-Man 3, I rewatched this film. An IMDb score of 7.3 for this film is one of the biggest injustices I've seen on this website. In my opinion this is THE definitive and THE best superhero film of all time.This trilogy of films is my childhood. I've loved Spider-Man as long as I can remember and he has always been my favourite superhero. These films came out at just the right time when I was growing up so watching this films just brings it all back. And that's not to say my judgement of this film is blinded by nostalgia- this is genuinely an amazing film that holds up in the present day.The story is an interesting one, with Peter grappling with the personal consequences of being Spider-Man and feeling the subsequent effects, all whilst he fights the best Spider-Man villain ever to be put on screen, Alfred Molina's brilliantly menacing Doc Ock. The sequence in which Spider-Man returns and fights Doc Ock on the train is for me, the best superhero fight scene of all time and my favourite cinematic sequence ever. You can feel every punch, every wince and every scream- something that unfortunately, today's comic book flicks are devoid of.And it's not just all action and no heart- when it wants to tug on the heart strings it yanks them. The scene with Uncle Ben is so painful, raw and acted to perfection. It makes me tear up every time. There's also the usual Raimi campiness, with quips and funny moments giving the film a real charm about it. All of this is underlined by Danny Elfman's brilliant, bombastic and booming score that really does sound like the audio equivalent of a comic book.This film is a 120 minute thrill ride with heart-stopping action and heart-wrenching drama. The best superhero film ever made and my favourite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Much Teen Romance Drags Film Down,"Let me say I have generally enjoyed watching both Spider-Man films. They're fun to view, but as someone older who doesn't necessarily get thrilled watching teen romances, they aren't DVDs I would purchase. The action scenes, with Spider-Man flying around from skyscraper- to-skyscraper, are fantastic. I also loved the villain in here, the octopus-like ""Dr. Octavius,"" played just great by Alfred Molina.However, there is just too much Kirsten Dunst ""Mary Jane Watson"") in here and the romance angles between her and ""Peter Parker"" (Tobey Maguire) are just annoying....too sappy, and they take away from the story too much. A little of it is fine, but that aspect of the story takes up too high a percentage of screen time.I've read the comics and those concentrate mainly on Spider Man vs. various villains. I wish the movies would have done the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fan's Dream Come True,"I went to the midnight show last night and was completely blown away !! I am 30 years old and had begun reading the Amazing Spider-Man back when I was 11 and leaving the theater last night, I felt like I was a kid again- I was amazed, I was in awe, I really felt... satisfied.Every scene crackled. There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive.Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire did a great job of making Peter Parker sympathetic, you feel for him, you wince with him, he is the boy, becoming a man, and you watch it, and you keep watching it.Even as a long-time fan who knew where some of the story lines were going- with MJ, with Harry Osborne- to see HOW the movie chose to play out these stories, provided great surprises for me, I almost wished I didn't know... I can't wait to see the reactions of my friends who haven't followed the Spider-man comics, the twist of the story and the hints at what is to come...A great movie. Great fun. Great story. Great action. A blockbuster movie. You leave the theater, definitely feeling like you got your money's worth !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vastly Overrated Summerflick at the Right time.,"This movie is vastly overrated to say the least. Sure, it's a good summer movie - but that is all (don't believe the IMDb score). It's a summer action movie at the right time without competition, that's why it's a box office smash hit (nobody goes to see Troy anymore) - not on movie merits. If you don't believe me yet at how overrated this flick is; look at the votes. 50% of voters has given this movie a 10. A 10! Imo it's more of a 6 or a week 7 (I gave it a 6) and here's why.This is more of a drama then an action movie and some scenes are really drawn out. ""What?!! You just want brainless action!"" I hear the Spiderman fans screaming from the top of their lungs. ""No."", I reply calmly, ""I don't"". But when you want some sort of drama or a strongly emotional driven storybase (or what not) you need, imo, at least 2 things.1) A good script. This is not it, no matter what you say. The script is very poor by all means and I'm not reacting to the liberties taken over the spiderman story (and some things are really out there), it's just not a very good script by any standards. The tempo and wrapup of the movie is really strange aswell (but that's the editings and / or directors fault).2) Good acting. And this is not it again. Tobey Maguire surprised me with how poorly he acted in this movie - looked mostly like he was wandering about being sleepy all of the time without any emotions to show for his life. Kirsten Dunst never was (or will be) a good actress. Alfred Molina? Hah. It feels like they're trying to make the movie as cheap as they can, what a poor substitute he is for the great Dafoe in the first movie. In fact, the best acting by far is that of James Franco and he only has a small part (he truelly shines).The effects are still mediocre at best aswell (Harry Potter 3's are outstanding) and cleary compatriot. There isn't any excuse for it either this time around since the first Spiderman movie pulled in as much cash as it did. No, simply put this is a good movie; but not great by any means. no matter how hard people try to project on you that it's ""innovative"" cause of the emotion overload (poorly executed) they try to fill it with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Comic Book Movie. Ever!,"This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time! The movie had pretty much everything you need for a prefect film: Script: 10/10! OUTSTANDING! Director Sam Raimi did an excellent job giving full attention to the Dilemma of Peter Parker. He balances all the action, comedy, and drama perfectly.Acting: 10/10. Tobey Maguire was very good being a character that doubts himself and has to choose between wanting a normal life and wanting to live as a superhero. Kirsten Dunst is very good in her roll as Mary Jane Watson. James Franco is amazing as the bitter Harry Osborn who is seeking revenge on Spider-Man. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is fantastic. He was an excellent choice as one of my favorite characters from the comic.Action Sequences: 10/10. This movie has some amazing action scenes with Doc Ock on the building. But the best effect in the film is the fight between Spidey and Doc Ock on the side of the train.Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons is amazing as J. Jonah Jameson and adds a lot to the film. Ted Raimi is also very funny. The Raindrops sequence in the movie had a lot of laughs when you see Peter Parker as the nerdiest kid in the world.This movie has everything you could ever want out of a summer blockbuster.

"""I believe there's a hero in all of us.""","Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker's life. He's had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can't hold a job because he's always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.Sam Raimi's direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There's still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie's highlight. Danny Elfman's music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work.The cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what's right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she's saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane (""Go get 'em, Tiger.""). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she's amazing. She steals every scene she's in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in the first film.When this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman '78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It's followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A damn near perfect summer blockbuster,"Two years on from defeating the Green Goblin, Peter Parker is having a harder time meeting the ongoing expectations of the public. On top of this the double life is taking its strain on his job, his personal life and his ability to even cast webs. Parker decides enough is enough and throws it all in  after all, he is only one man. Meanwhile, A brilliant scientist, Dr Octavius sees his life's work on a fusion reactor explode  killing his wife. Wife the protective device on his computerised arms broken, Dr Octavius loses his grip on sanity and starts to rebuild his reactor using money and materials from crime. With him seemingly intent on destruction, Parker must decide if the needs of others outweigh his own.With many blockbusters falling at the opening weekend this summer, the title of 'summer's best' was still up for grabs when I arrived at the cinema to watch Spiderman 2 (having only the week earlier given it the miss in favour of lighter fare). Two hours later I emerged having enjoyed one of the most entertaining popcorn films I'll probably see all year. The plot is more than able to fill the running time and, although the action scenes often have large gaps between them, there are no moments where I was bored  even if there are a few moments where the film slightly slows. The complexity of the hero is the main thing  he is an unwilling hero and the strain shows well on him. Even the potentially ponderous thread with Mary-Jane plays pretty well for the most part.The villain of the piece is similar to the Green Goblin of the first film in that he is a scientist driven to madness by 'voices' who we want to lose as well as feeling for  more tragic than evil. Where Dafoe was great as the Goblin, the silly costume hindered the actor, here Molina has no such obstacle and does very well  carrying off the 'voices' scene without it looking silly  it is only a shame that he has so little screen time as a person (he has little time anyway  but the vast majority of it is throwing cars around). With these complex people as the fronts it is any wonder that the script has no problem being surprisingly strong for a summer action movie. You could read meaning into most of it but it is hard to not see the New York people on the train carrying the prone body of Spiderman backwards as having a bigger significance  a surprisingly poignant movie after a big effects-driven scene. The script also throws in a real mix of emotions  perfect for a film that is more about being an exciting ride than a piece of art. Plenty of it is very funny, some of it is touching, some of it is about character and some of it, well, some of it is about cars being thrown through windows! And of course the latter is what we have come for.In terms of action, the several big action sequences are very enjoyable and put the skirmishes from the first movie very much in the shade. Part of this is down to the increased intensity of the fights due to the close combat nature of the character but it is hard not to be impressed by the impact of the vastly improved effects. In the first movie I struggled occasionally to get past the fact that some of it (not all but some) looked very much like an average playstation game. Here the effects are great; sure, you can still tell when a mid-shot of a character is real or CGI but they are much more convincing and they are used a lot better  making it easier to accept them as real for the purposes of the film. Of course what really makes the action sequences is Raimi's great direction. He is very able in the smaller moments but he is fantastic in the massive action scenes that he pulls together. At times his direction is very clever and my favourite 'reference' scene is also the one that surprised me that it was rated PG. In a very clear reference to Evil Dead, doctors are hammered by Dr Octopus' arms for the first time  dragged screaming (ED's trees) and tackling it with bone saws (Ash's chain saw). It was a very intense scene and, with it being in a PG, it acts as proof that the BBFC are not as strict as the moaners would have us believe.Working with this direction, the cast all do really well. Maguire takes the pratfalls, the moral questions, the romance and the action equally as well. He is very much the likable everyman that the film needs Spiderman to be and he is good throughout. Dunst has talked about her desire to do more than just this type of film and, from this, I can see why. Although she has some good scenes, generally she is sidelined and it is to her credit that she does as well as she does with comparatively little to work with. Molina is given too little time and lacks a really strong scene of emotion in the same way that Dafoe did in front of the mirror but he still does well. I didn't feel his pain as much as I really should have done but that was more down to his low screen time rather than his performance. Franco is good but a bit too one-dimensional; given that the third film will be very dependent on him I'm hoping he can step up to the plate more than he did here. Of the support cast, once again it is a wonderfully OTT Simmons who steals every scene he is in  he is so good that I never once saw him as his Oz character  an association I never thought he'd be able to break but he did  and he did it hilariously. Cameos from Campbell, Raimi and Dafoe are all enjoyable and add to their scenes.Overall this is not a perfect film and I am bemused by its appearance in the top 250 list here but it does basically everything it sets out to do and does it in a manner that puts this years' other blockbusters in the shade. The script is clever, interesting and involving; the characters are complex and pretty well drawn while the film delivers laughs as frequently as it does action. With improved effects and some very impressive action scenes this is definitely the movie to sue in a summer full of misses and average thrills.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman? More like Superman half the time..,"As sequels go this one isn't bad. It's entertaining, the characters get more development, the CGI is more intense, the perceived ""threat"" is more deadly etc. etc.But somehow , despite a reasonable first half, I felt let down by the second half. The warning signs were there all along, thinking about it, but I ignored them because, up until the half-way mark, the film was pretty good and I was enjoying it. But once the movie crossed into the nonsense-filled second half, all those ""ignored sillinesses"" of the first half flashed back to haunt me. As a result, the pleased expression on my face darkened into a scowl and the movie lost me by the three-quarter mark. I was just glad when it finished.Spiderman, the CGI creation doesn't look any more real than he did the first time out to me. Additionally, it grated on my nerves that he was apparently able to defy the gravitational constant and swing around the city like he had a jet-pack strapped to his arse. It was like Van Helsing all over again.And since when was Spiderman indestructible? Or able to stop buildings from falling? Maybe I missed those comics as a kid but I don't remember him having those kinds of powers. Agility, yes. Spiderlike wall-climbing ability, yes. Super strong webs, yes. Regeneration, yes. But not being immune to damage or able to resist tons of pressure.Then there's my perennial favourite gripe - physics. If you put a comic-book character into a supposedly ""real world"" situation, then you better stick to physics at all times or your movie ends up looking dumb. My example here is dumping what amounted to a small star in the Hudson River. Not only do we not get the steam-flash explosion that would probably have been as devastating as the star going up itself, but we don't even get a hint of warm water. Not even a tiny hot-spring effect. Just the star and Doc Ock serenely sinking to the bottom of the river. Bah!Other items which surprised me were the face pulling exploits of Tobey Maguire when he was stuck on the front of the train. Talk about ugly! I haven't seen a face that contorted since the decompression effects in Total Recall! And they say he can't act!Speaking of faces. What's with Kirsten Dunst? Her face when acting out any kind of emotional scene (other than terror) was, as my partner put it, ""a face like a half-p***ed cat!"" Not pretty!So, the movie loses it after the halfway mark. If you can put up with the nonsense then it's a pretty good film, livened up by Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi cameos and some nice gags and one-liners. But don't expect anything but silliness from the second half.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-sequel-tastic,"My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about.But every now and again a sequel comes along that just simply changes your perceptions and gives you faith in a continuing franchise where the sequel is just as or in the case of Spiderman 2 better than it's predecessor.Toby Maquire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco return with director Sam Raimi who has done a terrific job in making this for me one of the best sequels of all time.One of the successes Spiderman 2 has is the depth of the characters and stories as there is more than one strand. Toby Maquire has the same natural ability which he possessed in the first film to accurately convey the character of Peter Parker who struggles with his feelings for Mary Jane who becomes frustrated that he can't return her feelings for him, to his fractured friendship with Harry Osborne who harbours a deep grudge against Spiderman to trying to balance his life as superhero, student and employee and struggling with his Aunt May over Uncle Ben's death to finally battling the new villain Oto Octavious played memorably by Alfred Molina and all these story strands thread there way through two hours of pure entertainment.With the main story and these sub-stories the film could have become confusing and meaningless but thanks to the sublime artistry from Sam Raimi, it flows beautifully and never loses sight of itself.Which goes to say the acting is as brilliant from the main cast which helps the film has more exploration and depth and the special effects this time round are flawless and much improved on the first.This has everything for the comic fans and those who just want to be entertained of action (which there is plenty of particularly towards the end) drama, romance and humour mostly from JK Simmons who when he was on screen I was laughing out loud.Credit goes to all involved and I very much look forward to Spiderman 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Mature, nuanced and layered; the superhero genre at some of its very best.","It's hard to decide whether or not I prefer this film to the first, as it tells - in some ways - a more mature, nuanced and layered tale, but what isn't hard to decide is that 'Spider-Man 2 (2004)' is a fantastic movie and easily one of the best sequels of all time. The villain is wonderfully rounded, his motivations constantly clear and his character arc drawn in full before the credits roll, and presents both a physical and psychological challenge for our hero. The story expertly balances the phenomenally fun yet still emotionally resonant web-slinging sequences (a high-speed train in danger provides one of the feature's nicest character moments whereas the whole 'bank' section is amazingly accomplished and thunderously entertaining) with the relatable central dilemma of our very human protagonist. Raimi's directing seems to be stepped up a little, too, as he leans further into his own quirky style - evident in the renowned 'surgery' scene which is one of the best in the entire film. The entire piece just gels together to make a cohesive, complex and rare example of the superhero genre at some of its very best. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man some more... please!,"After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented.Spider-man 2 is a great sequel for many reasons. First it ties right into the original without skipping a beat. Set a few years after the original with all the same actors and characters. Though it differentiates itself enough from the original so you're not watching a clone of the first. It dives deeper into the psyche and the experiences of its main character in order for you to gain a greater understanding of his situation. At the same time it still provide great visuals, pulse pounding action sequences, humorous side sequences and breath taking special effects and camera work. This movies stands head and shoulders above all super hero comic movies. It delivers what a movie goer seeks and leaves them gasping for more. Immediately after viewing, I was pondering what they will do with the next installment and i am sure that the majority of the viewers were thinking the same thing.The movie is strung together in a great sequence that never ever bores the viewer. The new villain gets a good intro which explains his situation in a neat and tidy manor. Doctor Otto Octavius is a perfect villain which is played and visually represented to perfection. The movements of Doc Ock are fantastic. It's just as i would have pictured it in my mind, if i could... while watching the cartoons or reading the comics. Only Raimi presents it in a way that connects the loose visuals in our minds with the visual reality (of course with the aid of computers).Some may complain about there being too much story, too much Peter Parker and not enough action. One must realize that if it were the other way around, that you'd be complaining that there wasn't enough storyline. People are so hard to please. Even with this seemingly flawless movie people still find something to complain about. The only thing i didn't understand was the presence of Ursala, the daughter of Peter's landlord. What was her role in all of this?Anyways, i just bought the DVD for this and realized that i should voice my opinion especially seeing how low of a score this movie got in contrast with what i would score it.Action:10 Directing:10 Acting:10 Re-watchability(if thats even a word):10Overall rating: 10 out of 10... bravo!Bring on part 3 whoever the villain might be.

"not great, but a step up from the first one","I was very under-whelmed by the first Spider-Man movie, a tepid affair with a poorly constructed story and some ridiculous script inconsistencies. So my expectations for the sequel were pretty low. But this is really a pretty good movie. The script writing is still sloppy, but it doesn't have any of the glaring problems that plagued the original.The movie varies, but is notable for some truly shining moments. The best parts of the film are those that focus not on the action but on the humanity; there is a wonderful scene at the end of the subway sequence and a very affecting ending.The movie has a good pace and more convincingly combines action and human elements.

A Flawless Super Hero Movie,"This is what a good summer movie should be.Spider-Man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero. Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask. Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider-Man 2, we are plunged into a world of shadows and off colors.Picking up two years after the first Spider-Man left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has his hands full with three full-time jobs. He is going to school full time, he is working full time to pay off his rent, and he is a hero always on call whenever he hears a siren. Not to mention, we see the emotional toll that has been taken on him, his only surviving family member, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), has become consumed with grief and loss over the death of her husband (incidentally, creating Spider-Man in the first part), Peter's friend Norman Osborne (James Franco) is now at odds with him since he has become consumed with revenge over Spider-Man killing his father (the Green Goblin), and his love affair with Mary Jane-Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is slowly being extinguished because he is never there for her to return the feelings she has for him. And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.As Spider-Man, Parker is even in danger of losing his powers as his exhaustion slowly begins to take over. Is it medical or is it because he has stretched himself too thin? Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man to finally bring peace into his life. There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter-ego from the first part before the mutated spider bite as he puts on his glasses again, clouding his vision to the world around him. When he sees someone being beaten up in an alley, he turns around to walk away. When the familiar sirens fly past him again, he just eats a hot dog. In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker.In the midst of all of this, we see the creation of a new villain, this time in the form of a deranged scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has four frighteningly powerful arms welded to his spine after a disaster with his life's work. This disaster not only turns the Doctor into Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock as the papers call him), but the artificially intelligent arms seemed fuse to his id, placating his desires to not want his life's work to be a failure. Doc Ock will try again at the expense of anyone around him.The standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart-wrenchingly done in his hesitations. For a man so used to having quick reflexes, when he has to slow down and realize what is going on around him, we are instantly in his head. Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider-Man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic.Sam Raimi also does a knock-out job as well, knowing when to hold on a character's face long enough or swinging the camera along with Spider-Man to give the audience the exhilaration of flight. Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero.Spider-Man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most? In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses. Seemingly, we have entered the bizarro world of sequels, where they seem to surpass the original (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 2, etc) and Spider-Man 2 definitely joins these ranks. Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider-Man 2 also suggests.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Don't really see what the big deal is....,"OK, so I wasn't one of the people that flocked to see this movie right away, but I saw the hype it received on here so I thought I'd check it out.Let me just say, I really don't understand the big deal surrounding this movie. Maybe for some comic book fans, or people who are into the whole superhero genre, this may be your thing, but to me, this movie was better than average, but nothing amazing.This movie did have a few clever moments, some of the scenes and laughs were cheesy funny, but reading some comments on the message board about this movie being hilarious, I really didn't think so.The fight scenes were OK, the train scene was probably the best scene in the movie, and the interaction with the people on the train was more of a classic movie moment than the scenes with MJ and the Aunt.SM 2 also seemed slow at times. I understand that character development is a major part in this movie, so that this can be at least a trilogy, but the first movie was a little more fun throughout. There were numerous times myself along with people i noticed around me, yawning and looking around in a few spots in the movie.I just don't see how this movie can't be ranked so high on the IMDb board....

~ MORE Web-Slinging Fun ~,"Normally sequels are hugely disappointing in comparison to the original film. So it's hard to believe that they could even come close to topping this movies original, alas they do!Picking up where the first movie starts off and introducing several new comic book regulars, we bypass the history establishing story of the original and head straight into what life is like for Peter Parker being a college student, Spiderman, and trying to hold down a job.This time Spidey must face the likes of Doc Ock, portrayed by Alfred Molina (he's come a long way since Indiana Jones cameos) excellently. Once again they couldn't have picked a better actor to portray the villain Spiderman has to face.Spiderman must take out Doc, save the city, save the girl, and still get good grades.The action sequences once again are entrancing and the story is well written.

"Better than the first- Sam Raimi proves his cool knack for balancing elements of action, drama and comedy","Spider-man 2, at least, accomplishes one thing above all else- this time, when the Spidey flings himself through the air, it doesn't look as fake as it did in the first film. If anything, this time I did feel the exhilaration that the filmmakers intended. They, being the team at Edge FX, have taken the huge lot of profit from the first film, which became the smash of smashes in the comic-book movie genre, and on that end the film is a success. But even on the human front with characterization the film is a bit of an improvement, which is always tricky for a sequel to do. Two major action sequences involving Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) and his nemesis, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina, in a compelling turn), are shot and edited to a wonderful, creative impact. And, in an interesting bit when Doc Ock escapes a hospital, echoes of Raimi's Evil Dead comes through with subtle, if grin-inducing touches. The work done on the villain as well as the hero shows, and it helps that Ock is a sleeker, more threatening presence with his mechanical arms than the weird madman in Willem Dafoe's performance.There are also other factors that give Spider-Man 2 it's worth of entertainment, even as if follows story turns that we as the audience have seen in plenty of other movies (comic-book or otherwise) from Hollywood. There's a nice dosage of humor to tip the scale on the romantic/non-romantic drama, courtesy of J.K. Simmons' added time as the over the top newspaper editor, and as well to a few bits of business in dealing with the problems of being a guy in a costume (plus, there are a couple of fun cameos from some Raimi regulars). The performances aren't bad by the leads, but they haven't improved too well, and with the script that they're given some of the lines don't work as well as they should. Some are appropriate in their corny quality, some aren't. One of the key performances that comes through is Rosemary Harris' Aunt May, who's the most effective of the dramatic parts to the story.So, is Spider-man 2 as great as everyone's saying, that it's one of the great sequels and comic-book films of all time? To me, almost- it actually gets even more engrossing and interesting in its comic-book atmosphere on repeat viewings. It has a fresh appeal as a mainstream, thoughtful action film and, like Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy in the horror genre, it will live on when other superhero movies bite the dust in the video market.

eh...the original is better,"I'm sensing a new trend here. A few years ago, everybody agreed that sequels pretty much reek. But now, studios are ""pumping up"" their sequels with more money and more hype, and suddenly, it's cool to say that installment number two is better than its predecessor. Directors have jumped on the bandwagon - they'll happily admit that their earlier efforts pale in comparison to their latest blockbusters - and critics are following suit. ""X2"" was judged better than ""X-Men,"" when it wasn't, and now ""Spider-Man 2"" is being universally hailed as better than its predecessor...which it isn't.Trouble is, the only thing that's really better about this movie is - come on, you can guess it - the special effects. The CGI Spidey looks better. He moves well. The fights are beautifully choreographed. But you know what? He's still CGI. And a good special effect is still nothing more than a momentary diversion. It's the script that counts.And this script is old news. At one point, it was rumored that the movie was to be subtitled ""Spider-Man No More."" They should've just called it ""More of Spider-Man,"" because it's a rehash of the original. We get more of Spidey being a loser (a lot more...like an hour), more of Spidey mooning over Mary Jane, more heroism in a burning building, and more evil scientists with a serious case of hubris who decide to tamper with forces that are best left alone. It's a virtual remake, only without the cool origin story and the iconic scene on the bridge. Even Uncle Ben makes a return appearance, but in a form so cheesy and strange it must be seen to be disbelieved.I must admit that Alfred Molina's Doc Ock makes a great villain; he's both a sympathetic character and a kickass opponent for Spidey. The scene when he awakens after his ""accident"" is truly horrifying, effective stuff. But I couldn't understand his plan, or care a whit about his giant gizmo. So many important plot points are glossed over, particularly the exact nature of his tentacles (What do they actually want? To steal an exasperated actor's catchphrase, what's their motivation?)Many of the things that happen to Spider-Man are inexplicable, too. He's supposed to be making some big life choices in this movie, but his decisions seem to be dictated more by unexplained physical changes that he's experiencing, and not his own judgment. One thing that the script does make clear, however, is the moral of the story, which is pounded into Spidey's head every time he asks for some gaseous advice from a friend or loved one.Right, griping done. Certainly an entertaining movie, and the train segment is fabulous. But the first was better, make no mistake. Refined CGI is not the key to a superior film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
See this one.,"WOW.I had low expectations after Spiderman 1. Spider Guy 2 is a blowout, take no prisoners, roller coaster ride of a film. It's got it all: great story line, edge of your seat action, romance, humor, fine acting, break neck pace,.well, you get the idea.This film is for the whole family. Great chase scenes, crashes, and special effects for the guys. Romance, and a tender love story for the gals. Comic book touches for the kids. It just works so well on every level.McGuire and Dunst have a chemistry that reminded me of Niles and Daphne in ""Frasier."" They loved each other from afar, and could not communicate their feelings to each other. The romantic tension was exquisite. So it is here with McGuire and Dunst. You know they have to get together at some point, but the long and difficult road is a journey we enjoy.The villain is definitely top shelf. Without revealing too much, suffice it to say that he's bad enough, scary enough, and convincing enough to make the film work on the plot level.The special effects are well done, especially where Spiderman has to save passengers on a speeding train.Spiderman has self doubts, begins to lose his powers, and longs to be Peter Parker instead of a superhero. He struggles with his choices in life, as we all do. He makes difficult choices, and learns that truth and integrity are rewarded, even when the results are very painful for the aunt who has replaced his mother.You might see films with a deeper message, but you won't see many films that combine action, romance, and meaning in one slick package.

Best movie from raimi's trilogy!,"Oh man what an amazing movie this was! Sam Raimi really did an amazing job with this one. The storyline, direction, screenplay everything was so good in this movie.To start elaborate first let's talk about the villain of Dr. Otto Octavius which is being portrayed by Alfred Molina and he did really good job in acting department. The character itself is really good that you'll won't even notice that when it turned into villain. This movie doesn't feel like the first one where greeb goblin single handedly carried the movie on his shoulders despite the amazing performance of tobey maguire. Both Maguire & Molina did good job contributing in this film with their respective characters.Other cast didn't had that much involvement in the movie except I'll say parker's aunt may but even she didn't had that much involvement but raimi didn't waste the time on them just used them whenever he wanted and that's it.The ending was really good and probably my favorite ending in any Spider-Man film it didn't felt like something was left behind or some questions remained unanswered or anything like that.Overall it was a really amazing movie and an improvement over the first installment of raimi's trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""At least we still get the toaster!""","Spider-Man 2 (2004)-I really liked the Graphic Novel recap of the first film in the opening credits, not only did it summarise the events succinctly, but it was also beautifully drawn and a reminder of the stories origins as a comic book.I don't think that there is any question that this film was better than the third instalment, but for me, it just falls a tiny bit short of the first. It tried a bit harder to achieve something better and it showed, which ultimately took a layer of shine off of it.Don't get me wrong, I'm just picking at nits, because it's still a good film.The use of Doctor Octopus (Ock) was a good choice of ""Villain"" and Alfred Molina did a great job of delivering the role.Tobey also gives the same cute and thoughtful Spider-Man, but the inept Peter Parker bit was overused and didn't seem to fit with what we know he can do, because of his abilities. His pre-cognitive ""Spider Sense"" seemed to have failed him completely as he got bumped in to and repeatedly hit over the head on the way in to school. I realise that they were trying to show how he had taken on too much, but it just seemed to make him a loser and not the hero I tuned in for.I've gone off of James Franco lately though, I'm not sure that we'd get along in real life, as he continues with projects that are definitely not my thing and he is actually very wooden in this one. Also, he is alleged to have called Tobey ""Frog Face"", which upset him, so I can't forgive him for that.I'm not a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst either. I thought that she was amazing in 'Interview With A Vampire' (1994), but her character in this film was annoying and whiney. Maybe I have been spoiled by Zendaya in the Tom Holland Spidey films, as she is much cooler, but this MJ was frustrating to watch.Other than that, it is a film that is easy to watch, with a relatively good story and the main issues of the title character and his battles with Doc Ock are what you need from a film based on a comic book.The CGI has been improved from the last one and as a whole the film flows very well. I really like the train scene and Ock's lair is cool. Credit to the set department for that.There are some really great moments in this one, some humour, action and Tobey is quite emotive in his role. It also has the same balance as the first, where it is just cheesey enough to be a fantasy story, but still grounded in a reality similar to our real world.

"""Face it, Tiger ...","... you just hit the jackpot"", Mary Jane Watson ~ Dialogue straight out of the comic book ensuring that this sequel is going to be well worth the wait! OK, not quite as good as the first - sequels seldom are - but a valiant effort on the part of Sam Raimi.Here we have the next big Super Villain, Dr Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), who is about to further complicate Spider-Man's (Tobey Maguire) already failing personal life: Parker is experiencing financial difficulties and his studies are slipping. To top it all off, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is now engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Parker's overbearing newspaper editor, Jonah. Things just go from bad to worse for the web-slinger.Meanwhile, following the death of his father (the Green Goblin), Harry Osborn has now now taken over Oscorp Industries and is in business talks with Dr Otto Octavius. The Doctor, Parker's idol, has created a set of mechanical arms that are impervious to heat and magnetism; the experiment goes wrong and the arms become fused to the spine of Octavius, taking complete control of the doctor both mentally and physically.Aunt May is later captured and taken hostage by Dr Octopus. Spider-Man too falls prey to capture and is delivered to Harry, where his true identity is under threat. How much can one guy take? 'Spider-Man 2' is all about choices for Peter Parker: lose his alter-ego and concentrate on number one or continue with the responsibility he chose after the death of Uncle Ben ~ Raimi has skillfully recreated the classic scene - panel-for-panel - from Amazing Spider-Mam #50, Spider-Man No More, written by Stan Lee, pencilled by John Romita, and inked by Mickey Dimeo. Here Parker is seen leaving a rainy alleyway where his discarded costume hangs from the throat of a garbage can. Raimi has concentrated on the Parker who is forced to deal with actual everyday problems in Spider-Man 2, one we can all sympathize with. Parker's character outweighs that of other superheroes, for the simple fact that - at heart - he is just an ordinary guy trying to exist in a complicated world.Also stars: Bill Nunn, J K Simmons, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell with Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I don't quite get it...,"Most of the time when a film is hugely popular, I end up agreeing with the majority, especially when it's an action/scifi flick. With both ""Spiderman"" movies, I've disagreed.Perhaps I'm simply too much of a nerd to appreciate the very human spin Spiderman has been given by Maguire, though I should venture to say I've never collected comic books, and my familiarity with this particular series is limited to the old Fox Saturday morning cartoons (remember the days when those were something to look forward to?). I'm sorry, but I don't sympathize with the saintlike, penniless genius who's going through a major crisis and responds in a manner that suggests he's quite in touch with his feminine side. Not to imply anything about his sexuality, of course, but I'm an adherent to old-school macho stoicism, and Peter Parker does not display it, despite pursuing a ""great power brings great responsibility"" lifestyle. How about the responsibility not to become an emotional wreck? I guess being a superhero is hard on the wallet, but I'm sure there's a way he could make things work without breaking any laws. I don't recall his financial situation being quite so dire in the cartoon, and if it is indeed an affectation of this particular rendering, it is an unnecessary one.Maguire's attempts were somehow more acceptable in Spiderman (1) when he was a full-scale high school geek. Now that he's a superhero, I have trouble forgiving the unterminable stupid look on his face. Additionally, Kirsten Dunst doesn't make me think of MJ Watson, or a community heartthrob.The comic book story of the movie takes up half its total showing time at most, and is fairly simple and formulaic. Scientist loses sight of his original philanthropic intentions and commits dire offenses in the name of progress. The film fails to explain why Octavian's AI tentacles have so much stock in the success of his project. I realize they think, but why should they *care*?The quality of the film, ignoring the genre it's in, is certainly less than most give it. Iffy CGI, an inability to decide exactly what sort of movie it is, comedy/romance/action/drama? leads to unbalanced distribution of time for its scenes. It has a poor ending, as well, suffering from the more forgivable LOTR 3's multiple fades as all the loose ends are tied up. Still, let me be positive for a moment, after all, I rated it a 6. The acting is good, the action well-choreographed, and the drama occasionally moving, and it scores on most of its comic notes, even if Spiderman hits the bottom of an alley a few too many times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Over-hyped and Overrated!,"The first movie was much better than this bomb, mainly because of Willem Dafoe and his fine acting. I can't fathom how critics say Tobey pouting and whining throughout the first half of this way too long movie was character development. The first movie established Parker as a loser and we didn't need to spend nearly an hour watching a depressed Maguirre sulk his way through the movie.The action sequences were nothing special, and were much too drawn out and boring. Overall this movie was all too predictable. It tried to copy the Return of the Kings into tricking the viewer with false endings (although anyone who read LOTR would know they were not false endings). Dunst was annoying as MJ and as usual tends to overact. Without Dafoe in this movie the performance came from J.K Simmons who had provided comic relief in a limited role.As a whole this movie is slightly better than the dreadful Daredevil and Batman and Robin.

"Well worth the wait, what a movie!","Spider-Man 2 picks up where the original film left off, this time showing the more difficult hardships of being a superhero. Standing in the way is Dr. Otto Octavius(Doc Ock) a brilliant scientist whose fusion experiment goes awry at a demonstration Peter attends.The story, and characters are fleshed out more this time out, as well as the effects. Kirsten Dunst is more convincing as MJ, she seemed a little flat in the role last time. Here she, like the rest of the cast, do a convincing job. The top performance has to go to Alfred Molina. In the short screen time Otto has before he becomes a diabolical powerhouse supervillain, he is an endearing, likable person. Spider-Man 2 also offers more confidence in it's story telling. The ""raindrops"" sequence is an evident example. Not afraid to go full nine, this movie is the definitive comic book movie, possessing action, drama, comedy, and message(without being too preachy). Director Sam Raimi and crew really nailed it this time around. Be sure to check out comic artist Alex Ross' paintings spliced in the opening credits, entailing the events of the first film.

Spiderman 1.5,"Poor Peter Parker (McGuire) has a crappy life and can't ever catch a break. Then he gets powers and takes up the mantle of spider-man, but that only causes him more grief. One of his scientist mentors then undergoes a dangerous experiment that gives him powers but warps his mind, who then goes out of his way to attack May Parker (Harris) and Mary Jane (Dunst). I know what you're thinking ""Laserwolf65, I thought this is a review for Spider-man 2, not Spider-man."" Well my inquisitive friend, you have already found the major flaw in this sequel, it's the exact same movie as the first one, with only a few new cast members, and subtle sub plot changes.The movie starts off with peter parker getting laid off from his second job as a pizza delivery boy. We then find out that he can't pay his rent, his aunt is about to lose her house, he's losing his friendship to Harry (Franco), Mary Jane and Peter still have a love-hate relationship, his report on doctor Otto Octavius (Molina) is late, and to top it all off, his powers are no longer working correctly.As the movie progresses Peter tries to remedy all of these problems, slowing down the main plot and lengthening the movie to over two hours. Spider-man doesn't even make an appearance (besides a brief sequence of him delivering a pizza with the suit on) until about forty minutes into it. The movie might as well be called: Peter Parker.After over an hour the villain finally makes his appearance. Doctor Otto Octavius has created a machine that will produce a small sun-like reaction, which will produce cheap, renewable electrical energy using a fuel source called tritium, an element so rare that only twenty-five pounds of it exists (because we all know that cheap energy uses a non-renewable extremely rare element). So if that bit of science nonsense didn't faze you, how about this: In order to control it the good doctor created a harness with four long arms to handle the reaction. He also gave them each artificial intelligence (for apparently no reason), but don't worry, he built an extremely small and flimsy inhibitor chip that will stop them from taking over his mind. A few minutes into the experiment, the chip is busted, and Otto goes rogue terrorizing the city.The problems with this movie are rampant. First, almost every important scene in the first Spider-man movie is repeated in Spidey 2. The scene where Goblin talks in the mirror is changed to Otto talking to his arms. The scene on the bridge where the citizens tell their love of spider is changed to patrons on a train telling their love of spidey. The list goes on and on. Secondly, while Molina does an all right job as Octavius, he's hardly in the movie at all. Instead, his screen time is taken away to focus on the completely moronic and unbelievable love triangle between Peter, Mary Jane, and her fiancé John. Also, Raimi tries to infuse comedy into the movie where it doesn't belong. This includes an Asian lady singing the old spider-man TV show theme and Spider-man telling children to eat their green vegetables. None of these events are funny, and almost all of them are groan inducing. Indeed the only thing that is funny is J. Jonah Jameson, but sadly he's not too important a character and his scenes are few and far between. Finally there's the moronic explanation for why his powers aren't working (""maybe I'm not supposed to be spider-man"" he thinks to himself.), and the painfully obvious setup for the next movie involving Harry Osborn.This movie really only has two redeeming qualities; it's special effects (which are much better than the last movie's), and the Jameson scenes. Other than that it is simply a badly made remake of the first one. That said it's still better than the first movie (although that's not too hard a feat to achieve). **1/2/*****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fun Compelling Popcorn Movie,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling to make ends meet and having a hard time keeping his secret. He can't even keep his pathetic pizza delivery job.

He is now funding Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) and his work on fusion. However something goes wrong in his demonstration and a new villain is born.Director Sam Raimi is able to inject a bit of spidey fun in this movie. The internal struggle in Peter Parker about his identity is very compelling. And Alfred Molina makes for a great villain. I especially like J.K. Simmons as Jameson. They're great characters.

On Par With The First Installment,"This sequel starts with the hero, Peter Parker (Tobey MaGuire), in a bad place. Every part of his life is in shambles.

Can anything else go wrong?Thanks to physics that are other-worldly and a style that emphasizes some of the cartoonish aspects of the story, this episode of Spider-Man keeps the lightness of the first episode: not as much as the original Batman television show, for example, but much more than the Batman films that came later, which used a dark tone for gravitas and style.About the only character who seems detached from the central story, in terms of realism, is Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who delivers some archetypal wisdomAs in the first installment, the special effects are the best part of this film.

Probably the best of Tobey Maguire's Spidey,"Revisiting a massive early 2000s blockbuster and the early days of Marvel cinema is an interesting one. Frankly a lot of them are hits (first two X men movies) and misses (third X men movie and Daredevil).This one falls in-between.Sam Raimi is great with two things: great visuals and campy horror. But for me personally, there's always a different thing missing and I can't always pin point what it is. The Evil Dead series did not impress me (the second one being pretty much a remake of the original except with a different ending), did not enjoy Oz the Great and Powerful and I really couldn't stand the third Spider-Man movie.In this film, the piling on of troubles that Peter Parker has seems endless, but it does cut to the core of what makes his character so appealing and relatable. Doc Oc was actually a little more developed and understandable than most supervillains of that era. The malfunctioned chip in his neck makes his multiple arms control him rather than other way around as it was originally intended before the unfortunate accident.MJ, sadly for me just felt extremely flat to me. Although Kirsten Dunst is wonderful and she does her best with what she's given, the script just doesn't allow her to be a fleshed out character the way hers is supposed to be. She is either the damsel in distress or the token love interest that makes or breaks Peter. It's not that she's a bad character by any means - but there was an opportunity for her to be fleshed out, complex and interesting, even if she wasn't the main character. And she just isn't.The very best part of this movie? Jonah Jameson. I LOVED his character. He is absolutely hilarious and JK Simmons does an excellent job at portraying this high-energy, fast talking short fused anti-Spiderman newspaper mogul. I honestly wouldn't mind having an entire film featured on him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I don't see what everyone sees in this movie,"This movie was horrible. It might be that I'm not a big super hero fan to begin with, or that I actually know something about science, or maybe I'm confused on what a bad screenplay is defined as. To begin with I found a lot of the dialogue very awkward and full of clichés. The line ""Go get 'em tiger"" should never be used unless as a joke in a movie. There were others too. Then there were some plot holes. Why would Dr. Octavius give his mechanical arms artificial intelligence, much less why did he need them in the first place? I know he needed them to set the story up but at least explain why he needs them. Second of all it really wouldn't have been too hard for the screenwriters to take 5 minutes to get a general idea of what nuclear fusion is. They were right in that fusion takes place in the sun. Thats about all they had right. Fusion is when you combine two atoms, generally hydrogen, to form larger atoms, usually helium. This releases a ton of energy. First of all fusion reactions release so much energy that they can't be used to create energy simply because they destroy everything around them. The movie has Dr. Octavius testing his new form of fusion in the middle of NYC - which would most likely destroy the entire city. The hydrogen bomb is nothing more than a fusion reaction. People are working to create ""cold fusion"" which would be a fusion reaction but at a temperature low enough that it won't destroy anything within a few miles of it. Then Tridium or whatever they had in the movie doesn't even exist. Much less spinning it and firing lasers at it definitely won't make if fuse together. Then at the end of the movie they solve the problem of the uncontrolled fusion reaction by putting it in the river. That is the absolute worst thing they could do. Whenever you heat water to extreme temperatues - even a fraction of the temperature of fusion - it separates into hydrogen and oxygen. You might remember the three mile island incident a while back. That was caused by water entering a nuclear reactor and creating hydrogen, which easily blows up. At the end of the movie the entire river and city should have blown up due to the massive amount hydrogen created from the fusion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great entertaining movie,"I'm not a spider man fan, but I started to become one after the first movie appear. The second has some things that were missing in the first, like the appreciation for spider man's work. If I was a super hero I would like to have some consideration for putting wrong things right, so I think the worst spider man enemy is the press. This is just a movie, but in real life the press has also the power to turn a good man in ""the bad guy"". The other thing that I loved in the movie was the combination of the psychological with the physical aspects, where the first ones overcome the second, like regular people. The mind will always defeat the body and super heroes are no exception. The end couldn't be better, super hero or not, he has also his needs that can't be ignored.

Best Spider-man Film,"Spider-man 2 is a perfect example of a film with a good story with lots of action, drama, entertainment, and has a good love story. This film surpasses the first one and despite the fact I had high expectations for this film, those expectations were sufficiently met. This is the best spider-man film.Sam Raimi returns as the director in this popular movie series. This film covers the emotional battle of Peter Parker and it is handled perfectly. Peter is torn between his duties as Spider-man, his responsibilities as a student, and most of all, his emotions. The result is Peter is uncertain what he wants and what he should do. The ultimate theme, the true test of a hero! What are the choices that Spider-man makes and the actions of those choices. They will define and determine the fate of his character, Spider-man. This story of Spidey's problems is handled perfectly alongside the story behind Doctor Octopus. The special effects in the movie are very good! Although some of the effects at times seemed obviously fake and way overdone! One of which I disliked was the Spider-man/Doc Ock battle on the skyscraper! Other than that, the special effects of the film were very satisfying.Tobey Maguire returns in perhaps his best performance of the movie series. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are back as Mary Jane and Harry Osborne. I think Franco has a better performance as Harry in this film over the first film. But yet again, just as in the first film, the villain steals the show. Alfred Molina portrays Dr. Octopus. My personal favorite spider-man villain aside from Venom. He handles the character terrificly and the character is used perfectly as well. A good hearted man trapped in a mechanical and ""superior"" intelligence. Molina has the appearance and attitude of Doc Ock. He takes a very serious approach to Doc Ock which is very satisfying. He is a dangerous threat instead of a sometimes viewed old, crazy, and laughable villain. One of the best performances by an actor on a super-villain. He did not disappoint. J.K. Simmons returns in his humorous role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell makes a hysterical cameo appearance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May and in this film, her character is more influential than ever! Her character has always been important to Peter but in this film her role is most significant. She has always been there for Peter but in this film she is able to provide Peter with the most wisdom and guidance he has ever needed. Her character is perfectly portrayed in this film. She is used as a pivotal necessity which is exploited wonderfully.Just an outstanding movie with an outstanding story and an outstanding usage of secondary characters! One of the best comic book films ever made and a true compliment to the Spider-man character. A fantastic film! The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it does not seem as captivating as other movies. It is a good film but I do not really get sucked into it near as much as I do with movies I give higher ratings. An outstanding movie, a must see by spidey lovers and spidey haters alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"My dreams came true, but partially","I watched almost all the episodes of classical Spider-Man animated series and I am familiar with the comic book, even if I did not read it, just a few of them. Like The original The Batman animated series, Spider Man animated series is a masterpiece, on all counts, characters, story, story editing, script, direction (or should I say drawings) etc. As for the adaptations, I have never thought that Sam Raimi is the right guy for this project. Yes, sometimes, there might be exceptions, an unexpected director gets an unexpected success, but I believe that someone who has a grasp of the field should take the project. However, as said, there might be some exceptions, positively or negatively, for example, Bryan Singer's X-Men movies were great and he seemed a perfect choice for Superman Returns, but it was a huge disappointment. Sam Raimi did a good job, but particularly. Spider Man 2 surpassed the first movie by far, but I had been almost sure for that, especially technically, so did not surprise. As for expectations (dreams) the movie meets some. Tobey Maguire makes us believe that he is Peter Parker /Spider Man and I have no complaint about that, but pretty different from the original character, not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of personality. The original Peter Parker character is beefy, this Peter Parker is so thin, he is a bit glitzy boy and not a loser exactly like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker. There is one enemy, Dr. Octopus in the movie, in the comic book and the animated series I love, as you know, Spider Man fights more than one enemy at the same time and it causes amazing moments. Sadly, some people complained about this in Spider Man 3, so the filmmakers have sworn not to make room for more than one enemy. However, to me, absolutely, the problem is not this formula does not work, it is the fault of the directors. In Spider Man 3, it did not work because of Raimi and script, especially you know Venom stuff. However, Tim Burton did, didn't he? (Batman Returns, The Catwoman and Penguin) Some details are also missed in Raimi's Spider Man movies. These details might be not important for some people, but they are a part of dreams (expectations) For example. Spider Man is a chatterbox, so he talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in and those lines are very humorous. In the movies, we have none. Sam Raimi creates his own world, makes his own humor, the tone of the movie, the atmosphere are not based on the comic book or the animated series, it is far different. Spider Man movies, the first, 2 and even 3 are great fun, also feel yourself good movies at times, but every time I am upset because of those. Raimi cannot adapt the mood, the atmosphere and the humor. Visually, yellow tones are dominant, in the comic book and the animation, visually, it is great. How is called? Use of city. Raimi cannot use of city well. Now, let's about the content of the movie. There are some brainwave moments in the movie like the stained clothes in the launderette. The first short action scene shows the improvement of the movie, so technically perfect, it is a very stylish scene also. The platonic love between Parker and Mary Jane is realistic, I mean one sided love. Thankfully, Raimi makes Spider cruise in the air, those images are dazzling, he does not miss this detail as he did some other ones. However, personally, it was not enough for me, because I just love that, so it could have been longer, it should have been longer. However, there are some too unrealistic moments in the movie, for example, he tries to jump from a roof to another, but falls down. All your bones are broken and you die! Or he is not shocked when he pulls out the plugs. The positive hype of the hospital part is true, in this part, even if you don't know who is the director, you understand it is Sam Raimi. J. Jonah Jameson is cartoonish unfortunately, he imitates him, does not interpret him. The first big action sequence is one of the best sequences of the movie, to me second best. It is very very smart, especially the choreography and editing, very brilliant. And perfection in visual effects. In terms of action, yes Raimi's movie meets all the expectations and dreams come true. Action is a bit less, but satisfying and the movie was not boring. The second Spider Octopus fight is the best action sequence of the movie and my personal favorite. Again very brilliant choreography and very brilliant editing. Real amazing. However, Raimi uses some showy tricks like the forward traveling to the end of the rail (Batman Begins used it too) And another illogical, unrealistic stuff. Your leg is real seriously broken, if you do that! even further injury may be. He is not Superman. A problem of the movie is that Peter Parker is a very thin and the most important feeble boy, but when he wears Spider Man costume and becomes Spider Man, he becomes very powerful as if he is the son of Superman!! This really flaws. Then, some real touching (and humorous) moments. There is something in it. Returning to the relationship between Parker and Jane, realism is ruined and fantasy takes the place of it.

Nothing you haven't seen before,"In all fairness, Spider-man 2 is not that bad. Mostly it's just dumb and overplayed, just like its much ballyhooed predecessor, which people also liked more than it deserved. I don't have anything against Sam Raimi (except Darkman) or Spider-man the character, but folks, these films just aren't that good. Spider-man 2 has moments where it takes off and is exhilarating, but only moments; most of the movie is like your overweight uncle who talks too much at the holidays. You don't really mind him but you wish he'd shut up and leave.After roping in the heart of every fanboy by starting off the movie with copious artwork by their anointed Michaelangelo, Alex Ross (who is admittedly talented but does the same thing over and over), or someone paid to imitate his work, they recap the first tepid adventure of Spidey and then proceed to make mostly the same mistakes they did the first time. We get all the histrionics of a relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but none of the build-up; these two have spent four minutes together on screen and they talk like they were lovers for years. Then we're saddled with Harry Osborn (James Franco), who really should have completed, or started, his acting lessons. The first half hour of the film is one painful scene after another in a pointless attempt to establish Peter Parker as Charlie Brown. Ziggy isn't as much of a loser as this guy. It gets old, really fast, and I was checking my watch after the thirty-five minute mark.Thankfully Alfred Molina comes in as Doc Ock to give a little oomph to the proceedings. Long one of the lamest characters in comics, Ock here is a pretty decent guy who just wants to make things better. Molina's pretty good until of course he has to go on the necessary rampage, which is inspired by the death of a loved one and some splashy special effects, and then finally we get a chance for the film to get good. Spidey and Doc Ock's first fight is really terrific  it zings, it soars, it wakes you up from the wincing half-slumber you'd fallen into. Sadly, Spider-man then takes off his costume again, so we get a bunch of Dawson's Creek reject scenes with him and Mary Jane, who has obviously fallen in love with him even though she's only exchanged seventeen words of dialogue with him (and she has a hunky new beau played by Daniel Gillies). When Spidey and Ock go at it again, the movie once more comes to life, and follows that pattern; Spidey okay, Peter dull.Trouble is, they have a pretty strong ending that is only slightly overdone (subtle by this movie's standards) and gives the audience exactly what they want. So those few who are going to spot the film's many and obvious flaws are going to forget them in the admittedly wonderful ending. Aside from a juvenile throw-away scene promising the next villain will be as retarded and uninspired as the first, the last twenty minutes of the film are by far the strongest of the piece. If only that inspiration could have spread to more of the film.Okay, here's the real problem with Spider-man 2. Though the New York Times, and others, bill it as 'the greatest superhero movie ever,' it is in fact not only not the greatest superhero film ever (which would still be 1978's Superman), it's one you've already seen before. In no significant way is this film any different from 1981's Superman II. All of the plot elements are the same, you have two villains, it all revolves around the hero's secret identity, etc. I could go on (and on) with this argument but will cut it short to avoid spoiling Spider-man 2 for you in case you haven't seen it.And I'll go you one better. Not only is this film Superman II, it's also Smallville, the Movie (it should be, it was written by the same guys). Osborn is nothing more than Lex Luthor, the head of a wealthy corporation bankrolling villains. Peter and Mary Jane mouth the same sentiments as Clark and Lana, down to some of the very same lines that those two characters have said. If this is the 'greatest super hero movie ever,' you could have seen it for free by watching Smallville every week.I was harsher to this movie than it deserves; it really isn't that bad, and it doesn't make me angry, like that turd Stepford Wives did. But I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to hear everyone else crow about a mediocre film that's a rehashed remake/rewrite like it's the best thing since the Bard. If this is all that moviegoers in this country really want, then they get exactly the cinema they deserve. There's really no harm in going to see this film; the only harm is in thinking it's especially good or original.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It Just gets Better,"Well i had my doubts about Spiderman 2, could it possibly live up to the hype, and i for one think they done an excellent job at creating this movie, the amount of effort put into this movie really made me happy, the animation is just superb.Plus you gotta' love the fact that the character look like the actual characters from the comic book series which is an added bonus.I found myself actually jumping out of my seat at the picture's wanting to help spiderman out in some of the scenes which is very rare for me, being a long life Spiderman fan i was hoping for even more action then the first, i wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet but for those that haven't you must check this out, it will bring your imagination to life, this is simply put the best comic book/super hero movie out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Almost as good as the first film, with terrific visuals and a (I think) superior story","I really enjoyed the first film, despite its unevenness in the script, and its length. This sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, and for me one of the better sequels out there. If there is one thing that I do prefer over the original, despite the rather slow start, I do think this film has the stronger storyline. The script is in general very good too, but the only other real problem I have with this film is its length. Despite the flaws, it is a pretty darn good action sequel. Two things made this movie as wonderful as it was. One was that it was terrific visually and technically, with splendid special effects and jaw-dropping stunts. The final action sequence between Spiderman and Dr Octopus was in particular brilliantly staged. The cinematography is focused and makes the film even more a wonder to look at. The other was the villain Dr Octopus, superbly played by Alfred Molina. Dr Octopus is made into a rather complex villain, after the death of his wife Rosalie, and becomes a villain after being part of his own invention. The music was also dramatic and fun. The remainder of the performances were very good too, while not admittedly the most charismatic actors ever, (Sean Connery is definitely a contender for that) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst still give believable lead performances. All in all, a very good sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The unbearable misery of being Spider-Man,"Nope. This one didn't do it for me either. I found the first Spider-Man to be pretty bad, and the sequel fails to improve.Fans of Spider-Man comics are sure to get their kicks from seeing their hero swing across the screen, but for the rest of us there's only the film itself. What's lacking in both films is the sense of any real danger. There's simply no antagonist for Spidey to fight. The first film had the Green Goblin who basically was blowing up business partners (naughty of course, but hardly very exciting), and in the second film there's Doc Ock (""possessed"" by his robotic arms - how stupid is that by the way?) who's demonic plan consist of... finishing his failed experiment (which could blow up half of New York, but that's not why he does it). I'm not saying that you need some Bond criminal who wants to take over the world, but someone a bit more menacing would have been nice.Since Doc Ock stays in his laboratory for most of the film, Spider-Man has to spend his time doing something else. Namely fighting his inner feelings whether or not to continue being Spider-Man. To illustrate this conflict, we get 90 minutes of Peter Parker/Spider-Man going through hell. He's broke, he hasn't got a girlfriend, Mary Jane is marrying some astronaut, his aunt is poor and has to move, his best friend slaps him, he falls off building, falls in the street, gets pushed around etc. This isn't fun for him, and it's not much fun to watch either. There are times and places for existential drama, but I'm not sure this movie is one of them. Realising this, Raimi lets loose a final 30 minutes of action scenes making everything that happened before seem completely redundant.Overall, the script leaves a lot to be desired. It's mostly filled with silly teenage angst, but there are also some pretty gaping plot holes and stupid dialogue. Nothing is implied or subtle, everything is clearly pointed out and explained (except those plot holes of course). Every scene with aunt May made me cringe, and they've copied the vomit inducing scene on the bridge from the first film, only placed it on board a train and made it about ten times worse.I can't complain about the actors, they do what they can with what they're given. Generally though, these characters leaves me pretty cold. I simply don't care about whiny Parker and his girl trouble.The effects are better this time around, especially Doc Ock's mechanical arms, but at times it still feels very much like cartoons. The action scenes are nothing new or special (a CGI character fighting another CGI character in a CGI environment has been to death by now - how about some real people for once?). Also, I don't get Spider-Man's powers. He can get cut with a knife and bleed, but he can fall of tall buildings without getting a scratch on him?On the whole Spider-Man 2 is equal to its predecessor. A bit better looking, but exceedingly long and tedious. And more than once you get the feeling that it only functions as an introduction to the inevitable Spider-Man 3...

Great Spider-Man Film,"Tobey Maguire,(Spider-Man/Peter Parker), gave an outstanding performance as a very weak and helpless type of guy who tried to fly like a bird and fell on his face all the time, so to speak. As the picture progresses you wonder just how Spider Man will eventually put an end to his octopus friend and his evil deeds. There are many exciting scenes and especially when Spider Man is trying to save a run-away elevated train from going off its track and winding up in a river. Kirsten Dunst, (Mary Jane Watson) is about to get married to someone other than Peter Parker and something takes hold of her and sends her in another direction.

"With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride","Spider-Man 2 is an adrenaline-packed cinematic delight. A purely functioning superhero film, serving as a sequel to a film that was surprisingly capable after spending a fourth of a century in development hell. Not only is this one of the best sequels I have yet to see, but one of the strongest superhero epics of the decade.What little Raimi and the writers neglected in the original Spider-Man film is injected into this sequel with full-force intelligence, depth, and attitude. Certain action scenes are so artfully designed and professionally crafted, it appears they could serve as the long-awaited climax in any film of the genre. Scenes themselves play like epics within an epic and some, like the infamous train sequence, are so breakneck and excessive they could use an intermission.But Spider-Man 2 doesn't have time for preposterous breaks or intermissions. They would disrupt the flow of poetry the film so effortlessly excels at, and for that matter, it is too busy furthering Peter Parker's entertaining story and fueling its action scenes with the coherency and structure they need. The film takes place two years after the events of the first film. We see Parker is still doing vigilante justice around the city of New York, yet we see he is breathlessly struggling to juggle his alter-ego's duties, his schoolwork, his freelance photography job, and his own free time. Because of this, he has long been distant from the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Now that Harry is the leader of Oscorp, he has been funding research for the nuclear scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Octavius's goal is to perfect fusion power, and he creates and operates a harness equipped with several long, windy robotic arms that seem to take on a mind of their own. Unfortunately, due to a series of disasters, the arms are now sewn to his spinal-cord and have corrupted his mind and are now influencing his decisions and actions. Dr. Octavius, who will later be known as ""Doc Ock,"" serves as the main villain in the story, as one can expect.Parker not only must try and defeat Doc Ock, but must figure out how to get his spidey-legs working again after numerous web malfunctions, and has just learned that Mary Jane is engaged to an acclaimed astronaut. And don't even get him started about how he must continue to comfort his Aunt May, who is still grieving over the loss of her husband and Peter's uncle, as well as telling her the real truth about his death.Speaking as a sizable fan of the original Spider-Man, the one part I mentioned in my review was that Raimi showed Parker's newly-discovered powers to be all fun and games with no consequences or brewing agony. It was a chockablock of excitement for him, and never once did the story showcase how these powers would've inevitably burdened Parker with a barrage of responsibility and tribulations. It almost seems Raimi and the writers left that part out on purpose, so they could center the sequel primarily around the agony of being a superhero. If that was their plan, their have succeeded, because not only is this one of the most riveting and entertaining superhero films, it is also one of the deepest.Tobey Maguire, returning as Parker, bleeds charm and confidence in the role of a character that just has the charm part down. With the new Amazing Spider-Man film just released about two weeks ago, boasting the relatively new star Andrew Garfield in the central role, I can't help but remind readers who I believe is the real Peter Parker. Maguire's Parker has mastered the role of a shy nerd who lacks any and all confidence. Garfield's character was still in that nerd-position, but he was far more secure in his witticisms and his confidence. To me, Peter Parker is and always will be a nerd. Regardless of how tight and brazen his costume is.When it came down to the villain of the original Spider-Man, unlike many people, I was satisfied that it was the Green Goblin. If anything, Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in a lot more of an eerie light than I assume many others actors would've. Doc Ock is a more impressive villain in every sense. Quite possibly one of the most enticing to watch on screen. The Goblin, no matter which way you examine him, is a rather stock villain. Ock's robotic arms make for a never-ending line of possibilities and events, and the action sequences involving him are stylish and crafty, perfectly complimenting the film itself as a whole.Spider-Man 2 is a shivering example at what makes a great superhero film. It shows us what most of us want, which is explicitly entertaining action scenes, and the something extra I hope most of us crave, which is the humanity and exploration of the character. To show Parker's powers as a burden to him was a brilliant move on screenwriter Alvin Sargent's part (who would later go on to write the third part of this franchise and be one of the three to construct the new one) and Sam Raimi's. With a brain in its head and style on its side, this is one hell of a ride.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Donna Murphy.

"Sequel, Shmequel.  This one tops the first in every area.","Sequels. Who needs them? Who wants them? I hate them, most of the time. Most of the time, the sequel ruins what made the first one so great. Take the Superman movies. First one, GREAT! After that, it was all down hill. Batman is another perfect example. The change in actors playing Batman/Bruce Wayne, along with the slide into fantasy instead of realism ruined the Dark Realism of the first two. Along comes Spiderman. It had a top notch story, top notch actors, and top notch plot. Although the Green Goblin costume looked too much like a kid's Halloween costume and Willem Dafoe's dialogue was a bit over the top. Okay, that's an understatement, it was way over the top. The visuals of the first were mediocre at best, to the point where you could tell what was real and fake. Still, I wondered, how could they top it? It was still superb for a comic movie. Then I see the teaser for Spiderman 2....Made me feel all tingly inside. Then the trailer. I must say, I was salivating at the mouth. Then it came. I couldn't get any better than the midnight showing of the premiere! On the Edge of my seat before the movie even began. I know, I know. I am such a dork. The intro was great. I loved the Alex Ross drawings portraying some of the important plot points of the first movie, to remind us of how Spiderman came to be.From beginning to end, this movie had me laughing, crying, cheering, and just about any other emotion you could think of. The story was amazing. For those of you who think it was a rehash of the first stories theme, yes it was, and no it wasn't. First of all, yes it was about great responsibility coming with great power, but it is also so much more. It's about being able to balance his responsibility with his life. To borrow a Christian theme, it's about serving two masters. Either God or Money, and the struggle to decide which of the two to serve. Of course, the best part of the movie is in it's heart. The action is great, but it's the vulnerable parts that really shine, like the scene where Peter reveals a secret long kept hidden to Aunt May. The writers were so much more confident in their abilities when it came to the script dialogue, and except for one instance, everything flows perfectly. The only part that feels forced into the movie is Aunt May's speech about Heroes. The acting was so much better this time around too. You really feel the struggle going on inside of Peter Parker/Tobey Maguire, and I still can't think of anybody who could play the part better. He really makes you see the struggle, the pain going on inside, and he's more sure of his ability as an actor. Kristen Dunst plays the beautiful Mary Jane like no other, still making us love her even more, and ends the movie perfectly with one statement. You can't find a better Doc Ock either. Alfred Molina really brought substance to the part, and since their is no mask to hide behind, you can see the struggle between good and evil within his face. Though, a couple of the bits of dialogue were a bit overacted. The visuals are ten times better than those in the first. Doc Ock's arms move so realistically that you'd never believe they were real puppets and not CG. Spiderman looks even more realistic than ever. His motion is so much more fluid than the in the first movie and he doesn't look all rubbery. Sam Raimi, I tip my hat off to you for perfecting Spiderman. I had my worries about you when the first one hit, but you've got my confidence that you can do it, and do it right. I have only one question for you. How can you top this one? This movie is one of those movies that everybody can enjoy and for those who don't agree with me, here's webbing in your face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An almost perfect ""popcorn"" movie, highly entertaining.","I watched this at home, I own it on DVD.As the sequel to his first Spiderman role, Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker. He has been fighting crime and trying to figure out how to balance his life as Spiderman and his desire for a relationship with Mary Jane Watson, capably played again by Kirsten Dunst. Then mid-movie he has an identity crisis of sorts, discards his costume in the trash in an alley, and vows to give up his crime-fighting role.But the call is too great, on the loose is Alfred Molina as Doc Ock , with four metal bionic arms attached to his back, powered by Tritium fuel. The risk to the city and the citizens is too great, he has to put his costume back on and save the city.The romantic side story is MJ getting tired of what she sees as Peter's lack of commitment to their ""friendship"", e.g. repeatedly failing to show up to see her stage play. She in fact gets engaged to be married to another man. Somehow through all the turmoil MJ has to realize who Peter really is and that he is the only one for her.Good, entertaining movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good but I still prefer the first one,"The hotly anticipated ""Spider-Man 2"" arrived in theatres in June of 2004 and soon proved to be nearly as big of a box office success as its predecessor. The film even managed to garner better reviews than the original, which is something of a rarity for sequels.The story picks up a couple of years after the first movie and finds Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to cope with the sacrifices inherent in being Spider-Man. As a result, he seriously contemplates giving up crime-fighting. Meanwhile, the demented Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) will stop at nothing to continue his fusion research, though the results could be disastrous.The cast of the previous film returns here and they perform their roles capably once again. New addition Alfred Molina makes a memorable villain and the film features another entertaining cameo from Bruce Campbell.However, I find that the acting talent is somewhat squandered on a less than stellar script. Despite the involvement of Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon and two-time Oscar winner Alvin Sargent the screenplay comes off as a dumbed down effort (no doubt as a result of catering to a young audience). That being said, the conclusions of the film's individual story lines are so satisfying that I can almost overlook the script's lesser moments.Sam Raimi returns as director and the film's visuals are on par with the first film. The special effects landed the film its sole Oscar and are responsible for some memorable moments. Danny Elfman once again provides a fitting score while good use is also made of B.J. Thomas's ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"".In the end, ""Spider-Man 2"" is an enjoyable popcorn movie but nothing more. While I may be in the minority here, I find the first film more rewarding than the followup. The third film, meanwhile, is especially disappointing considering the promise of this film's ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Is this movie strong? Listen, bud...","Review of SPIDER-MAN 2by STEVEN BAILEYThere are some ""popcorn movies"" that transcend their origins andjust become great movies--""North by Northwest,"" ""Raiders of theLost Ark.""Add ""Spider-Man 2"" to the list.There's no good reason that a film about a guy with the dubioustalent for traveling by web should be one of the most touchingmovies around. But darned if I wasn't near tears by movie's end.For that, kudos to director Sam Raimi, who found the same""realistic"" tone in the first ""Spider-Man"" and extends it here. Thecharacters seem like clichés--the clumsy kid turned super-hero,the erstwhile girlfriend, the doting aunt. But thanks to heartfeltencore performances from Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, andRosemary Harris, they're more believable than those in more""earthbound"" movies I've seen this year.Of course, some viewers don't go to ""Spider-Man"" movies forcharacter depth, and action fans won't be disappointed here either.Alfred Molina, whom I've always found hammy, here has perfectpitch as Dr. Octavius--at first friendly and caring to Peter Parker(Spidey's daily alter-ego), then downright operatic in his revengewhen his planned scientific breakthrough goes wrong and turnshim into a kind of octopus-robot.But the movie spends an unusual amount of time letting us get toknow its characters, so that viewers truly have a stake in thehigh-powered action scenes. (Warning: Those scenes might bevery tough sledding for younger viewers. But if you've seen""Spider-Man 1,"" you know what you're in for anyway.)Out of a flawless cast, I end by singling out thoroughly winningKirsten Dunst as M.J., Peter/Spidey's love interest. Her dreamy,sunny face grounds the story in happy normalcy. And her finalscene tops even ""S1's"" much-ballyhooed kiss.This movie has it all. Go.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Emulates success of original too closely to feel authentic,"Using the successful template which guided part 1 to a tee, Sam Raimi again duplicated his blockbuster hit with even more box office bite, but in the process lost something along the way. There are no obvious downgrades from the previous installment, a fun, enduring origin piece that instantly sat well with so many outside the comic book norm. All key elements which became dependable in the franchise are present and multiplied: fluid action, romantic tension, and meaningful metaphors on the man behind the mask. Even though there is clearly an intended purpose to probe Parker's dualistic struggle, sermonizing his morality to an uncomfortable measure via a few extra corny interactions does not help a plot that parallels way too much from it's predecessor in the first place. This overdone approach will lend well to all intense sequencing but does somehow trample over the unique pleasure that was the first rather then totally compliment.Essentially, Spider-Man 2 is a glorified teaser for the impending trilogy, using much of it's time to simply set up a bigger showdown that is yet to come. Whereas the original offered an exciting, fun, and fresh update to the comic book superhero in and of itself, one can definitely sense the stench of sequelitis begin crawling in this time around. The primary cast begins to settle into their respective roles, perhaps a little too comfortably, while Raimi struggled to fill the movie with an admirable foe. Alfred Molina is a fine actor who wears his four robotic arm well as rogue scientist Doc Ock, but too many similarities between Dafoe's Green Goblin render this conflict predictable. James Franco, who remains a pivotal character to the series, simply does not bring any humanity to the role of Harry Osborn either, replacing any ongoing tension the sequel wishes to set up with a sourly frown to drive his character instead.The fans ate this one up, and it is easy to see why. All the action scenes are finely tuned and exhibit a sharper eye then the original could ever attempt. Spider-Man's webbing around New York City is still the selling point, and the CGI animators do everything in their power to justify a second indulgence with some fascinating fights, particularly when filmed at high speeds against an aesthetically adventurous Doc Ock. A certain dedication to examining Peter Parker as he struggles to reconcile with his alter-ego was also another reason fans held this one on a pedestal. But honestly, as much as the script may try to diverge into psychological subtext while offering insanely choreographed action, the impact still ended up feeling like an amped-up repeat of what made the first one so engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The villain is fantastic, with solid motivation and who is vastly different from the hero, yet still connected to him! Harry gets even more development into turning to the new Goblin.

They basically kept everything that worked in the first movie and addressed several things that made me give it a lower score. If the first movie really was the spark announcing the new era of superhero movies, this one really helped fanned the flames, which eventually would lead to Iron Man.

Maintains the energy of the first one,"A cut above the typical comic book movie, S-M 1 did what this type of movie is supposed to do: introduce the main characters, have 'em fight a Super Bad Guy, and then have it all end happily ever after, for the most part. In other words, for the first movie in a supposed franchise, you have to allow time for exposition of the protagonist's background, even if millions already know him from another medium.With S-M 2, though, such an obligation isn't necessary. We've met Spidey, MJ, Aunt May, et al., and we're ready to jump into a new story. So while the first one explains why Spidey is, the second movie devotes more time to fighting the Bad Guy du Jour, Doctor Octopus.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still pines for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), from whom he steers clear despite his undying affection for her. It's for her own good, he tells himself. If we're together, my enemies will top at nothing to get at me through her, and I can't put her in that position. And so, in typical superhero fashion, he broods and broods and broods. The relentless push-and-pull between his love for MJ and his devotion to using his powers for good is a constant theme in the Spider-Man universe, and in the movies it either smolders in the background or charges with a raging fury to the forefront. Peter is given the impossible choice - true love or good deeds - and it's a choice to which, at its core, everyday people can relate; we all have exceedingly difficult choices to make throughout our lives.And in this especially, the movies succeed. Peter Parker is supposed to be an average teen - well, except for those powers he has. He's not morally superior. He's not smarter. He's just a poor schlub who accidentally has these super powers, and he doesn't quite know how to deal with them. On a smaller scale, a comparison can be made to a supremely talented collegiate football player who's just made it to the pros. He has otherworldly talents. He has money, fame, fortune. And can he handle it? About as well as Peter can.Anyway, the big villain here is the aforementioned Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), yet another in a long line of Good Scientists Gone Wrong. You may recall that the Green Goblin from the first S-M movie was also of this line. This Doc has found a way to manipulate metallic tentacles with his mind. (It helps that the tentacles are physically attached to him.) Something goes wrong, he goes mad, and next thing you know it, he's gonna take over the world. Give these boys a Happy Meal, and they'd still want two prizes.Along with the inevitable Spidey-Doc Ock battles, Peter Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) is still quite resentful as Spidey's killing of his father in the first movie. He doesn't know Peter is Spider-Man, but he knows only Peter is able to take photographs of him. So the second thematic struggle is within Harry - does he resent his friend for knowing the murderer (in his eyes) of his father? All of the cast returns from the first movie (well, all that survived the first movie), and they all do a collective good job. Maguire is a perfect choice for the lead; he's unassuming, can't really emote, is stoic, and even a little bit wimpy. All are qualities that plague the characters of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very Overrated!!!,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW***Now I was disappointed with the first Spiderman?.it just didn't seem to hit home with me as it seemed to with everyone else. The hype behind this Spiderman movie franchise is what drives it, because this sequel is just as good as the first..... in other words, not that good.I've heard everyone, from most critics, including Ebert, to many of my peers, that this was simply a GREAT movie, guys like Ebert went so far as to say that Spiderman 2 is 'the greatest superhero movie ever'. I only have one thing to say to that: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!Did anyone see 'Batman' (1989)? Or how about 'Superman'? How could ANYONE compare this campy movie to those two superhero CLASSICS?? This flick does absolutely nothing new?more of Mary Jane looking and acting retarded, more of the CG Spiderman swinging all over NY, more of Peter Parker fumbling all over himself, and another villain who just drops by sparingly and engages in some unrealistic fight scene with Spidey. This was very lazy film-making IMO, they just handed the audience the same old formula used in the first one?making this sequel very dry, but somehow more campy and corny. I can't believe all of the praise this film is getting?.with talk about how its soooo much better than the first?it's basically the same movie!! Peter doesn't want to get with MJ for fear of luring her to danger, though he ends up doing it anyway; some villain was just born wreaking havoc all over NY, Parker's so-called best friend is jealous of him?yada yada yada. Spiderman is no 'superman', so how does he takes the falls and bumps he does and get up like nothing happened??What makes the world of Batman so realistic is the fact that he can indeed get hurt. and it's easy to relate to him. Same with Superman; he actually has superpowers but still seemed more realistic than Spiderman here. Everything in Spiderman 2 just seemed so lame; he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore, so just when things start to look up for Peter 'The Ultimate Loser' Parker, he quickly learns that they're not. All of a sudden because his 'mind' isn't into his crime-fighting occupation he can't do his basic abilities. Were the writers really serious with that? He got bit by a spider, so the spider traits are a PART of him! But no, just because he's having a hard time at school, can't pay his rent and is too much of a punk to confess his love to MJ, he can't scale walls and constantly runs out of web?? How ludicrous! Hell, I felt more sympathy for Doc Ock than I did for Peter Parker, he was just TOO MUCH of a loser for me to feel sorry for him. Kirsten 'Dunce' still sucks, she's just hideous. Tobey Maguire is average as Parker, he's too much of a wimp to be taken seriously IMO. Green Goblin's son tries to portray himself as some big shot, going to board meetings and what not?give me a break, he's like 20!! What's even worse is that they're setting up part 3 with him as the villain (yes Green Goblin yet again), wow that ought to be great! LOL please. Who absolutely stole the show to me was Jameson, the leader of the newspaper. He was hilarious; the only character I liked.I'll just say this about Spiderman 2: Don't Believe The Hype!

Even better then the original!,"2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Mcguire) has never had time with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) whom has became a model/actress or for class because he's always late because there's always a crime happening at the wrong time. Suddenly his powers fade away which makes him realize that he must give up being Spider-Man, however as Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molan) has made a robotic suit with monstrous tentacles as suddenly a lab accident occurs making the suit fused to his body as he controls it telepathically to become Dr. Octopus with a plan on eliminating the city. Sure Peter is happy with being normal again, but with the crime rate high and Doc Ock on the rampage can he return back to Spider-Man or will the city be doomed.This is a rare sequel that can surpass the original much like ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"", ""Godfather 2"", ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"" or ""Empire Strikes Back""! Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to their instant crowd-pleaser ""Spider-Man"".

The greatest sequel of all time!,"This story has everything the first one had but with more. The choices from the original are now consequences in this one. The villain is just as iconic as Green Goblin and again, has a personal relationship with Peter to add extra emotional weight. So if you ask me, this one doubles everything the first one did, and the first one was already flawless. It's just as attracting as the first one and will have you engaged, Spider-Man fan or not since there's action and drama. The theme still focuses on responsibility as does the 3rd one. The acting is still great with less cheesy dialogue than the first. The cinematography improves in my opinion and seems more cinematic and dramatic. The editing and pacing takes a little more time but fits all its scenes perfectly. With great sound and keeping the iconic theme.

A Former Favorite That Hasn't Aged Gracefully,"Ah man, I *really* loved this one when it first hit theaters. Now? Boy, it just hasn't held up so well. I still appreciate the effort to dig deeper into the character's history, exploring the classic ""Spider-Man No More"" storyline and treating Doctor Octopus with a fair degree of respect, but it's so thoroughly over-acted and packed with corny jokes that the good stuff is largely negated by the bad. Two steps forward, two steps back, if you will. Every aspect of the film is like that. Tobey Maguire does a fine job of conveying the heavy burden of responsibility, suffering through an arduous personal life to satisfy a lofty personal code, but he also hams it up like nobody's business and flat-out kills a few shots with his blunt delivery. Sam Raimi pieces together a scene that's arguably the character's best cinematic moment (that would be the great train rescue) but also over-indulges with abundant guest spots and awkwardly out-of-place throwbacks to his Evil Dead days. Doc Ock's escape from the operating room, for example, is straight-up B-grade horror fare. The world-building stuff gets a bit out of control, too, which leads to an overstuffed running time and a plot that drags on forever. It's cute to see The Lizard, Black Cat and Man-Wolf before they've become rogues, but those guest spots aren't worth more than a quick smile and a wink. Why do they need to become recurring characters, when the cast is already bursting at the seams?

"Lack of action, lack of good story","Many comments on IMDb (as well as a movie rating) say that this sequel is better than first Spider-Man movie. Personally, I don't think so. First of all the second movie was very slow, too slow for action movie and comic book adaptation. It is well-known that Spider-Man 2 had around 200 millions budget but I watched it very carefully and I simply haven't any idea for what they could spend so much money. Overall, the computer-generated visuals weren't bad but the central computer-generated character Dr. Octopus was a really bad thing. Bad character development and acting, ridiculous tentacles - all that made Dr. Octopus such a strong candidate for the worst villain of the year. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man movie was simply brilliant compared to this guy. And in addition to that we got a colossal amount of dull and silly dialogs what supposed to carry some moral messages, but in fact they could carry only boredom. I don't know is it a true adaptation of the comic book or not, but anyway the story was lame, as well as the ending was ridiculous. I don't want to discuss here all possible plot holes because that would take too much time. But only one mention of a idea of drowning a fusion generator in a river should be enough for understanding a real stupidity of the script. So I warn you. The Spider-Man 2 can be a watchable movie but only if you don't expect much and turn your brains off before watching it.My grade - 5.5 (I rated the first Spider-Man movie 7.5).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"More drama, less action","That might not be what I/you want, that's however what you get here. And although the drama part works better here, than in the third part of Spider Man, it still feels as if it were too much, especially after repeat viewing.The drama part still works (as I wrote above) though and that is a testament to the actors. They have to convince in some partly dodgy dialogue! The action scenes are filmed well enough (nothing surprising here) and the end will leave you yearning for the third part (which is out now, in Cinemas if you didn't notice! ;o) Although who knows you might read this, after it hits the DVD shelves).The running time isn't the only thing I didn't like (the extended version feels even more long drawn-out, especially the elevator scene shouldn't have made the extended cut, it just isn't funny, but I liked the office scene with the Spider Man costume, you know which, when you see the movie). There were too many ""revealing"" moments, that wouldn't work like that, not only in reality, but also in the film reality we are drawn into here!If you've seen the first one, you'll see this one too, I encourage you to do that, and then you will make up your own mind, about the great themes in here, but also about other things! :o)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
better than the dark knight,"it would be better if i come straight to the point and discuss why i think this movie is better than tdk. when i watched spiderman2 first time i was blown away by it i felt like i never felt before watching a superhero movie, its generally very hard to relate to a superhero for us average movie goers.. after all how many of us pull their briefs on top of their trousers and go after bad guys... before spiderman2 superhero movies had the very usual worn out formula, there is a superhero there is a super villain and there is a girl, super villain come up with an ingenious plan to kill the superhero and conquer the world... spiderman2 has all this too but it has little more and thats what makes it the best superhero movie till this very day... and that thing is the failures of superhero the weakness of the superhero, his suffering and for a change him being a victim of others cruelty. and that makes us love, sympathize and pity this superhero. the movie is not just some high on adrenaline cgi cheap thrill collection of sequences (though it does have some great action sequence which you'll love), its much more... tdk is a great flick but in my opinion its overrated and spiderman2 is a superior flick and first of its kind... god how i wish they didn't screw up spiderman3 so bad..",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Distant characters, plot is a commonplace, the film a mess.","Wow! It is unbelievable how weak this movie is. It is so full of flaws that they seem interconnected between so that the few moments of real acting and art are washed away by the erratic stream of less-than-mediocre story-waving. The plot is flat and trite, full of the usual American brainwashing blurb about how there's a hero in everyone, about benevolence, the dream of justice, and so on. In fact, the characters (with the exception of Mary Jane, perhaps) are acted out as if they weren't really alive and had no spiritual bond between them whatsoever. They just cannot feel, they only act stupidly and get caught in the web of artificiality and commonplaces. Sincerely, if Americans can recognize themselves in these characters, I feel great sorry for them, for in that case they do not know what human compassion, human warmth really means. ...OK, I must nevertheless recognize that the scene when Spidey stops the train went berserk and loses his mask, is very moving and inspiring. And the end is very pleasing, with a very human and intelligent Octavius who is back to his senses.

Spider-Man returns...Wonderful news!,"In 2002, Sam Raimi proved he was the right man to give cinematic life to Marvel Comics'most popular character.With this sequel, he proves he can do the same thing again, only a lot better...Two years after the events of the first movie, Peter Parker's life hasn't got any better: the woman he loves is engaged to his boss's son, his best friend accuses Spider-Man of said friend's father's murder, and his powers are beginning to fail him(comparisons with Smallville aren't a problem, since the show's creators contributed to the Spider-man 2 script).Plus, there's a new weird guy in town: Dr.Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), aka Doc Ock.Trouble's on its way...This film is far more exciting and gripping than its predecessor, and it also contains some humor(check out Raimi-regular Bruce Campbell's cameo).The original actors are excellent, while Molina's Ock is more conflicted and charming than Willem Dafoe's superb Green Goblin.The movie also contains the most breathtaking action sequence ever,featuring Spidey, his nemesis and a speeding train.A real triumph within the genre, it makes the expectations for the third movie very high, as people wonder what Raimi can do to overshadow the greatest superhero movie after Batman Begins.The standout of summer 2004",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An entertaining blockbuster with brains,"Sam Raimi's 2002 adaptation of the ""Spider-Man"" comic books was a phenomenal success and whether or not to green-light a sequel was a ""no-brainer"" for the studio. However, sequels always bring higher expectations and often, as the sequel to this film shows, disappointment. With ""Spider-Man 2"", Raimi pulls off that rarest of cinematic successes. It is a sequel that is better than the original.The strength of the ""Spider-Man"" films lies in the central character. How Peter Parker deals with this stroke of fate and the stress on him being an ordinary man, and a young one at that, in an extraordinary position of responsibility creates a great deal of sympathy and depth. It is a role that Maguire is ideally suited for and his performance makes this more than just a simple blockbuster. It is a light-hearted drama. It has been described as ""subversive"" by some and that is an apt description. It sits right at the top of the great summer blockbusters of this decade, a list that includes ""Batman Begins"" and the ""Bourne"" series.But, it certainly doesn't shirk on its duty to entertain. Sam Raimi is a born entertainer and he doesn't pull any punches here, quite literally. The action comes thick and fast. All of the set-pieces are eye-popping and inventive. The first hour, in fact, is spectacular. There is stunning action, breathtaking visuals, interesting character development and lots of brilliant humour.It opens as a pretty light-hearted affair and this is not really an example of a sequel going ""darker"". The birth of this film's villain, as it was in the prequel, is the result of a tragic accident and there is no suggestion that he is truly evil. The second hour is grittier, but not darker. It is a completely satisfying film that never bores, but Raimi can't quite hold himself back at points. The final scene should be awfully melodramatic, because it is, but it is forgiven on the basis of the rest of the film.The other failing is that the villain, Doctor Octopus, brilliantly played by Alfred Molina, doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The main focus of the film is Parker's struggle with himself and his desires, but it comes across as pretty much the only focus. There is an interesting ""Jekyll and Hyde"" duality in the ""Doc Ock"" character, but this isn't really explored. There aren't enough internal struggles to make the character believable at points.Though, this should not take away from the many positives of the film. Mention must be made of J.K. Simmons, who is brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson. If this performance were in an offbeat comedy, he would have got an Oscar nomination. And don't forget Bruce Campbell's cameo as the ""Snooty Usher"".All in all, that makes for a completely entertaining two hours. In every way, this film justifies a sequel. In fact, it's a ""no-brainer"". What a shame that the sequel turned out to be exactly that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'm not with the crowd on this one...,"Seems everybody LOVES this movie.  Even those I know who have good taste in movies say the LOVE it.Me?  I LIKED it.  I certainly didn't LOVE it.Naturally, the effects and much of the acting were outstanding.  This was to be expected in a movie with this budget and which had the impressive start which it did.Where it fell short was the STORY.  ""WHAT"", you say?  You thought the story was great?  Well, I will give it the fact that the story THEMES were in place.  The overall elements and directions of the story were worthwhile. However I felt when this story went from outline to a draft, it lost something.Everything, especially the characters, was 2-D.  Flat.  Unbelievable.  There were a number of points where it LOOKED like high drama; where one WISHED one could empathize with the characters.  However I could not, because these characters never came to life for me any more than wooden automatons.  It's as if the characters were thought of in terms of the coarse, archetypal way in which they would behave as opposed to with the refinement for the realism of human thought and behaviour.True, most movies are like this.  But this movie took some of these elements and overdramatized them.  They went over the top and thus out of the realm of believability.  Also part of why I noticed it so much in this movie is the POTENTIAL it had for being better.  Many of the actors, especially Tobey, were quite strong and capable of more.  Their own strengths made it more evident how shallowly the characters were developed.Peter Parker was entirely to ""sappy"" in this movie.  Not because of Tobey's portrayal, but because much of the movie focused upon him as a sympathetic character.  The problem here is that a few ""hard knocks"" can make for a sympathetic character.  Too many becomes surrealistic and downright comedic. Yet this movie was not meant to be padodic!What happend with Spidey's powers in this movie was nonsensical.  'Nuff said.Still, this movie had the visual effects and good action you would expect. It would be worth seeing just for the action scenes between Spidey and Doc Oc.  There were some funny moments (in fact, I wish there were MORE of them; this movie would have been more effective with a more comedic feel and less serious drama).All in all, I'm looking forward to the next installment of Spidey.  I only hope the writers can treat their characters more as living beings and less as 2-D archetypes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man on an Emotional Rollercoaster,"This film essentially begins about two years later with ""Peter Parker"" (Tobey Maguire) going to college and working for a pizza shop after school to order to pay the bills. Between those two activities and spending an inordinate amount of time as Spider-Man, he is becoming quite exhausted. So much so that, he starts finding it much more difficult to maintain his superpowers. Likewise, the fact that he feels quite a bit of guilt from the death of his uncle along with his emotional distancing from his childhood sweetheart ""Mary Jane Watson"" (Kirsten Dunst) also registers heavily upon his mind as well. And just when he thinks it cannot possibly get any worse, a brilliant scientist by the name of ""Dr. Otto Octavius"" (Alfred Molina) suddenly transforms into a malicious monster that only he can stop. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, while not quite as good as its predecessor, this film turned out to be a decent sequel, all the same. And while I believe that Tobey Maguire performs exceptionally well in the lead role, one thing that is missing is the sense of humor that Spider-Man is known for in the comic books.

Spiderman?,"Apart from the action scenes - which were a very minimal part of the movie, it sucked. The CGI was way to clearly CGI (not as bad as in the first-one however).

It has way too much romantic crap, this seems a Pearl Harbor/Titanic ripoff with all it's cliché's that come with it for free. That's not what a real spiderman-fan wants to see, not that I am one, but I know some guys that were really really disappointed. OK that you have some romance I can understand - but this?

Raimi at the height of his power.,"If the first movie was the blueprint of an origin story, this one is the blueprint of hero movies in general. The balancing act that Rami started in the first Spider-Man really comes to fruition in this movie. This is what spiderman is supposed to be, a dorky kid dealing with extreme personal problems while battling over-the-top, goofy villains and Raimi's style is perfect for it. It gives the movie a light-hearted, funny vibe but it isn't afraid to take the struggles of its characters seriously and their struggles are refreshingly not always the big bad. Al of the characters are suffering from the choices Peter made and the results they had on their lives. This is superhero drama perfection.It isn't a perfect film thought.

Strong Sequel,"Spider-Man 2 (2004)*** (out of 4)The second film in Sam Raimi's trilogy finds Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling with his superhuman powers because he's starting to realize that in order to be a hero he's going to have to turn his back on everything he loves. Mainly this goes for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but he also has a new villain, Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) wanting to kill him. SPIDER-MAN 2 is a very good follow-up to a pretty good movie. It seems over the past several years fans have debated on which film is actually better. The first one was about as good as you could get with a comic adaptation and this film improves on it in most spots. Like the first film, the screenplay here is the biggest key as it really allows all of the characters to grow and especially the Parker one. The entire film really does seem to be built around his mental state as he struggles with what to do as he's constantly wondering what would work best for him and those around him. The majority of the movie deals with him outside the costume and this was a pretty unique and different feel. The screenplay throws in quite a bit of character development for the supporting players as well. With that said, once the action scenes are put into place they too are impressive and especially a sequence on a train that happens towards the end of the picture. Once again the performances really come to life with Maguire doing an excellent job with Parker and James Franco also getting to shine as his best friend. Dunst is good as the love interest as is Rosemary Harris in her part. The one thing I think doesn't live up to the first is the villain. While Molina is good in the part I think the character on the whole just isn't interesting as the one in the original. With that said, SPIDER-MAN 2 is still a very good movie that ranks right up there with the best comic adaptations.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I prefer Spider-Man 1,"Good action movie, but I much prefer the first installment. 2 has arguably the greatest comic book villain of all times, Doctor Octopus, which kind of makes the movie a disappointment since, after him, it's rather forgettable. It really should have been better with such a cool bad guy. Unfortunately, it really drags during the dramatic segments. The film makes no points that weren't made in the first one: can Peter Parker exist without becoming Spider-Man? Will his being Spider-Man always put his loved ones in danger? We've been over all this before, so, at its worst, 2 seems like a simple retread of the first, which I actually found fairly poignant at times. Besides the action sequences involving Doc Ock, there aren't any images as memorable as those of the first, which we are reminded of by a nice opening credits sequence where those famous images are presented as drawings. There are some pretty great comic sequences, fitting well into Raimi's varied career. Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo, and, once again, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson gives the best performance in the movie. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Boring, tedious and dark","I have to admit, I'm not a huge comics fan. But I really liked the first Spider-Man movie. This one was just so boring! There were hardly any good action scenes, most of the movie was people standing around talking about the same things over and over. The back and forth ""I love you, no I don't, yes I do."" between Peter and Mary Jane is so excruciatingly boring after the first scene with them that I wanted to get up and leave. I really don't understand why so many people like this movie more than the first one. There were just so many things that made no sense about the characters and the plot. It was way too long, and had many unnecessary and completely puzzling scenes. It seemed like the director was trying to turn a comic book movie into some kind of artistic statement, and to me it just didn't work.The first movie had a lot of funny lighthearted moments, this movie just didn't have the same kind of sense of humor, and I really missed that.Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maquire's faces are so emotionless in some scenes. Its like they're so tired of having to do the same scenes over and over again, just in different outfits and locations, that the lines have become meaningless to them. James Franco has such a small range as an actor, he's just awful in the scenes that are supposed to be emotionally intense. I think he would be better suited to acting in soap operas. And god help us, if there is another one, he'll be the bad guy.

The best Spider-Man movie and one of the best superhero movies,"In a modern world with superhero movies filled in with random action sequences, Spider-Man 2 stands out as it is a character driven story which knows when and where to use its action sequences. The plot focuses on the struggles of Peter Parker balancing his life with Spider-Man, and it is probably one of the best superhero story arcs across the superhero genre. With all that being said, the action is still amazing and makes use of both the hero and villain's powersets in a satisfying way. The villain is also another great thing, Doctor Octopus manages to be sympathetic but also a very evil and fun villain to watch. Another aspect I greatly appreciate is the score, as Danny Elfman yet again manages to elevate the emotional and action scenes in a way that is rare to see in superhero movies nowadays. However, with all that being said there are still a few flaws (as there are in many movies). The love interest, Mary Jane, is yet again very annoying as her motivations don't make sense. Doctor Octopus's motivations also doesn't make much sense in how the arms control him.

Long and Boring,"Uh I just saw spiderman 2 as a team outing. It's not that good.I mean it's OK. But there are times where I thought I was watching a B rated horror movie (in terms of the style of cinematography and cheesy dialog, I was thinking Army Of Darkness, which the main character of that movie happened to play the usher). That aside, I think they were going for a comic book feel on that. So then, 80% of the movie is slow ass crap. Which is either the love story situation, or the whole 'those who have a gift must use it for good' melodrama. There were times were I was borderline about to just walk out and finish it later when it comes out on DVD.Though it woulda been hilarious if when Harry, who was whining about his dad the entire movie, at one point when he see spiderman is Peter and goes ""You killed my father! (for the 500th time)"" instead of Peter going ""there are bigger things going on than you and me..."" but rather said ""Dude, get over it already.""They also coulda delved a bit more into why Peter was losing his powers. I was guessing that it was related to being totally stressed out. But the powers mysteriously come back at peak stress. Oh wait, lemme guess it's because ""he believed in himself."" (yawn)Spiderman 2 was dumbed down for kids. I don't think action movie goers care for the 2hr chick flick that this movie was, nor do kids. Love stories are always introduced for one primary purpose: it's inexpensive.

Sad sad sad,"I expected to love this film. The first Spiderman film was beautifully done and I'm a big fan of Sam Rami's work. I never dreamed it would turn out to be so badly plotted, poorly scripted, self-indulgent, over-stuffed and under-edited.To be fair, there were several good points. J.K. Simmons is a joy to watch as he nails the J. Jonah Jameson character -- his scenes are the best in the movie -- and the Doc Ock role could not have been more perfectly cast than with Alfred Molina. The action scenes were the best I've ever seen when it comes to capturing the feel of comic book action sequence. Unfortunately, much of the writing was equally true to capturing the feeling of comic book thought balloons -- and in a movie, that's bad.Worse, much of the plot made no sense at all -- the entire subway fight was spectacular but completely contrary to the villain's objectives. The resolution to the Doc Ock threat was insipid at best, and the entire first hour was painfully dull. Everything in it could have been fully established and better done in 30 minutes -- 40, tops.Raimi's usually deft touch with humor was painfully absent. The broad comedy was overdone, highly repetitious and delivered with a sledge hammer.

The BEST Spider-Man movie,"THIS is the best Spider-Man movie (or Peter Parker movie, since Spider-Verse is perfect). Spider-Man 2 was my favorite Spidey film for a long time until I watched No Way Home. After that I thought, ""Is No Way Home BETTER than Spider-Man 2?"" I rewatched Spidey 2 a month later or two and I thought that no, Spider-Man 2 is still better. Here's why:In NWH, I did enjoy that Tobey, Andrew, and all the villains came back but that's not the #1 thing I loved about NWH. It was actually Tom Holland's Peter Parker story and his progression as Spider-Man. However, I believe that Spider-Man 2 is the better Peter Parker story.Firstly, the simplicity. I could care less about multiversal/ end of the world stories when it comes to Spider-Man. His best comics and stories are when things are simple because Spider-Man is meant to be an everyman. Someone like us who faces regular, everyday problems; he has as much human problems as his superhero problems, and sometimes they clash with each other. Spider-Man 2 is simple and just cause No Way Home has bigger things happening, doesn't make it better. A big movie doesn't mean a better movie.Spider-Man 2 is an actual Spider-Man story because it's simple, like the comics. No high tech suit, no avengers involved or multiple Spider-Men, and no world ending problems. Just Peter Parker struggling with his personal life while trying to stop Doc Ock as Spider-Man. To me, that's all I need. Peter Parker struggles with everyday life with money troubles, relationships (girls and friends), with jobs, and all that jazz. THAT'S what makes Spider-Man fascinating: The relatable problems.Secondly, is that this movie feels like an actual film. Say what you will but I didn't love that NWH was 80% CG and green screen. I'm fine if you wanna do those things unless if most of the film is done this way when some shots can be done in real locations. Also, the fact that it was done during the pandemic does not excuse it. There are SO many films shot around the same time that use real locations and look significantly better than NWH.Overall, Spidey 2 is my favorite Spider-Man movie. It's not nostalgia that convinced me because NWH is my second favorite Spider-Man movie, over Spider-Man 1 and 3. It's just that in terms of filmmaking and in terms of the story, I prefer it over NWH. If you like NWH better, that's alright. You like what you like but as for me, I still stand with Spider-Man 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big-budget bummer,"Peter Parker learns that being a superhero doesn't necessarily pay the bills, and at the beginning of ""Spider-Man 2"" he's struggling just to keep a job (he tries delivering pizzas-on-time while being Spidey, which may represent a new low in the superhero genre). Despite a mid-movie montage set to B.J. Thomas' ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" (!), this beleaguered sequel is unhappy, unfulfilled, and it doesn't know where to go as a film. Parker confesses guilt to his aunt over the murder of his uncle and is rebuffed, his lady-love is engaged to someone else, his eyesight is going, he has psychological problems, and Spider-Man is being called a ""masked menace"" by once-adoring New Yorkers. The film invents a foe in Alfred Molina's Doctor Octavius, but he's a ridiculous villain; with four iron tentacles grafted onto his back (with pincher-heads that seem to have brains of their own), he proves just as powerful as Spider-Man--and what's the point in that? Spider-Man gets a good pounding in this one, and the action sequences (always involving one of Parker's loved ones as a target) are CGI crazy. Tobey McGuire is still rather odd in the lead; sleepy-eyed, like a post-modern Tommy Kirk, he has a wonderful moment late in the film trying to stop a speeding subway car but otherwise just ambles through. Director Sam Raimi pauses occasionally for moments of Spidey beauty, but whole scenes don't play (such as every moment at the Daily Bugle), character conflicts are muddy and confused, Molina looks embarrassed, and the tag at the end--setting up the next sequel--is woefully clumsy. Staying true to formula, in movie trilogies the second installment is always the weakest. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best superhero movies,"What an incredible film, it perfectly builds on the first movie to create one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It was a bold choice to have Spider-Man lose his powers for a good chunk of the movie, but it works so well because it allows use to see Peter Parker as a person, and the movie becomes a brilliant character study about him. The special effects still look great today, like the subway scene still looks so real. The ending was extremely satisfying, both in terms of beating the villain and having the perfect solution to Peter's personal struggles. It felt earned, we went on a journey with Peter to get there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but I expected better","Writing a review about an endeared comic book character is harder than you might think. You don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the hero that most people who are taking the time to read the review, already know. You can talk about the history of how the film produced a sequel, but movies such as these have so much fanfare before they hit the big screen that by the time they are released, everyone is sick about turning on their television or looking out their office window to see yet another advertisement. And going into the details of the character as not seen in the movie but rather between the pages of an illustrated magazine, forgetaboutit! One small miscue, and the comic book convention guys are all over you petitioning your house and threatening your children (granted I live in a condo and have no kids, but it's possible).So when the event movie of 2004 hit theaters in June, I wondered how I was going to introduce the review. So for inspiration, I climbed through the attic and found a box labeled 'Old Clothes 1976' and pulled out my old Spider-Man underoo's. (To be fair, I should mention that they were not really underoo's just underpants and a t-shirt that my father had drawn webs on with a black marker). In full gear, I sat in front of my computer and started to type.Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to the multi-million dollar grossing Spider-Man released just two years earlier. Back at the kick of the proverbial second can are actors Toby McGuire and Kirstin Dunst as Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Mary Jane Watson, and director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead). SM2 picks up a few years after Spider-Man had rescued Manhattan from the evil deviance of the Green Goblin and things have changed greatly for the web-slinger. The oddly contorted swinging from building to building that was present two years ago has now been perfected, and variations of web constructions have improved for the betterment of mankind. But where thing have improved for Spidey, things have taken a turn for the worse for Peter Parker. He has lost his job, his woman, his friends. Hell, he can't even get a free drink or appetizer at a high-class gala.Also standing in his way of living happily ever after is none other than Dr. Otto Octavius (or Doc Ock for those of us who feel we have earned the right to be on a nickname basis). Played perfectly by Alfred Molina (Species), Doc Ock and his tentacles of terror strike a deal with Harry Osborn to deliver Spider-Man in exchange for the trillium he needs to complete his scientific experiment. So, Aunt Mae, Mary Jane and half of New York (including an El-Train?) are subjected to the terror that these two adversaries cause atop the tallest structures of the inner city. The special effects for these battle scenes are an improvement on the first installment, following the sequel rules that everything must be bigger and louder. Buildings are destroyed, cars are thrown at will and a riverside dilapidated structure is destroyed which will probably get Spider-Man credit for cleaning up the waterfront.Of course, like the first film (why change a winning combination), there is a love story at the heart of SM2 that runs cold then hot then cold then hot again. There are so many volleys back and forth between Toby and Kristin that I felt like I was watching Martina Navratalova and Jimmy Conners during a US Open tennis match. But where the Spider-Man had sparks fly, SM2 drags it out over too many scenes and doesn't capitalize on an emotional scene at the beginning of the film where the two speak with but a fence between them.But love story, blub story. Who cares, right? Are things blown up? Yes. Are the special effects cool? Yes. Is the movie better than the first one?I am not so sure. I wasn't completely enamored by the original and the second one had too many dry spells to keep my interest for the full two hours. Although the sound was incredible and the visuals stunning the story and dialogue lacked a great deal of substance and final climax between web-head the Octavius was anti-climatic in terms of what was building up to be a phenomenal finish.There is a good deal of humor in the SM2 and that is a good thing. A scene in an elevator between Spidey and a passenger was good fun, and the violin player outside the theatre house was worth a chuckle or two. But all the snickers in the world couldn't keep me from ignoring some incredibly inane dialogue. The final words as uttered in the film from Mary Jane to Spider-Man ('Go get 'em, tiger') got laughs when it shouldn't and that is not the way you want to remember a film. And don't even get me started on Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head or the Here Comes The Bride musical treats.When you get down to it though, this is the ultimate summer flick and it will make wheel barrels of money no matter what any of us say. The young women will like it due to Toby's presence, the young men will be happy that Kristin gets wet again near the end while wearing a tight outfit, and teachers and theologians will talk on the storyline of how Spider-Man suffered through a mental condition that affected his web slinging ability.Oh yeah, I guess the kid target audience will like it too due to the violence and cartoon action. Me, I was indifferent. Glad I saw it and will probably buy it on DVD in 6 months. I just expected a little more.So there you have it, I can finally take off these stupid Spider-Man underpants and go back to the normal boxers (which also have cob webs.unfortunately, real ones). With Spider-Man 3 more than hinted at the conclusion of the second, I just best not put the Old Clothes box anywhere it can't be easily found.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Some stupid parts and things that make no sense {LOTS in part 2}.

A powerful and memorable sequel,"I have never been much of a Spiderman fan, as a matter of fact I am not really a comic book fan overall. However I enjoyed Raimi's first Spiderman film very much and was more than happy to check out the second instalment when it was first released in cinema.My hopes before entering the cinema were not too high to be honest, I expected it to be one of those sequels which were simply out just to make money. However by the time I was leaving the cinema my thoughts were completely different to my expectations.Everything about this film in my personal opinion is an improvement from the first. The acting is a lot better and you can tell that the actors really do understand and care for the characters that they are playing. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have some outstanding chemistry in this film and of course not to forget the fantastic performance from Alfred Morlina who plays the menacing Dr Otto Octavius.Also the action in this film is a large improvement along with the special effects, each action sequence is directed well and is executed in a fast and exciting pace, making the film a real roller-coaster ride.Finally one thing that made this film so memorable for me is how much deeper and personal it is compared to the first film. As the original shows Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, this instalment shows the problems that Peter faces actually being Spiderman and what he must sacrifice.I do not usually like to compare sequels to original films as in my opinion every film whether it is sequel or remake should be given a chance on its own. However Spiderman 2 is one of those sequels which shines well above the first instalment and in my opinion has so far been the best in the series.8 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Major Flaws in ""Super Hero"" Film.","I really enjoyed the first Spiderman Film. I thought it did a good job establishing Spiderman and had a lot of action. Also it layed a good foundation for future sequels. I thought the second would be an action packed follow up that further developed characters. I was half right.Basically in this film Peter Parker is learning to live his life as both himself and Spiderman. THis leads to him constantly being late which affects his schoolwork, jobs, and most importantly his relationship with MJ. Meanwhile a doctor named Doc Ock is performing a fusion experiment but it goes horribly wrong and he has four metal arms that are really powerful fused to his body and he becomes Doctor Octopus. Parker soon decides that it may be best for him to hang up his Spiderman Costume and live as Peter Parker and not Spiderman. But will his decision be final? Too much of this film drags. For one the first half of the film Peter is still affected by his uncle Ben's death. That was a problem that should have been done after the last film. But through the film the characters are still coping with Bens death and it just would have been nice if that was not still an issue.Also this film deals more with Peter Parker than Spiderman. It should have been called Peter Parker. It is all about his relationship with MJ, his aunt May, and his best friend. The main conflict of the film is not dealing with Spiderman himself then.I thought the villain in this film, Doctor Octopus, was OK. However he does not get to fight with Spiderman enough. In fact after his first encounter with Spiderman you do not see him for a while and I think that all of the conflict concerning Peter Parker takes away from time that should have been with Doctor Octopus and Spiderman fighting.Spiderman could have been in the film more also. The core of the film barely shows Spiderman. I was hoping since they already established Spiderman in the first film that in this one he would get to do a lot more action and fighting but there really is a shortage of great action. SOme of it is good like how Spiderman battles Doctor Octopus on the side of the building, but there is not enough of it.Also what is the deal with Spiderman wanting to take off his mask in this film? That just seemed out of place.The conflict within characters is somewhat interesting though. It does not necessarily make this a bad film, just a boring at times Super Hero film. I came to see this film to see Spiderman get in a lot of action, not see Peter Parker try to work out his life.So this sequel does not have enough action for me. It has an OK villain, but there are a lot of major flaws in this super hero film. I do not recommend it greatly, the first Spiderman Film I think is much better but this is not that bad either.

What's The Fuss?,"Sorry guys, but I'm one to find Spiderman 2 the weakest in the series. The first one was excellent, a sufficient plot, no over-loading on violence, and villains, a perfect action movie. Spiderman 2, all it felt like was hardly no in-depth plot, loads of violence and a unrealistic (CGI wise) villain. It didn't have that feel. I'm totally despised seeing that Spiderman 2 out-rates Spiderman on IMDb. There is just way too much explosions and action from my likening. Spiderman had a bit of everything, Spiderman 2 had way too much typical comic book elements.

Ten years later...,"This is absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a sequel that was just as good as the first, it whooped the first movie so hard and it set the bar extremely high for future superhero movies and movies in general to come. Toby Maguire, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Rosemary Harris and extras play their roles wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst not so much.The characters have matured and you'll care for these characters. The story is much deeper and the stakes are higher than they wee in the first film.2 years after the first movie, Peter is suffering to balance his normal life and his crime fighting life. He's low on pay, he doesn't make time for Harry or Mary Jane, Peter is doing poorly in school, he doesn't want to feel this pain anymore. He meets Doc Ock, a scientist invested in his work, but when his experiment goes bad and kills his wife, he avenges her and swears to take down Spider-Man and all of New York by rebuilding his work, but bigger and stronger than ever. Now, Peter has to stand up and do what's right.The action in this movie is just perfect. Not too boring and not too intense. The CGI looks really amazing for 2004 and it hasn't aged yet. I love the fight on the clock tower and on top of the train. Although I did enjoy Danny Elfman's work in the first Spider-Man, he brings his A game to the sequel and it's fantastic. The music is calm, ambient, sad, and frantic when it appropriately needs to be. This is personally my favorite film score. It's just a shame that Elfman had an uncomfortable time composing for the movie.Quoting from the film critic Roger Ebert who didn't enjoy the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man that much, he said that Spider-Man 2 ""May be the best superhero movie I have ever seen."" If you have not seen Spider-Man 2, go and watch this. You are doing a massive disservice to yourself by missing out on a compelling story and spectacular fight sequences. 10 years later and I still love this movie so much.

How can Spider-Man possibly be Improved?,"Spider-Man 2 (2004, Dir. Sam Raimi)It's been two years since Peter Parker had his transformation into Spider-Man, and he is still trying to balance life perfectly. His love for Mary Jane is becoming much stronger, as he finds it hard to not let her down. His friendship with Harry Osborn is at risk, as the young Harry is frustrated with Spider-Man getting away with his fathers death. And if this wasn't enough for the superhero, a new enemy is in town. Dr. Otto Octavius is involved in a freak scientific accident, and emerges as the dangerous, 'Doc Ock'.The first 'Spider-Man' movie was amazing, and you would have to wonder how it could possibly be improved. Well, you just simply make a sequel. Good sequels which was better than the original are hard to come by, but 'Spider-Man 2' does the job perfectly. All the cast and crew return bringing a very familiar feeling to the original movie. Everyone is older and feel more mature. Alfred Molina is an actor who is not normally associated with comic book villains, but he performs an awesome version of Doc Ock, who is definitely more menacing than the previous Green Goblin. The special effects have improved this time, with some great action scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock. If you've never seen the 'Spider-Man' movies, what are you waiting for?

"O-ver-ra-ted (clap...clap, clap clap)","This has got to be the most overrated movie of the summer. Not that it's a bad movie, but the critics just seem to be hailing it as the best comic book movie of all time, and quite frankly, it isn't.This movie is like the LA Lakers, and the Shaq and Kobe are Doc Ock and his Arms. The third major force, Phil Jackson, is like J. Jonah Jameson. Without these three, this would be a terrible movie.It brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of Doc Ock. I kept trying to remember awesome scenes from it that DON'T involve Doc Ock, and there aren't any. There isn't enough of him, though. The rest of the movie is a rehash of all the themes touched on in the first one.A movie about the tough decisions of Peter Parker: whether he can exist as both Peter and Spiderman, the pitfalls of being a hero the world underappreciates, and the bitter truth that he can never have Mary Jane, lest his foes harm her. I liked this movie better the first time I saw it, when it was called Spiderman 1. Roger Ebert slammed Shrek 2 for ""saying nothing original."" Apparently by the time he wrote his 4 star review for Spidey, he lost interest in the importance of novelty.How many times do we have to watch Tobey Maguire gazing into a mirror as if yet another Uncle has died? How many times do we have to watch MJ react to petty accidents as if her life has been destroyed? How many times must we hear the same old sappy Heroes and Virtue monologue from the old woman? I put up with it the first time, but it got too old. With Doc Ock the movie is good. Not great. Not even as good as the first.

Remarkable!,Spider-Man 2 put my faith back into the movies. The action in this film is unbelievable. Just to be able to visibly see the very stories we have read in comic books come to life on the big screen was wonderful. I found myself not wanting the story to end. Many of the movies based on superheroes in a comic book tend not to stick close to the actual story. I personally have been a Spider-Man fan since I was seven. The movie has surpassed my expectation and I certainly look forward Spider-Man 3! The next film sets itself up for a kick butt start. Raimi should take a page from X2 or the Lethal Weapon series and just open the next film with a wild battle. Keep the Tobey thought intro but have him talk over a Spider-Man vs Sandman battle. You can grab the viewer right away and still tell your full story right after. A villain made of sand really doesn't need an intro and these kids clamoring for more action will be satiated enough to let Sam continue to spin his remarkable story and his take on Spider-Man.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is the completely stupid mixture what this movie is. We have some really stupid scenes (mentioned above).Then we have some scenes which try to show us the big emotions from movies for grown people (when Peter tells his aunt he could have saved his uncle).And then she walks slowly and quiet away (it tries to be great emotional cinema; but IMO this reaction was completely unrealistic; especially when they meat the next time!).Or when we see she hasn't enough money and mas to move to another apartment.

I made me go ""oh oh"" !And there is even more of this ""mixing"". There is even more comedy (the newspaper scenes), but there are also some horror elements (doc oc - LOL, another stupid name in this movie).At all: this was much more a comic as it was a movie.

On the one hand, he realizes ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" but he still wants his own life. It seems that every promise made to others he cares about is broken because of his self-imposed ""responsibility."" He cannot hold a job because he felt compelled to stop a robbery. He misses Mary Jane's play for a similar occasion. Adding insult to injury, is the fact that his powers are misfiring. He keeps losing his mastery of equilibrium, he cannot stick to walls, and he cannot sling his web. Frustrated, he packs up being Spider-Man. But is it for the best? At the same time, Doctor Octavius is trying to show Peter Parker the mastery of fusion power. It could solve the world's energy problem, mostly by copying the power of the sun. His robotic arms used to control the experiment fuse with his spinal cord and brain functions, giving the scientist a split personality. Now, he is controlled by the artificial intelligence of his robotic arms. Doc Ock needs a special element to continued his experiments. Only a vindictive Harry Osborne has. Since he wants Spider-Man dead, Doc Ock has to kill Spidey to get his precious metal. At the outset, this movie does so well in giving us super-heroes who we care about. The characters and story do not take precedence over the special effects. Director Sam Raimi does well in making Mary Jane, Harry Osborne, Peter Parker, and even Aunt May believable as real people. This is probably the best strength. We identify with them because they have the same problems we do. Aunt May cannot meet mortgage requirements, Peter can't pay rent, Harry turns to alcohol after an abysmal failure, and Mary Jane is frustrated with Peter's lack of commitment. Probably the best scene that shows this believability is when Peter confides in Aunt May. In fact, I think Rosemary Harris does a fantastic job, giving this background character real strength. I also liked the way Doc Ock was given some depth and intrigue. As a villain, he is smart, powerful, and strong. Even more intriguing is how he meets his demise, which will surprise the audience. However, the action and special effects are the topping on the cake. The fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock are incredibly fantastic, giving such intricate detail that will even wow a CGI specialist. One of those involves Spidey trying to save Aunt May from Doc Ock atop a high building. A better scene involves the two opponents fighting atop a moving elevated train. In any case, Spider-Man 2 is the best of the series, and probably the best super-hero movie ever ... so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I'm not your enemy, but I'm not your friend"" - A Review of ""Spider-Man 2""","Spider-Man 2 is the second addition to the original trilogy of Spider-Man films. It follows the story of Peter Parker, once again played by Tobey Maguire, as he continues to navigate the challenges of being a superhero while also dealing with new threats and personal struggles. The film also explores Peter's relationships with Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, and Harry Osborn, played by James Franco, and his conflicts with the film's main antagonist, Dr. Octopus, played by Alfred Molina.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had terrific chemistry as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, and their performances were compelling and gave their characters depth. This was one of the things I liked best about the movie. Additionally stunning and contributing to the overall enjoyment of the film were the visual effects employed to construct Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus. The orchestrated action sequences also had some thrilling moments. The movie also focused more on Peter Parker's internal turmoil and emotional issues, which increased the story's interest and complexity.Compared to the first movie, Spider-Man 2 was more polished, with a better pacing and a more engaging plot. The chemistry between the characters was better and the subplots were more relevant to the story.Overall, Spider-Man 2 is a film that provides some exciting action scenes, impressive visual effects and a more meaningful depth. The performances by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are a highlight, the film is a more polished and engaging compared to the first movie and is definitely worth a watch for those who enjoyed the first one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressed..,Absolute banger! Sequels are usually worse than the first part but Spider-Man 2 was the exact opposite. The same elements from the prequiel but amped up to a whole another level.Solid story with great pacing. Set the atmosphere perfectly with great emotional emphasis. Good music composition and sound choices. The dialogue was not bad and certainly had some taste to it with some funny one liners. The visuals were pretty good considering the time it came out in. The characters have developed nicely so far. The dynamics between the characters and they absolutely nailed it with Peter Parker's character though Spiderman's character could have been improved.Overall an enjoyable flim with phenomenal directing. Rewatchable: Yes . Memorable: Yes,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I don't get it man.,"There is absolutely no doubt that this movie has some of the greatest themes of any movie, sporting a lot to say about responsibility, the cost and sacrifice of great ability, and all in a very well written way, setting up the mental burden on Peter very very well. So here are my pros.One of, if not the greatest script, and general direction of a superhero movie. Motivations and themes are great all around.Cinematography is pretty solid, nothing insane like some people have said but it's solid overall with some very good shots, such as Doc Ock rising, the power of the sun, some great action filming, generally solid framing and good use of lighting. Of course love Raimi's camera movement.Action is actually really good.Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is amazing, the character is amazing and Alfred plays him to perfection, outclassing everyone.Practical effects are amazing per usual.Some absolutely amazing scenes, like all time level, with the OR Doc Ock scene, the train fight, the end speech, etc.Can be utterly hilarious, sometimes not so much, but it is a funny movie that balanced tone really well, most of the humour comes from JK Simmons by the way.ConsWhy is there a vault in the middle of room and why did aunt may kick that guy what the (Nitpicking I know lol it's jokes)Editing can be slightly wack, but only on occasion.The chemistry with most of our main character is again abysmal, I simply do not believe Peter, Harry, or MJ can be friends.The acting from Tobey is again sub par, a bad Spider-Man, decent Peter Parker, but his lacklustre line delivery and same tone as both leads me to believe Tobey is only decent at acting angry and nothing else.The dialogue and lines in this film can sometimes be borderline atrocious, like the timing of lines, or the utter terrible word choice that even the dumbest, most awkward person couldn't think of if they tried, and not for the sake of humour, it's just bad.My main problem, the love story, is simply infuriating. They spend two damn movies explaining why Peter has THE RESPONSIBILITY, THE THEME OF THIS MOVIE, to not endanger the people close to him, Peter rejects MJ at the end of the first movie, and rejects her again, only for her to say she's dating someone?? She also seems extremely eager to get with Peter despite marrying soon? Like it is a habit in every movie for her to essentially cheat, and I get how this can be a byproduct of abuse, I think that's a great story element, where it faults is completely ignoring the fact that everyone would have a problem with cheating behaviour, nobody acknowledges it and it makes it very hard to believe this relationship along with the trash chemistry. Back to the actual theme, got a little sidetracked. They spend two movies building up the point that Peter cannot be with MJ, and yet immediately after rejecting her, he tries to learn poetry to woo her, then after admits to himself that he can't be with her at risk of her being killed by villains. All of this would be excusable, in fact I would love it if they did not get together at the end. Showing that he hasn't learned anything about that in the last two movies, considering he saved her twice because the villains know he loves her. Not to mention she literally ditched her husband at their wedding to get with Peter, and he's just like yeah I love this treacherous b*tch. It completely diminishes the theme of responsibility, making Peter not simply flawed, but nonsensical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very good....but perhaps they wrote the main character wrong...,"I enjoyed ""Spider-Man 2"" very much. It had lovely special effects and interesting characters. However, I also felt annoyed about one major aspect of the film. Tobey Maguire's version of Peter Parker was just too darn stupid and annoying. Throughout much of the film, Parker has horrible problems balancing his life as Spider-Man and Peter--and did a horrible job as both. In fact, his ineptitude really made me cringe. Can anyone be THAT klutzy, nerdy and dumb? It tried to make him endearingly inept--but I wanted my superhero to be less of a knucklehead and less pathetic. Peter, unfortunately, was often just pathetic. So, when the movie introduced a great villain, eye-popping stunts of Spider-Man appearing to really fly through the streets of New York and a very spunky and likable Aunt May, you still couldn't help feeling that Peter needed to stop whining and be a man! Too bad, as otherwise this was a likable film and an amiable follow-up to the first Spider-Man film.Also, what's with that scene with the annoying woman on the street singing the Spider-Man song in the most god-awful rendition in movie history! Homer Simpson's ""Spider-Pig"" song would have been far more fitting than this tuneless moment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Has it all,"This movie has everything you'd want from a superhero movieIt improves on the first movie in every way.There are great new characters that are introduced. The tension between certain character grows and the action is on an all Time high.The end scene where he swings away to At long last love "" is one of the more epic superhero scenes ever.Amazing soundtrack that's heroic and swinging scenes that makes you want to be spiderman.They haven't topped this yet even though everybody hype no way home up. It was also a good movie. But it was weak and focused too much on fan service rather than what this movie does - spiderman 2 is its own movie and still delivers what fans wanted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lackluster Follow Up,"Despite the better reviews for this movie, I thought it was a very flawed sequel. The story line and villain were pretty well done but the acting and special effects were far worse than the first despite this having the same actors essentially and in there more technology/budget for effects. Also the scenes with girls screaming were way over the top and too often.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"OK, did the write actually read a Spiderman comic book","I am sick and tired of great comic heroes being turned to a load of crap on the screen. This is truly another example of how stupid Hollywood writers, directors and produces take a great action hero and reduce him to a bunch of screen garbage only to satisy a greater population who have no vested interest in the character.Poor Spiderman....what a wimp. Poor Peter Parker and complaining and carrying on started to drive me whacko. This movie really sucked.The special effect were incredible, but that has to do with technology not writing.What can us true Spiderman fans really do about this crap produced by Hollywood. Nothing. All we can do is endure another pile of crap soon to be released.Michael Moore said it best. Hollywood Producers should be forced to see their crappy movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How does this only have a 7.3!?,"It seems futile to do a plot synopsis, as most of the planet should've seen this movie by now. Over the years I've tried my best to look at this film with a critical eye and not be influenced by nostalgia. But the nostalgia runs strong with this whole trilogy. Still, I can openly admit the flaws with the first film. And it becomes all the more easy with the bloated mess that is Spider-Man 3. But even after dozens (and I mean dozens) of viewings, this still stands up as one of the best, if not the best film to come out of the now over packed Super Hero genre.The main question Spider- Man 2 poses is - What are you willing to give up to be a hero? At the heart of this movie is Peter's struggle to live any semblance of a normal life while grappling with the responsibility being Spider-Man carries. Sam Raimi was an avid Spidey comic reader growing up and his understanding of the character and themes presented therein is simply unmatched. The thing that separates Spider-Man from other super heroes is his struggles are grounded. He can't hold down a job, he's failing at school, his relationships are falling apart. Things your everyday person can relate to.Compounding his stressful daily life is a new threat in the form of one of the greatest comic book villains ever put to screen - Doc Ock. There's a reason Alfred Molina's appearance in the No Way Home trailer broke the internet. He's just that damn good! His super villain origin story is tragic. At his core he's a good man with good intensions. Who's own intelligence and ego ultimately become his downfall. Watching the Jekyl & Hyde back and forth between Ock and his mechanical arms creates a captivating dynamic unlike anything put to screen before or after. Although I wish they would've kept him alive, his sacrifice at the end of the film is undeniably powerful. I still get chills every time I hear, ""I will not die a monster.""Tobey Maguire also gives us the quintessential iteration of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. You can't watch the train sequence and tell me he didn't give this role 110%, constipation memes aside. He brilliantly encapsulates everything that's great about the character. Peter's a deeply conflicted man being torn between two worlds. But as this film shows, even without the powers Peter Parker is still a hero at heart.Every aspect of this movie is near flawless. Danny Elfman's score is riveting, the action set pieces have such style and provide some truly unique and memorable fight choreography. Most of the CGI holds up extremely well to this day. I still have to remind myself almost all of Spidey's web slinging is completely digital. It also has one of the best CGI shots of the decade, with the corpse of Doc Ock floating underwater. Yes that's entirely CGI. They actually attempted a close up shot of a human being fully submersed in water in 2004... Mind blowing!I could rave about this movie all day, as I do believe it to be the pinnacle of the genre. It's funny, romantic, touching, dramatic, brilliantly shot and even manages to throw in some of Raimi's signature brand of Horror that jump started his career. With Spider-Man 2 Sam Raimi has crafted a comprehensive character study with some brilliant performances and plenty of bombastic Spidey vs Doc Ock action. Anyone who gives this move less than 4 stars should be psychiatrically evaluated. Super Hero movies just don't get better than this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Step Back from the Original Movie,"This is a movie that I saw in the theater originally. My mother took my sister and I to see it. She knew that I was a big Spider-Man fan. My sister also liked him enough. I know that I've seen this a few times throughout the years, but it had been a while. Jaime and I checked this out. Much like myself, she hadn't seen it in some time. We also want to watch Spider-Man: No Way from Home.For this movie, we are picking up where the last one left off. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has come to terms with being Spider-Man. It is getting in the way of his life though. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has feelings for him, but Peter rejects her. He also isn't there when she needs him. Harry Osborn (James Franco) is also broken with what happened to his father. He tries to fill the shoes with OSCORP. He has hired Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). He is a brilliant scientist trying to create a fusion reactor.The experiment goes wrong turning Otto into Doc Ock. Peter has a crisis of faith with his superpowers and decides to give them up. It takes time with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Mary Jane and even Harry to come to terms with who he is and what he has to do.With all of that fleshed out, I should say that this movie didn't hold up for me. Jaime struggled with this one as she found boring. I don't mind the concept that is brought over from a series of comics in the early line with Peter losing his powers due to losing confidence in himself. It doesn't play out as well in this movie after multiple viewings. It makes Peter come off as almost whining. It is a shame though as we have a good cast. Maguire is good in his role, but I don't like the script here. Dunst, Molina, Harris, J. K. Simmons, Dylan Baker and Bill Nunn are all solid. I like the cameos by Bruce Campbell, Elizabeth Banks and Ted Raimi. The only performance that didn't work was Franco.What else doesn't hold up as well are the effects. You can tell they're CGI. They were good for the time; I will give it that. I do like that this movie is bringing all these comic book characters to life. What we are getting here just isn't as good as I remember it.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of The G.O.A.T,"This movie is one of the G. O. A. T cause its a superhero movie that is not afraid to focus more on the ""Man"" aspect of Spider-Manit really fleshed out Peter Parker as a person and how he struggles living his two lifes as a Poor College Student and an All powerful Superhero, even tho his hero life is ruining his personal life, his grades, his romantic relationship with MJ, and also his friendship with Harry but he still keeps going and push through cause he needs to bear the great responsibility that comes with his great power, also Peter as a character parallels with main villain Doc Ock who happens to be Peter's idol who peter looked up to and wants to be like, Doc Ock also has a great power (His Intelligence) but the difference between peter & him is he let go of his own responsibility (of only using his Intelligence for the good of man kind) to pursue his own goal unlike Peter who almost did it by giving up being Spider-Man but after Aunt May's pep talk & he realized that the people of the city needs him, he pick back up his mantle.. Sacrificing his own happiness for the greater good, Which is very inline with Spider-Man main core theme massage and that is Responsibility, Sacrifice, & Choiceits really simple story wise but i dont see that as weakness of the movie, i actually see it more of a strength, cause with simple plot they could focus more on the character complexity and how they developed especially Peter.The Movie could be cheesy at times but i see it as charming and adds to the style & flavor of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It would have been a great movie if they didn't recycled the first one's story.,"I would have enjoyed this more if i didn't watched the first one.At first it bothered me why i never like this film. I love the acting, the characters, the ending, everything here is objectively good, despite that i never had any fun watching this. It just became apparent that whatever happened here parallels the story of what happened in the first one.Granted, The original was one of the best superhero movies i've watched at the time, i loved it for what it was and i enjoyed watching it at least twice which is something that i rarely do.Then this movie was released afterwards, in almost every way it is better than the first one, the actor for Doc Oct needs a special mention and the emotions that transpired within the movie gave the feel that a lot more is at stake.At the time i felt compelled to like this movie for what it is, but it's something i can't do, despite the talent the actors put in table, this movie feels cheap and a cop out since i already watched the first one which is basically the template of all the 3 spiderman movies (with Tobey Mcguirre)The villain's performance was stellar; i cannot stress that enough, but that only amplifies the feeling that their talents were wasted and the recycling of the story of spiderman 1 spoiled the greatness of this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I actually think the first one is better. Even if Aunt May hits a villain with an umbrella. It's all a bit... extra... in a desperate kind of way.It feels like it's trying to deviate from Raimi's horror aesthetic and shots, so much so it doesn't know what it is anymore.

The best Spider-Man movie,"The first time I got the chance to watch this film was on a cassette. I was very impressed by it and watched this film almost every day. But quite recently I decided to review this creation again and to this day I honestly adore it, but first things first.Acting. The main role in the film is played by the same unmistakable Tobey Maguire, who perfectly understands the character of Peter Parker and reveals the essence of his hero even more clearly. Tobey performed all the feelings and emotions flawlessly, this is a truly memorable character. The role of the main villain in the film was played by the talented and respectable actor Alfred Molina, he perfectly conveyed the image of an intelligent scientist, and then a psycho with a split personality. I also enjoyed such actors as Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons, Donna Murphy, Daniel Gillies, Ted Raimi and Bill Nun.The cinematography of the film is simply amazing, the number of special effects has become much larger compared to the first movie and they have become much brighter and on a larger-scale. The musical accompaniment written by Danny Elfmann was also excellent; all the compositions in the film turned out to be very pleasant and memorable. I was also pleased with the careful work done by the cameraman; all the emotional, intriguing, exciting moments were captured to the highest standard.As a result: we have an excellent sequel, even surpassing its predecessor in some ways, and which can offer excellent acting, high-quality and bright special effects, and a memorable musical accompaniment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The CGI was not flogged to death either, like most current superhero productions these days. With a good combination of real set scenes. Overall, performances by all the cast exceeds expectations.

You're just waiting to be slaughtered.Well, okay, let's start at the beginning, I wasn't a HUGE fan of the original Spiderman movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first one as being entertaining, but what was it ABOUT? It seemed to just be mainly character development and nothing else. Oh sure, Willem Dafoe WAS menacing as the Green Goblin (Is Willem Dafoe anything BUT menacing?) but there wasn't anything substantial to come of it.Which brings me to Spiderman 2. This is a lot better story wise then the original Spiderman. While I can do without Alfred Molina (and who wouldn't? Ever see Scorpion Spring?) as Doc Ock, The thing I like about this version is the neat little side story about Peter Parker's struggles of whether work, education, Mary-Jane or being Spiderman is more important in his life. While the answer is predictable from 100 miles away, hey at least Tobey Maguire is entertaining, like he always is,.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Perfect Mix Between Action, Superhero, and Drama","Spiderman 2 is directed by Sam Raimi and once again stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a nerdy kid attending college in New York. However, he's secretly a superhero as well, a hero that calls himself ""Spiderman."" After the accidental death of his last villain, the Green Goblin, the tension between Peter and his best friend, Harry, has heightened, and the connection between Peter and his love interest, Mary Jane has begun to feel uneasy. Once a new villain called Doctor Octopus has presented himself, Peter must balance his life as a superhero and a college kid while keeping his relationships intact.Spiderman 2 is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the already amazing first film. Most everything in Spiderman 2 is great in most ways, and stands as one of the best superhero films to date. With a great villain, script, and perfectly well-rounded main character, Spiderman 2 is everything it promised to be. Sam Raimi handles this movie pleasantly, and not only built upon the first installment in the franchise, but improved upon it as well.The confliction of the main character, Peter, is absolutely flawless. Constantly throughout the film, the script beats Peter, and the audience, over the head with his problems. His failing relationship with Mary Jane, his inability to hold a job or keep grades up, the constant feel of tension between Peter and Harry, and the new villain on the rise, Doctor Octopus, all combine to make Peter's life completely awful. As the audience, we feel these conflicts through our main character, and subsequently want him to come out on top even more than before seeing the film. This capability to emotionally feel what the main character is what makes any protagonist, whether it be Spiderman or Han Solo, great.The acting, as well, is fantastic. Tobey Maguire, while not exactly improving upon his performance in Spiderman (2002), again does pretty well. Maguire plays a great Peter, and a decent Spidey, which add together for an ultimate success. James Franco plays an even better Harry this time around, improving upon his original performance in every way. Once again, Kirsten Dunst plays a pretty good Mary Jane. While her performance is fine, the character of Mary Jane starts to feel almost like an antagonist throughout the movie. Through her shaky connection with Peter, the audience is, at first, confused with her actions, and then just starts to get slightly annoyed with her character.Despite all of the great performances throughout Spiderman 2, Alfred Molina completely steals the show, playing a magnificent Doctor Octopus. Although Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin/Norman Osborn was great, Molina's performance slightly tops that of Dafoe's. Molina plays an astounding villain, with an understandable motivation and a sensible plan. Doc Ock isn't just a bad guy for sake of being a bad guy; he makes sense. The viewer understands why he does the things he does, and won't take him for granted at all. From his actions to his lines, Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is one of the best superhero villains in cinematic history.Sam Raimi also handles the direction very well. Throughout the entire film, no action is filmed poorly, with no quick or abundant cuts, and great wide shots of Spidey swinging around the city. However, Raimi knows when to cut down on the ""cool"" shots and such during a talking or exposition scene. He smartly recognizes when the camera shouldn't be taking over for the script, and it pays off greatly. Although he utilizes his traditional ""Raimi"" camera angles, it works out well, and doesn't distract at all from the plot and characters.Now, I can't write a review of Spiderman 2 without mentioning the train sequence. The train sequence involves Spidey and Doc Ock fighting on a moving train, and it's easily one of the best action sequences in superhero film history. Everything about this sequence is absolutely perfect, and it works in every way. This particular sequence combines the genres of comic book and action so flawlessly, and it works perfectly.The only issue I took up with Spiderman 2 was a small one, but it is present. It is very hard to explain without spoilers, but it is this: Peter's problems are large throughout this film, and it's obvious. However, one of his specific problems is only halfway present. The problem is existent, but it disappears when convenient. Like mentioned above, hard to say without spoilers, but there it is.Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest superhero films ever created, and slightly improves upon its predecessor. I'd recommend Spiderman 2 to anyone who enjoys action and drama wrapped together in one movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just like the pizza I ate the other night.  Covered in extra cheese.,"This movie is not terrible, but it's not great either. The cheesy moments in the film are some of the corniest ever in cinema history. The movie still has some great action though and Doctor Octopus looks great. The fight scenes are excellent. But the stupid storyline with Spider-Man losing his powers because he's depressed and Doctor Octopus being a sympathetic character is just bad. We already had that with Norman Osborn in Part 1. And having his arms develop personalities of their own was dumb. It was like having 4 hand puppets attached to his back. Not all of Spider-Man's enemies are good people being pushed to go bad. Some are just plain evil and Octopus is one of them. Why change the character. All and all it's a decent popcorn flick. It's a far better film than the horrifically bad first Spider-Man, but it still has it's share of sub-greatness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Spider-Man 2' is a masterclass on how to create a proper sequel.,"This movie is a very well-made sequel that picks up right where the prior film leaves off with a very seamless transition.All the major cast returned from the original to reprise their roles - Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry Osborn, Aunt May, even the editor-in-chief of the newspaper is the same actor. It's always distracting and awkward when sequels include glaringly obvious lineup changes, but 'Spider-Man 2' was able to get every main actor to return.I still really enjoy Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Remember that from the comic books, Peter Park is an absolute nerd. Tobey Maguire, with his wide-eyed stares and open-mouthed breathing, is dorky enough to be believable as Peter Parker yet handsome enough to be simultaneously believable as a superhero.The special effects were greatly improved. In the original 'Spider-Man' the special effects are outdated and many times its very obvious you're looking at a computer generated image. The special effects in 'Spider-Man 2' are much greatly improved and flow more naturally. They're still a bit dated by today's standard, but if you watch the two films back to back, you'll notice how much smoother the special effects are in the sequel.Overall I really enjoyed 'Spider-Man 2', it's a great movie and it's on part with the original in terms of action, suspense, and story-telling. I would definitely recommend this one if you're a fan of Spider-Man or a fan of superhero movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Dull, Repetitive, and Shapeless","I was very surprised by my lack of response to this movie considering the glowing reviews.  But I found it to be pretty lame, repetitive, dull, and shapeless.  My wife absolutely hated it, and the audience I was with was bored and unresponsive.  The focus on character is nice, but the material just wears you out after a while, and there is no real driving force to the plot.  Cutting about thirty minutes would help.  Giving Doc Ock a real plotline would have helped.  Cutting out some of the repetitive scenes would have helped.  Excising that ill-conceived I'm-losing-my-powers stuff would have helped.  All in all, everyone clearly gave this their all, but it's not very good.  Better than the first one?  Sure, Willem Dafoe in a plastic suit killed that one.  But this one is hardly the ""perfect"" film the critics have bizarrely claimed it to be.

Everything about this film is exactly how Spider-Man was written, Doctor Octopus was amazing in this movie, the chemistry between Tobey & Alfred is so spot on. The best Spider-Man movie ever!!! Tobey did a fantastic job as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, just fantastic. This movie is so underrated, & with people giving it a 7.3/10 are wrong, it should be higher because this is how films are made & characters. At least this film is Marvel's best since The Winter Solider & Infinity War, by far Marvel's golden age at the time until now. I miss movies like these, we don't usually get these stuff anymore which is sad, but Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse did great, & thats my second favorite Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man 2 brings the exciting moment of history of Spider-Man. It's a fantastic film, & most people don't realize that. Thank you Sam Raimi & Tobey Maguire & Stan Lee for bringing this movie to life as the best Spider-Man film ever!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Special effects + rona dhona like a Hindi movie = Spiderman-2,"Storyline: Spidey is back in action as a crime-fighting super hero. But this time, he seems to be grappling with his situation, struggling to strike a balance between his life as Peter Parker and Spiderman.Comment: The performances remain more or less similar to the previous movies. Tobey Maguire has done his job well. The movie makers could have definitely found someone better to play the role of MJ. In fact, in Marve's comics, MJ is shown to be a voluptuous model, a role which Kirsten Dunst fails to fit in to. She looks like a popularity seeking cheapster. James Franco as Harry Osborn and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius have done their roles well.The most notable feature of the movie is the improved special effects that leave the viewer asking for more. The action sequence on the train is especially exhilarating. The cityscapes of Newyork seem more real than the previous movie.Talking about the negatives, the movie has been turned into too much of a love story. The worst part of the movie however, is that his mask is off and he is seen by many. Since kids would be greater fans of Spiderman, I am not sure as to how well they would appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Take out the sap-fest between Peter and Mary Jane and we're good,"Spidey 2 was bittersweet. Spiderman had a new and incredible nemesis in Doc Oc, and at the same time he was going through an internal struggle of whether or not to remain a super hero. On the one hand there was a normal life as Peter Parker: no crime fighting, and complete with Mary Jane. On the other hand there was the life of Spiderman: never a dull moment, the weight of the world on his shoulders, and Mary Jane would be out of the picture. The story made for a great movie, and there were some fantastic scenes, but... I got sick of the Peter Parker/Mary Jane show. I'm not all that impressed with Kirsten Dunst to begin with, then she just became down right annoying as Mary Jane.I am a guy. When I sit down to watch an action film, I want lots of action, minimal dialogue, and zero sap. The sap factor was large and in charge in Spiderman 2... the only significant flaw in my eyes (well that and when he saved his Auntie from Doc Oc). The potential was there for this movie to soar above and even beyond its predecessor, but it was bogged down by PP and MJ. It was a decent movie, one worth watching again, just not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated Spider-Man Movie in my opinion!  Too much love duty,"All the critics think this is the best spider man movie and call it one of the best superhero movie of all time and everyone else calls it the best one too. But in my opinion, I think that this is an overrated spider man movie. I like that it starts fresh and has very funny moments particularly J.K. Simmons who is still fantastic as J. Jonah Jameson, but as the movie goes on it starts to get boring, especially for a spider man movie. The special and visual effects are great and spider man looked as real as ever, but the movie drags on in the middle part. Tobey Maguire, who was excellent as the titular character in the first film, lacks heroic presence in the movie. Kirsten Dunst sort of disappoints in the movie a little bit but still is convincing as Mary Jane Watson. To be honest though, I thought Alfred Molina was not that menacing as Dock Ock. He lacked as a villain for me in this movie and I prefer the green goblin over him from the first film. However, James Franco I thought really does a great job in this movie and is my favorite performance in this film but is a little underused.Overall, I thought this movie is just good, not great as everyone else thought. The first hour is excellent but becomes too boring and too much love duty afterwards. Maguire and Molina are disappointing as the hero and the villain. Dunst is still good. The special effects are still amazing. Franco and Simmons both steal the show.Overall: 7/10 Good but overrated Spiderman Movie my least favorite one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IMDBs Rating [7.5] is a joke...,"IMDb is a great source for movie ratings, but it lacks consistency when it comes to superhero and comic-book movies. It's hard to justify modern MCU films receiving higher ratings than this classic.Spider-Man 2 by Sam Raimi is a comic-book masterpiece and ranks just behind The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero movies ever made. The story follows Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, as he struggles to balance his superhero responsibilities with his ""normal"" life. Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is one of the genre's most compelling villains, bringing depth and intensity to every scene. The film strikes the perfect balance of story and character development, making Peter's journey both relatable and powerful. The action scenes are outstanding, yet there's also space for genuinely funny moments (especially from J. Jonah Jameson) and moving dramatic scenes. Spider-Man 2 stands as a brilliant example of a sequel that surpasses the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great sequel!,"The original cast is back, and the story picks up where 'Spider-Man' left off. At the end of the first film, Harry swore to avenge Spider-Man, whom he believes to be responsible for his father's death.The saga continues, and is as stylish as ever, with Sam Raimi back in the director's chair. The film's main villain is Otto Octavius, who becomes nothing more than a creature due to a malfunction of one of his experiments. The visual effects are really good, and this is another great script with thought-provoking dialogue.Mary Jane is now an accomplished stage actress, Harry is head of Oscorp, May Parker is still coming to terms with her husband's death, and Peter Parker is fighting his own inner demons, which is starting to take its toll on his powers. JK Simmons is back as Mr Jameson, and is hilarious - I just love him in this role!!They never do explain how Parker manages to change outfits so quickly, and what becomes of his clothes, but for the sake of making the movie work, lets just forget about that detail (the same as Hulk's clothes when he turns into the hulk, and then back to human again...). The action sequences are fast and spectacular. This is a great sequel to a spectacular film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Only Alfred Molina is worth watching (and worthy of an Oscar),"I'm apparently in the minority of film goers in that I despise this film. Its simply one of the dullest, most predictable films I've seen in years, and yet people are falling all over themselves with praise for it. Which version did all these people see since it wasn't the one that played my local cinema.Basically this is a Spiderman film with out Spiderman. The Parker/MJ relationship trudges on, Osborne moans about how his father was killed by Spidey and Parker tries giving up the suit. Its dull and worst of all you know where its going. Perhaps its the trailers, or perhaps its just the conventions of the genre, but what ever it is this film is so predictable that Las Vegas is considering banning it as too sure a thing.The only joy is Alfred Molina's Doc Ock. When he is on screen you realize what this movie should have been. He is a villain of the highest order and gives a performance that Oscar will be noticing come award time.(It better or else some super villains will tear down the Academy) Molina gives the film a reason to be. Unfortunately instead of being the main thrust of the film he's  given the short end of the stick. If I did my math right he's in it for around 30 to 40 minutes, and disappears from even conversation for whole sections of the film. He's the best thing in this movie and he's second banana to angst.Not that anyone is going to listen to me, but wait for cable or home video when you can zap through the dull parts.Four out of ten, simply because the 10 out of ten Molina bits are dragged down by less than zero rest of the film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Watchable sequel with better Special Effects, but weaker then the first film","I am one of those in the minority who liked Spiderman (2002) better than its sequel. The Special Effects have indeed improved with Dr Octavious (a good but sadly underutilized Alfred Molina) being a worthy match for Spiderman. However, the pacing is weak and the mid-section gets bogged down as it rehashes Peter and MJ's romance from the first film. Also, too many bad things happen to poor Peter, so much so that suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. On the plus side, JK Simmons is as hilarious as ever as Peter's boss J Jonah Jameson. There's also an exciting train rescue. Definitely still worth a watch.Overall 6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not too bad, but the 1st was better...","I have to admit that I preferred watching the original Spiderman. This one seemed to drag in some areas, like showing a unbelievable long bad-streak for the Peter Parker character. Special effects were great, except that at times Spiderman looked a little too fake. Maybe his CGI costume needed to turndown his glossy levels. Regardless, it was worth the 2-hours watching this film.A final comment: With all that web Spiderman was shooting at the buildings and other public/private property, would you not think that some people would be a little upset about his 'littering'?

Great when not trying to be 1978 Superman... again!,"I thought I would like this one more, considering how many people have this one as a favorite (or top) comic-book movie.
I'm not there. It is one of the best as showing the tool that it takes the responsibility of being a super-hero. That was the only really great thing about this movie. Few had shown this because it is hard. Expert job on it.This movie is great also when Raimi uses techniques more related to horror, on sequences that work perfectly. The action is pretty fun, and the train sequence is still one of the comic-book bests, probably.
There is catch on the horror thing. There are a gazillion woman yelling like a scream queen would, everytime something dangerous may happen to them. It's ridiculous.But the weaknesses of the first movie remained on this one. The villain is better, yes, but his actions are still impacted by the 1978 Superman. He does stuff that makes no sense, and how the city reacts to him is not only unrealistic but quite dumb. Fine for 1978, but in 2004? Nope.
The dialogue is even WORSE. It is really dreadful.
Also, the acting got worse. Tobey MaGuire nails the self-doubt but nothing else. Kirsten is quite bland and with her screen time, she would've been better if having more peaks and valleys on her performance, giving that she changes her mind quite a bit on few scenes. James Franco is as bad as ever.It's good. With great and weak things almost in equal parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well-done but clichéd and uninteresting,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is Spiderman...but it's affecting his personal life. Peter can't hold down a job because he's always out helping people AND he's failing his classes at school AND he can't pay his rent AND he's losing his powers AND his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is going to loose her house AND his friend Harry Osborn (James Franco is becoming an alcoholic AND he loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but can't let her know cause it would put her in danger etc etc. Then Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) shows up with deadly mechanical arms that do his bidding. I realize that the movie has to show the hero overcoming adversity but this just pours on the misery to a ridiculous degree. I started getting the uncomfortable feeling that the screenwriters of this enjoyed making the character suffer. To make matters worse Maguire can't act. He's stone-faced throughout the entire picture so, instead of feeling sorry for him, you don't feel anything. Add to that is the comic book dialogue and plotting which just dumbs down the entire movie. Yes, I'm well aware that this IS based on a comic book but what works as a comic does not translate to movies as well. Also J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is not funny or cute--just annoying.So why am I giving this five stars? To be honest I was never bored. Annoyed yes but not bored. Franco, Dunst, Molina and Harris all give good performances (despite the material). The special effects are superb and the fight between Doc Ock and Spider Man on top of a train is exciting and fun. Without Maguire in the title role this might have been better--but I can never accept him as Peter Parker or Spider Man. A 5 at best.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""One of The Greatest Super-Hero Movie Ever Made""","This film is my favourite Spider-Man movie of all time (other than those two animated masterpiece). Everything about this film feels right in my opinion. From the amazing casting, the action set pieces, the practical effects, the story, the emotion and the overall tone of the film. After all of these years and many new Spider-Man films, I still don't think any has quite managed to get to this level of sheer awesomeness.Spider-Man 2 is a character-driven masterpiece that explores the internal struggles of its protagonist. Tobey Maguire delivers a career-defining performance as a Peter Parker grappling with the weight of his responsibilities. You get to see a more vulnerable side to Spider-Man and Peter Parker. His portrayal of Spider-Man's physical and psychological decline is both heartbreaking and inspiring. The film doesn't shy away from the challenges of being a superhero, making the character even more relatable and compelling. He has an emotional breakdown and he gives up the role of being the hero. You get to see the world and what it would be like without him and then how everybody wants him back!Kirsten Dunst is once again good as MJ but unfortunately she isn't given as much to do this time round. She still has really good chemistry with Maguire though. James Franco is back as Harry and we get to see a more devious side to his character.Then we have perfect casting of ""Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus"". Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus is a tour-de-force performance. The transformation of the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius into a monstrous villain is both tragic and terrifying. Molina's portrayal of a man struggling to maintain his humanity amidst the overwhelming power of his mechanical arms is a masterclass in acting.I honestly cannot imagine anyone else playing him. Molina does a terrific job at bringing some humanity to the character.He isn't just a villain, you understand his motives and you even feel sorry for him too!I love the ending when he gets a chance to redeem himself. The tentacles and character design are actually really impressive to be honest. It's amazing what the film's crew was able to do with this character at the time of its release. I really enjoyed the hospital scene too! I really enjoyed return of Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus again in the ""Spider-Man No Way Home""Rosemary Harris is once again perfect as Aunt May and JK Simmons is once again a scene stealer And Every time I think of Spider-Man, I come back to this film.Everybody has emotional breakdowns and then has to find their way back to being themselves again. Spider-Man 2 has a lot of heart to be honest. It's inspiring and the film does a really good job at putting you in the suit of Spider-Man, What would you do?!The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. The iconic train sequence, in particular, is a testament to Raimi's skill as a visual storyteller. The combination of practical effects and CGI creates a sense of scale and realism that is unmatched.Danny Elfman's score for Spider-Man 2 is often considered one of the greatest superhero film scores of all time. It perfectly captures the emotional depth and epic scale of the film. Elfman's music is deeply intertwined with the characters. The main Spider-Man theme evolves to reflect Peter Parker's internal struggles, while Doctor Octopus' theme is a menacing and imposing force. The score is incredibly effective at evoking a wide range of emotions. From the soaring heroism of the Spider-Man theme to the heart-wrenching moments of Peter's personal life, the music perfectly complements the on-screen action. Tracks like ""Train/Appreciation"" have become synonymous with the film, capturing the intensity and drama of the iconic train sequence.""Spider-Man 2"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a profound exploration of the human condition. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a cinematic masterpiece that captures the essence of what it means to be a hero. It's a film that will continue to inspire and entertain for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man 2 sees Raimi up the ante from the previous film taking the characters to the next stage and overcoming the growing pains of the original,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) continues to try and balance his life with the responsibility he carries in his alter ego Spider-Man. Faced with his Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris) financial troubles, his best friend Harry Osborn's (James Franco) hatred of Spider-Man whom he believes murdered his father Norman, and Mary Jane Watson's (Kirsten Dunst) forthcoming marriage to J. Jonah Jameson's (J. K. Simmons) son John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) the situation is exacerbated by Peter's struggles to maintain employment, his enrollment in college, and his role as Spider-Man which is hampered by sudden troubles maintaining his spider powers. When Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfre Molina) experiments with a new fusion reactor using four experimental AI controlled arms to control the experiment, the fusion reactions quickly become unstable and a fight with Spider-Man stops the unstable reaction but also damages the inhibitor chip in the arms with the AI corrupting Dr. Octavious mind. Now with Dr. Octavious, now known by the Daily Bugle as Dr. Octopus, seeking to replicate the experiment Peter Parker finds himself challenged from multiple directions to the point he may abandon Spider-Man.The 2002 release of Spider-Man overcame 20 years of development hell and rejected and stalled concepts to become one of the biggest smash hits of the year only behind Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. With Spider-Man's opening weekend the biggest at the time of its release, Sony was eager to continue the series giving the film a greatly expanded budget at $200 million and delivering a solid sequel that gives more of what worked in the first film while filing down the rougher edges.Maguire is really good as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man even if admittedly he's more comfortable in the charming awkwardness of Peter Parker than the more snarky Peter Parker but Maguire does sell the core of the movie with Peter Parker's desires for a life his own and his drives to be Spider-Man and a hero that often undercut his search for happiness. James Franco does well as Harry Osborn building upon the fallout his character experienced in the previous film and adopting the more ruthless aspects of his father's character with a feeling of slow rot stemming from festering rage coloring him and Peter's friendship. Kirsten Dunst is still good as Mary Jane Watson and her chemistry with Maguire helps to sell the relationship between the two characters and keep us invested. J. K. Simmons continues to effortlessly steal the scene with his take on J. Jonah Jameson. Alfred Molina as antagonist Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doctor Octopus does well as a tragic scientist and his position as one of Peter's idols makes him a sympathetic antagonist who creates layers in his conflict with Spider-Man. The movie features some great character moments including a scene between Rosemary Harris' Aunt May and Maguire's Peter Parker where he tells her about the night Uncle Ben died in a heart wrenching exchange.The action sequences have been significantly refined from the first films with more established weight to Spider-Man's acrobatics and smoother rendering of action and flow. The movie does a great job of realizing not only Spider-Man but also Doctor Octopus with his robotic arms given a real tangible presence that is not only visually interesting but conveys the strength and force present in them. The train top fight in particular is one of the best superhero fights and has nicely established stakes at a lightning fast pace that keeps you engaged throughout.Like the previous film the movie does feel very inspired by that ""silver age"" style of dialogue with exaggerated performances and slightly awkward delivery, but the dialogue has been ironed out with fewer awkward moments in favor of more comedic moments that are self-aware (like Spider-Man riding in an elevator). The movie also strains credibility by not really giving a good reason why Doctor Octopus' arms have their own AI nor why the arms want to build the fusion generator and it seems like you could've just had him motivated by fury at his name being dragged through the mud by the Daily Bugle and had that be the motivating factor. The movie also stumbles a bit at the end with Peter in regards to Harry's arc in that he doesn't say something that he really should have and feels like he only didn't because it ""needs"" it for the sequel.Spider-Man 2 has some of the same flaws as its predecessor, but it refines its strengths so much that it really is a great superhero movie. With likable characters, rich drama, and exhilarating action sequences, Spider-Man 2 plays to its strengths and gives us a mixture of slightly goofy humor with genuinely rich character moments and pathos.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm sure she's an excellent actress, and I'm not too disappointed in performances in the Spiderman series.However, Mary Jane Watson first gained her fame (in the comic) as a model, and I believe the term ""supermodel"" was even used in a few issues.

The Greatest Superhero Masterpiece,"Yesterday was the day Spider-Man 2 was first released, as well as the day that gave millions of people around the world a newfound appreciation for superhero movies. The movie which together with Spider-Man 2002 started it all. The true beginning of superhero movies. Peter Parker may be a teenager but he had to learn about the responsibilities that come with great power. And, above all, or beloved wall-crawler's first few comic book outings were down-to-earth dramas of youthful romance and inner dilemmas caused by the overwhelming responsibilities of being granted seemingly otherworldly powers and the difficulties of being unable to pay rent. The difficulties of being a superhero are shown rather than told. The tone of Spider-Man's best comics are almost perfect in their execution.Tobey also continues to have great chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Their romance picks up right where it left off from the first movie and it continues to evolve. And surprisingly, despite how difficult it would presumably be, it's pulled off masterfully. Hinged on a secret that weighs our protagonist down while allowing him to flourish, something that eats away at him despite his best efforts to keep it at arms lengthThe rest of the returning supporting cast is also great. J. K. Simmons continues to steal every scene as J. Jonah Jameson. James Franco also gets more to do as Harry Osborn. He's a tortured soul that is thirsty for revenge against Spider-Man. The drama between Harry and Peter is expertly crafted while leaving it unresolved so that may be completed in the sequel. Rosemary Harris gets to really shine here as May Parker. She has some great moments with Peter and her quieter scenes along with her nephew are some of the emotional highlights of the story.Spider-Man 2 believes in its story in the same that the die hard fans believe it, it knows what it wants to be and succeeds while keeping its audience glued to the screen. Isn't just a brain smoothing CGI-fest. It's simply and poignantly a realization that being Spider-Man is a burden that Peter Parker is not entirely willing to bear whilst also realizing it will bring him more hardship than he can handle at times. Parker is just like you and me. He struggles to pay the bills, tries to take care of his Aunt, wants to end up with the girl of his dreams, and he takes a mean beating when it comes to blows. You can see the conflict in his eyes as Parker wants to throw it all away for Mary Jane, but knows he has a responsibility because ""He's been given a gift. With great power, comes great responsibility. "" and learns that ""Sometimes to do what's right we have to be steady and give up the things we want the most, even our dreams.""And of course, the score is excellently composed by Danny Elfman which manages to sell every mood and every moment. It's just as iconic for the web-slinger as the classic theme song from the 1967 cartoon, and completes what I personally believe is the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time which will hold a special place in my heart for the rest of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jerk or Hero?,"This film depicts how a jerk became a hero after his accidental bite by a strange spider.Yet he is still a jerk after-all, whenever he is not in his spider uniform.Instead of devoting his precious time in doing good to the world, this jerk chooses to deliver pizzas!And he is a total loser everywhere,not being able to get a decent living , or to support his aunt, or even to get a crump of cake from a party. It's difficult for the viewers to find these amusing!If you can manage to tolerate the first 20 minutes of the film, you will be able to meet the real villain, nothing more but a machine-possessed professor moving around clumsily with his heavy octopus claws, rather comical and not at all scaring. Not even the police has bothered to hunt him down, as if they knew even the jerk could do the job anyway.Surely, people can still try to defend Peter, admiring his love towards Mary Jane which had explained his under-performance in life . Afterall, ""love"" had been so wrongly depicted and over-valued in so many films before.But the truth in life is: being able to do good to the world is much more important than the love between any couple, although the two are not actually totally exclusive of one another, as the jerk has finally discovered at the end of the film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything a comic-book movie should be,"I just saw this film at an exhibitor's screening, and it was everything a comic-book movie should be. I had low expectations, since I thought the first film was decent, but left a lot of great opportunities on the table. But not part 2. Raimi has really stepped up to the plate with this film, and created something that will be loved by both the mainstream viewer, as well as the film geeks and comic geeks. He took time with the characters, and gave Peter, M.J., Harry, and Aunt May some quality character development. We even get more of J. Jonah Jameson, which is great for the comic relief (even if I can't stop calling him 'Schillinger').The CGI is much better this time around, and Spidey no longer looks rubbery.It is much more believable, and doesn't take you out of the moment at any point. Also, we're given a much better bad guy. Doc Ock is a fantastic villain, and much of this credit goes to Molina. He doesn't cheese it up at any point, and since Raimi gave us some time with him and his wife before the experiment goes wrong, we see that he's a kind man who wants to make the world a better place. Honestly, the film is dripping with pathos, and yet it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to do so. And when we get to see how vulnerable Peter Parker is (wait until you see the subway car scene), we actually feel for the poor guy. This is the first comic-book film that got me to feel for the lead character, and I'm grateful for that.I'm a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this film has a lot more heart than either of those. Thinking back, I can't remember a better comic-book film. Spider-Man 2 gave me everything I wanted, and more. Kudos to Raimi for finally hitting one out of the park.

""If you don't like this, you don't like movies"" or more accurately, ""if you don't like Spiderman 2, what is it you seek from movies?"" Seriously. Every frame packs emotional resonance of some kind. Whether it be dramatic, comedic or just the kind that gets your heart pumping. The film values its character's so much, that it never betrays them. There are no shortcuts. And despite what a lot of the (internet) critics of the film are touting, it's not really overly talky or preachy, and it's never boring. Raimi and Co. have masterfully let what's up on the screen do most of the talking, through images,  looks, sounds.  It's been said that to critique a film you must make a better one, I think that applies here. Spiderman 2 makes Spiderman look somewhat rudderless. The action this time packs more of a punch, the villain is creepier, the romance hits higher highs and lower lows, the pace is smoother, the comedy is funnier, and all the characters get just about the right ammount of screen time. In the first Spiderman we had a lot of odd fills (Aunt May at the Hospital), and scenes too misplaced to have meaning, (Gobby and Spidey meet on the building). Raimi looks to have come to terms with the source material's medium this time out, and he and his crew don't waste even a minute of screen time.Who here didn't just love that scene in the elevator with Spiderman and Hal Sparks? That sense of fun combined with the drama, and some fantastic performances by Tobey, James, Kirsten, Molina, JK and uh.. the woman who played Aunt May (sorry ma'am), made this a can't miss film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Completely Overrated,"When I walked into this movie I was expecting it to be good not excellent but good. Then the movie started..After a few horrible jokes and just bad acting I decided that, okay its not good but I think they were aiming it towards little kids. An Asian woman playing spiderman on a violin with her fingers and singing with an accent....WHO THOUGHT OF THIS!! The whole beginning part was done horribly or aimed completely towards making little kids have a few horrible cheap laughs. Then DocOc was formed and he overkilled a few people. From that point on it was just pretty bad, Tobey Maquire is OK at best along with Kirsten Dunst. No one else in this movie is above average at all.Story:7/10 What can you ask from a comic movie.

Nowhere near the original,"Seeing Spiderman 2 I find almost dumbfounding that people are actually calling it better than the original. The first movie was a brilliant movie with a deliberate pace that crafted the plot wonderfully and really made you care about the characters. In the second everything is just sort of thrown together in order to make it more of a fast paced ultimate action movie. I suppose this is okay, but it sort of left me feeling like ""blah"" as far as the characters involved. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker takes off his mask for like five hundred people to see and doesn't seem concerned even though masking his identity was supposedly his ultimate motivation so that his friends and family are never injured. All in all I'd say this movie was an overblown action flick that was a bit of a rip off Superman 2. (I.E. losing your powers to be with girl and then reclaiming them to save said girl) I rate it at about a six because of the excellent effects and some of the humor.

Wow.  Just wow.,"I'm a comic book fan and film buff. Have been for years. But I NEVER rushed out to see this movie in the theatre. In fact, I waited until I could watch it on DVD. Why? Mostly because the first movie, while good, didn't really strike me as 'great'. But there I was on my day off; no wife, no talk-during-the-movie friends, and most importantly, no audience to prompt me to laugh or groan or when to say 'whoa'... and I was whoaing. A lot.Picking up where the first movie left off, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest superhero movies ever, even surpassing the first. But despite being a great comic book movie, it is SO much more... it is a great 'FILM', comic book or otherwise. Good character development and interaction, perfect integration between live action and CG, a beautifully developed bad guy, strong performances, great cinematography and visuals, pathos and even an ending, that while leaving it open to sequels, DOESN'T make you feel cheated in the end!I truly believe that ANYONE could watch this movie and enjoy it. Incredibly-choreographed fight scenes, an involving, realistic story, romance and a sprinkling of comedy are all balanced together nicely in an unbelievable movie. And now that you've read all this you're gonna be disappointed, right?

The first time was the charm...,"Somewhere along the way, the makers of SPIDER-MAN 2 couldn't decide whether they were making an all-out action flick or a soft-core soap opera with the accent on Spidey's melancholy love affair with Mary Jane. The balance between action, humor and love story has been so skewered by what seems like the intrusion of action scenes that this one doesn't work as well as the first. Apparently, the makers wanted to humanize Tobey's character as much as possible.None of the fault lies in the performances. Tobey Maguire is genuinely effective in making us see Spider-Man's humanity. In fact, he's so good that if this guy ever gets a really deep character role to play, he's going to win some big prizes (aside from financial ones). He's a very sensitive actor, as revealed in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.Kirsten Dunst does her usual nice job as Mary Jane but there's a little too much of her long pauses between dialog to gaze intimately at Spidey. James Franco is fine as Harry Osborn who may in time become Spider-Man's next opponent if the ending of this one gives us a clue.But acting honors this time really go to Rosemary Harris, so warm and human as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as the harried headline-chasing editor of New York's most tabloid newspaper. Cliff Robertson does nicely as Uncle Ben Parker.Naturally, all of the special effects are mind boggling and the villain of the piece (Doc Ock) with his octopus-like mechanical arms is given plenty of action once his character is established. But personally, I preferred William Dafoe's villainy much more than Albert Molina's attempt to be Doc Ock. Not liking the villain of the piece is enough to make me give the first Spidey film a higher rating.Elfman's musical score is excellent. Most impressive stunt in the whole film is the way Spidey stops a runaway train from a disastrous fate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman 2- A sequel that surpasses the original,"First of all let me just say that Spiderman 1 was good but not perfect. The only other sequel I preferred to the original was Superman 2. All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far.I also went to see Spiderman 3 but to be honest I was slightly disappointed. That isn't enough to deter me from watching future sequels though. No.4 bring it on!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular comic book fun!,"It is well known that Peter Parker is probably most well liked because of his human weaknesses than for his superpowers. He's a comic book superhero who is presented as just a normal guy who suddenly finds himself in possession of amazing powers that he doesn't quite understand or know how best to use, just like any of us would probably react. A lot of people were dissatisfied with the original film for a whole list of superficial reasons, but even those minor shortcomings seem to have been fixed for this sequel, which is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen.Peter Parker is in college now and remains hopelessly in love with Mary Jane, but also remains a hopeless romantic, to say nothing of his unwillingness to get close to her for fear of endangering her. Superheroes, you see, tend to make enemies easily. And speaking of enemies, the villains in Spiderman 2 are a much welcome step up from Willem Dafoe's too- clownish Green Goblin with the plastic mask.There is a complicated history between Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is both in love with Mary Jane and the son of Norman Osborn, the alter-ego of the Green Goblin in the first film. As revelations are made about who Parker really is, their best friend relationship of course becomes increasingly prickly.Alfred Molina is also brilliant as the perfectly named Dr. Otto Octavius, the main villain, a benevolent scientist whose desire to create a means for harnessing cold fusion turns him into a madman, which is complicated by the fact that he has developed a way to connect some massive and enormously destructive metal tentacles to his body, enabling him to climb buildings like a spider and crush and toss humans around with equal ease. There is a scene involving a group of doctors that really reminds you who the director is.""Doc Ock"" has a laboratory on the bank of the East River in which he has created a device which will either prove that he can use cold fusion or, if he fails, will destroy all of Manhattan. Parker doesn't think it's worth the risk, and the grand climax of the movie culminates in the final fulfillment of Octavius' experiment while Spiderman tries to stop it and save Mary Jane at the same time.It seems that Spiderman 2 is the result of a production team that openly discussed what might be weaknesses in the still fun and exciting original film, and how to fix them and make them better in the sequel. Superhero movies are often hit or miss, and usually it's pretty obvious what the misses are (hear that, Punisher?). The original Spiderman was a hit, and the first sequel is a bigger hit.

Better than the first!,"I for one was not totally blown away by the first Spider-Man film. Yes, it is a good comic to film, but somehow I just didn't get caught up in all the hoopla. That was changed with Spider-Man 2. This film took the successful elements from the first (character and acting) and pushed it up another notch.We were given again only 1 new villain, this saved much needed time to flesh out Peter Parker/Spider-Man as well as further the other story lines going on with those surrounding Peter. The struggle that Peter goes through; should he or shouldn't he sacrifice his life for others, is handled beautifully here. You feel that struggle. He may be a ""superhero"", but he is still just a kid trying to sort out his life. A life that seems to sucker punch him every single day. I thought this was the most logical step to take the franchise after the introduction in the first.The special effects this time were much improved over the first. Many times I was taken out of the moment in the first film because the effects looked to much like effects and were not natural. That is still a problem from time to time here again, but by in large a much better outing.Story, performances, effects, all were improved in the 2nd installment, something we just don't see happen a lot.

Basically the perfect superhero movie.,"Comic book movies don't get much better than this. Sam Raimi once again proves what a great director he is with this sequel to the fantastic Spider-Man movie of 2002. And as good as the first movie was, this one improves on it in many ways. It's a fantastic continuation from the first one, fitting right into the storyline. I honestly don't think anyone could hope for a sequel better than this. Set two years after the first movie, Peter is struggling to find balance between his two identities. His life is falling apart. His loved ones are still suffering from various events from the first movie. And now a new enemy has appeared. What can become of all this?The storyline of the movie is really great. It sort of makes you ask yourself questions. Like how long can a person really put other people before themselves before it all just becomes too much? Can a person really handle that much responsibility? The movie definitely gets the human side of the story right, and has a strong sense of emotion about it. It doesn't just go through the motions and have Peter as a hero who never gives a second thought. He is portrayed as a normal person who got these powers that he never asked for. After watching the movie you might re-think ""How awesome it would be to have superpowers."" And the villainous Doctor Octopus has been given a drastically different origin in the movie to the one he had in the comics, which was a risky move to make, but it really worked.The acting is great, once again. Tobey Macguire still does a great job as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst is a good Mary Jane Wattson and James Franco plays Harry Osborne well. As with the first movie all the supporting actors in the movie are great, like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris. A lot of the chemistry the characters had with each other in the first movie is back, although considerably different in contrast to the differences that the events of the first movie have caused in their relationships with each other. The actors pull off the changes well. Alfred Molina was the perfect casting choice as the villainous Doc Ock, and played the part fantastically. Couldn't have asked for a better actor for the job.The visual effects in the movie are amazing. The effects in the first movie were decent, but these are a vast improvement. The action scenes were just amazing and really got my blood pumping. All of it just came together better than someone could hope for. Once again the costume designs were fantastic, with huge props for the way Dock Ock is done. His artificial arms are awesome and the character could not look more perfect. So all in all, the whole movie was fantastic, and It makes me sad that I missed the chance to see it at the cinema. I've watched it several times, and it really holds up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man 2,"No one can deny that 2002's Spider-Man was excellent. It had everything that was required for a top superhero film  great characters, great script, great action and great effects. The story of the all-too-human Peter Parker who, because of a freak accident (aren't they all?!) became Spider-Man, and after the death of his uncle decides to heed his advice and fulfil his responsibility to protect people with his new-found powers. Of course, the Green Goblin showed up to mess things up, but it all worked out (reasonably) well in the end.To write a synopsis for the sequel, I could just settle for ""see above"". The story behind this film is pretty much the same as the original, but then again when the result is this good, a 'more of the same' attitude is not necessarily a bad thing. There are obviously going to be some changes, and this time Peter begins to lose his powers instead of gaining them. This gives a nice little twist to the story, and also provides most of the films lighter moments (Spider-Man taking the lift to get down from a building), and throughout this shows how comfortable director Sam Raimi is with his source material. Also fully present and correct is the good-hearted scientist who, because of an experiment gone wrong, becomes a mad bad-guy. However Alfred Molina must be given credit, as he is a much better villain than the Green Goblin was (and not a stupid mask in sight!), giving the right amount of menace to the film; he almost steals the show from right under Tobey Maguire's web. The rest of the cast are also excellent, their characters evolving just as you would expect them to after the first film.However, unfortunately it cannot be said that the sequel is actually better than the original; it is clearly its equal, even though has better acting, better effects and a better villain. The problem comes slap-bang in the middle of the film, just after Peter has decided to give up being Spider-Man and start his life afresh. The set up becomes repetitive  his powers fail him in exactly the same way (in mid-air) a total of four times. He even goes into a burning building just like last time to save a kid; though this time he is without his powers. Once he gives up his responsibilities, the film seems to dip into some kind of soap, with Peter trying to win Mary-Jane back. This results in some quite trite dialogue, and the whole act is far too long, prompting the audience to have doubts as to where this is all going.But it is all saved by a relentless final act, where Spider-Man realises he has to do what he does, and goes to kick some ass. And does he! The action scenes beat the originals' hands-down, and special mention must go to the showdown on the train, which is accelerating out of control. They are expertly shot and edited, giving any other film of 2004 a run for its money in the excitement stakes. It's non-stop pace is just what the film needs after the slow middle section, and it clearly shows that this franchise is definitely going somewhere great. If only that middle had a little more attention paid to it, then this could have quite possibly been a 10. However because of this, and it's 'more of the same' feel, no matter how good it might be, just puts the top score out of reach.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A great summer movie,"After Spider-Man's box office success, the incredible media hype, and the rumors about Tobey Maguire opting out, I honestly didn't have much faith in this film. I was worried that it would be a sub-par affair designed solely to reap profits from the cash cow that was the original. (Think, Matrix: Revolutions)I couldn't have been more wrong. This film actually exceeded the first in almost every aspect. The writing was smarter than can usually be expected from a summer blockbuster. It was true to the spirit of Stan Lee's comic book work, without being too clichéd or campy. Now, before die-hard fans of the comic books jump all over me, I am aware that the storyline has been changed dramatically from the graphic novels, but, it seems that Sam Raimi, Alvin Sargent, and crew did their best to be respectful to Mr. Lee's work.J.K. Simmons' portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson was boisterous and funny without being too over the top. Maguire's performance seemed to add more depth to the characters of Parker/Spidey than in the original. Horrible films such as Bring It On and The Crow: Salvation (sacrilege!) notwithstanding, Kirsten Dunst is actually a very talented actress. This is not a role that will garner her an Oscar, but, she did a very passable job as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina's depiction of Dr. Octavius/Doc Ock stole the show here. A bit more explanation of the AI of his tentacles, and the motivation behind them would have been welcome, but Molina did an outstanding job with this character. Add to this a quite proficient supporting cast, and you have the makings of a quite enjoyable film. Some of the flashbacks with Uncle Ben were pretty contrived, but, not so much as to take you out of the moment.CGI Spidey was well-done, without being overdone, as were the rest of the effects. Great eye-candy, without detracting from the film itself. With technology today, it would be easy to let computer effects take over the movie (remember The Hulk?), but, luckily, some restraint was shown here.Final Verdict: A great escapist, action flick with a little bit of substance thrown in for good measure. You get superb effects, a love triangle, a vulnerable super-hero, great story, above par acting (for a summer blockbuster), and enough teasers to make you eagerly await the third installment.

A sequel that matches the original.,"SPIDER-MAN 2This is the sequel to the successful Sam Raimi movie.The film continues 2 years after the original movie with Peter Parker now living in a flat on his own still protecting the city from the bad guys. His nemesis this time around is Doctor Octopus.It is very rare for a film to be better than the original movie or even be close, but this is easily as good as the original in my opinion. The story is really good and even though Spider-Man has an enemy in Doctor Octopus, this film concentrates a lot on the emotions he is going through and not just about the action. Peter is going through a lot of stress with life as Spider-Man. He is in love with a woman he can't be with, he can't hold a job down, he is failing his studies, his best friend is badgering him to find out who Spider-Man is because he wants revenge for his father and he is riddled with guilt because of the death of his uncle. I like the story in this as it shows that he is human and has emotions and you start to feel actually quite sorry for him as you see that even though being Spider-Man is cool, he is sacrificing a lot for the people.The action and effects are really good and it stays entertaining all the way through the film. There are some comedy moments which breaks up the emotion and it is well timed.The stars of the original movie returned for this. Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst played MJ and James Franco plays Harry Osbourne. Alfred Molina played Doctor Octopus. Toney did a good job playing a guy who was running out of emotional energy. He really did look like he was struggling with everything. James again did a brilliant job. He looked angry and played the part well. Alfred did a great job as Doctor Octopus. Even though he was the bad guy in the movie, he was also the victim. I felt sorry for his character. The cameos again were great in this Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell made appearances.There was one scene that I thought was rubbish. During once sequence Spider-Man was seen by a lot of people without his mask. They all tell him that they won't say anything and his identity was kept a secret I straight away thought this was rubbish. Someone would have spilt the beans for the right price and let's face it. The Bugle would have paid cash for that story. I enjoyed this a lot and thought it was a great sequel to the original.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""I'm back I'm back!

I can't get no satisfaction,"First, I liked Amazing Spider-Man (aka S-M 2), but I didn't leave with the same satisfaction that I did with the first installment. The storytelling was richer in round one, not nearly as jumpy; S-M 3 lacked a lot of fluidity. Yes, the special effects were there-- and some of them blatantly so (was I watching the VG or was I at the movies?!) but the combination of a multitude of Spidey stories left the plot weak and unsubstantial (which is a shame, considering Michael Chabon worked on the screenplay). I thoroughly enjoyed the use of the image from the cover of the 1967 #50 Amazing S-M comic-- where Peter throws his Spidey outfit in the trash-- as well as the struggle that Peter has determining what is right, what is wrong, and how he fits into the context.

Pure Fun,"Solidly entertaining throughout, and with some improvement in performances, Spider-Man 2 is not a great superhero film, but it is a very enjoyable one. Needless to say, due to Tobey Maguire in the lead role, and Raimi's directing style, there are bound to be quite a few silly moments throughout the film. Things can feel random or a bit out of place at times, though I can't help but feel I enjoyed the film better than the first. Besides some few notable moments that many may recognize today, Spider-Man 2 I feel is ultimately a much better written film than the previous installment, as the characters on the screen feel like more than just outlines. The depth into the characters is definitely seen more this time around, and I enjoyed delving into the character of Doc Ock, played by Alfred Molina, who I believe is the standout in this film. James Franco is also quite good in this film, as well as J.K. Simmons as always, who always brings his A-game to his performance. The action scenes, especially those containing large amounts of CGI are a bit dated, but no point of the film ever feels dull or boring. It's an entertaining superhero romp, that is far from perfect, but one that kept me engaged and smiling with until the end.
My Rating: 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big try without polishing and attention to details,"Less bad moments than in the first movie, more impressive good moments, but movie just goes up and down and it goes up every time when it is not about masked action. Around all the serious staff happening here Doc Ock looks so childish and boring... Action not really interesting, still nobody cares about physics, but since the original movie sure it is a gap. Direction still not measured as it should be, scenes follow instantly one after another and it is so stupid and bad in the whole context. Like this movie can't deside what it wants to be: a action movie for kids or have big volume, good mature stories and characters. And iam so mad about what we missed because of this numerous bad descisions, cause even with all of these flaws it looks good and interesting. Raimi or Marvel or Sony, or all of them, i dont care, they spoiled great movies when they had all the instruments to shoot big. I'm really sad, cause we can see so many good things in this movie. Oh yeah, Mr Maguaire - fantastic performance, he is peerless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lower rating than what it deserves.,I never review anything but the rating of this movie is very low. This is still the second best superhero flick of all time arguably with all the required elements.It deserves at least 8.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exciting Sequel!,"Spider Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time rivaling the Lord of the Rings movies. I was blown away by the movie with the special effects and Spider Man himself. This movie may even be better than the first. I think the villain is better than the first film.Peter Parker has a busy life. He has several full time jobs and he attends school full time. On top of that he turns into Spidey when the time calls for it. And here, the time does call for it with the evil Doc and his mechanical arms.The acting is decent. I felt more towards Tobey than I did with the first film. Kirsten Dunst is still great to look at. Alfred Molina plays a great villain.The special effects are amazing. They should have with the budget this movie had. The music by Danny Elfman is another beauty.Overall, this is a great sequel to a great superhero movie. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, Yes. I Agree.","First I want to admit that I am not really a big fan of the actionadventure genre. I heard such great things about this movie though thatI felt I had to see what all the buzz was about. I also had not seen thefirst installment, although I didn't really think that was aprerequisite. It wasn't. I caught on just fine.First I'll say this was entertaining. I definitely was not bored,however I just did not love it. I thought the evil guy, the octopus guywas terribly cheesy, especially the way he'd enter a room with his shirtunbuttoned and dark glasses. He wasn't scarry to me. I thought he lookedlike some reject from a singles bar in the 70's. I thought KirstinDunsts performance was very flat. I could not see why a superhero wouldgive up his superhero powers for her. I liked Tobey Mguire and thoughthe did a nice job in the role. I loved that he was dorky and kind of aloser. I thought it made his character very sweet and endearing. Ididn't like that Spiderman practically flew like superman. From what Iknow of Spiderman, having watched the series as a kid Spiderman does notfly. In this movie he used his webs, but the way he got around was likehe was flying. I suppose to keep up with this type of blockbuster moviehe'd have to be able to fly.Much of this story reminded me of Superman II where he gave up hispowers so that he could be with Lois Lane, but then the 3 villains fromhis home came and practically destroyed the world so he HAD to go backto being Superman. I felt the Superman movies (the first 2) were farmore effective and entertaining stories. They were funny, fun,suspenseful, and exciting. I felt this film lacked much of what mademovies like Superman great. I also loved the Indiana Jones movies andthought they were EXCELLENT.I will say that Spiderman II was a decent flick, enjoyable, butultimately forgettable. Just on",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not my kind of movie,"I'm not a big superhero action movie type, so I went to Spider-Man 2 not expecting much. Even with low expectations, I was disappointed. The movie was like a boring roller-coaster: long, drawn-out, slow sections between overly-intense action sequences. And then, just when the movie should have been over, it continued with too much more story, which could have waited for Spider-Man 3 (which I'm sure will come out).I would imagine that if I were into comic books, this movie would have been more enjoyable. But it's not my kind of movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My FAVORITE Movie.,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that I'm a bit bias. I LOVE Spidey. He's been my favorite fictional character since birth, so understandably, I would love this film. But I don't love this film, because I love the character in it. I love this film simply because it is a great film.Nearly every character in Spider-Man 2 is completely fleshed out. Even the villain has a motivation, and a reason behind his actions. That's something that I've always appreciated in a film. When you can emphasize and get behind each character. ESPECIALLY Spider-Man. You really feel his struggle through out the film. Him trying to be there for his Aunt, trying to keep a friendship, trying to be a super-hero, and trying to be there for his girlfriend all gets extremely overwhelming for the viewer. And that, to me, is fantastic writing. Sam Raimi really understood Spider-Man so well, which makes so many memorable scenes in this film like, the train fight sequence, the ""Spider-Man No More"" scene, and Peter walking down the street, eating a hot dog, while ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"" plays in the background.Sure, there are a couple of flaws In this film like Kirsten Dunsts acting, but that's really just a nit-pick, because nearly every one else does a fantastic job portraying their characters. Tobey Maguire is an excellent Spider-Man/Peter Parker, Alfred Molina is a VERY menacing and interesting Doctor Octopus, and J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is easily one of the best casting decisions ever made.Everything I just talked about, is why Spider-Man 2 is such a great movie, and why it's my favorite movie of all time. I can go on talking about how good this film is, but I think you get the point. If you haven't seen this film yet, please do so. It's really that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Before Tom Holland, this was THE Spider-Man","The sequel to the smash Spider-Man could not come fast enough for me. It did not disappoint. This movie deals with the inner turmoil of Peter Parker as he tries to ignore his desire for love and happiness in an effort to be the hero that New York needs. Peter's jobs are suffering, his college work is suffering and his personal life is non-existent as he rushes from one crime to the next. He is still pining away for MJ, but is firm in his belief that to keep her safe she must stay at arms length from him.Harry Osborn has taken on a project led by Otto Octavius to create a source of renewable energy akin to a small star. Ocatavius employs a device that plugs directly into his mind and outfits him with an additional four arms that can withstand the reaction in his device. When things go wrong, the inhibitor chip in the arms gets fried and Octavius become corrupted and is now the super villain Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man starts to lose his powers as he fights his inner demons ans Peter hangs up the suit and tries to live life as a normal man. Fate would prove to be against him and he is forced to once again don the suit and take on the guise of Spider-Man in order to defeat Doc Oc.This is probably my favorite of all the entries into the world of the web slinger. It does a tremendous job exploring the human side of the superheroes we all admire. Doc Oc was always my favorite villain and Alfred Molina breahtes him to life in a far better fashion than I could have hoped. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of Spider-Man,",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BETTER THAN FIRST ONE IN EVERY WAY,"Spider-Man 2 brought so much new stuff that they didn't have in first one. But in the same time, it kept doing very good things that first movie had. Almost every character is so well written; it is just enjoyable to see how movie understands these characters, especially Peter Parker. That's a story about lessons that Peter is learning and realising, just like first one. His insane character development proves how good they were at storytelling. Also it is still a powerful love story. But after all, the best thing this movie have is showing how people love and respect to Spider-Man. Honestly, I cried in train scene after seeing it few times. It was meaningful and intense. That's why I think Spider-Man 2 is one of the best superhero films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad sequel,"This is another re-watch, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw, It seem this movie as gown on me over the past few yearsI really enjoyed it on second watch, I feel liked the fact that this movie had nice mixture of action and some very humourers moment in this movie.I did laugh a few times in this movie as i found some jokes really funny, it blended in really well with the action scenes.There were some really good action scenes in this movie, really well made, there were some action that did go little longer they should, those scene kind of took edge of it.I enjoyed most of the movie, I felt the ending was bit of let down, That really let the movie down.The acting was really good from the whole cast!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Man, was I disappointed with this film - particularly the first half...","As far as I can remember, I've never watched a movie that's led me to want to get up out of my chair and leave the room due to frustration over what is being presented to me on the screen.It happened during the first half of this film - Spiderman 2.When I watch a movie, I want to be taken in by it and believe what's going on - believe in the characters and believe their situation. Is that too much to ask? I think not.But in this film, the makers want me to believe that Spiderman can't be killed, like he is Superman in a world where Kryptonite doesn't exist. He's thrown around, he falls from tops of buildings, bounces off of walls and cars before hitting the ground face first - but gets up with nothing more than a bit of a sore back... ""My back! My back!"". Jeez.The makers of this film also want me to believe that Peter Parker's character is a true, down to the bone, loser - I mean, someone who can't even take care of himself let alone the entire city of New York. This doesn't make sense. I know we're supposed to see him as unlucky, and down-and-out money wise. OK, I would accept that - but no! The makers of this film need to stress, for scene after long scene, that Parker is a NERD, a GEEK, a LO, a SER! Why? I never got this impression from anything I remember reading when I was a kid...Stan, why didn't you say anything?? Moving on to feats of strength... am I watching Spiderman in action here, or is it Superman wearing Spiderman's tights? Since when can Spiderman hold up entire building walls for like... ever, while he waits for his girlfriend to scurry away to safety? And the scene with him sticking his legs out onto the railway ties to try and slow the train - I didn't get that at all - the second (and successful) attempt made more sense for the Spiderman I know, using his webbing.I know that anything goes in the comics, it's a make-believe world. But I'm just asking the makers of this film to try a little harder to make it believable...please! I personally feel it was the fault of the screen writers going overboard on things in the name of the mighty god of ""Blockbuster Film"". How about the idiotic scene where he's saving the little Asian girl from the fire? Were my eyes deceiving me or was she, after being thrown across the room to get by the whole in the floor, actually pulling parker up to safety? Was it still the little 4 year old girl, or her older, sumo wrestler sister, that comes in to save Spiderman? (insert Twighlight Zone music here)...This brings me to my last point: Too much focus on romance! Gag me with a spoon - talk about corny. Was I watching an action/sci-fi/fantasy movie, or Gone with the Wind? I know that the really big blockbusters need a little romance in there to appease the masses, but c'mon...this was too much. WAY too much. I found myself calling out to the screen to move along, get to some action, get away from the corniness! Jeeeeeez! I'm honestly afraid to give this film a second chance and I seriously question Sam Raimi's vision and judgement. I have no idea why there wasn't more negative feedback on this film from the community - I'm hoping it's because I'm just out of touch and in no way a film connaisseur, and unable to understand the reasons this picture was so successful. Otherwise it will mean it was mass-hysteria and marketing that controlled the majority of the fan's reactions and the high scores this film obtained on this site.Sincerely, Kwake",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expanding the World of Spider-Man,"What makes a truly great superhero movie? Is it the large spectacle of incredibly mind-blowing special effects? Is it about the character and their amazing gifts and abilities to overcome overwhelming odds? How about the implementation of a tangible love story, the introduction of a particularly nasty villain or the mythology formed from generations of stories told through a multitude of media.If ""all the above"" is what you had in mind then you must conclude that Spider-Man 2 (2004) is the golden standard for superhero movie sequels and the modern gold standard for superhero movies in general. The movie has everything one would need to enjoy from a film genre that embraces popcorny-ness. It's sleek, stylish and has a tremendous villain in the form of Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina). Furthermore, the fact that Spider-Man 2 is a sequel, the story has the ability to open and expand the world of Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), our forlorn hero.The film opens with Peter Parker trying to balance his personal and professional life with that of his secret life as the web-slinging wall-crawler. Late on his rent, fired from his job delivering pizzas, discovering the woman he loves (Kirsten Dunst) is about to be married to someone else, and slipping in his academics, the downtrodden Peter can't even catch a break on his Birthday. To top it all off his best friend Harry (James Franco) wants Peter's alter ego Spider-Man dead for killing his father and dear Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is foreclosing on the house. How can things get any worse you ask? In comes Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who after a scientific breakthrough goes wrong gets four large mechanical arms with a mind of their own. Add to that Peter's web-slinging just isn't what it used to be.The film asks many questions about Peter's fidelity to his masked persona. Life is hard enough without having to deal with every whack job, natural disaster and heavily armed bank robber in New York. Half way through the movie Peter eventually just says to hell with it and walks away from his supposed great responsibility for as we all know he has great power for.Spider-Man 2 differs from its prequel and from most superhero films in that it has a very strong and apparent emotional core. The majority of the movie is spent with Peter Parker out of his Spidey-outfit just trying to keep his head above water. We have an emotional connection to his character to the point where we actually care and want to see him and Mary Jane get together and be happy.My only major gripe about Spider-Man 2 is its setup of Spider-Man 3 (2007). While there is a lot of controversy about whether the Sam Raimi directed trilogy (2002-2007) is better than the new Amazing Spider Man (2012), we can all agree Raimi's third installment wasn't very good. Still by the end of Spider-Man 2 both Mary Jane, Harry and even Aunt May knew Spider-Man and Peter were one and the same. Add to that the fan boy crowd screamed at the top of their lungs for Venom so Sam Raimi kind of painted himself into a corner.Ages ago Christopher Reeve dawned the cape of the Man of Steel which first planted the seed for a viewing public ready for breathtaking action and noble sacrifice. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy gave way to the darker more brooding superhero films which expounded on larger themes about a hero's relationship with society and the greater good. In between those two moments, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy laid the groundwork for superhero films loaded with modern special effects and old-school story-telling. Without the bankability of Spider-Man 2, there would be no Avengers (2012), Fantastic Four (2005) or Kick-Ass (2010). Additionally there'd be no standard to reach for or exceed.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sets A Higher Bar For Superhero Films To Follow!,"One of the finest sequels ever made and still counted amongst the greatest superhero flicks in existence, Spider-Man 2 is a remarkable follow-up to its already-impressive predecessor that skilfully builds upon the solid foundation provided by the first film, presents significant upgrades in each filmmaking aspect and beautifully balances all its elements to succeed as not just a de-facto standard of its genre but also as one of the best films of its year.Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of Spider-Man 2 finds Peter Parker struggling to balance his personal life & his obligations as Spider-Man. His love interest is engaged to someone else, his grades have been steadily declining and he also seems to be losing his powers. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Otto Octavius transforms into a supervillain with four robotic tentacles fused to his spine after his effort to sustain a nuclear fusion reaction goes horribly wrong.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 2 is a far more mature effort from him in comparison to his previous venture and presents the director in sublime form for this sequel picks up the story right where it left off the last time despite the 2 years span, progresses the arc of its reprising characters amazingly well while giving a proper introduction to the new ones, and also does an outstanding job in balancing its storytelling elements with moments of action in a seamless manner, due to which everything about this sequel just works.Alvin Sargent's screenplay is worthy of praise as well for the story takes a darker approach than the last time yet packs in enough humour to prevent it from becoming too bleak, and although the cheesiness of the first chapter isn't reduced, the narrative flow is much more stream-lined than before. Production design team comes up with bigger, more refined set pieces, Cinematography preserves the vibrant camera-work but has a firmer grip on it this time while Editing is definitely one of its strongest aspects for there isn't a dull moment in the picture.Visual effects is much improved as well and by not overdoing its CGI elements, it keeps the artificiality of its universe at bay for the most part. Sure a number of moments are over-the- top but most of them still fall under the realm of on-screen believability. Last but not the least, Danny Elfman delivers again with a splendid soundtrack that stays true to the original film's score, works as a wonderfully evolved successor, and captures the darker tone with finesse just like it did the last time. Even the existing songs used in the picture are nicely chosen & help compliment the respective sequences.Coming to the performances, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco & J.K. Simmons return to reprise their respective roles of Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn & J. Jonah Jameson and do a better job than before. Maguire builds up on his earlier input to impress once again and what he lacks in star presence, he makes up for it by chipping in a complex performance. Simmons is hilarious as before, Dunst & Franco are still on base level but it's Alfred Molina who impresses the most in what is a sympathetic rendition of Doc Ock, thus making him a classic foe in every way.On an overall scale, Spider-Man 2 delivers everything one can expect from a sequel. It goes bigger, better & more action-packed than before yet stays completely true to its origin, plus finishes on a high with enough open choices for where it can be headed in later instalments, something that Sony failed to take advantage of. Sam Raimi has weaved a magical web yet again that tightly grasps on to every necessary ingredient to come up with an incredibly fun, highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying extravaganza that promises yet another high-flying, web-sligning roller-coaster ride and effortlessly delivers it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Smashingly good action movie with very good special effects!,"My vote: 7.5/10. This film is smashingly good with incredible good special effects. It isn't boring at all. It is a success. The only thing that I found boring is the middle of the film where we don't see spider- man for quite a long time. This is the only trouble but the rest was good! It was pleasant with a lot of BOUM, CRAC, SMASH, BAM that were very strong. The special effects are excellent!!! The casting, very good too! They play very well! It is the best of all the spider-man movies I've seen (the trilogy, I mean). Spider-man is really amazing with his super-power that I like very much. His power is so COOL! I like the way he moves from one building to another with his spider web fingers and the way he uses them for anything possible. This is a great pleasure to see in a super-hero film. The villain, I really like him and he is the best! I love his terrible, disgusting octopus arms and his nasty project!!! My favorite scene was the scene where spider-man fights the villain on the roof of a train. It was so cool and very smash, smash, smash if you know what I mean by there! The super-hero has good qualities and a good thinking about his life. I will add 1 Oscar for best action movements and 1 Oscar for best super-hero costume and another one for best special effects and best power!!! I really enjoyed it!

Visually Brilliant,"As with its predecessor, Spider-Man 2 benefits from its excellent casting. Although mostly returning to their previous roles, the addition of Molina and the expansion of Harris as May again give this film the great depth that many superhero films lack. Molina especially encapsulates his comic book character and is visually inspiring.Again with the lead being so relatable despite his abilities, the plot offers so much more than stopping the bad guy. Love interests, financial struggles and inner turmoil regarding one's identity are expressed excellently by Maguire.CGI/special effects are brilliant for its time and still hold up very well now, with an added increase in POV and swooping shots of Spidey swinging through the city. Fight scenes and action is well choreographed, and whilst there are less iconic scenes than in the first film, the train scene stands out as one of the best across all Spider-Man films.Occasionally there are little parts that are daft and laughable, but they only add to the enjoyment of everything. It's not perfect, some interactions would be excruciatingly awkward in real life (such as sharing cake in silence with the girl across the hall you barely know), but they're only for a moment and in a way display the awkwardness of the character without powers.Maguire is fantastic again and matched by an equally brilliant villain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better,"I base this upon the Special Edition. This is still too bright in the look, and I maintain that the ""humor"" is almost exclusively on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon, but on the whole, this is superior to the first. The plot is good, and it develops nicely throughout. Octavius is a tad similar to The Green Goblin in some ways, and not completely true to the comic version. He's a positive, however, and the mechanical arms are excellent. The action is dynamic, intense, entertaining and makes marvelous use of the title hero's powers. This is epic and dramatic. It takes away from it the way Raimi keeps trying to add ""comedy"", at least to those of us that don't find it funny. If you laugh when people get hurt, hey, maybe you'll enjoy it in this, too. The pacing is fairly even. This has well-done FX, if Spidey does continue to not look ""real"" at any point, and the efforts to make things work with practical effects is definitely a plus. Yes, CGI can solve a lot, just don't forget, using it constantly will desensitize the audience to it, sometimes less is more. The acting tends to be great, and the roles are filled by the right actors. Molina was a perfect choice. The music is well-composed. On the DVD, you will find a a feature-length documentary and several featurettes(the 2.1 release has a handful, as well, and also includes 8 minutes of extra footage that isn't half bad; on the whole, it does feel as though that one was mainly made to remind you to go watch the third one at the theatre) I'm reviewing on their entries here on the site, a couple of Webisodes, a photo gallery, a multi-angle production, a music video, trailers, and, like on the one for the first flick, additional tracks for during the film, the three being a Factoid one and two commentaries, a cast & crew one, and a technical one. There is a little disturbing content in this. I recommend this to fans of the character, even if you disliked the 2002 movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Superhero Film of All Time,"Without exaggeration, 2004's Spider-Man 2 by Sam Raimi is in my opinion the best comic book movie ever written. In this film, you see the struggles of a man trying to juggle his everyday life as Peter Parker with the constant demands and responsibility that come with swinging around each day, protecting innocents as New York's friendly neighborhood wall-crawler. Doctor Otto Octavius is Peter's idol who Peter gets to meet through his best friend Harry Osborn, who hates Spider-Man because he watched as Spider-Man stood over his father Norman Osborn's (The Green Goblin) corpse. Harry does not know that Peter is Spider-Man, which provides an interesting dilemma throughout the film. During an experiment gone wrong, Otto's free will is swept under the might of the artificial intelligence that lurks within the very mechanical arms that he created, and thus his emotions are altered, and he becomes hellbent on creating his sustainable form of energy no matter the cost. When innocent lives are put in danger by the blinded ""Doctor Octopus"", aka Doctor Octavius, Spider-Man must deal with the responsibility that he accepted in the first film and put said responsibility first and foremost before his own desires as a human being in order to do what is right and be the hero that he is meant to be, living up to Uncle Ben's last piece of advice to him, ""With great power comes great responsibility"". The story is inspiring, the action is exhilarating, and the editing/transitions are breathtaking at points in the film. In my honest opinion, this movie is a masterpiece of the superhero-film genre and is a must see for those who haven't watched it already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A special effects extravaganza,"It should tell you almost all you need to know that all the publicity stills from this film were CGI shots.If you're a fan of CGI, Spider-Man 2 is a real treat - an Internet Movie Database Top 250 of a film. But in other respects it is lacking, and more so than its prequel.Although Tobey Maguire is billed as the lead, he is on the screen for a relatively short amount of time because, for the most part, his character is played by 69 members of the effects crew. And talented though Maguire is, his appearances have the feel of being a filler while we wait for the next action sequence.It doesn't help that Peter Parker's superhero affliction has gone from being poor and naive to being the world's most unfairly treated individual. He is dumped by his girlfriend for turning up late to the theatre and shunned by his aunt for confessing that he played an indirect, and entirely unforeseeable, part in his uncle's death.Still, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus is a very fine baddie and the plot ticks along nicely, if predictably, for the full two hours. My main issue is that despite its high rating among IMDb's voters, it is not as good as Spider-Man. The hero never appears vulnerable enough to give the scenes any tension and the film begins to look like an action flick by numbers.That said, as CGI-reliant films go it is certainly better than anything by George Lucas. Let's hope that the third instalment is up to the standard set by Batman Begins.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
God awful movie; its high rating signifies the low standards of moviegoers,"This movie was the most awful schlock-fest I've seen in at least the past six months. I thought the first movie was okay, not great, but certainly not awful; I was entertained by it. While watching the sequel I was continually incredulous that anyone could consider this movie to be anything other than a smörgåsbord of crap.Sure, people will tell me: ""It's just a movie. Suspend your disbelief."" And while I'm more than happy to suspend my disbelief that there's a kid with superhuman spider powers swinging around New York and fighting crime, I'm not willing to concoct an elevated subway train running through what looks to be midtown Manhattan, said to be bound for Bay Ridge (which is in Brooklyn) but somehow the end of its line faces some body of water (the east river, perhaps?) and there is no platform or station in sight.That was merely part of my gripe with the movie. What about the asinine bank robbery scene where Doc Ock is stealing gold coins of some sort? He makes off with two bags and somehow has enough to buy whatever absurd supplies he needs to rebuild his machine. From where did he order the supplies? ""Wholesale_sci-fi_nuclear_machinery.com?"" Did they deliver it to his run down layer on some dilapidated pier in ... where, Queens? Wouldn't that set off some alarms somewhere? There's only so much disbelief that can be suspended.There has to be some semblance of believability for a movie to work and while superheroes are obviously a fiction, having fleets of cop cars racing down the streets of NY (in 2005? This isn't Dinkin's-era NY), being flipped--and shot at by white nu-metal looking hoods cruising in convertible 50s-era cars--is *bleeping* ridiculous. It's not entertaining, it's insulting and moronic.But hey, the general public seems to be comprised of morons who eat stuff up so long as it makes a lot of noise and has a lot of movement and color and, of course, explosions and property damage. This film dragged on forever with absurd, feckless bits of exposition (the cake scene with the Russian landlord's daughter? Wtf?? What was the point?). ""Spider-man 2"" might as well have been directed by Joel Schumacher; it was almost as bad, if not as bad as ""Batman and Robin"".This movie was a disgrace.

Sommons), the owner of the local newspaper and great enemy of Spider Man; Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lost his job, has no money for the rent and his aunt is having serious problems to pay her mortgage. He has problems also in the university, having lower grades. Spider Man 2' is an excellent sequel, having a good story and excellent special effects.

"Tobey Maguire's Back, Spinning Another Web","The ""Spider-Man 2"" movie is just a shade better than the first - which, in series films, is a cause for tremendous celebration. Happily, producers were able to pay director Sam Raimi and his main cast however many millions of dollars they needed... Also, the first film's ""special effects"" (however well done) seemed too startlingly change from live action to animation. This is still fairly obvious, but done much more smoothly; and, the ""Dr. Octopus"" villain costume is a cinematic success. Like they say, ""(special effects director John) Frazier is especially effective (along with over a hundred helpers).""Allowing for a comic book aficionado to be a little too critical, it does seem like an extraordinary amount of time is spent on illustrating the ""downtrodden"" life of ""Peter Parker"" (which is the main plot, I know, but it's a very large chunk of the movie). And, although Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker) is wonderful in the role, he and Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane Watson) aren't going to be able to convincingly play ""Peter"" and ""M.J."" as ""teenagers in love"" much longer. It will be interesting to see how producers continue this relationship, which seems to be, herein, necessary for ""Spider-Man"" to remain fully powerful.Alfred Molina (as Otto Octavius) rises to the challenge of playing the ""visual effects""-enhanced villain role. Handsome ""best friend"" James Franco (as Harry Osborn) returns, to hint at becoming the new ""Green Goblin""; as in the first film, the actor doesn't seem to be used to his potential (although, it looks like he will get a chance to put on a costume in the next film). My ""No-Prize Awards"" winners include: Elyse Dinh for playing the ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" theme song, Rosemary Harris for being ""Aunt May"", Hal Sparks for being so funny, and Stan Lee for believing in Super-Heroes.******** Spider-Man 2 (2004) Sam Raimi ~ Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Superhero With Human Frailties and Boyish Antics,"Dumb, loud, and cynical blockbusters have long brutalized movie audiences. 'Spiderman 2' illustrates that a superhero film can always stand to strike a chord of what vibrant, intelligent, and heartfelt popular film-making could look like. Directed by Sam Raimi and adapted from a story whose many scribes include the novelist Michael Chabon; the sole screenwriting credit belongs to Alvin Sargent, who wrote ""Ordinary People"" and ""Paper Moon"". The new Spider-Man 2 is replete with dazzling colors, deafening noises and elaborate special effects. Of course this is what we expected.What distinguishes this film, I am pleased to report, is solid character development with sincere emotions. Much like its Marvel Comic book kin, ""X-Men 2,"" this sequel, free from the dreary weight of excessive exploitation, is somewhat better than its predecessor as well as better than most other comic-book-based feature films.However, what disturbs me about this Super hero is his lack of maturity, looks, and good judgment. It would more aptly be called Spider Boy than Spider Man. His continuous child-like thinking and boyish appearance belong more in a high school teenathon than as the omnipotent Spiderman of comic book fame. This frail looking teenager hardly presents the image of a super hero who is able to attract the likes of a Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) or any other adult female.In the comic book, the hero is depicted as much older, more muscular, and able to assert himself wherever and whenever needed. I would suppose that the powers that be selected Tobey Maguire for those boyish looks since they would more likely appeal to the teenagers who would more likely provide the bulk of the film's attendance. Whenever Peter Parker kisses the mature-looking Mary Jane, it almost makes you cringe that he is about to be sexually abused.At the end of the film, the hero was forced to choose between his superhuman powers and the heady charms of Mary Jane. However, it was extremely irritating and difficult to sympathize as to why poor Peter Parker could not have both. True to action-hero clichés, he felt the world needed Spider-Man, and so Peter hardened his resolve and surrendered his despairing, life-long love of Mary Jane Watson.The dutiful web-slinger, although adored by the people, is unjustly scorned, and maligned in the Daily Bugle, led by the angry and abusive editor J. Jonah Jameson, played with fanatic passion by J. K. Simmons. However, his alter ego Peter Parker is the one who suffers the deeper emotional wounds. Jameson continuously insults, cheats, and badgers poor Peter while he is desperately scrambling to balance the demands of a normal life along with nocturnal forays into crime fighting. Perhaps even more insulting to Peter is the negative mirror image of Spider-Man he is forced to bear, being routinely hounded as penniless, lazy, selfish, and unreliable.His poor aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who is still grieving from the loss of her husband, (Uncle Ben previously played by Cliff Robertson, in a brief flashback), is in grave danger of losing her home, and her devotion to Peter is eroded by palpable disappointment when he confesses his negligent role in her husband's death. Even Mary Jane, whose career as a model and actress has been recently quite successful, is fed up with what appears to be Peter's consistent selfishness and unbelievable excuses. To make matters ever worse for Peter, she has become engaged to an astronaut, who just happens to be Jonah Jameson's son.All of this hoopla moves us to the film's midpoint when the pitiful Spider-Man, his webs drying up because of Peter's depression, dumps his Spidy suit into a back-alley garbage can. In the meantime, a brilliant scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is presenting a dangerous and ambitious fusion project financed by Peter's best pal and who incidentally is also another Spider-Man nemesis, Harry Osborn (James Franco). A disastrous malfunction leaves Octavius not only a widower, but transforms him into a monster. Malevolent, intelligent mechanical legs that seem to have diabolical minds of their own now propel his body. Doc Ock, as Jamison in the Bugle characterizes him, is now Spidey's enemy. Unlike Spidey, poor Ock is not the master of his octopus mechanical arms; rather he is their servant.Sam Raimi, the director who cut his teeth on the gory, low-budget horrors of the ""Evil Dead"" franchise, is not totally an aficionado of fancy computer-generated special effects (CGI). Nevertheless, they remain an integral part of the film. (No filmmaker working in this genre can afford not to). Yet, the digitized scenes of New York City's Spiderman flights and fighting are not the strongest parts of the movie, since Raimi does not yet have Peter Jackson's or Steven Spielberg's talent for a seamless combination of CGI with conventional movie-making. Instead, he attempts to develop the characters more and provide more of a storyline than other action films.The storyline, although much more interesting than the usual action extravaganza, still is a bit juvenile for my taste. The film is fun, yet often frustrating when the immaturity of Peter contaminates the hero mood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best one of the trilogy,"I've seen this movie on the theater twice.. once on the premiere here in Indonesia, and then the second was one week after. not just that, i even bought the DVD, trust me.. it's that good!The part that i liked best from this movie was the story. Raimi has put amazing plots to the make the movie enjoyable for everyone (even kids that doesn't care too much about the story would be amazed by the fights in it). From inner conflict, love and the fight against Doc Ock, Raimi and the scriptwriters amazed me till the end.Maguire was great. Dunst, Franco and Molina were also the vital parts that made this movie so powerful to me. Thanks Raimi, for making such wonderful superhero movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great sequel with better qualities than the first,"Spider-Man broke records and open the audiences eyes when it first came out in May 2002. Nothing can beat that, but this Spider-Man almost did. It's hard to out due the Green Goblin, but Alfred Molina's character as Octopus was excellent. The Green Goblin almost looked fake at times with the all green suit and the fixed helmet that wouldn't move. The story behind how Dr. Otto Octavius ended up with these extra metal arms is intriguing. This Octopus character has an intense presence and powerful force when he attacks Spider-Man. Another story goes on between Peter Parker, taking place 2 years later after the first Spider-Man. Mary-Jane Watson is still in the spotlight role for Peter Parker. It is very interesting how you see Peter Parker go through dilemmas with himself and dealing with him having a dual life of being in college and being a hero. Tobey Maguire seems made for the part. Finally, in Spider-Man 2, his identity is revealed to several important characters and that affects his decisions. Mary-Jane's love story continues with another character yet she begins to realize that her one true love was right under her nose. J.K. Simmons' character as the newspaper editor was hilarious in the first Spider-Man. His character is magnified in this film and his jokes and attitude seems a bit overdone. Overall, this was one of the best sequels I have come across. The story is just as interesting as the action, and there is a lot of eye-popping action. Spider-Man 2 is simply a hit, and there is not another way to put it.**** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power comes...........poetry ?,"Peter Parker is finding his life real tough, conflicted with his feelings for Mary Jane, he's also struggling at school. Add to that that his best friend is thirsting for revenge against his alter ego, and that a new breed of bad guy has been birthed, well it's a mightily challenging time.Spider-Man 2002 was a roaring success, director Sam Raimi excellently bringing the iconic web slinger to the big screen. That Spider-Man 2 met expectations is something of a stunning achievement, following on two years later from the first film, Raimi has wisely kept the same formula that made his first film so joyous. The same cast all return to cement this as a character driven franchise, so just add a new quality villain into the mix and it's all good really. Here the story is very strong, driving the picture on is Peter's struggle with his dual identity, Raimi merrily leads us along the path of his struggle whilst often hinting at what is to come, and sure enough once Doctor Octopus is born, all hell breaks loose, but because of our familiarity with all the characters, the film has gained our trust and thus the impetus hits splendidly.Raimi benefits here from having more money available and so we as the viewers get to see him weave his FX tricks, whilst great fight sequences and a more grounded bad guy both are great improvements over the first films offerings. There are also nudges aplenty to some of Raimi's other films, and fans of the Spider-Man legacy will enjoy all manner of nods in their direction. Alfred Molina is the big new addition as Dr. Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, he brings a sharp bit of intensity to the villain side of the persona, and although the character is never fully formed, Molina puts credible gusto into the role as we enter the final third.Fine story that is dazzlingly surrounded by quality, hell yes this is a truly great sequel. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man 3 should be like this,"In comparison, Spider-Man 2 is better than Spidey 3. Why? because my dear Spidey fans and casual movie lovers, Spider-Man 2 has a better script, better character development, suspense, humor and great action sequences; something that Spidey 3 DOESN'T HAVE!!! Spider-Man 3 was so bogged down that it sputtered like a car that ran out of gasoline at the last (and worst) time of the day. If the producers and the director would've sticked to the same formula that made the first two films so great in the third installment, it would've been SO much better.

Or Carnage? When will we see one of them in a Spiderman movie? Seriously, though, Spiderman 2 is a good one. Seen it in the cinema? Still good enough to spend your money on.

This put me to sleep and made me thing it was the 50's again,"I am not going not spend much time on this as I felt I wasted enough already. The first hour and 20 minutes was so painful.

I remember watching sapping movie in the 50's and they were OK, but I was a preteen then, so it to be expected.I understand why they think it is justified for spidey to lie, but I hate it when it makes no sense. He is talking to this girl (not attractive either) and you know he is going to say he does not love her, why?Can't he be mature enough to respect her and say, yes, but he is not going to act on it?Why would it be so hard for the police to shot this octo man, who by the way does not have 8 legs. Oh well, it is just more of the infantile writing. If I want mindless action, I do not need so much tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever.,"'I'll peel the skin off your face!' Spidey nemesis Doc Ock informs one of his victims how he feels. Here's how I feel about director Sam Raimi's ('Spider-Man,' 'A Simple Plan') 'Spider-Man 2': It's the best American movie so far this year and the best comic book adaptation ever filmed.Not hard to figure because the writers are a Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon ('The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay') and Oscar winner Alvin Sargent ('Ordinary People'). This is the kind of movie American filmmakers excel at with outrageous action, weepy relationships, and glorious endings, all spiced with unparalleled special effects and actors such as Tobey Maguire destined to play their roles.Peter Parker (Maguire) is still rejecting Mary Jane because of the danger his Spider-Man persona would bring her if people knew who he was. The interesting twist in this second installment is that Spidey loses his powers in conjunction with several other losses in his life, love and job included.That maxim, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' still eludes him because he disavows heroic responsibility and hurls himself into an existential funk questioning his purpose in life.Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) makes it difficult for Parker to quit the web-based business because Ock's experiments with fusion threaten all of New York City (a popular target this year: Do you remember it frozen in 'Day After Tomorrow'?), and Spidey is the only one who can defeat him. Molina's octopus-like tentacles almost achieve character-status themselves; his climbing Manhattan buildings with various female victims in his grasps evokes the great King Kong. Like Kong, Ock has a soft side that makes him less a monster and more a human.Among several themes is the importance of responsibility, a lesson for all the major characters, including slimy newspaper editor J. Jonah Jamison (J.K Simmons), who almost steals the picture with his over-the-top selfishness and brief moment of remorse.Stan Lee, who created the complex hero for Marvel comics in 1962, has a cameo, but his understanding of human frailty pervades the film. He achieved that heroic ambivalence only hinted at in the Superman series.Tobey Maguire ('Cider House Rules,' 'Seabiscuit') has the youthful idealism and stunned-by-reality look to make the complicated change of life he will try later on credible. He reminds me of another struggling, lonely and poor hero, Thomas Hardy's Tess, who likened herself to a lonely spider, 'which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came, and shivered in the slight draft through the casement.'Maguire's gift as an actor is to relay the American dream and the American drama of self-discovery in his eyes. No other actor can better demand our respect for his journey from innocence to experience. He is America.So George Bush and the neocons should love the responsibility theme of this film considering the sacrifices the War in Iraq has asked of Americans. The other themes of sacrificing for love and discovering one's self may be too subtle for anyone but Kerry supporters. Either way, this is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did.Stay put because Spidey 3 is spinning another web.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bad dialogue, OK story, Great effects, but just a Good movie","This movie is for people who have already told themselves they're going to love it no matter what. I saw it last night and I was pretty disappointed. I loved the first one, and I don't think this one lived up to it's ""better than the first"" billing. Yes, the action is better, and even the special effects are amazing, but the story and flow are definitely sub-par. And don't even get me started on the dialogue. Alright, I'll start...I defended the bad dialogue in the first movie because I said it was how characters talked in a comic book. However, this time around, the dialogue used was by people who are morons. Take, for example, anything Mary Jane says. My favorite line of hers was when Peter asked her to go get some Chow Mein, and she rudely retorted ""Peter, I'm engaged!"" As if people who are engaged can never go out to eat with anybody ever. Or the exchange at the end....MJ: ""You love me, don't you?"" Spidey: ""Uh-huh"" MJ: ""Even though you said you didn't?"" Hey, moron, he just said he loved you, you don't have to badger him about it. I really like Kirsten Dunst, but I'm not sure I can blame the writers for her poor performance. She is getting really good at the look of being totally heart-broken though.One last rant...in the first major action with Doc Ock, there are some hilarious shots of young, hot women with tight shirts and sweaters, clearly showing off their perky breasts. These shots were no mistake, and they couldn't have been more obvious. I was laughing hysterically during one shot. Truth is, that was probably the most entertained I was during the whole movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is still the benchmark.,"I remember everything about the night I saw this movie, at a retro drive-in theater, just like it was yesterday. That was almost 20 years ago now, and as far as superhero movies go..this one still hasn't been topped.First things first- I love Batman, I've seen the Dark Knight more times than I can recall. Spider-Man 2 is better. Though, I may have a slight bias- Spider-Man might be my favorite character in any medium, across all genre of film, television, even video games. There is something about a young guy struggling to support the corner of the world he's vowed to protect, just as well as juggling his relationships, job, college life, and yet still staying strong enough to pay his bills (even if they're late) despite the harsh realities thrown his way that really..speaks to me. This movie throws all of this at you and more. You truly feel Peter's life crumbling around him, as that weight he's vowed to bear becomes too much for both Peter Parker and Spider-man. The humanity in seeing Peter struggle to withhold his true feelings for Mary Jane, and more importantly, his knowledge of Uncle Ben's death from Aunt May, all because he's Spider-Man, can be felt. You're a witness to his struggles as Peter Parker, his triumphs, and failures as Spider-Man, and his evident resurrection as both- Peter Parker, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It's spectacular in every way. With the perfect touch of cheesy.Superhero movies aren't made like this anymore and I can't understand why. Go for the kickass action, stay for love story, the everlasting drama that is life.Finally, to be honest...I love Tom Holland.

"A rare feat for a blockbuster, this film exceeds expectations.","These days there are so many blockbusters that are heavily marketed, and we see the trailers ad nauseum before we get to see the film. Most of the time, the film turns out to be disappointing. I certainly felt that way about the first Spiderman.Spiderman 2, however, is much more than your regular action hero film. We are too familiar with the Clarke Kent/Superman, Bruce Wayne/Batman identity dilemmas, and thought that another Peter PArker/Spiderman will be no different. But Sam Raimi explores this in a much more human and sympathetic way. Interestingly, the film seems to focus less on action, and more on the psyche of Peter PArker confronting his life and fate. Even though he is not as invincible as Superman, and not like Batman with his inexhaustible wealth and gadgets, Spiderman is more courageous and heroic in the way he deals with his problems, and the path he takes.As before, the scenes of Spiderman swinging through the metropolis are stunning.Dr Octopus is also a much more multi-dimensional baddie than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.I loved this film and will definitely see it again many times over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great villain, good action, but way too talky","Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock, a brilliant mad scientist with 4 long metallic arms he cleverly also uses as legs. He's tearing up the city and only spideyman can stop him. Unfortunately the super-bug has, for some reason the movie never explained, lost his super powers and has furthermore gotten fed up with the whole idea of being a super hero instead of a regular teen.Sounds pretty good and it is, except when the movie gets into the ""personal relationships"" of spiderman when he's just Peter Parker. Lots of idiotic heart-to-heart talks with his girl friend and then there's this obnoxious old aunt who can't shut up and is always giving peter meddlesome advice.Still, the fight scenes are great and the animation of S flying thru the air is great too. I remember one scene where peter thinks he can fly again and takes off only to come crashing down and violently bounces off a couple cars. Looked extremely realistic - the director even thought of having the tail-pipe on one of the cars swing back and forth after peter smashed into the side of the car.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Just a Great Superhero Film but also just a Great Film,"This is probably my favourite Spider-Man film. I have seen all of the Spider-Man films before but I decided to rewatch them in preparation for No Way Home.Directed by Sam Raimi, a director most at home with horror, this film takes some horror tropes and combines them with a story straight from the pages of a comic. I love Alfred Molina, I feel like I've hardly seen him in anything else but watching him in this he is obviously a massively talented actor. His take on Doc Ock is great and tragic. I like the score by Danny Elfman, it feels really unique compared to a lot of superhero scores and is instantly recognizable.

Dissapointing,"I wasn't a huge fan of the 1st Sam Raimi Spidey movie but after several of my friends singing the sequels praises I caved and went to see it.Starting very well it was easy to get drawn in and it all seemed very respectful of the comic books. Enter Dr Otto Oktavius, and on come the brakes.Dr Ock should absolutely not be ever portrayed as a misunderstood, slightly ecentric scientist. Otto is by far one of, if not, Spiderman's deadliest arch enemies and is and evil meglomaniac.But okay this is forgivable as long as it's just one change and the rest is quite respectful, but noooo.Peter Parker's whole character for the past thirty odd years has been motivated by his feeling of guilt for the death of Uncle Ben, but here he confesses to Aunt May that it was all his fault and Aunt May after a while forgives him, taking away any motivation for him to be spiderman.The travesty continues when he loses his mask, or rather repeatedly takes it off. The comic books do reveal Spiderman's alter ego as being Peter Parker but when it is done it's so momentous that it takes an age for him to come to terms with. Here Peter whips off the mask when he's surrounded by people on a subway train and again in front of Doctor Octopus and Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne.It seems to me that Sam Raimi does not understand Spiderman at all. Harry Osbourne on the other hand is perfect, he couldn't have nailed him better.All in all the movie is stunning as a superhero movie to as a representation of the well established Spiderman it just plain stinks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

we need new screenwriters!,"good action, decent effects, and the chance for some good acting...unfortunately the last of these three aspects of spider man 2 was squandered yet again by horrible screenwriting!it happened in the new installment of the ""star wars"" movies and it appears it's going to happen with all the spider man movies as well. i wouldn't be surprised if george lucas somehow managed to convince this movie's scriptmen to take some notes from his shipwreck of a script.don't get me wrong, i definitely thought the action was decently well done, although the rubber-looking cgi spider man looks about as real as the agent smiths do in that overdone scene in matrix: reloaded where neo gets swarmed by a hive of cgi agent smiths. i think it looks tacky and it in no way allows me to immerse myself in the movie. that said, the action sequences were nicely constructed in terms of pace and intensity. and the subway train was probably one of the best action sequences of the movie.they (stan lee and friends) could have cut out well over half the overly cheesy dialogue, and everyone would still have known what was going on. i haven't seen the first movie, but it didn't take me more than about 2 minutes into the movie to realize that spiderman/peter parker would have to juggle and eventually sacrifice certain parts of their existence in attempts to find a balance. i didn't need the entire cast to preach it at me every 10 minutes or so. even parker's doctor gives him a life lesson talk, as if he were his father or something. you can get away with a bit of cheesy dialogue in comic book movies, but this was far and away too much, particularly when the caliber of actors in this movie was enough to warrant some good acting.tobey maguire isn't quite Oscar-worthy, but he's been a part of some intelligent films with well-written scripts and tight directing (cider house rules, pleasantville). and alfred molina was superb in ""frida;"" it was a passionate and severe man who portrayed diego rivera in that film. in my opinion, only the screenwriters are to blame for blunders like spider man 2.everyone else in the cast should get their huge paycheck for having been made to suffer through such an atrociously-written script.speaking of money, i also wouldn't mind my 7 bucks back, mr. lee. i would have rather just checked the movie out at the library.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A great Spider-Man sequel,It is a very good film (not as good as the first). It has a slow screenplay which gets a little boring. The performances are good but Kristen Dunst role as M.J gets a little annoying with all of her screaming. Only watch if you liked the first movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
revolutionary,"this is an excellent piece of film making. it will do to films what star wars and superman did. It is revolutionary in the way it uses special effects.Spiderman flies faster than ever, and you cannot tell which is computer generated. It is unlike anything ever seen before. The other special effects are amazing. They are so fluid and detailed, that they just blend into the scene.Some of the scenes are brilliantly thought out and grip you to the edge of your seat.aside from the visuals and sound, its an excellent film for the family. Its both humorous, serious and romantic. All wonderfully blended in to create a tru blockbuster.This version is superior to the first in all aspects and sets the landmark for future movies. Hollywood has created a most incredible world and presents in a glorious way.I felt very privileged to experience the genius of the film. Great way to spend two hours, or even better to have on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Jon Monsarrat review: better than the 1st, not hokey at all","The first half of Spider Man 1 was brilliant because the characters seemed real and deep. It was OK for Peter Parker to get dirty (like the hobbits in LOTR). He was just a regular guy. There was no melodrama, the film didn't take itself seriously. But the second half was a lot of computer graphics combat and cheesiness that didn't work for me.Spider-Man 2 fixes all that. The Spider-Man costume is allowed to get torn. There's plenty of self-deprecating humor. Jamieson is brilliant. I'm not much of a comic book guy. I used to be when I was a kid, but there's a limit, you know? At about the point when some cartoonist says ""maybe the gorilla has a third eye and he's got a gem instead of a heart and the whole universe is at stake again"" when you just gotta sigh and give up comic books to kids. Anyway, I prefer real drama these days. I saw X-Men and X-Men 2 but thought it was a little too over the top.Spider-Man 2 is not like that. If you're skeptical of cartoons you can see it as a straight action flick or even as a drama. The only faults I might draw are that there is possibly too much plot packed in, and I just didn't sense a great romantic chemistry.Who should see this film:-- All action flick people & comic book types-- Older kids-- Drama people, put on sunglasses and go slumming, you will enjoy this film and I won't tellI'll give Spider-Man 2 an 8 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Spiderman Movie!,"Spiderman 2 is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman film that has come out so far. That is not to say that the movie does not have its problems because it does. However, despite its issues, this is the Spiderman film that, has the best effects, has the best action, has the most heart, and most importantly stays true to the spirit of the character the most.This film almost embodies Spiderman almost perfectly. This is definitely Tobey McGuire's best performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I cannot say it is his best performance period because I haven't seen all of his films, but it is definitely his best performance as this character. This film really captures Spiderman and people love him even now. Everyone hates Spiderman and regard him as a criminal despite all the good he does, him trying to balance his life as Spiderman and his personal life, and no matter what he does things just never seem to go his way. That's Spiderman and that's what made him so relatable in the comics and why so many people gravitated towards him even to this day.They also handle Harry and his ark perfectly. In this film he is still trying to get revenge on Spiderman for ""killing"" his father in the last film. This has become an obsession it virtually consumes his life where he does nothing else. At the end of the film you see where that ultimately leads him.
Rosemary Harries gives an amazing performance as Aunt May like in the last, except she is even better here. The scenes where Peter is talking to her about Uncle Ben's death and when she gives her speech about heroes they are amazing and the best scenes in the movie. I do not care what anybody says, Rosemary Harris is Aunt May not the one from Amazing Spiderman.Doc Oc, I think, they actually improved upon from the comics. In the comics he is just a stereotypical mad scientist with four robotic arms. In the film they make him for of a three-dimensional character. You can feel sympathy for him and see where he is coming from which are almost always the best villains.The action is also top notch in this. This film has the best action scenes of all the Spiderman films to date. Spiderman 3 had some great action as well but this, in my opinion, still takes the cake. The fight between Spiderman and Doc Oc on the clock tower and the train are phenomenal. It is the best fight in the entire franchise. The effects are amazing and really help make the action amazing. Some of the effects in the original were a bit off which hurt the action a little. The effects in Spiderman 2 beat the crap out of almost all the other films including the new ones, which is sad. Spiderman 3 had slightly better effects but is still quite close.The film, however, is not without its faults. The film, while coming close, does not capture Spiderman perfectly. Spiderman still does not use his wit enough. He does use it but not often enough. Mary Jane is still a very poorly written character. I still think Kirsten Dunst, while a good actress, is miscast. This Mary Jane is still not like the Mary Jane from the comics, is still annoying, and is still just there to be Peter's token love interest and the person he saves. She also comes off as a bit selfish in this film as well. It is not as bad as the third film but is still annoying.There is also the plot point of her and Jameson's son. That goes nowhere. I am not too familiar with the Spiderman comics but I think he had a bigger role there. Here he is simply a throw-away character. Weak!The plot-point of Spiderman losing his powers, while not, seems a little weird to me. Not-to-mention it is taken almost beat for beat from another film. I swear Sam Raimi ripped off Hayao Miyazaki. The same plot point was used in the 1989 Miyazaki animated film Kiki's Delivery Service which is an awesome movie by the way. It does not bother me too much since I saw Spiderman 2 before Kiki, but I still find that quite amusing. I wonder if it was because of Kirsten Dunst. Dunst who plays Mary Jane in these movies also voiced Kiki in the dub of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is her best performance in my opinion. Did she have some creative input she was not credited for?Overall, Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman film easily. If you are a fan of Spiderman then definitely see this film. It has great action, great effects, great story, and it comes closest to the characters in the comics than any of the other films. You really do not even need to watch the first movie before this. I would recommend you do, but it is not required to understand this. This film is pretty self-contained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
keeps going downhill...,I really did not like the first one much but i decided to give this one a shot thinking that it may be a bit better. In fact is was much worse. The actors are much worse and its filled with more plot holes.This movie takes place after the first one following peter parker (spiderman) as he tries to live a normal life and be spiderman at the same time.This movie was not as good as the first one. At least in the first one you had the excitement of him becoming a super hero. In this one the story line is just boring and predictable.

Spider-Bland 2,"Being utterly disappointed with the first Spider-Man film, I thought for some bizarre reason that this one might be better. I think that I thought the villian (Dr. Octopus, in comic terms, Doc Ock in this film) would be a cool, but of course I was wrong. First off, Tobey Maguire is unbearably annoying with his nerdiness, but then he becomes a total bad-ass when he puts on his suit - that's really stupid. The CGI was over done and done poorly. Spider-Man was too concerned with ballet while flying through the air, and lost all of what made him an admirable super hero. What's worse is that there was an irritating over-doing of women screaming at EVERYTHING in the movie. This reminded me of those old horror movies where people just stare and scream - it didn't work then, and it sure as hell doesn't work now. I was bored with this whole movie because it moved so unbearably slow, and any action that took place wasn't too exciting compared to the bland scenes that came before it. There was several irrelevant scenes in the movie that further destroyed its potential. I think that Sam Raimi would make a better Peter Parker, but it doesn't really matter because this series is beyond repair. Don't see this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Spider-Boy 2"" Aims to Please It's Targeted Audiences (and probably will), but Offers Something for the ""Babysitter Viewer"" Too.","With his performance in ""Spider-Boy 2,"" Tobey Maguire firmly establishes himself as the ""thinking person's"" Ralph Macchio. The almost 30-year old Maguire's on screen adolescence is virtually undiminished from episode 1, but the darker themes in episode 2 are an intriguing disconnect for older, more discerning viewers (those dragged to see the movie by younger, less discerning ones). I have no doubt that straight girls under 16, and gay men over 40 will enjoy this one as much as the first one, but there is also a little something here for the indifferent captives in the theater as well. Now that the ""Batman"" series has been resurrected with Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, I'm thinking that Maguire should be on a short list for Robin should that character show up again in the future, thus sealing the poor actor's fate as an omnipresent junior action hero (while he laughs all the way to the bank, no doubt).

Resonates in a Post-9/11 World,"""Spider-Man 2"" improves on the original, thanks to Sam Raimi's decision to take advantage of a post-9/11 need for solidarity and heroes and work it overtly into his film. It also benefits from a scene-chewing performance from Alfred Molina, as this installment's villain, Doc Oc.However, no improvements were made in the casting of the leads, with dough-faced Tobey Maguire returning as the web slinger and Kirsten Dunst as his vapid muse.This one won the Academy Award for Visual Effects and also found itself nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everybody needs a hero,"Peter Parker is trying to deal with his personal life, and all of a sudden starts to question his role as Spider-Man. Soon his personal life begins to fall apart. The situation only starts to get worse when his powers begins to give out, and a mad scientist Dr. Octopus(Alfred Molina) terrorizes the whole city. The first movie brought so much to the table now having established the characters and the tone. Spider-Man 2 to me is the best in the trilogy. It builds on Peters character as a whole with a personal journey while still having most of the charm. The characters are just more fleshed out and developed. Having their own obstacles to over come. One of the reasons why Spider-Man is so loved by so many is because in many ways peters the most relatable superheroes ever. He's not a CEO or a big shot lawyer or neurosurgeon or a literal king. He just ordinary guy trying to make a way. This film shows many of those aspects of his life. Failing to hold down a job, his relationship troubles with M. J, Aunt Mays financial crisis and just maintaining his personal life. All at the same time still trying to do what he does a Spider-Man. Tobey does a great job and showing Peter is struggle and is he even capable of still being Spider-Man? Does he want to be Spider-Man what does he want is the overall question. You feel sympathy for Peter as constantly throughout this film he's just kicked down. Every chance he tries to get back up from his situation with Mary Jane who decides she's going to marry someone else. To his friendship with Harry practically jeopardized because of Harry's hatred towards Spider-Man thinking him responsible for his father's death. So he just grows this bitterness towards Peter. Peter doesn't get a break in this. Doctor octopus arguably the best villain from Rami trilogy and probably all the Spider-Man films. He written like a scientist he's calm and calculating. He's a villian you feel more sympathy for given want happen, as well Peter spends time with him before the accident. He's not played more over the top to the point its comedic like Dafoes goblin. The hospital scene is like something out of a horror movie. Imagine it with blood all over the place. He's far more serious in many ways a bigger threat to Peter. The fight scenes between the two are some of the best. No point does peter really have the upper hand mostly he's just thrown around like a ragdoll. Even though this movie has less action and drama. The fights still manages to stick out and leave your remembering them like the train. The visuals are way more stunning in the first film some of the CG was far more dated it stood out looking back at it. The second film actually managed to perfect that given it had a larger budget to work with Spider-Man swinging around and climbing on walls it doesn't look as fake. It's more fluent in organic as he moves from building and swing. The only Cg used that does stand out was on Dr. Octopus for the tentacles sometimes having an CG body but it's not as bad. The uses of practical is always appreciated many parts of the film whenever it's not having to be fully Up eyes. The tentacles behind Doc ock are actually real when he's not all over. While the films is more serious then the last it still manages to be funny Some of the best favorite moments involved JK Simmons as Jonah Jamison hands-down the best character portrayed in any movies. It amazing how accurate this character is to the comic. Everything he say is quotable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good film. Bad love story.,"At the time this came out it was quite unique in the superhero genre. It showed character development compared to the first Spiderman and a good villian in Doc Octopus. While other superhero films since have matched/surpassed this template, this can be seem as a founding father to todays superhero flicks. For Harry Osborn, read Bucky Barnes.i was never a huge fan of Tobeys Spiderman, he was good as nerdy Peter Parker but as Spiderman he doesn't crack enough jokes, doesn't have a heroic presence and is too obsessed with rescuing Mary Jane. The latter part could work, except Mary Jane is an unlikable character and the worst part of the film. She's not a strong woman, she's a generic ""damsel in distress"" who is not exactly 100% loyal to Parker. Compared to what we seen on film in 2018 this type of woman seems quite backward and is not interesting.The film spends too much time focusing on the Parker-Jane relationship, which dragged the film down. Other aspects were good, Doc Ock's arc was fascinating and was a badass villain. Parkers struggle to balance being a superhero and a ordinary college student is well done, despite the obsession with Mary Jane. And the newspaper guy has the best laugh in the history of cinema. The ending nicely sets up the next film (which unfortunately turned out to be a disaster.)A good film that has been overshadowed somewhat by todays superhero flicks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doc Ock Is The Best Spider-Man Villain,My love for superhero movies has been encoded into me since I was about 5 with TMNT and X-Men cartoons. Back then it was all about seeing colorful characters fight one another for me and I couldn't wait to watch new episodes every week. I was 14 when Spider-Man 2 came out and the first time I saw this movie it melted my brain with how spectacular it was. It still captured the continuing adventures that made love superhero cartoons as a kid but what really blew me away were the human aspects.Peter Parker trying to figure out who he was and what path he wanted to take in life resonated with me then and now in two totally different ways. But one this that hasn't changed for me is the awe I have for Doc Ock in this. There's a reason why he was the first big bad revealed in the No Way Home trailer; he's the best villain in Spider-Man cinematic history not because of the villainous acts he does but because of the human struggle he shows in the final act. While there are more flaws in this movie than I remembered (watching Peter relearn his powers really dragged with this rewatch) the main lesson that it has to tell is timeless.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but... not THAT good.","I really enjoyed Spiderman 2... but not as much as I expected to. Overall it didn't feel as well balanced as the first one. It seemed to spend overly long bludgeoning us (the audience) over the head with how horrible Tobey's life is and how he's so down on his luck and blah, blah, blah. It was just too much. It just got to the point that it wasn't authentic/genuine and it just came off as brutish (rather than artistic finesse). I think if they'd trimmed that stuff off a bit then it would've been much tighter and more enjoyable because the story wouldn't drag in places. Some elements of the story were obviously in the script ONLY to add depth to the characters - primarily the whole aspect of Aunt May losing her home, etc... That scenario may have been intended to somehow reflect Tobey's internal conflict, or buttress the effect his conflict on on us, but all it ended up doing for me was weighing down the story. Every time we had another ""Aunt May scene"" I would inwardly groan, sigh, and just hope it wouldn't be too excruciating. It's sad that they didn't come up with a more valid way of incorporating Aunt May this second time around. On the positive side of things though, the effects were tremendous (of course), and everyone did a fantastic job of acting. My favorite element of the Spiderman series of films is the villains - who are so fascinating because of their humanity and complex underlying motivations. Anyway, like I said earlier, I did enjoy it, but it just had too much of boring Aunt May scenes, and not enough substance on some of the other major plot point scenes. As good as the first Spiderman? Definitely not. In fact I'd say it's above the crappy Batman sequels (3 & 4), but below the rest of the comic superhero movies in quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It looked like they were desperately trying to write the superhero somewhere in their adolescent drama,"For me, it was a hard work to sit this film through, after this slow and long opening and all. I know I'm probably just being a smartass or whatever, but I struggled to find something to be interested in.I mean, there's no much action in it (I hoped to relax and watch a sfx flick - duh! Nowhere near it!), and there's this (IMHO) overwritten personal story that doesn't state much, either (it probably does for what it is: an adolescent movie; but it lacked freshness and therefore was plain DULL).At last - I found one interesting thing: at about the half of the movie, it suddenly occurred to me that the script writers didn't seemed to LIKE the whole superhero thing at all! Like ""oh, well, yeah, I forgot- he's a superhero... OK, let's put an action scene here, what's it that the producer wanted there? The train chase? OK, here you are, now let's get back to the REAL people!"" Or something to that extent.I mean, it looked like they were desperately trying to write the superhero somewhere in their adolescent drama, and I saw this bizarre picture of the whole writers crew jumping on the film roll trying to fit the bloating here and there superhero in, like people do with the traveling bag when there's too much stuff in it.At the end, I could clearly see two separate movies that mixed about as good as lemon juice and an 85W motor oil. So my conclusion was: they didn't manage to marry the two stories, maybe because they got so far in the realistic part of the first one that the second one looked like it didn't belong.I understand that it's probably the most difficult part of writing a superhero script, but as difficult as it is - it should be done. I could barely watch the ""main theme"" of the film, although it struck me that there were some pretty bold secondary characters (say, the landlord's daughter - what a pearl!), and there wasn't much of the action movie, so I got bored.It probably is a good movie, but if puts me out of the 3 sigmas of the Gaussian distribution of its target category.

Best of the Bunch,"This fine piece of cinema is sandwiched between two inconsistent films, those being Spiderman, and Spiderman 3. The first lacked a truly frightening and threatening Villain. The Comics displayed a more solid vision of the Goblin. But that said the film saved itself by showing Peter's dealings with becoming Spiderman, while attempting to keep a sane life. The Third tried to be bigger than it could, and it fell flat on it's face.This Film shines strongly, Spiderman starts this film off with him being in control, an established Superhero. Peter seems to be doing just fine in life, but his powers soon slip, something is causing him to loose them. To make the problem worse Doctor Octopus is raging havoc. The Doc challenges Spidey on all fronts (moral, physical, emotional, and personal) The way a bad guy should challenge the hero.

Very Well Done,"The movie started strangely. It was paced strangely that is. At first i thought the entire movie was going to be this way and i had very low expectations but any doubts i had were quickly dismissed as the movie continued. I had the same doubts about the choice of villain in this movie being Dr. Otto Octavius(Doc Ock) but Alfred Molina did a superb job with the character as did the visual effects department. Tobey Maguire really swayed me with his performance in this movie, i was one of the naysayers of his casting in the first place. Kirsten Dunst was also very good in this. James Franco with his Harry Osborn was perfect being torn between his best best fried and the man he believed killed his father.

I see Red in this Sequel!,"Many critics have labeled ""Spiderman 2"" as the best superhero film ever. The film was quite entertaining, but I think many of these critics got caught up in the spider trap. As its infamous predecessor- the film did incorporate sensational special effects, paradoxical personal dilemmas, sacrificing love intricacies, and stirring action sequences. However, to say that it was much better than the original would be an overstatement. I think these critics were ""climbing off the walls"" with their calenture for ""Spiderman 2"". Sam Raimi must be once again commended for his swashbuckling direction of ""Spiderman 2"". Raimi, who directed my own personal favorite superhero film ""Darkman"", is the premier director for this type of film genre. Tobey Maguire's performance as the web-slinging crusader was adequate but not of superheroic proportions. Alfred Molina was quite a handful or should I say handfuls as the villainous Dr. Octopus (Ock). However, the remaining supporting cast of ""Spiderman 2"" (James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris) did not entrap me too much into their world wide web of acting. They were far better in the original. In spide, I mean spite of it all, ""Spiderman 2"" is still one worth hanging on to and checking out. **** Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best Superhero Movies Out There,"It has been 15 years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 was released in theaters, but it has not aged poorly. In fact, it still holds up today as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Peter Parker's character arc in this installment of the Spider-Man franchise is better than ever as his subconscious desire to stop being Spider-Man takes him on what can only be described as an emotional rollercoaster. And once again, this story is very much about Parker's desire to be with Mary Jane, even though he rejected her at the conclusion of Raimi's first Spider-Man movie from two years prior.One big feature of Spider-Man 2 is the presence of a villain that exceeds the villain of the previous movie in almost every way. Alfred Molina steals the show as Doctor Octavius, or Doc Ock for short, a power-hungry scientist who tries to harness an element named Tridium so he can have ""the power of the sun in the palm of his hand."" In order to harness the element, however, he builds mechanical arms with artificial intelligence, but things go awry, of course, and he succumbs to the will of these arms when a chip that allows him to maintain control breaks. Octavius' evil motivations are combined from both his own mind and the will of his mechanical arms, so unlike Green Goblin in the previous installment, he is not a villain who goes mad due to insanity being a side effect of a drug. Doc Ock is more well-developed as an antagonist.Another subplot in the film focuses on Harry Osborn becoming obsessed with longing for Spider-Man's death for the ""murder"" of his father, Norman. While this subplot ultimately makes sense (most people would seek justice for murder) it does not take up a whole lot of screen time, and it seems to be rather repetitive. It is almost as if every time we see Harry on-screen, he is in the same petty mood as before, drowning his sorrows for the loss of his father, but with nothing new to say each time he appears. Franco's acting chops are good in a scene when he confronts Peter at a banquet while he is clearly intoxicated, but the entire subplot could have been handled better to make Harry's hatred more genuine.The best movies demand a strong character arc from their protagonists, and this movie does just that. Though it might seem repetitive if thinking about the first Spider-Man movie while watching this one, a lot of the story revolves around Parker struggling to be with Mary Jane, but this time around it is because he has too much responsibility as he balances being Spider-Man, going to school, and trying to find work. This is definitely the most emotional Spider-Man movie to date. His losing his abilities as Spider-Man is a subconscious warning to him that being a hero may no longer be in the cards for Peter Parker. He also struggles to be honest with his Aunt May in this movie, and this leads up to one of the best moments in the history of Spider-Man cinema.With a brilliant character arc for Peter Parker, good subplots, and a much greater villain than its predecessor, Spider-Man 2 still shines as a brilliant superhero movie 15 years later.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spidey 2 Good,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Everyone's complaints on the first were pretty much the same.  Weak special effects and poor character development left us with a bit of a hollow feeling.  This sequel is far superior on both fronts. Tobey Maguire has made Peter Parker/Spiderman HIS role.  His turn as Parker is more impressive than that of the masked hero.  Dr. Ock played by the surprisingly cast (always excellent)Alfred Molina is a terrific villain and this is where the special effects really shine.  The only real weakness in this one was the strength of the first: Kirstin Dunst just doesn't bring her usual sparkle.  As a matter of fact, she looks a tad under the weather in most scenes with her bad hair and bad make-up.  I have often said she could be the next Julia Roberts, but this one is a step in the wrong direction.

I think he could have done more efort like Willem Dafoe did in the prequel. i also hated the darkness of spider-man, his friends against him, losing jobs, having his lover engaged, and his aunt in money crisis. What sucks the most is is that he is unmasked. The effects were great, a 10/10 for those, the action sequences were excellent, and the ridiculous humor was laughable. the cinematography bothered me of being so dark.

Powerfully continues the emotional journey of Peter Parker,"Blockbuster sequels were notoriously tough to pull off before the superhero movie renaissance of the 2000s, and ""Spider-Man 2"" in 2004 was the very best follow-up we'd probably ever seen, with a number of the critics praising it more than Sam Raimi's original. Personally, I prefer the first ""Spider-Man,"" but there's no denying the sequel's many strengths.Ultimately, Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) personal journey elevates ""Spider-Man 2"" above everything that preceded it, unless of course you happen to have my personal attachment to the first film. Peter's struggle to reconcile himself and Spider-Man drives the core of the movie and it goes on quite the wild ride.Having come to the powerful realization that being Spider-Man comes with the cost of keeping distance between himself and the ones he loves, Peter finds his personal life in a downward spiral at the beginning of the film. He has been fired from his pizza delivery job and can't pay the rent, fallen behind on his schoolwork and his secret identity has caused a strain with his best friend, Harry (James Franco) who wants Spider-Man dead, as well as kept him from coming clean to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) about his uncle's death.Then there's Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the love of his life, who has moved on thanks to his peculiar way of being around her. When he fails to arrive on time to see MJ's play thanks to a crime-fighting pit stop, he realizes he has no part of his act together. Even his superpowers have been slipping up.Peter has advice coming at him from every which way, even his physician. The most profound advice, however, comes from Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whom Peter is writing a paper on. With Harry and Oscorp funding Octavius' fusion energy research, Peter gets to meet one of his idols. Octavius tells Peter that intelligence is a gift and not a privilege, and also drops some hints as to how important love and companionship are.But it's pride that causes things to go wrong with the doctor's experiment. When the energy becomes unstable, he refuses to shut it down and it results in his wife's death and the injury of others. He himself has four giant mechanical arms fused to his spine with no way to inhibit them from controlling his neural pathways. Dubbed Doctor Octopus, he becomes preoccupied with rebuilding his technology and fixing his ego, no matter the cost.Doc Ock presents a formidable challenge to Spider-Man and Molina does him justice, but the choice for Doctor Octopus seems arbitrary. His story never fully intertwines with Peter's, and his character development reduced to talking to himself. He simply could have been more of an example for Peter to learn from, but with the movie so focused on Peter's personal journey, not much else gets a fair shake, even if that character development is in fact what makes it so good.When Peter decides to stop being Spider-Man, it comes in the form of a second act when something that serious could've been a whole film. The script handles it well and Raimi truly brings us along with Peter's thought process, but it happens as an epiphany in the story and feels rushed. Consequently, Peter and MJ have so many changes in their feelings about each other throughout this movie that it could've been comical if not for the continued strength of Maguire and Dunst's performances.The romance wrenches as it did in the first film. The fact that these two can't find a way to be together absolutely kills and it drives up the emotional catharsis of the movie, playing a huge factor in why so many people love ""Spider-Man 2.""On the opposite side of things, the action is visually stunning, with props to the team behind Doc Ock's appendages. Even if the sequences don't have much of a role in driving the plot, they're fun to watch. Doctor Octopus' need to rebuild his machine drives all of them, which make his motives seem a little weak. The elevated subway train fight toward the end is the unquestioned highlight, but nothing necessitated a fight on a train. Still, it's an exhilarating sequence and the nice touch at its end involving Spider-Man's mask adds an extra something to the character development as well.""Spider-Man 2"" does an excellent job building off the first film's foundation, shooting the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character out of a canon now that we are familiar with him. The genius of the franchise to this point is that we're always on the same page with Peter's emotions and it doesn't change despite all the ups, downs and changes of heart that he endures in this installment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Best Superhero Movie Still,And just a great movie. Even if you don't like superheroes.Story is just great. Characters are great. Pacing is perfect. Visuals still look amazing.This movie is made with love.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hollywood, please STOP","I just finished watching this movie on DVD, (6 bucks, ""previously viewed"" but probably liberated from someplace) after hearing Roger Ebert describe it as 'the best superhero movie ever' on his childish and slightly overblown, ""best of"" show. Uh okay...... First off, it must be the stress of being shown up by his younger co-host, or perhaps its the subliminal messaging in the paramount mountain, or the effeminate moon-boy on the dream works logo that did it, maybe its a work related injury.. damage to the cerebrum from a job that forces him to watch every movie ever made for too many years to think about without going cuckoo even the carrot top movie that no one saw because it makes people jump out windows and force their dogs to drink ink. Wait, could it be that film critics/eunuch-ed movie geeks, are paid off by studios to say this stuff? I mean their are certain movie websites, not unlike this one which purely exist as a medium for jerks to promote their own films (or fawn over someone Else's, don't know which is worse...)Could it be that a misguided culture desperate to objectify and make money off anything has elevated these losers to celebrity stature, and they don't take their jobs seriously anymore? I mean how serious could you be, when you host a television show? Critics once evoked images of Dorothy parker et.AL literati, evaluating aesthetics, creativity, talent, these days they just suck up to powerful studios between Shampoo ads. Hmmmm. Buddha say meditate on this. I watched an interview with Todd Macfarlane who had plenty to say about comic books and corporate culture. He posed the question: why can't spider-man be black under his mask? Interesting. Film reflecting relevant social issues, note: someone please crucify him or at least deport him to Europe with the other 'weirdos'.Well, let's see why do black folks only get one superhero, and of course he comes from hell (spawn). Why do the ethnic superhero's have to avenge ghetto murders, why are their girlfriends dead or non existent? (ibid., the crow)? In short Mr. Macfarlane asks: why can't Superman eat watermelon for a change, Mr. Spielberg? Money & Politics, Todd. Whatever has the broadest appeal to the demographic is what's reflected on film, and to some extent it also serves as a way of perpetuating values of yesteryear with roots in racism, sexism, and sensational violence. These cookie cutter creations are supposed to be forgiven because they are admittedly somewhat entertaining, and of course they're, ""y'know a summer blockbuster"". This qualifier seems to mean that we're supposed to overlook how stupid the movie is, and just enjoy it, that is like a brain lesion triggering the aroma of burning toast, movie-houses awaken one's 5 year old inner child and ask us to abandon our standards and reason. I've been 5 years old before, and I think I'm ready for Hollywood to make some more 'mature' movies for a change, that don't require that I get drunk prior to viewing, in order to prevent throwing something at the screen. What ticked me off was the special features section on the DVD. It was illustrated to me how expensive this movie was and the neurotic attention to detail that went into making it. It seemed utterly absurd to me that these clearly educated and talented people (Laura Ziskin, and com-pats; minus the educated but including cute for some of the younger cast)could make such a predictable stupid movie. In fact why does Hollywood make such bad movies? Could it be that because as an audience we are to quick to say ""y'know its a summer blockbuster"", should we instead wake up and DEMAND more from these people? Sure we'll give you our dough, but how about hiring writers, and telling us a story we don't know? How about reflecting the world as it is, why not see people like, wow, us? Nope, instead studios have sold out a potentially artistic medium in order to stuff their pockets and ensure a spot at ""Promises"" and the DNC fund-raiser, in that order. I've officially stopped going to see movies I think cost too much, its immoral. Moreover, I won't pay a dime to watch the studio's chicken feed to the anesthetized masses, with their chalky and vapid stars, and insipid stories. I'm willing to bet that Ziskin and troupe, probably don't even watch their own movies. They're far too rich and Au currant to watch this junk, they're at the art-house cinemas, or their home cinemas? So who watches this stuff? Kids whose parents have to work late, and this stuff is like cyanide for the brain. Hollywood is corrupt, stop giving into their laziness and greed. Sure its entertaining, but don't kid yourself that something is really wrong with the fact that the only stuff that makes money is the fantastical escapism fare. I had read that the movie industry is at its peak during times of economic desperation, as was the case in the depression, there was a need to escape. Something is wrong when thats all a society's people want to do, i.e. television. Sure its okay to indulge in some eye candy as you slowly wean yourself off, like switching to menthol's to make your withdrawal easier. I'm just saying, demand more from the artistic community, and if they won't budge, at least wait for video or TV. Hope I'm not the only one out there! And oh yeah, its not the best superhero movie, its not even the best 'y'know summer blockbuster'. It didn't suck, its just stupid. ANd its sad that with all the resources they don't even try to do more, because its notnecessary that they do, little Timmy is in for merchandising and the price of admission, before the release date. Shame.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Set the standard for superhero movies,"From a filmmaking perspective, Spider-Man 2 is similar to its predecessor. The cast, Danny Elfman, and Sam Raimi all continue their great work in the series. However, Spider-Man 2 upgrades some key aspects. First, Raimi expresses more freedom due to his previous success as he increases his style here. Overall, the imagery is moderately better with more motion, creative shots, and dramatic sequences. This is exemplified by the scene where Doc Ock wreaks havoc on the hospital staff. That segment is reminiscent of Evil Dead and genuinely fun.Still, the most significant improvement is the script. Spider-Man 2 is brilliant because it's really a Peter Parker story. Much more time is spent with Toby Maguire than with his mask, making the movie very intimate. For the entire film, the protagonist struggles to live his dual life and loses himself to his secret identity. Real themes of responsibility and self-care are explored, pushing this beyond flashy entertainment. Furthermore, Maguire nails his conflicted character in a way that's rare for superhero movies. Fundamentally, Spider-Man 2 is special because it works as a drama first and the fantasy elements support that. Once again, this franchise sets the standard that echoes today.Writing: 8/10

Spidey spins a web of entertainment,"I liked it a lot. Much better than the first. However, I had a few problems with it.First and foremost, What is with him taking his mask off constantly? It's like half the city knew who he was after the movie. Secondly, he started to lose his powers because he was lovestruck and didn't want to be Spider-man anymore? Lastly, while I loved all of the character development and the fact the movie was more about Peter Parker than Spider-man - they went overboard with driving it in that his life sucked due to his responsibility of being the webslinger. At one point, I just let out a sigh of depression having to watch Peter go through so much s***. It didn't ruin the movie in any way, but I felt some editing might have been in order to relieve some of the unnecessary melancholy. Nothing that ruined the film - just a few things I would have done differently.As for the good points? A lot of 'em. The introduction credits were brilliant. Possibly the first time I've ever considered credits to be a contributing factor to the overall entertainment of a film. They were that well done. I wasn't a huge fan of the original movie due to some very cheesy dialogue. This time around it was a huge improvement. It retained the comic book feel while refraining to make me cringe. I think there were only a few lines I wanted to roll my eyes at, but held back because I was thoroughly enjoying the film. Major props in that aspect.The action scenes were awesome. Mainly the train scene. I could go into great detail on how much I enjoyed that scene, but the number of expletives needed may offend some. Orgasmic will have to suffice. The operating room scene was equally as impressive. Not in terms of overall excitement, but in that it accomplished expressing the terror these AI constructed arms were. I've never seen the Evil Dead series, but have read this particular scene was influenced by Raimi's previous work in said series. I will certainly have to give those films a look.Humor. The film had it in spades and I'm very hard to amuse in that regard. Most humor in films pass me by without the hint of a smile, but Spider-man used it effectively and there were several times I even gave a chuckle. J.J. was spot on. Absolutely hilarious and JK Simmons was able to pull of the character from the comics in stride. The elevator scene was another one of my favorites and I wish it hadn't been spoiled for me in one of the various commericals on the TV.A lot of people seem to have complaints with Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary Jane. I agree to an extent. She didn't seem like she was putting much effort into the role - at least not as much as the first film. This is certainly not the MJ we know from the comics, but it doesn't detract too much. Her last scene in the film makes up for the shortcomings previous to it. Molina was good as Doc Ock, but hardly a standout as some reviews have claimed. It was his tentacles that were the villain in this film and I can't say I didn't enjoy the different approach to the character. As far as Harry goes - I think with his limited development in the film, he came off as being needlessly whiny. We all know why, but it's hard to really care. Either they spend a good deal of time with his character in the 3rd film or limit the significance of his findings. I have mixed feelings of him being the 'main' villain in the next film.Well, I could go on and on about all the different things I liked about the movie. It really was a big surprise for me after only semi liking the first one. I think I'll watch the first film again to see if there is any new found appreciation after having seen the excellent sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Charming and a fun time!,"I like this movie, its not a subversive masterpiece or anything like that, its just a fun movie with emotion. But i do think that the first one was better. Almost everyone is unlikeable in the movie, aunt may is unlikeable, harry is unlikeable, mj is an unlikeable and other. People say this movie is a masterpiece and greatest achievement in humanity, but its just a good movie. People say its more darker than the first but I would say its more mature not exactly dark. I love dr octopus but still not better than the green goblin, i like peter and him trying to save people, not as spiderman, but as himself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maybe I was just tired that day,"Or maybe it was the build up-hype from everyone who had seen the movie before me. I would recommend you watch the movie but with the fast forward button at the ready. The movie is overly long. The special effects are excellent. But the story line is a bit long and a bit ragged in my opinion. But then again we are talking about a million dollar cartoon/comic hero here. I have been reading Spiderman comics since was I able to read (more years then I am putting down here) and the movie does a much better job bringing you that world (as did Spiderman I) then the HULK. But I do think the movie could have been edited down almost 30 minutes and you would not have lost any of the main points of the story. Spiderman is the peoples hero because he is a lot more like us then the Supderdude or many other heros are. Nice touch of setting up Spidey III towards the end but was this movie really better then Spiderman I? I also find it very interesting that as of to date most of the Marvel movies have made a point of staying away from the ""supernatural"" occult side of the comic stories. Not that this would bring that much more to the movie. My two cents watch the movie if you have not but do not be surprised that you feel like there was something missing when you finish the viewing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best one in the series,This film is definitely the best one in the series.

I was really impress of how amazing this film is it was great it's even better than the amazing spider man 2 that was not so amazing at all this is the real spider man movie we wanted to watch oh yes it is great acting great everything and the new villain is cool yes this film is a miracle better just a great film such a good film that will make you shine and this film is a very good movie to go on a date with and also a great film to eat pizza so yeah go watch spider man 2 it's definitely a true masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really? Anyone LIKED that movie?? Why?,"This is my personal opinion, and I respect other opinions of course.I really hated the first movie, an I thought they would produce a better second part. But I was very disappointed.Tobey Maguire is not a good Spidey. I'm still thinking of who I would like to see in that costume. Suggestions?Alfred Molina is a big laugh as a bad guy. Is he, let's say, demonic? Were we afraid of him? And if not, did we feel sympathy for him? No. Look how he looks in his ""costume"", bare-naked, just one big laugh. Willem Dafoe in his 2-minute appearance looked far more scary!I'm sure that now everyone in New York (in the Movie) knows Spideys true identity. I couldn't stop laughing when he showed his face to the passengers in the Subway Train without a reason (Why did he pull of his mask there? No one knows). Count the minutes when Spidey wears a maski in Part 2. 5 Minutes?Every two minutes the film shows us what a loser Peter parker is. On and on and on ... we knew that after 10 Minutes, so stop those bullshit of letting him fall down, lose his job, getting nothing to drink at the Party (3 times!) ... The method of repeating something is used too much in here.He is a coward. Tobey/Spidey is shown as a coward with no balls. Look at Spidey in the Comics, always talking fancy and fighting bravely against the bad. Here he is shown as a wimp.Cliffhanger, we love you! Part 3 - Return of the Green Goblin ... Wow! What a story... Never heard before... I'm interested to see how that comes to nothing.The only funny character was Jonah Jameson and the Guy from ""Evil Dead"" in the theatre.But if you all liked it, thats OK for me. I mourned for my money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More Octopus,"This was a fun flick, but just not as fun as it could be. Octopus, only referred to once by his new name, and mostly called Octavious, was awesome, and should be commended for a wonderful acting job and the computer generation people should take themselves out to dinner. But the plot seemed to revolve primarily around Spidey's psychological drama. Its almost like Spiderman: The Lifetime Special. (one out of every 10 spidermen suffer from depression.) (anyone who watches made for Lifetime Movies will get that joke.) Anyway, to sum up - More Octopus - especially fighting Spiderman. Less MJ, she's a downer, and she brings Spiderman down with her.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent movie, with almost no negatives, if there any","This movie starts off right where the first one left off. Peter Parker continues saving people as Spider-Man, however the misunderstood Doctor Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Oc is standing in his way and is backed by Harry Osbourne, who is still extremely mad at Spider-Man for killing his father, Norman.Peter faces all the hardships of a superhero, watching Mary Jane off with Jonah Jameson's son, John and watching his best friend Harry Osbourne drink himself into a frenzy. Eventually he has a tough choice to make; stop being Spider-Man and live a normal life while the city crime rates soar, or continue as Spider-Man and watch his social life go down the toilet. Doc Oc also looms in the wake, attempting an experiment that could destroy th city. More than one secrets are revealed and those secrets and who they are revealed to may surprise you.Definitely a great performance by Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and solid directing job by Sam Raimi. The special effects are very good and they do an excellent job during the fight scenes. Great all-around movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely a good sequel...,"I opted to sit down and watch the 2004 movie ""Spider-Man 2"" once again her in 2024, right after having watched the 2002 movie ""Spider-Man"" as well. Of course I've seen director Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel before, a couple of times actually, but it has been many, many years since the last time.So it was a nice return to the early Marvel movies, and I have to admit that the storyline in ""Spider-Man 2"" was, and actually still is, as good as the storyline in the previous movie. So writers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Michael Chabon and Alvin Sargent definitely put together and enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline.It was nice to see Tobey Maguire return to don the mantle of Spider-Man once again. And just like two years earlier, he did it with grace and really carried the movie and the character. ""Spider-Man 2"" also has Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J. K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris returning to reprise their characters, which was nice. And Alfred Molina definitely was a nice casting choice for Doc Ock / Dr. Otto Octavius. There were some other nice faces on the cast list, with the likes of Elya Baskin and Daniel Dae Kim. And, of course it was a treat to have Bruce Campbell himself return to the movie, even if just for a brief moment and also Willem Dafoe.Needless to say that the acting performances in the movie were good.Visually then ""Spider-Man 2"" was good. The CGI effects were a tad better than the first ""Spider-Man"" movie, but still there are some effects that shows signs of not aging well, as the movie is 20 years old already. But all in all, the effects were suitable for the movie taking into consideration when it was made, and still holds up fairly well today.If you haven't watched ""Spider-Man 2"", then you should do so. But you should sit down and watch the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" movie first in order to fully understand some of the events in the sequel.All in all, a great sequel with a lot of enjoyable moments to it. And it certainly is a movie that you can watch again and again.My rating of ""Spider-Man 2"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The best of the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" trilogy!","After the commercial box-office success and critical success of the 2002 film, Sam Raimi signed on to direct two sequels and the actors from the first film signed on to two other films. On June 30, 2004, a sequel titled, SPIDER-MAN 2 was released to box office success and critical acclaim, receiving a 94% on RottenTomatoes.com.Set two years after the events of the last film, this film focuses on Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man, while Dr. Otto Octavious becomes diabolical following a failed experiments and his wife's death.He uses his mechanical tentacles for threaten and endanger the lives of New York City's residents. Spider-Man must stop him from annihilating the city.This film along with ""The Dark Knight"", is considered being one of the best superhero films ever made and this film is really amazing. The dialogue is so amazing in this film and it was really amazing to hear some of the stuff all of the characters and Mary Jane & Peter's relationship is really cool.The CGI in this film is really amazing and spectacular and I could have not been more happier with what they did. The fights between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man was well done and the fight choreograpaher really did a great job in this film with those action sequences.The acting is amazing, but James Franco is just completely crazy and really bad in this film. Thankfully, the next film makes up for this. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are really good as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Alfred Molina plays Dr. Otto Octavious / Doc Ock and he was amazing. Willem Dafoe also plays the role of Harry's late father and he is not in the film that much.This film has one of the greatest endings ever made and this film is just freaking amazing.Overall, I love SPIDER-MAN 2 and I'm giving this a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman returns!,"Finally the web slinging hero is back for new adventures. This new movie happens roughly two years after the events of the last movie. We can see Peter Parker in turmoil as he tries but fails to balance his life as Spiderman, his relationship with Mary Jane and his failing finances. This is not the only thing that is troubling our young hero as a new menace in the form of Otto Octavius who is instantly turned into Doctor Octopus because of a horrible accident the fuses four robotic arms to his body.If you were expecting more action on this film then the previous one then you will surely be disappointed. The action is restricted to probably a quarter of the film concentrated on the end. Well it sure does make up for the better screenplay compared to the next. More of the love story angle than the conflict between hero and villain. Yes this movie is more a love story than an action/adventure film.Most of the characters have indeed developed in between films and will continue to do so as you watch the film. The most drastic change happens to Peter as he continues to grasp his new life of normal guy/superhero. Here we see him develop as he faces more trials. The only thing that I found quite disappointing with the story of Doctor Octopus which was given less emphasis unlike the first movie. In that movie, we can see the development of Norman Osborne from peaceful father to the maniacal Green Goblin. In this movie we see less of this. Just a short encounter with Dr. Octavius before transforming into Doc Ock.Well in this day and age of high technology computers that produce effects that were once thought impossible I was not that impressed with the effects of this film. I guess it was really a case of 'oh I've seen this before'. Not taking anything away from the effects people the effects were good but nothing extraordinary.Well overall the movie did not disappoint me but it also wasn't that amazing either. With a sequel guaranteed, perhaps in the third film the director can do some adjustments so that the film can be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Web Spinning,"""Spider-Man 2"" is almost entirely an improvement upon the 2002 original. There are several fine threads, and although not all of its limbs are followed through, there is some consistency, from the level of the characters' double lives up to the meta-narrative constructions.Most of the nested stories involve some web of lies being unmasked. There's the truth behind the story of Uncle Ben's death between Peter and Aunt May. For Harry, there's the secret of Spiderman's identity and the mask of the Green Goblin. Doc Ock is lied to by his mechanical limbs. There's the love story between Peter and Mary Jane, which remains unrequited because of the secret identity. Like Clark Kent, Peter also works for a newspaper that gives a meta-narrative about the superhero to the outer story of the superhero that is the movie; except, here, it's a tabloid that lies about Spiderman's heroism. And Mary Jane is a stage actress who performs in, of all plays, Oscar Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Get it? It's quite the balancing act that the filmmakers managed to put this all together so well--even though some parts don't quite fit, such as the suggested attraction the landlord's daughter has for Peter.Another part of the cinematic template here seems to have been ""Superman II"" (1980), which also involved a superhero sacrificing his powers to pursue his love interest before, in the Donner Cut at least, a father figure from beyond the grave guided him back to being a savior (although Aunt May's speech here is even more decisive, which, I suppose is more akin to the theatrical cut of ""Superman II""). The train sequence even includes Spiderman in the Christ crucifixion pose twice over--during the heroism and, again, when he's lifted by the passengers--which is more obvious than the corresponding bus scene in ""Superman II,"" if not the Trinitarian talk about ""the son becomes the father and the father becomes the son,"" but not so blatant as the Christ allegories in, say, ""Superman Returns"" (2006) or ""Man of Steel"" (2013).Moreover, there's more of the ""Spydercam"" or swooping camerawork than in the first movie; plus, the rest of the picture is better composed, too. There's no more of ""The Matrix""-style bullet-time photography and Neo-like moves for Spidey like last time. There's no more of the steady static shots here on a static-masked villain like the Green Goblin, either. Indeed, the villain here is a total improvement (which credits the argument that the success of a superhero movie largely depends on its supervillain), and while there's still more Goblin stuff being set up, it's mercifully subjected here to subplot, as opposed to what happened in the disastrous third movie. Even when Spidey isn't swinging between buildings, there's a sense this time that the film is still moving at a lively pace--whether innovative editing, the odd freeze-frame or slow-motion shot, the Spidey-sense shots or cutting and shooting based on Doc Ock's thundering approach. I love the use of ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" in the score. It also helps that the action set pieces are excellent. I even like the cartoonish look of the bank robbery, what with the bags full of coins and an elderly woman being thrown around like a rag doll. The CGI of the first movie, on the other hand, bothered me some for its cartoon appearance. Not so here. Doc Ock's limbs look fine, including in a horror-film-inspired scene; Spidey actually looks rather human performing much of his acrobatics and even more human when he fails to perform them; and the train sequence is fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just as hackneyed as the first Spider-Man,"This movie was not that great. The screenplay sounded as if it was written by two different people with very different views of how the movie should be. Some parts of the script are so hackneyed that I thought I would vomit, (i.e. when Aunt May gives her three minute monologue on how ""there's a hero in all of us."" That scene alone seemed to last for an hour.)The performances from Maguire and Franco were mediocre and not close to their potential as actors, (see Maguire in the Ice Storm, or Wonder Boys). Dunst does an OK job as Mary Jane, but the part doesn't seem to hard. The only saving graces were the superb special effects, and the great performance of Molina as Doc Ock. But just like the first movie, this one ends with a sequel in mind, so I guess I'll go see that one too, and hope that the Spider-Man franchise lives up to its potential.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enter Dr. Octopus!,"I have never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man movie, but I have to agree that its sequels, especially 'Spider-Man 3' have finally won me over. I've been a Spider-Man fan for a rather long time, but the Green Goblin has always been, to me at least, the lamest villains in Spider-Man's villains galore. Dr. Octopus isn't really the coolest one in the bunch either, but growing up I kinda liked him and his movie incarnation presented a nice multi-level character.The second Spider-Man has the convincing CGI effects but is also miles more interesting and comedy-packed than its predecessor, which is why I liked it so much. Though some parts of it are borderline cheesy there's enough to keep the film grounded.Only the middle-part of the film seemed horridly stretched out and a little boring though its nice to present Spider-Man having problems. I also wasn't irked by the revelation of his identity to a number of individuals, but in some places the film just seemed to lose its pace at times.However, the film undoubtedly has all the right ingredients of a great film. It doesn't compare to Spider-Man 3 in terms of plot, but it definitely has a memorable cast and is in most ways superior to the first one. Definitely recommendable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We get it....he's a flawed superhero.,"In my opinion Spiderman 2 is a very average movie.  Parts of it I liked very much.  Other aspects I couldn't stand.  The main reason people seem to be praising this movie so much is that it focuses more on Peter Parker than Spiderman and creates a real human character going through the same day to day troubles we all have.  I feel that the movie goes too far with this concept.  By the time Peter is failing in school, unlucky in love, living in a bad apartment and unlucky with his laundry, I was just tired of it.  We understand already!!!The main plot point there is that Peter is unlucky in love.  First of all, he has a model/actress madly in love with him.  I would hate to have that problem.  Second of all, the daughter of his landlord seemed very interested in Peter also.  Show me a superhero who still can't get girls.  Then I'll be interested.Another problem I had with this movie is the supposedly superior CGI work. My only response to this is that there are shots in the movie that downright look like screenshots from a video game.The third problem that I have is a combination of the dialogue and Kirsten Dunst's acting.  I don't really know who to blame for this, so I'll combine the two.  People joke about Christopher Reeve's ability to make you believe his ""truth, justice, and American way"" comment from the original Superman. All I can say is that I didn't get that same feeling from ""go get 'em, Tiger.""Where this movie succeeds is with Spiderman himself.  Spiderman swinging through the streets of Manhattan is one of my favorite things to ever appear on a movie screen.  It's exhilirating to watch.  I also enjoyed the lighter moments such as the elevator scene, and I liked the fact that other people saw Peter with the suit on, but no mask.The fights with Doc Ock are satisfactory, but I would expect more if this is ""the best superhero movie of all time.""Overall, this an average superhero movie.  Not as good as the first Spiderman, not as good as the first two Supermans, but better than any Batman.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"too much, too fast","Before I get crucified for not praising this film, I want to say that I found it to be very entertaining, and I'm not sorry I saw it.But be warned. I felt that this movie lacked the focus on character and plot that the first one had. In fact, I think it lacked focus, period. Maybe I'm being a little pretentious, but I thought the pacing of the film was totally off for the first hour of the film. Characters like MJ, Harry, and Aunt May are just thrown in without having anything but a few one-dimensional lines to say. The trailer leads you to think that Harry and MJ play major roles in this movie: they don't. Not to mention that one of the big problems for spider-man (I can't say what, but you'll see) is never really explained, and seems totally unnecessary in the first place. Also, I thought the CG effects were more obvious in this film (especially the first shot of Spidey...he looks like a video game character!)So what was good about it? Well, the Doctor Octopus character and storyline are developed nicely (it's one of the few things the movie takes time on). Alfred Molina is endearing, with one of the best performances in the movie. Tobey McGuire does a good job as well, and JK Simmons (JJ) is given much more screen time. Oh, and the scene with Bruce Campbell is great.Also, despite their CGI-ness, the action scenes are better than the first movie's.Bottom line: if you want action and excitement (what it does well), I think you'll be pleased. If you want anything else, you may be a little disappointed. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent sequel,"I went to my local cinema to see this film about a year ago with my grandma who went with me, i didn't think i would like it that much because i didn't understand the first one very well but i just wanted to get out of the house. But i loved it with its fantastic special effects ,great action scenes, great super villain, great super hero great acting and a dash of humour. Something for everyone even my grandma sat there enjoying every single minute of it. After the film finished i came out of the cinema thinking WOW what a great film i wanted it on DVD when it first came out i didn't get it then and i still haven't got it but i saw it at the Imax and that was the ultimate experience. 10/10 a must for fans of the first or if you're bored and need something to entertain you.

Eensy-weensy bit better than #1,"With action sequences that drive the plot, a sense of humour and a better villain, this is a vast improvement over its undeservedly successful predecessor.I don't agree that the characters are getting any deeper - we're just seeing more of them. If Mary-Jane loves Peter so much, why's she always flouncing around with other blokes? I think we all get that with great power comes great responsiblah-blah-blah; what I want to know is: why do Spidey's webshooters keep misfiring? It seems to happen when he's suffering from self-doubt, so it must be a Freudian thing.Spidey 2 also suffers from Hollywood's latest ailment - multiple tacked-on endings (see also Minority Report, The Bourne Identity, LOTR: The Return Of The King).

A Fantastic Sequel,"Next in my Spider-Man Review series comes Spider-Man 2 and I re-watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set 2 years after the first and sees Peter Parker struggling in balancing his life when a new threat comes to New York.Main Character
Tobey Maguire is great as both Peter Parker & Spider-Man. I actually think he is better in this film then he was in the original, his character goes through a real arc as both Parker and Spider-Man and that can sometimes be a real difficult thing to balance in a film like this. He is still to this day known for his portrayal of the character and that is due to his great work, I think especially in this film.Supporting Characters
Alfred Molina plays Dr Otto Octavius and he is fabulous in this film, as Doctor Octopus he is one of the better comic book villains we have seen on screen. He also has a real character arc and Molina really cares about this performance which ranks him up and easily raises this overall film higher up. James Franco gets a bigger role in the film and I actually liked the way the film took Harry Osbourne, his lust to get revenge on Spider-Man is well handled and saw him through his own story in the film. Kirsten Dunst is back as MJ and again I thought she was fine, I felt like the dynamic between her and Maguire was better in this film and I thought she was better written though not perfect and I will give her the benefit of the doubt here. A real scene stealer is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, they give him more to do in this film and he is amazing, I couldn't stop laughing watching him and as I said in my previous review he is one of the best castings ever made.Story
The story is really effective in this film and that is because it takes more care with its characters and focuses less on the whole relationship dynamic on the film. It balances Spider-Man & Peter Parker really well and characters like Harry & Doc Ock are really given interesting arcs that get you invested in the film. It balances the narrative well and I really was invested in pretty much everything, even the not amazing romance.Script
The script is also better in this film, it isn't as cheesy as the previous. The drama is interesting, with the characters written better. I also found myself laughing more watching this film and that is a credit on the balance that is achieved with this film.Style
The action scenes are really great, I mean the train sequence alone is one of the greatest comic book action sequences ever made. Seeing Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man clash is really exciting and feels completely different from the action scenes in the previous film. But this film has one issue and that is with tone, it is a bit all over the place, with dark moments and really cheesy moments. It isn't the biggest issue in the world but it is here and holds it back from getting my top score.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic film. It raises the stakes and delivers on a great superhero action film that should be seen.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just another ultra standard mainstream blockbuster,"I found Spiderman 1 a pretty bad flick, because of uninvolving characters, but this sequel manages to be somewhat better. Yet it manages to still be an average mainstream blockbuster which lacks imagination. The plot is simple, the love story is geared towards teenagers, and most characters borderline caricatural.Near the middle of the film, my friends and I were starting to get bored actually, although it's quite fun to chase all the incoherences in the realization. There are numerous of them. For example, the car on which Peter Parker falls from the top of a building is left intact. Or the suit that he throws in the middle of the street is miraculously clean and ironed 5 minutes after. But that's the privilege of super heroes I guess. The kitchen ""fusion"", though, looks pretty ridiculous and unrealistic (if a spherical plasma was stable, why would the physicists bother to make them toric ? not mentioning its magical magnetic properties).Anyway, these are still minor details in such a movie even though such details can make a difference. The most annoying thing, though, is the lack of originality in just about everything, from the script to dialogues (the little aunt who delivers another over-the-top speech on how the world needs super heroes) to situations (the passengers of the train carrying the body of Spiderman is pretty ridiculous, the whole train scene actually looks ridiculous and hardly believable) to film-making itself.Nothing really bad, but nothing outstanding either. Just another blockbuster that fits in the long series of average Marvel Comics adaptations we've had so far : Batman & Robin, Xmen, Daredevil, Captain America, and coming Catwoman, Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer. But certainly not the masterpiece that is hailed by IMDb users.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Superhero Film Ever!,"Two years have passed for Peter Parker, established in his role as college student...and as a crime fighter. He can't keep up at school, pay his rent or make amends with his estranged best friend Harry, who wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane is more skeptical than ever of the man in her life. Peter's idol, a renowned scientist named Otto Octavius, resurfaces following a failed fusion experiment. Peter, at times noticing he's losing some of his powers, and is feeling the effects of the stress in his personal life, realizes he must decide between being who he once was or retaining his secret identity to stop ""Doc Ock"" and save New York City.From a disappointment from the first film of this series, I was quite relieved that this film is not only a lot better, it's the best superhero film ever made! There are much more love for the characters in here and the character development. There is also an emotional core throughout the entire film and it's not your regular superhero film.There's a lot of drama in this film, not only from Peter choosing a life to take, but he also has to beat the bad guy, and tries to tell Mary Jane that he loves her. I mean, it's not all about the action in here. The action sequences are much bigger and better in this film with nice CGI to top some of the most exhilarating action sequences.Tobey Maguire's acting is better, as well as Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. The villain, played by Alfred Molina, also does a very good job playing a creepy antagonist. There's one scene with him in it that was filled with tension, like a horror movie. Again, the score is also fantastic.This is the best superhero film ever made! It gives you the fantastic characters, great action sequences, it's emotional, suspenseful, and exhilarating as an entertaining film!

"Not a huge disappointment from the first, but a gigantic disappointment from the hype!","I had low expectations when this movie came out, as I was very disappointed by the first film. I don't enjoy Tobey Maguire as a rule, and he overplayed the nerd without any hint of the cocky brashness that defines Spidey in the comics (when in costume). Spidey's swinging through Manhattan looked awful, the Green Goblin looked like a Power Ranger, and Dafoe chewed scenery with gleeful abandon. Just not a good movie.So I didn't bother with part 2 in the theater, even though the reviews were uniformly excellent. I figured I would wait for the DVD, and did so. Part 2 is almost an exact rehash of part 1 for me. Peter's got powers, but is horribly put upon to use them for good. Peter loves Mary Jane, but can't tell her, and she runs into the arms of another. Peter befriends a rich scientist who experiments on himself, his invention goes wrong, giving him special powers and driving him insane. In a tough situation, the people of New York stand up for their hero. It's the same $%#&^ story!!I thought the attempts at humor were contrived (although I did enjoy Raimi regular Bruce Campbell's turn as the usher, and the landlord was pretty funny as well), and the broom closet scene lasted about three times as long as it needed to. The love story is ridiculous. First of all, in what I thought was an impossible feat, the cinematographer made Kirsten Dunst positively unattractive. For that matter, Maguire looked awful too. I know he's supposed to be a geeky teenager, but would a little pancake makeup have been too much to ask? Dunst has never been much of an actress, and nothing changed here. She and Maguire both have their eyes half-lidded the entire movie, making me want to fall asleep along with them.The villain was once again overacted to high heaven. The exposition as he realizes the arms are controlling him made me laugh out loud. Let's not even deal with the absurdity of controlling a fusion reaction in the open air, or why he suddenly felt the need to use the robotic arms for EVERYTHING, including taking off his glasses. I was actually relieved to see Dafoe pop back up - that's how bad Molina was.Now for the special effects. This is what saved it from being a complete disaster. The Spidey-swings were MUCH better, and there were some nice sequences where they transitioned from CGI to live pretty seamlessly. And Doc Ock's arms were very well done. They did seem to have a mind of their own. I'd give it an 8 for effects (well below the LOTR trilogy, about on a par with the X-Men movies), but a 3 for everything else. Let's call it a 5 overall.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Second verse, same as the first.","After a superb set of opening credits that artfully recap the prequel, ""Spider-Man 2"" (""S2"") picks up two years after the original left off, although the elapsed time is barely noticed. Among the familiar characters, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) is fighting through college and criminals; Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is starring in a Broadway play; and Harry Osborn (James Franco), who still blames Spider-Man for his father's death, is running OsCorp. The company is aiding Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) in his attempt to create a form of fusion that produces perpetual energy. You can probably guess what soon happens.As is often the case, this sequel has lost some of the novelty that carried the original. There are only so many ways Spidey can swing through skyscraper canyons, although a couple new twists do elicit oohs and aahs. In place of that originality are human emotions that expound upon what Peter was battling at the end of the first movie. As in the ""Batman"" films, this humanity makes ""S2"" better; in this case, better than the original.Despite this humanity, and also addressing great movie themes like love, revenge, courage, and destiny, ""S2"" falls short of greatness, largely because of how those themes are addressed. Too often longish dialogue scenes are used to explain the inner conflicts of characters, rather than pictures and actions. The pace change isn't a problem, but the heavy-handedness is. Perhaps for once the audience was underestimated. We know that the Marvel comics are supposed to touch on themes beyond the action, and don't need them to be force-fed. Especially with a quality actor like Maguire, we can see the inner conflict, and that is enough. We don't need Aunt May's five minute speech filled with double meanings.Peter's main issue is how to be ""normal"" while fighting crime. Primary amongst his concerns and the movie's plot is his love for MJ, because the ones he loves are constantly in danger from his enemies. But alas, due to the emphasis of the trite romantic story, the most interesting relationship of the movie, between Peter and Harry, is disappointingly (although understandably) under-developed. Young Osborn can't let go of his father's death. Because Peter is Spider-Man's personal photographer, their friendship is constantly strained, made more complicated by the plot progression. That is a very unique situation that I wish had been explored more deeply. But unfortunately, their relationship may not be further fleshed out until the third installment, which promises to be the best one yet.I'm generally a fan of the superhero genre, but neither this movie nor its predecessor connected with me. Part of the reason is derived from the typical storyline. Not once during the course of the movie was I particularly surprised by anything. Part of the reason was Kirsten Dunst, whose performance in a cliché role wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. She tries just a bit too hard, as though in an objective role, attempting to nail the part, rather than be the part. My personal bottom line though is that Spider-Man simply doesn't do it for me. I can't fully explain it; that's just how it is. Fortunately the overall craftsmanship of the movie, including quality performances from Maguire, Franco, and Molina, is good enough to overshadow those issues.Although not perfect, the special effects mesh nicely with the comic book nature that director Sam Raimi has created. The visuals add to the almost cartoonish edge without distracting from the reality. Danny Elfman (Men in Black) has again composed an excellent score for an comic-based movie. His syncopated tunes, rife with percussive orchestral notes, provides enjoyable background music while appropriately accompanying the action. In sum, the world of Spider-Man is now established, and all hands are very comfortable with their work, as evidenced by the uniform look.Much like the original, ""S2"" is a good solid superhero movie, easy to watch and filled with action and melodrama. I didn't like it as much as many critics and fans, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you spend $10 and two hours on ""Spider-Man 2"".Bottom Line: Good, not great. Some will love it, but Spider-man just doesn't do it for me. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Does Whatever a Spider Can,"After Spider-Man's success there were naturally high hopes for its sequel. Raimi showed with the Evil Dead trilogy that he knows how to tweak and develop a continuation within his films. That turns out to be one of the films strongest suits, it continues to grow and build onto the themes established in the first film whilst adding new layers of material. By this second outing Raimi and his cast are so comfortable in their roles that it does become a genuinely enjoyable film. The film is often claimed to be the best of the trilogy and that is something I'd have to agree with. It's far from perfect and shares some of its predecessor's flaws, but when it hits the right notes it is great entertainment.Story: Peter's struggle to balance his two lives hits breaking point when his powers appear to be fading and Mary Jane becomes engaged to someone else. Elsewhere a failed fusion experiment leaves scientist Otto Octavius psychologically damaged and with four mechanical arms, which he uses in an attempt to recreate the experiment. I was really impressed by how well the film balanced out both of these stories, giving them appropriate time and space to breathe. I certainly think Peter's emotional journey is one of the films highlights and there is a great deal of emotion to those scenes. It's also nice that Doctor Octopus isn't simply a mad man, but a very intelligent and conflicted person with his instability causing his actions.Hero: Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter here. He sells every emotion with subtlety and makes some shaky dialogue sound very natural. There is an honesty and warmth in his performance which makes the Peter so endearing. His Spider-Man suffers in comparison as he does lack wit and confidence, but I still think he does okay in the suit and it still manages to fit the character.Villain: Alfred Molina is a standout as Octavius because he balances both sides of the character to perfection. At first he's very thoughtful and charming, but after the accident there is a ruthlessness and cunning that he manages to get across with his expressions alone. By giving the character so many dimensions it makes it easier to be invested in his struggle.Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane and brings charm to the role, yet the character is frustrating. Her anger at Peter's apparent lack of support is understandable, but she once again becomes a plot device for Peter to rescue. It's annoying by this point. James Franco is fine as a more vengeful Harry Osborn, even if he does overplay the part at times. Rosemary Harris is a great Aunt May and her elegant delivery gives the dialogue a real zest. J. K. Simmons is simply wonderful as Jameson, his comic timing is perfect and he delivers constant laughs whenever on screen.Action: The action sequences are much improved over the first film. We again get plenty of shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city and intervening in police chases, with the refined CGI adding intensity to those pieces. Both the climax and the fight at the bank were well constructed. The highlight however is certainly the train sequence. It's a fight that is both wildly creative and appropriately hard-hitting with a great deal at stake for our hero.Music: Danny Elfman's score is more of the same. It lacks any new sounds, but it definitely fits the films tone and always provides the correct amount of bombast or calmness.Production: Sam Raimi directs the film with a flair and imagination that surpasses his work on the original film. He captures the vastness of the city well and gives an identity to a lot of the places we end up visiting. Visually the film is very impressive too, with a great number of scenes resembling images you would expect to find on the comic book page (Peter discarding his suit being just one of them). The writing and tone is where the film really splits for me. Much of the material involving Peter's struggles with Mary Jane and the guilt he feels over Uncle Ben's death is excellent, both in its acting and the grace with which it is pulled off. The scenes that Peter and Aunt May share are always so naturalistic. However, the film has too many ill-fitting or goofy moments that clash with the more honest tone. Peter has to deliver some really bad lines, his interactions with Harry get more clichéd throughout and even the Mary Jane dilemma feels weak by the end. The also extras have to be mentioned as I have no idea what's going on with them. It feels like way too many get unnecessary screen time and they all seem to act in a stilted, robotic way that is extremely unnatural.Conclusion: Spider-Man 2 is an example of a film that improves upon the previous film and adds onto what that film was trying to get across, but it doesn't quite reach the heights that it could have reached. My issues with the film are nearly all down to writing and tone. The film does have a playfulness and sense of fun that frequently works well with its more sober moments, yet it pushes itself into silliness a few times too many and that dilutes some of the more serious material. I certainly think Raimi's direction is as stimulating as ever, whilst the action is better and the acting (especially from Molina and Maguire) is impressive all round. It's by no means flawless, but I do think it's a very entertaining entry and one that is easy to get wrapped up in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than the first Spiderman, but still fairly unimpressive","Spiderman is back and he's kicking butt. Unfortunately, his alter-ego Peter Parker (Maguire) is having a hard time multi-tasking and everything in his life is suffering. He is failing in college, he can't hold down a job, his aunt is losing her house, and (seemingly most important to Peter) while he's Spiderman he can't romance Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). To make matters worse, Harry Osborn, (Franco) Parker's best friend, keeps harassing Peter to tell him where he can find Spiderman so he can avenge his father. When Parker's school career comes down to a paper that he is writing on Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), Parker is delighted when Osborn offers to introduce the two, since his company is funding Octavius' research. The two strike up a repoire, but unfortunately, the next day an experiment in fusion goes horribly wrong and Octavius ends up with four metal limbs with minds of their own fused to his spine. Because he has lost everything, (including his mind) Octavius (now known as Doc Ock) goes on a mission to redo the experiment, wreaking havoc on the city along the way. Meanwhile, Parker has decided to give up his double life so that he can concentrate on his life, so he has to make some tough decisions about his future, and the future of Spiderman.When I saw the first ""Spiderman"", I was entertained but I wasn't amazed. I found the effects to be too cartoonish, and the story to be pretty lacking. In the case of ""Spiderman 2"" I found the story to be better and more compelling (the amount of conflict that arose was decent) and the special effects were definitely better, but again, I was less than amazed. I certainly didn't see the need for it to be on the IMDb Top 250 list, and it doesn't surprise me that it has fallen off, but from the reviews (both professional and from friends) I read and heard I expected a lot more. The acting was about on par with most action films; meaning it was okay but not great. (Although I still can't stand Kirsten Dunst.) Unfortunately, the best actor in the film was woefully underused, which was a disappointment mainly because he was the villain. Alfred Molina is a fantastic character actor and I think that he could have really made the role of Doc Ock great if he had only been given a sufficient amount of screen time. He didn't get to chew the scenery as much as Dafoe did in the first ""Spiderman"" film, and I think the movie suffered for it.While the story was better this time around, and the special effects didn't make me cringe at times, I'm still unimpressed by this franchise. Considering I'm a fan of Raimi's other work, and I used to read Spiderman in comic form I think I should be a little more excited with the film than I am.

Spidey Spins his Web,"Spider-Man 2 is a rare thing, a sequel that improves on the original in almost every way. Sequels tend to jump straight into the action; the characters after all, have already been developed in the original movie. Spider-Man 2 smartly eschews this rule, allowing for almost as much character development as in the first film. The result is a truly beautiful motion picture.Spider-Man 2 begins some time after the first movie. Spider-Man's real life persona, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a wreck. Fired from his job, falling behind in school, unable to pay his rent and out of touch with his friends Peter struggles with the duality of being Spider-Man.Meanwhile, the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is working feverishly to complete his latest project: a fusion reaction meant to provide a perpetual energy source. He conducts his project under the Oscorp Corporation, now led by Peter's best friend Harry Osborne (James Franco), who unbeknownst to Harry himself, is the son of deceased Spider-Man villain The Green Goblin. To complete the fusion, Octavius fits a set of artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles into his spine; these tentacles are prevented from controlling Octavius because of a tiny chip he has implanted into his neck. The fusion of course, goes awry, turning the respectable Octavius into the evil ""Doc Ock"".This sequence sets up the remainder of the movie, as Spider-Man must stop the villain from terrorizing the city, while he battles his own demons.This is where director Sam Raimi succeeds. The battles are fast-paced and shot from neat angles, with bright colours abound. An over-reliance on CGI for certain scenes can give the movie a 'cartoonish' feel, but more times than not it works well. Those scenes that further Peter's plight and his relationships with others takes up a significant amount of the movie's running time, but they never feel too long or verbose.Tobey Maguire is of course, the perfect Peter Parker. With his forlorn look and oft crackling voice, he evokes a genuine sense of pity for Peter. While I still feel that Kirsten Dunst is miscast as Mary Jane, she performs her role quite creditably. Alfred Molina is certainly quite enjoyable as the villain. Molina's Doc Ock presents a more interesting and dangerous villain than the Goblin. Making real progress since the first film is James Franco. Now freed of a peripheral role he steps nicely into the spotlight for the sequel. Further credit must be given to J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson. Simmons steals every scene he is in, not only because of his accurate portrayal of Jameson, but also because of his loud, unapologetic delivery of dialogue.Spider-Man 2 successfully pulls off what the Hulk tried, but was unable to do: to create a superhero film whose characters are just as exciting as the action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Now we have Alfred Molina playing Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus and he plays the the character amazingly.The action is fun especially the train fight is amazing and the epic music from Danny Elfman makes the entire movie amazing.The acting is still funny and cheesy but it makes it really entertaining especially with the acting. This is worth watching if you liked Spider-Man from 2002.I can see why people think this is the best comic book movie or sequal. I'm not going to say I disagree with that statement but it is one of the better comic book movies out there even though people can find some issues.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man 2,"Before watching Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to wait to review all the Spider-Man's until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, and this one was high on the list. Like I said, all the movies were great, but this one was better than the first.The first thing I liked was how we are getting to see the main characters grow up and develop. The jumps in years between the movies plays out really well, because when we start each movie, we need to catch up on what the character had been doing.This movie also had a great plot and acting. I don't know how to explain it, but the plot really worked for me. I really enjoyed it. Also, everyone who reprised their roles did so perfectly, but the new villain, Doc Ock was amazing. Alfred Molina did a phenomenal job as Dr. Otto Octavius. He is up there with Willem Dafoe being the best Spider-Man villain of all time.Lastly, the final battle was unreal. Everything from the execution of the scene to the acting to the actual scene itself was crazy. Especially the train scene with Peter. That is iconic.I definitely recommend this to everyone. Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, even regular people ei like it. Also, if you are going to see No Way Home, make sure to watch this and all other Spider-Man movies. It is worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another proof that hype compensates for quality,"I'm neither a die-hard fan of Spiderman comic strips, nor of comic strips at large. If you belong to this 2% of the audience, you might actually enjoy the movie. If you don't, chances are that you will experience a poor story, with poor special effects, and a boring love story. No surprises, nothing original, lots of superfluous stuff to fill the 120 minutes. It's not even remarkably bad.The high rating proves once more that virtually any movie can make it into the Top#250, provided its marketing budget is big enough (see also: LOTR series).Conclusions:1- don't rely on IMDB ratings for heavily hyped movies.2- don't watch this movie. Go for X-Men II instead.3- 4/10 points, for watching the movie was just a waste of time, but it didn't hurt too much.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Rare Sequel the Passes the Original,"Sam Raimi gives us the second part of his Spider-Man series.Our story follows Peter as a struggling college student, juggling his job, class, friends, and being Spider-Man. Peter finally meets his idol Doctor Octavius who invites him to a new fusion reactor experiment they are going to do the next day. At that experiment he puts eight tentacles on him and the fusion reactor erupts and pulls a lot of stuff off the wall, killing his wife Rosie and fusing the tentacles to him and they take over his mind and becomes evil.Tobey McGuire returns to the role that made him a star, Peter Parker. He plays a very good geek and an unconventional hero. Although he lays a bit on the cheese factors on time.Kirsten Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson, the girl Peter's been crushing on. She plays her role very nicely, I do have one problem, she gets mad at him and breaks up her friendship with Pete for the weirdest reason.Alfred Molina is one of my favorite actors from Raiders of the Lost Ark to The Hoax, no slip ups on his performance, he almost made me sympathize with him.James Franco is easily the worst in this movie, a major on the cheese factor. The one good thing about his character is that he has an awesome ending.I liked this movie, the special effects were awesome (well-deserved Oscar,) the only problem I had was the acting and them putting on the cheese.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily The GREATEST Super Hero Movie Of All Time!,"This movie was amazing, it delves into the characters wonderfully, and the plot was structured perfectly, as it delves into the life of Peter Parker (Maguire) as he is losing his powers, and must learn what it means to be Spider-Man again, as he faces against the villainous Dr. Otto Octavius, otherwise known as Doctor Octopus!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NOT the best super hero movie ever,"Some of the top film critics have called this the greatest super hero movie ever made. Not true. I like the Spider-Man series but I find Tobey Maguire too soft for the role. His looks and his voice don't strike a super hero chord in me. There's NOTHING wrong with his looks or voice, it just isn't for a super hero role. A super hero role needs to have an actor with stern looks and a commanding voice of presence like Michael Keaton or Christopher Reeve in their respective roles as Superman and Batman although, contrary to popular belief, Batman is NOT a super hero because he is mortal and operates with very human qualities. The definition of a super hero is someone who has special powers aside from the mortal way of life.'Spider-Man 2' has great special effects and Alfred Molina's role as Doc Ock is a memorable villain but 'Spider-Man 2' just gets lost in its own mix of elements and it clearly ends setting up the film for a sequel strictly for the purpose of making money. A lot of films do this but this film makes it look SO obvious and having too many people know your true identity weakens your strength as a super hero and while this is good film making, director Sam Raimi directs it by the numbers without clever interjections of his own vision, elements which were also present in the first film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Same director, different feel","I loved this film. I gave it a 7/10 stars (which right now is about average). I watched this immediately after watching the first Spiderman and noted the differences as I saw them. There was more humor in this film than the first, some bad and some kind of witty.I initially didn't like the fact that Spiderman loses his powers at times when he's stressed or whatever about real-life things. I thought that they could've saved that facet of his character out until the third movie. He could've saved so many secrets until the next movie, but it had to have been done at some point, I guess. This movie answered what would happen between Mary Jane and Peter Parker, or at least, how they feel about one another after Peter reveals himself.The music was as great as the first. Danny Elfman and about 3 other composers helped on this film, which you can feel in the intense moments of the action sequences and so forth. I liked the fact that there were fewer ""hits"" trying to surface from bands and the like on the soundtrack of this film than the first. The marketing had done its duty for the first film, and I think the makers of this film knew that, so that died down to allow the film to become more credible, to me.I loved the Doctor Octopus design. It is more like the original character, which they might've learned from the Green Goblin ""mistake"" of the first movie. Bruce Campbell is in this film as well, as the ""snooty usher"" so that's humorous (just a bit) to see him again in this line of film's, thanks to Sam Raimi.The directing was out of this world. Great adventurous shots were provided by the crew's ""Spidercam"" (basically a camera on a zip-line). My favorite part in the movie has got to be the car crashing into a coffee house where Parker and Mary Jane are about to share a kiss, and they both have to dive as this car smashes through the window like nothing I'd seen before. That was a great scene and timing was great in that entire sequence.The negative stuff, I could find anyways, that could've been better are the fighting sequences and weak relationship between Parker and Mary Jane. I hated seeing CG animated characters duking it out on the side of a building and being whipped around as the camera goes haywire and trying to get a clear angle of their fight. That drove me batty a few times. And the relationship between Park and Mary Jane was very frustrating to watch. At times I'd actually catch myself thinking, ""Just leave him and do something else. Move somewhere else in the world. Get a job...whatever. This life is gonna be hell with him."" And it wasn't improving as the movie went on until she finally caves in to his characterand accepts a rough life as the girl of Spiderman. Whatever...so much drama going back and forth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still the greatest Spider-Man film and interpretation of all time,"The Sam Raimi trilogy is the epitome of what the Spider-Man character represents. The curse and the gift that comes with the having those super powers, its a love letter to the classic storylines, while adopting something fresh and modern with it.""Spider-Man 2"" does not only raise the stakes, it evolves every bit of character and storylines within this film, and the development and responsibility that comes with it.While the first film set the foundations so well, while being the most accurate cinematic story arc of the character we have till this day, this one sets a larger scale of consequences, while still staying a personal story to Peter and his inner circle.Every bit of good thing from the first translates even higher here, from the beautiful score of Elfman's, to the grandiose memorable action scenes, and the emotional ones that are narrated by both parental figures of Peter, Aunt May and Uncle Ben, his distant love and protection to MJ, and the guilt that follows with his best friend and him feeling responsible for what happened. There is much emotions, while him struggling to balance between his life and it all plays out in a perfect mix of drama, action, comedy and emotional roller coaster.After 3 cinematic interpretations, it is safe to say that Raimi understood the character the most and it shows and much of the success helped to establish the genre as we know it today.Here's to hoping for more of his touch, and love for the character to continue within the MCU, with both Tobey's Spider-Man and Doctor Strange and we can enjoy more of these great memorable stories like this timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Major disappointment...,"... and probably this year's most overrated movie. I was really looking forward to the sequel of the truly brilliant 'Spiderman 1'... and boy couldn't I believe what I saw.Acting:Almost non-existent. Never seen Tobey Maguire act so poorly (he can do -and has done- much better than that), Alfred Molina was apart from a few good scenes- highly disappointing (he, too, can do -and has done- much better than that), and don't get me even started on Kirsten Dunst (who probably couldn't do better than that but probably even gave her very best, sad as it may sound). I was actually surprised by James Franco who IMO wasn't bad at all. Well, maybe he wasn't exactly great, but I was told he couldn't act, and he was almost the only one who didn't make me cringe constantly.Action:The newspaper's headline should be: 'SPIDERMAN CGI'ED TO DEATH!'. Apparently, I'm not ready yet for this kind of CGI, because I was annoyed how artificial Spiderman looked in most of the movie. I don't remember them using that much CGI in the first movie, thus making it more real. Granted- Spiderman moves more fluently in this sequel, and maybe more spider-like, but does this justify the sacrifice of this 'Hey, that guy looks like he could actually be real!' bonus the first movie had? I'd say not. Apart from the CGI, we've pretty much seen all these action scenes before. The only one that really was great was the train scene- but did they really have to do this with the people carrying Spiderman around like that? Just when the movie looks like getting better it's sinking in kitsch again. Doc Ock's animations were great, though, I'll give them that; he was a greater villain than the Green Goblin.Plot:It's such a shame, really- this plot could have been SO good! 'Superhero can't cope with all his responsibilities and decides to lead a normal life again'... great stuff IMO, but they managed to mess it all up- WAY too many schmaltzy scenes- how could anyone stand them?! All I could do was trying not to scream with frustration when Peter's aunt delivers a 5-minute-long monologue on how the little neighbor's boy used to look up at Spiderman and how sad he is to see his hero gone (*nudge* *nudge* *wink* *wink*)... or when Peter sees his uncle again in times of doubt... or when Peter tells Mary-Jane (sorry, MJ, not that old-fashioned) he loves her... or when MJ tells Peter she loves him... or when Peter tells MJ he didn't love her at all 'Oops, sorry- my bad...')... Basically it was the old 'with great power comes great responsibility' thing rolled out to the max plus a see-through love story. Now, this wouldn't have been THAT bad if the acting hadn't been as bad as it was- the way Maguire and Dunst delivered this was just implausible, and I wasn't the only one to snigger at those scenes. Between them was about as much chemistry as in a glass of water (plain, no bubbles).Also, there are more plot holes and inconsistencies than you could shake a stick at.And one last thing- who told Raimi to put as many American flags as possible in EVERY shot? No matter where you look- the aunt's house (and the neighbor's as well), the New York skyscrapers, even the GRAVEYARD- everything's plastered with Stars and Stripes. I'm not, I repeat, NOT Anti-American- but this really is way too much for my European eyes.The only good thing I can say is this: there's hope for Spiderman 3. I can't think of any more schmaltzy scenes they could possibly come up with as they've used up pretty much everything already, and the plot is very promising. I sincerely hope SM3 is going to be more like SM1 again.All in all:I was probably expecting too much (the movie of the year), and all I got was an extremely expensive and elaborate action blockbuster, but barely above average. Which just goes to show that a monster budget and as much CGI as possible don't necessarily make a good movie. I'd rather watch Spiderman 1 over and over again. 5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Spider-Man sequel and the best superhero movie!,"Spider-Man 2 (2004) is Sam Raimi's the best spectacular sequel Marvel's Action superhero film ever and It is Way Better Than the First! I am sorry but I think Spider-Man 2 is way better Than The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2.It may take a while for the action to start up in Spidey 2, but when it does it's great. This sequel deals on the inner turmoil our protagonist must face not only as Spider-Man, but as an adult living in the real world -- a nice contrast by the writer. The new villain, Doc Oc, is way better than The Green Goblin could ever hope to achieve. He's a struggling soul just as Spidey, only his has been focused on better achieving what he failed to do, as is Spidey -- saving the world after the death of his uncle. The script here is great. The acting is once again, very well done -- Simmon's character is wonderful. The music is basically the same from the first, a misstep by the composer Danny Elfman. Overall, this is a great sequel and could very well exist had the first not been made.Spider-Man (2002) was fun. I mean really, really fun. However, it was weighed down by the prospect that it took itself too seriously. Spider-Man 2 takes all the fun of Spider-Man and throws away the cheese. That is not to say that those shallow moments are entirely gone, but at least Spider-Man 2 knows exactly what kind of movie it is. Spider-Man 2 starts out a lot slower than Spider-Man does, but when the ball gets rolling, man is it worth the wait! The characters are more developed, the action is so poetic it's almost like watching a synchronized dance, and the story contains more drama and humor. Real humor. The funny moments here are less laughable and more funny, let's just say. Also, where Spider-Man contained some, well, ""objectionable"" content, Spider-Man 2 is surprisingly chaste. Here is one of those rare occasions where the sequel outdoes the original in every aspect. Swing us away, Spidey! CONTENT: Much stylized action violence; mild language; a few low tops. WHO: Teens and up.Now this is what a superhero movie should be. ""Spider-Man 2"" believes in its story in the same way serious comic readers believe, when the adventures on the page express their own dreams and wishes. It's not camp and it's not nostalgia, it's not wall-to-wall special effects and it's not pickled in angst. It's simply and poignantly a realization that being Spider-Man is a burden that Peter Parker is not entirely willing to bear.I wish more people could see and appreciate the heart displayed in Spider-Man 2. I love this film I love It the most so much because his life was really hard and because Doc Ock gosh I love him. The film it self more focus on a characters and the same time does the story. The film is struggles more Peter's life and what it Is life as Spider-Man and life as Peter Parker. His life is such a stress and he is trying everything, he even get's to stressful so he loses his powers. The film wasn't focusing only on Peter's life It was also focusing on Mary Jane, Harry Osborn and Dr. Otto Octavius. I love Spider-Man 1 & 2 tough Spider-Man (2002) has flaws and it isn't portrayed by comic books. That is why I prefer The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) over Spider-Man (2002)even tough I do Like the first film.""I believe there's a hero in all of us.""In Spider-Man 2, the latest installment in the blockbuster Spider-Man series, based on the classic Marvel Comics hero, Tobey Maguire returns as the mild-mannered Peter Parker, who is juggling the delicate balance of his dual life as college student and a superhuman crime fighter. Peter's life becomes even more complicated when he confronts a new nemesis, the brilliant Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who has been reincarnated as the maniacal and multi-tentacled ""Doc Ock."" When Doc Ock kidnaps MJ (Kirsten Dunst), Spider-Man must swing back into action as the adventure reaches new heights of unprecedented excitement.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them.""Spider-Man 2"" is the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ""Superman"" (1978). It succeeds by being true to the insight that allowed Marvel Comics to upturn decades of comic-book tradition: Readers could identify more completely with heroes like themselves than with remote godlike paragons. Peter Parker was an insecure high school student, in grade trouble, inarticulate in love, unready to assume the responsibilities that came with his unexpected superpowers. It wasn't that Spider-Man could swing from skyscrapers that won over his readers; it was that he fretted about personal problems in the thought balloons above his Spidey face mask.Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon.

Alfred Molina gives audiences one of the strongest performances with a Marvel villain through his role as the notorious Doctor Octopus.

"It is not the typical sequel, it actually makes you forget that there was a part 1 of Spider-Man","Spider-Man 2 is the best movie this year so far. The last time I saw a movie this good was last year when I went to watch Finding Nemo. As a matter of fact, Spider-Man 2 beats ALL superhero movies of this decade and the 90s. To be more specific, the last time a superhero movie was done so well is the instant classic Batman, and SM2 even outperforms that movie at certain times. Spider-Man 2 improved on the original in every way possible, it took the formula that made the first one a hit and tweaked on it much more to create a masterpiece of writing, acting, and special effects. So much happens in this movie, there was never a dull moment, and most of the time, you will be at the edge of your seat.Derived from a clever and very strong plot, a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot includes the fact that Harry Osborn is still hunting after Spider-Man, and also investing money in one of Dr. Otto Octavius's experiments, who turns out to be the main villain in the movie. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is being a successful model and is also an actress that is getting angrier and angrier at the fact that she can barely see Peter Parker. Not only that, but Mary Jane is also planning on getting married to an astronaut. In the meantime, Peter Parker continues struggling mixing his day life with his two friends and his aunt, with his nightlife as Spider-Man. So much happens, you wonder how all this manages to fit into just 125 minutes. This plot is the reason why the movie stays fresh and exciting throughout the entire time.Spider-Man 2 has much more humor the 2nd time around, much more romance and tear-jerking moments, more action, and much more moments that would make you jump out of your seat. The funniest character in the movie is Peter Parker's boss, which is the bossy, mean, not-too-smart, manipulative and just plain awful J. Jonah Jameson. The standout funny scenes in the movie are any scene with Jameson and also a hysterical scene in an elevator involving Spider-Man and a stranger. Mary Jane and Harry, despite still being major roles in Peter Parker's life, are not around as much in the movie, but they are in many major scenes anyway.The acting was excellent; everyone did his or her part wonderfully. Tobey Maguire did a good job as the strong yet tired and vulnerable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst played the beautiful Mary Jane with plenty of emotion and James Franco does the angry and unsure Henry Osborn. J.K. Simmons gives perhaps the best performance of the movie as J. Jonah Jameson. The main villain (Awesome performance by Alfred Molina), even though gets less screen time than The Green Goblin from the original Spider-Man, offers up a lot more scares and a couple of awesome fights against Spider-Man. The Green Goblin had 3 fights against Spider-Man, two minor, and one major. Dr. Otto has three fights against Spider-Man, 2 of them phenomenally awesome fights, and one smaller and shorter fight. One last note, I must applaud in Rosemary Harris's wonderful performance as Aunt May.The fight scenes were much, much, much, much better the second time around. The fights are not only longer, but have much more action, much more awe-inspiring little moments in the fight, and are in a much larger range. What I mean by the range is that the fight takes a lot more room, a lot more space. While the fights in the original Spider-Man are in a building or a burning apartment, the fights in the sequel take place at first in a bank and then goes up to a huge building, and then the best fight of all involves the top of a clock tower, and then heads on to a runaway train [Which is the best fight I have seen in years, I may add].What separates this superhero movie from the other superhero movies is that it does an awesome job of mixing the romance, comedy, action, and jaw-dropping moments so that it appeals to every single person wanting to watch it. The ending reveals so much; I cannot really discuss much about it. In some parts it will shock you, in some parts it may disappoint, and last of all, it keeps you asking for more, hours after the movie is finished. It was fantastic, in my opinion, and it will appeal to a lot more people than the original. The sequel stays very close to its comic book roots and does an excellent job with the special effects.Bottom Line: Fantastic movie. Despite perhaps the ending at one point, which I should not reveal much of, this movie will not disappoint at all. It was truly worth all the hype, and is the most exciting, most rewarding, and funniest, and best movie of the year. It was more action packed than all action films out now, it is funnier than most comedies out this decade [cough*Shrek 2*cough], and because of the great close-ups and brilliant acting, I find this one of the more emotionally-moving films out there today. I was impressed, and I am waiting for part 3 already. The only thing that part 1 has the advantage of is perhaps the villain, I really did enjoy seeing the Green Goblin, but besides that, the original is nothing compared to this. Go see Spider-Man 2, now, it is a crime to not watch and experience this movie.Final Score: 9.5 /10 [A]",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Liked the first better,"By far this was nowhere near the worst movie I've seen this summer (Van Helsing gets that designation) but I was disappointed. From reading the reviews I see I'm in the minority but sometimes it's like that.What I didn't like: So much angst and not enough action reminiscent of last year's Hulk movie.The overly done heavy handed ""Mr Loser"" jokes were just too much.Dr Ock is my least favorite Spiderman villain. he is right up there with the equally lame Stilt Man or giant poodle from the Hulk. Why weren't the more interesting villains like Venom, Carnage, Kraven the Hunter, Scorpion or Lizard used? The new contrived origin of Dr Ock and his motivations were weak.Considering how Peter Parker is always disappearing just as Spiderman shows up or Peter is the only person able to get pictures of Spiderman, the idea that no one suspects Peter is Spiderman is as bad as no one realizing Clark Kent is Superman with glasses. The scenes with Mary Jane and Peter. Painfully dull and journeys to nowhere.What I liked: The little CGI that was there. The movement of Dr Ock as well as improvement of Spidey swinging through Manhattan were excellent. Wish it had been the Lizard or Scorpion instead of Dr Ock. Good character development but overdone killing what should have been a great action movie.That's my opinion.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A New Spider-Man Story,"Sam Raimi's classic Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire looks just fine today. This is an interesting, in a sense, lamp story seems to be something warm and so native, from somewhere from childhood. The second film of the series came out no worse than the original, be sure to look back at the results of the last picture, which contributed to the construction of a coherent narrative canvas.The main characters: Peter, Mary Jane, Harry have grown up. Their lives changed after the events of the last film, leaving an imprint on everyone. And when a new villain Otto Octavius breaks into their destinies, the guys have a lot to reconsider in barely adjusted everyday life. But the stakes are much higher now, because the characters have become more mature, and along with this, the film itself has become more mature.The actors are good in their roles. Their characters, thanks to a high-quality, but not very intricate scenario, continue to evolve, and the past leaves its imprint on the relationships of the guys. The friendship of Parker and the younger Osborne is shown to be just great. The heroes have always been best friends, but then Mary Jane came between them, and then the terrible story of the confrontation between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. The script and the actors allow you to feel this smoldering conflict between young guys who are trying to remain the same close friends, but sometimes there is simply no strength for it. Harry despises Parker for his friendship with Spider (as Osborne himself thinks), and Peter tries to preserve this broken friendship, while not forgetting that he is a superhero who should remain a friendly neighbor to the residents of the city. All these difficulties between the characters are compounded by the disaster with Dr. Otto Octavius, who has become a danger to the city.Doctor Octopus has become a great villain for this story, especially considering how he was played by Alfred Molina. His actor's reincarnation is the decoration of this picture, as in fact in the first film the participation of William Defoe. Eminent professionals act as a kind of pillars of both paintings, allowing you to enjoy their play and the genuine tragedies of villains who have become such, trying to bring something good into the world.Each of the main characters is spelled out perfectly, experiencing its own specific difficulties. Peter Parker has this constant intrapersonal conflict. The guy is trying to do the right thing, but everything falls out of his hands: studies are not set, with the love of his life does not add up, strained relationships with a friend, and attempts to be a hero begin to turn into problems when the guy even loses his superpowers. This is a great example of how a person can fall into the trap of his own self. What does Peter really want, and how to save all that he is now able to lose? A difficult question, which will be solved by the Spider in this picture.Harry Osborne, who suffered from a lack of attention from his father throughout the first film, has now found a new motivation for himself. The theme of revenge obscures the guy's eyes, gradually eroding the young man's faith in friendship and love. Throughout the whole picture, one can observe how he comes to what will make him a completely different person and subsequently turn him into something new, another being.Mary Jane is well shown in this movie. Her heroine, who in the first picture was rather a permanent person who just needs to be saved, appears here as a person. And Kirsten Dunst has revealed her full potential, giving a really lively character who is growing above himself and is an important part of this cinematic world.The picture will certainly please with excellent battle scenes, a more beautiful and dynamic picture, will allow you to fully immerse yourself in an interesting story. The world of Sam Raimi will be appreciated by true fans of Spider-Man, for whom the picture has already become legendary.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Burden of the Mask,"How to improve on a solid origin movie? Do what Spider-Man 2 did basically.A much better package that improves in every single way possible than the first movie. Tobey is still not selling it but the movie more than covers it for him. This movie is the one that truly sells the burden of the mask and the struggles of Peter Parker and no other Spider-Man movie has managed to reach this high and likely never will now that Disney is involved.Honestly it feels weird watching a superhero movie with zero quips or forced comedy. I'm absolutely a fan of comedy and most definitely enjoyed majority of the MCU movies but those are mostly throwaways made to sell popcorn. Spider-Man 2 is not a popcorn seller, its a fantastic movie by any metric. The first movie feels somewhat dated now but this absolutely stood the test of time and can easily rival any modern superhero movie even with its antiquated technology. Because what makes a movie isn't budget or technology or VFX artist. What makes a movie is its script, direction and understanding of the characters. Which Sam Raimi proved he is a master of.Even better villains, more fights, updated touchup, iconic moments and deep understanding of Spider-Man as a character is just few of the improvements over the first movie. There will never be a better Spider-Man movie than this. The only way to make this better is to replace Tobey with Andrew Garfield and Kirsten Dunst With Emma Stone. Other than that and few minor vfx hiccups its actually a perfect movie. Even after almost 17 years later no movie has understood Spider-Man more and no movie later shall either.Also has the absolute best scene in Spider-Man live action history, you simply can't top that scene no matter how you try.RATING: 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very very close to a 10,"Burdened with a glorious purpose.In my opinion, this is one of the best superhero movies and probably the best solo superhero movies.There's not that many superhero movies where you can feel so up close and personal with the protagonist. The identity crisis that Peter went through, along with the guilt that he carried with him was heartbreaking. This aspect was done amazingly because unlike many superhero movies, most of the runtime was dedicated to Peter and not Spider-Man. This is a Peter Parker movie.Dr. Ock was definitely an upgrade as a villain. He was significantly more menacing because he was too strong for Peter. However, the most important part was how similar he was to Peter. I wished Dr. Ock had more screen time to make his character even better.Since there's more time for Peter character, there's less time for Spider-Man in action. However, both the fight scenes and visual effects improved. That train scene was not only iconic but also incredibly intense. What happened after that was a powerful and emotional moment. *spoiler* The way the people carried beaten up Peter almost gotten me tear up. What a beautiful way of showing appreciation for their hero *spoiler*Overall, I don't think Spider-Man 2 is fully a superhero movie, but rather an incredible character study. 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superior blockbuster,"In most recent years the summer months have brought an endless stream of blockbuster drivel. I was beginning to think that the art of making movies was being lost to the insatiable thirst of the production companies desire to bank as much money as possible each season.Spiderman 2 has restored my faith. It's got everything you come to expect from a blockbuster; it's got action, thrills and spills, a romance, comedy, drama and tragedy. Fortunately it's also got what you don't expect ... It's good !!! The main reason for this is the way all the characters are fleshed out. The good guys have problems and flaws whilst the bad guys are really bad through circumstances rather than through choice. In my opinion this is much better than the original and leaves you looking forward to the next film which again is unusual.This franchise is still revving up and could be the biggest thing of the naughties. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disappointment,"I guess I expected more.  This is a film for kids, I guess.  Given all the destruction and violence they encounter on TV and in video games, CGIs are just part of kid culture.  They expect it and tolerate it.  The bringing of comics to screen is hardly new and began back in the 30s and 40s.  Back then, the limits were imagination of the goofy directors who were able to patchwork props together to suggest the special effects.  Then, there were the old superman films with George Reeves which combined both...and they were pretty cheesey.  But, underlying all of this was the comic book heroes themselves.  Comic books were the epitome of the mythic journey where clear lines stood between the bad guys and the good guys.  You always knew who the villains were, just like in the cowboy movies.  They were invariably decked out in some symbolic feature like a tight-fitting costume, with the genitalia tastefully tucked away, which displayed the sleek, muscle-rippled bodies, all of which spelled out H-E-R-O.So, why does this film fall so flat?  It's got all the gimmicks, costumes, tension, unfairness, bad-guys who are basically good but taken over by some force they could not anticipate.  The brilliant scientist turned evil by his lack of foresight...the underlying message being, there are some secrets of nature, thou shalt not mess with.  Alas, the message is an anti-intellectual one and one that detracts from the power of the mythic struggle between good and evil.  It seemed to work well in the first film but the message in this is worn thin in this rehash.  There is a lack of continuity and the struggle of Peter Parker, which should be the struggle of every one, becomes a parody.  He gets knocked down, he gets stepped on, he gets slapped, he begins to lose his powers and descends into hell and is reborn.Those are powerful metaphors but they come across like a tune played on an old coffee can.  All we're left with is Peter Parker's confusion, growing self-doubts and final commitment, undermined by the girl he loves.  The sacrifice is made by the villain, Al Molina who refuses to ""die a monster."" We're left with the feeling there's still some good in the worst of us misguided souls.So, what's the lesson here?  Is Peter Parker willing to make that supreme sacrifice of love, career and normalcy, only to have it undermined by a now-understanding, woman who comes to him in the wedding dress she was wearing for another man, whom she ungenerously left at the altar?Stay tuned, as the James Dean-lookalike is waiting in the wings to don his father's garb for the next big money maker...while the suits like up to sell lots and oodles of Spidey goodies, games and treats.Could be, but maybe I'll pass the next one...I get the feeling I've seen it all before.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but where are Spidermans poses and cocky attitude?","First of all, let me say that Spiderman 2 is far better than the first. However, I consider the first to be very overrated, so that doesn't say much. Again with SM2, I feel I'm battling overratedness.. so excuse me if I get a little rough on it. >:)The movie contains several gems; action-gems, emotional gems, humour-gems.. Peter Parker vs the two kids (you'll know it when you see it, brilliant), and there were a lot of heart-rushing action scenes. The movie has nerve all along, and you ALMOST don't get bored during the whole film. So why am I so ambivalent about it?First of all: The CG is bad. Sorry folks. The CG is not near the quality of LOTR or whatever. Check out Spidey himself. Like many CG objects, he always seems a tad too light or plastic-y, he doesn't seem to jump or fall with normal gravity. Or Doc Ock's arms, although indeed nice looking, I never really got the feeling his arms were really stuck in his back. So, CG needs improvement.The movie has a lot of emotional nerve, which is a good thing, and an important part of the Spiderman universe. This movie is about 80-90% drama (!), believe it or not. Only problem with that, it's carried by too many ""hollywood-style motivation/emotion speeches"". Yawn! One of Auntie May's went something like: Always follow your dreams, believe in yourself, there are true heroes, don't run with scissors, never abandon your hopes, bla bla bla. Hollywood filler chatter! MJ had similar lines; OBVIOUSLY artificial. Direction also needs improvement.And Mary Jane, she's not ugly here, BUT - she's just not pretty. Her character's made up to be this model-style beauty, which she's not. She was in the cartoon, but she's not a beauty here. Now don't get me wrong, I love the concept of ""normal looking people"" in movies, but I hate people obviously miscast. Why chase a marriage-hungry dull girl like that, Spiderman? PS: MJs ""ironed"" 2000-style haircut never looked good on anyone, boy or girl. SO: Casting needs impr.... well, too late for that. (I realize you're married, Raimi, but DON'T miscast Felicia Hardy too)The main problem I have with this movie, however, is where it slips most from the cartoon concept. We've seen CG and wire-battles so many times now, it's been done so good before, so why should we remember Spideys battles when we walk home from the cinema? Well. Spiderman's battles in the cartoon was all about poses, Spideys cocky attitude and brilliant lines when he was fighting the bad guys. It was original, it was fun. Where is it here?! The battles themselves thus become a little anticlimactic (""seen that before""), so they just crush a lot of stuff and make Spidey ""almost die"" all the time in stead. Comic adaption needs improvement..Phew. Well, as I said; it's not a bad movie, but it's not quite up there as a top 250 movie either. That said, this movie does contain several gems, if you have a ""girlish"" girlfriend she won't be bored to tears by it - it IS highly watchable. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The format works,"While this is not a movie to remember for all time, and it isn't even the best super hero movie (X2, despite the tired plot is still better) this is the first comic conversion that actually fully works on screen.Every aspect of the film that matters is done well. The characters are still paper thin but I do care about them. The story is allowed to work at its own pace without being hijacked by the pixel fiddlers.The humour is not soulless one liners but small moments or fun riffs. Doc Oc using his arms to do four things at once while lighting a cigar, a terrible musical rendition of the old theme tune, and guess what colour bow tie the next green goblin wears?The action scenes are the most effective I have seen since Return of the King (which effectively defined year zero for effects based films). This is partly because they have been done properly, but also because they are done at different tempos. From Doc Ocs harrowing escape from the hospital, to bullet time reflex carnage, to silly pranks at the bank.Like Judge Dredd before it, Spidey has his mask off a little too often for comic fans - but in a film very much about identity, we know this is hollywood trying its best to entertain, and mainly succeeding.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie! Two thumbs up,"I just came back from the theatre after watching this movie and i thought it was great. Despite of the unimpressive acting, this movies grasps the attention of the audience because of its great special effects and stylized action. The script wasn't that good but it wasn't bad aswell. I think this is the greatest comic book that has been made into a movie. Sam Raimi did a great job making the sequel. I think the direction was perfect. This movie is also a bit hilarious. Like the scene in the elevator. Tobey Mcguire acted well being Peter Parker. I think Kirsten Dunst should not be in the third part. She acts pathetically.I gave this movie 10/10 and I think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies of IMDb. I recommend this movie to everyone who loved the first part. Don't wait for its DVD.

Spider-Man 2,"Following on closely from the first outing (2002) for Tobey Maguire in his red and blue suit, we find him using his now finely honed spidey powers for the good of New Yorkers whilst struggling at school and to hold down a job as a pizza delivery boy. His best pal ""Harry"" (James Franco) is still grieving for his murdered dad and, of course, his hormones are all over the place when it comes to ""MJ"" (Kirsten Dunst). He has a paper to write that might look better if he meets ""Dr. Octavius"" (Alfred Molina) and so when he discovers that he is doing some work for ""Harry"", a meeting is arranged which leads to a scientific experiment that - well let's just say that the well meaning scientist now turns into something of a metallic maniac! A side effect of this experiment seems to be giving ""Spidey"" a bit of limp-web syndrome, and he concludes that maybe his new powers have brought him nothing but grief. Should he hang up his lycra? That would please his newspaper boss ""Jameson"" (JK Simmons) but it would also rob him of much needed cash as his rent is due and poor old Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is having difficulties with her mortgage. See - he has not his problems to seek! Meantime, the marauding tin machine does a deal with the avenging ""Harry"" to deliver our hero in return for an element that will provide for an eternal source of energy (or, more likely, destroy the planet) and this puts everyone at risk as the newly christened ""Doc. Ock"" starts to piece together a puzzle that will expose the true identity of ""Spider-Man"" and compromise those he loves... It's a bit of a slow start, this one, but once the explosions have started to come, it moves along apace with plenty of action, a minimum of cluttering romance, and some fun one-liners from the more prominent Simmonds as it transpires that his son (Daniel Gillies) is engaged to be married to - well that'd be telling. Maguire is confident holding this together and Sam Raimi uses his visual effects, especially at the end, to complement rather than overwhelm a story that's a sort of superhero equivalent of a coming of age tale. It's a big screen standard with Danny Elfman's recognisable score helping to deliver a solid and entertaining adventure film that might actually be better than the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action-packed fun, but still corny","The wife and I went to catch this flick after many friends had recommended it.

There were a few scenes involving Dr. Octopus that looked borderline realistic, but far too many Spiderman swinging through the streets scenes that looked like an old video game.Overall, the best aspect of the movies is the acting of Tobey and the sometimes very funny comic relief injected into the film.If you spend your money on Spiderman 2 you wont feel you've wasted it.

Is it any wonder he's stilled billed as 'amazing'?,"When I heard a sequel was being made to the original Spider-Man movie, I admit that I had my doubts as to whether it could be pulled off. Sure, Raimi and co. did a great job with the first movie, creating not only a faithful comic book adaptation, but a great movie in its own right, but the usual 'sequel issue' looms into view: a well done and successful movie is made, but then the sequel is rushed out a year or two later which turns out to be less than successful, and the entire series is remembered on a bad note. I liked the idea of a Spider-Man 2, but I didn't want it to ruin the memory of the original. Turns out I had nothing to worry about at all.Raimi bestows upon us a masterpiece, easily equaling if not surpassing the first in quality and enjoyability. Unlike most sequels, which turn out with a very shabby plot, attempted to be covered up by stuffing in as much action as they possibly can, we actually spend more time with Peter Parker out of costume than behind the mask of Spider-Man. These long sequences spent with Peter Parker's friends and family as he struggles to solve his various personal problems risk losing our attention, but fortunately, Spider-Man will rush out to beat on some criminals at just the right moment to keep us interested.Raimi himself uses the directorial freedom granted by a sequel to allow his quirky sense of humour to permeate the film much more visibly than in the first movie. He uses techniques such as having the scene go entirely black except for the eye of Spider-Man's costume as a scene transition, or having the camera perform a dissolve effect, representing Doc Ock's progressing insanity. Such liberties you can't usually get away with in a movie, but Raimi finds a way to make them work. However, the main problem I had with Spider-Man 2 is that the 'slow scenes' drag on far too long. Far too much time is devoted to nothing but Peter Parker walking along the street, or running with a determined look on his face, without even any dialogue. I think these parts should have been edited down to about a quarter of their length, to decrease the likelihood of them appearing boring, unnecessary and out of place.The visual effects are much improved - Spidey looks and moves better than ever! And the addition of Dr Octopus and his four metal tentacles to the script gives the FX people plenty to play around with. The tentacles were apparently part puppetry and part CGI, but however they did it, the tentacles looked and acted excellent. This also opened up an opportunity for much more intense fight scenes than in the first movie, with Doc Ock and Spidey crawling up and down the walls, bashing at each other all the while.Unlike the Batman series, which threw in new actors every time, destroying any sense of continuity, all the principal actors from the first film return to play their characters once more. As the man behind the mask (for part of the time anyway) Tobey Maguire gives another solid performance. (in spite of what British Tabloids have to say about him out of character) He offers a lot more insight into the character of Peter Parker, and the motives that drive him. Kirsten Dunst gives a decent performance as Mary-Jane Watson, but she seems bored in her role, as if she would rather be just about anywhere else at the time, which doesn't help us realize what it is about her that makes Peter love her so. J.K. Simmons, however, gives another enthusiastic performance as the wonderfully horrible J. Jonah Jameson, number one tormentor in Peter Parker's dual life.Noticeable improvements can be seen in the performances of James Franco and Rosemary Harris. Harris as Peter's kindly Aunt May breathes a lot more life into her character this time round as the sole parental figure in Parker's life, ultimately becoming his inspiration for continuing to be Spider-Man.Franco has a real mess of a character to handle in Harry Osborn. Consumed by a lust for vengeance upon Spider-Man, who he believes murdered his father, and trying to take up his father's mantle at the family company, Oscorp, Harry is, whether he realizes it or not, becoming an exact copy of his father. This becomes more clear by the end of the movie. (you'll have to see it for yourself to figure out how) Franco conveys all these emotions convincingly, contrary to the shallow job he did on the first movie. It's good to see him improving as an actor.However, the show stealing performance has to go to Alfred Molina as multi-armed super villain Dr. Octopus. Molina does a spectacular job, perfectly inhabiting the complex character of Otto Octavius. What could have been a campy performance by someone else is a heartfelt and charismatic one in the hands of Molina. By spending some time with Otto and his wife and sensing the love that resonates between them, we know that he isn't really evil - just driven and determined that his 'dream for mankind' will succeed. It's just a darned shame that it seems like his character was stuffed into the script at the last moment just so Spider-Man has somebody to bash about, but fortunately, Molina's performance helps us forget this. Visually, he fits the part perfectly, looking like he just stepped out of the pages of a comic book, and his evil little smile was truly chilling! Molina put everything he had into the part to great effect: indeed, he lived, breathed and died Doc Ock.All in all, the Spidey folks throw us a well thought out and very successful sequel. All I can say is 'Bring on round three!'-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Better than the first one, but still not great","I didn't find myself completely enthralled by this movie.

The special effects were okay, but you could definitely tell when you were looking at CGI special effects -- it just had that unnatural CGI look and movement to it. The scenes of New York looked like it was either on a sound stage or in a CGI generator, nothing looked natural.I found little personal touchs interesting about this movie though. The fact that he started losing his superpowers due to emotional stress, for example. I found it interesting that he loses his mask a few times and people discover his identity; they tried hard not to reveal his identity in the first movie, in this movie they seemed to be revealing his identity to almost everyone!I liked Dr. Octopus. I did find the background to his story a little unbelievable. He invents his artificially intelligent bionic arms that interface to his spinal cord. But he invented them simply as tools for his main project which was nuclear fusion research.

Huge Disappointment,"I honestly feel that I must have seen a different movie than the one critics and audiences are eating up by the spoonful.

"Good, but not amazing","Let's see. First of all, I'd like to say that this film was enjoyable and funny. I felt that the actors/actresses did a great job. I liked J.K.

I felt that these actors/actresses were, for the most part, great at portraying the emotions of the characters.HOWEVER, I was SLIGHTLY disappointed by this film. I felt that they spent too much time on Peter Parker's life and did not have enough action. It does have a stronger emotional, human feel to it, but you can't forget that this is also an ACTION film, and it just didn't live up to that title.Additionally, I felt that the script was not so great. The writers did not spend enough time on Dr. Octopus. (Molina, with the little screen time that he had, did act very well.) There were way too many corny moments too, like the ""Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head."" Although it was a funny scene, it was very corny.I am a HUGE Spiderman fan, btw.

We see him struggling to keep up with his jobs, staying in touch with his friends, and overall struggling to find out who he truly is. And while that's happening, we have looming in the background the ominous threat of Doc Ock played by the amazing Alfred Molina.It's a movie that takes the character building VERY seriously, and makes you care for the person behind the mask. It still has its fun moments, and it has a lot of really well done action sequences. Not to mention the practical and digital effects have vastly improved.Personally if you were to tell me what Traditional Spider-Man movie I prefer, I would still choose the 1st one, BUT, after seeing this movie again, I have to tip my hat to Sam Raimi. It is a VERY well made movie that knows what it is, and doesn't apologize for it. Well done Marvel, and well done Raimi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Enjoyable, but so was Bring it On.","I was one of the few who did not like the first movie too much, where its bad acting and 'great' story of adolescence was wasted on me. With the big hype for the second movie, I expected more - better acting, better story, and basically a better movie.Well, I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the first one but that's only because they decided to add so many cheesy one-liners, overly dramatic scenes, too-well scripted scenes, and fan-service. Basically, most of my laughter and enjoyment was derived from points that I think the filmmakers didn't plan for. The acting was subpar on the part of James Franco, who I like, but I will say that was because of direction and his character. Tobey and Kirsten do a lot better this time around, and the other supporting characters really do shine.Story-wise, it was better. I was surprised a few times that they decided to go a certain way already and my prediction for the villain of the third movie that I gathered since the first seems to be pretty much set (with possibilities of more). The plot and characters were a lot more developed, spending time to accentuate those that needed it. However, there were many times scenes were used that were just irrelevant or longer than needed, its pacing was off, and the change between scenes was odd making me stop and wonder why.So, basically compared to the first, it is better, but I say not by much. I don't think this was as well-polished as X2 and definitely had flaws. I'm not quite sure why they are making out Spiderman to be Superman because Spiderman should not be that strong and it makes him out to be invincible, which was never the case.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Had Potential...Didn't deliver,"Tobey Maguire returns in the dual role of awkward adolescent Peter Parker and web-slinging vigilante superhero Spider-Man. He urges to tell the truth about his identity to his beloved Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and thus build a solid relationship with her, but he knows that this would result in putting MJ in harms way, so he remains silent.""Spider-Man 2"" is not an action spectacle, certainly not as hair-raising or as fast-paced as the original. Rather director Sam Raimi's attempt to fashion the human characteristics and foibles of Peter Parker. Very wise move. There are many welcome scenes where Peter merely talks to his aunt (who has some idea of why people need heroes), Mary Jane, Dr. Octavius, Harry and so on. There are some witty exchanges between Parker and his landlord who insists that Pete pay his overdue rent. But something is missing, perhaps some aura or level of surprise. The movie starts in fits and spurts, like a broken engine. There is a blandness in the direction when Raimi aims for those endless close-ups of Maguire's cherubic, sincere face. The movie feels inert at times, hardly as invigorating in the dialogue scenes as in the high-powered action scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too little,"All superheroes are tortured souls, torn between their yearning to fully join the human race and their overarching commitment to duty (kind of like the British Royal Family). Superman, Batman, the Hulk-all of them modern Shakesperean tragic heroes. Spidey's no different. You know, though, I didn't care too much for this movie, and I'll tell you why-at least half the reason you go to these flicks is to examine the villian. Most of the time, they're much more interesting (although not much different) than the hero. Driven by personal pain (see: Penguin, Joker, Darth Vader), they become an image what our hero could have become. Here, we actually have very little insight into the character of the villian, Doc Ock-who is actually being controlled by some mechanical arms. Yes, he lost his wife in the melee, but there's no character development, no real personalization of the war between he and Spiderman. It's just flat. And I don't really care about the relationship between Spiderman and MJ-part of the superhero's appeal is that he's always on the outside looking in, and there's usually a  beautiful woman, i.e., Lois Lane, who symbolizes that. I'm more interested in the relationship between Spidey and Harry, or Spidey and the world. Go back to the roots of superhero lore and the next installment should be much more entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
best comic movie ever,"Spider-Man 2"" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default. The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of ""Smallville""), Michael Chabon (author of ""Wonder Boys""), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for ""Julia"" and ""Ordinary People""), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s. I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee & Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book. This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything. Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down. He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him. He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City. It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the ""Daily Bugle"" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck. With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then. There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off. Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity. But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night. Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.We have all seen the trailer for ""Spider-Man 2"" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them. This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain. The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal. These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train. Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man. More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives ""Spider-Man 2"" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies. This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book. There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly amazing! It's better then the first!,"Yes! Believe it or not, a SEQUEL topped the original!

The movie that defines Spider-Man,"Spider-Man 2 is one of the most beloved super hero movies ever made, and I can see why. Sam Raimi knows damn well how to make a good action movie, and Tobey Maguire knows damn well how to portray Peter Parker.This film tells an amazing story about Peter wishing for what he wants, but having to deal with what he gets and what he needs. The writing is superb, the action scenes are intense and really well shot, and all the characters feel real.This is a film about dreams. Peter dreams of being with MJ. MJ dreams of being an actress. Doc Ock dreams of creating his infinite energy source. Harry dreams of avenging his father. Aunt May dreams of a happy life for Peter, and it's all so well done.Sam Raimi did a great job at making New York a character in this trilogy, especially here. We don't just see civilians looking at a battle, terrified. We see them actually doing things before they even notice the fight. The city itself feels alive and bustling, as New York should be. Sam also knows how to wring out as much enjoyment from action sequences as possible. The fights in the bank and on the train don't do that much to the overall plot, but they still FEEL climactic and tense.Doc Ock's character arc is also insanely well written. Having his arms talk to him in his head is something that I truly won't forget. His sacrifice at the end feels impactful as well. And the scene with the arms in the hospital feels just like something Sam Raimi would make.In short, this movie is almost perfect. I'm sure there are some things that can be improved (don't know what, haven't watched it in all the way through in a while), but what we're left with is undeniably Spider-Man at his greatest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doc Ock pulls this one out of the fire!,"I don't have much good to say about the first half of this movie. Spider angst, no organizational skills, and no social skills threaten to make Peter Parker into one of the great losers of cinematic history. And then the director beats on that concept like a rented mule. He is almost such a shmuck you don't care whether he succeeds or not, which is probably not the target response for your hero. Huge gaps in logic as Spidey's strength comes and goes but ending in a feat of strength so impressive, you absolutely know Sam Raimi has never read one of the comic books that generated his leading man, nor has he considered how that one feat conflicts with any other physical limitation the character has ever shown. Alfred Molina is a breath of fresh air into what starts out as a pretty silly movie. He steals every scene he is in and to me is as good a supervillain as Jack Nicholson was in the original Batman(high praise, for a smaller part). The movie starts out as a video rental but pulls together so strong at the finish that I have to recommend it, although this one seems more geared to older teens than the single digit fans of the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A brutally human and fallible Spider-Man that not everyone will easily swallow.,"This movie is the predictable sequel to the 2002 Spider-Man movie. In this movie, we continue to follow the life of young Peter Parker and his difficulties to reconcile two distinct lives: the masked avenger and the ordinary common guy. The movie is good, has an interesting story and shows a much more human, insecure and teenage Spider-Man than in other films of this superhero, which can be seen as a breath of fresh air in the character.I understand those who say they didn't like the way the main character was thought of in this trilogy. It is something that somehow breaks with the stylized and artificial image of the superhero. It makes perfect sense, though: Peter Parker may have superpowers, but he's still a teenager, a young adult, whatever you want to call it. The action and fighting scenes between heroes and villains are there and the villain is, as in the first movie, the fruit of an accident during a scientific experiment that failed due to his own ego. There is a certain notion of karma here: the villain was not born villain nor is it necessarily and entirely bad, but it is the result of the bad choices he made earlier. His personality, as a villain, is the same as before, but his defects are enhanced and amplified by the powers he has acquired.Problems or defects? Yes, they exist. For starters, the movie wastes more time in unnecessary and accessory scenes than its predecessor. I felt that at times the movie is too long, and that slows the pace a bit. I also found the whole plot strongly predictable. Half an hour before things happened I was mentally anticipating them.Tobey Maguire, you still seem quite satisfactory to me as Spider-Man. He knows how to be a hero without leaving out his more human side. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were also able to keep up with the work done on the first film and, if they didn't get better, they didn't get worse either. Alfred Molina, who gave life to the villain, Dr. Octopus, surprised me by not expecting to see this actor playing this kind of character.Technically, the movie didn't surprise me. I think it has improved a lot in terms of visual effects and CGI when compared to the first movie, and there are some really well filmed scenes. But that is essentially it. The soundtrack is regular, but I'm not even able to hear that ""Spiderman"" song without immediately thinking about ""Spider Pig"" and Homer Simpson. It's stronger than me!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Roger Ebert be damned he lies.,"My only conclusion is that Roger Ebert has sold out and really doesn't Judge movies. First and foremost the movie I am talking about is Spider-Man two, A movie that has been advertised as the greatest super hero movie ever by one of the ""Reputable"" critics in the land Roger Ebert. I will Not make the mistake and judge the movie by the comic books it is a mistake often done and I don't agree. What I will say is check out Spider-man since it is one of those critic proof movies and it won't matter what I say. When you see the movie though look for these things NO SPOILERS AHEAD. One see if the beginning does,t do a great job of setting up a premise advertised on every poster and commercial shown ""CHOICE"" after that see if half way the movie just forgets the beginning and adds just foolishness, some comical scenes that take up time instead of tieing together the movie. Second, check out the production value and see if certain this are left out to make spider man more plain or vulnerable Power wise, rather than adding actual plot twist to combat it. Third towards the end watch as the plot and the characters just become flung towards the ends of the universe, as point and main objectives of the movie aren't met or questioned. Last check for very predictable and boring points making spider man a two bit B film with bad effects to boot, they shoot many seens shadowy just cause when day light hits the scene looks power.Spider Man is a poor attempt to show what an everyday super hero would be. Instead much like the director who did Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban it only shows the limitations of the people directing and producing these movies. It is obvious their imaginations or budget did not match what these stories truly needed. On top of that the wholes created in the plot just to move it along for a sequel is disgusting and pathetic, part of that comes from me reading the comic, Guess Micheal morbius, Mysterio and others will not be there Bye Bye KRaven, but away from the comic it just makes the movie feel awkward and rushed. Spider man 2 was more like a montage of swings and short fight scenes than actual movie scenes and footage. I am sure people will like it no matter what but it you go in there and watch it with an open mind you will see that it is very poorly done and Sam Rami is out of his element.

Not too bad!,"I won tickets to an advance screening of this movie in Sydney.The film is what you would expect from a typical movie version of a comic. Not seeing Spiderman 1 doesn't detract from the movie at all, though reading some of the comics does help. The film itself has some very awesome chase scenes, and as previously mentioned by MisterBling, the CG is quite good (though nothing when compared to The Matrix!)It's a typical Marvel comic... with it's cheesy one liners (though not cheesy as ones found in The Punisher), predictable ending, and the heroes and villains doing the 'ultimate' battle. Oh, and who can forget the damsel in distress!This is a no-brainer movie. Great for watching on a date... it's got everything.

Spidey's back for more web-slinging fun.,"Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Action scenes were on point and it had great visuals!

It really makes you get really mad at Peter and annoyed at him. That really sucks as this movie had an incredible villain Alfred Molina played Doctor octopus and he had a great performance as him! He is one of the best parts of this movie! They also make dr. Octopus Into a great villain by giving him a emotional backstory that makes you really connect with him and understand why he is doing what he is doing.

Greatest cmic book movie ever!,"This is probably one of the best sequels ever made. Sam Raimi is a genius. He gave that film the breath of a marvel comic and that sounds like music in my ears!

And the plot is not too thin which is very important nowadays! Can't wait to get to see ""Spidey 3"" cause it will be very interesting how the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson will move on.

3 out of 5 rating,"I am still 'iffy' on ""how"" Doc-Ock came to be. The good doctor is working on creating a fusion power generator. Cheap, easy, free fuel for the whole planet. The only catch is that there was a ""miscalculation"" that causes the experiment to largely fail...fuse Doc-Ock to his little back-pack dealie with 4 powerful arms, kills his wife, and allowing the advanced 'AI' to influence his mind. Oh yes! The arms can think for themselves, and at times control Doc-Ock. He announces pre-test that the mechanical arms are necessary to do the experiment...as they are super strong, nearly indestructible, and magnetic-proof. But...short of a brief...'this is why I am wearing these arms' which in my mind didn't really give much of a reason to need to attach anything to his body....they really kind of blow his origin story. IMHOOf course the kid playing the Green Goblin's son is back.And once again...remnants of that terrible character almost ruined this one for me as well. Sam Rami...fire this kid. He is a horrible sub-soap actor. His lines are incredibly stupid too. He comes of with one liners like ""I pay the bills"" and ""With my money..."" and variations like that. He basically beats Doc-Ock over the head informing him constantly ""who he (Doc-Ock) works for"".I guess the whole movie felt rushed to me. The middle especially. I think Rami had a checklist of things he wanted to include in this movie.....so at about the 45 minute mark....it kind of becomes a mess.Spiderman loses his powers briefly. Why? Because he loses ""focus"". He's under a lot of stress so the poor guy can't seem to get it up. His webs stop working, he falls a lot. He can no longer climb walls either. Funny how he stayed 'ripped' tho. His eyesight goes bad again re-requiring the glasses he ditched in the first film. And he quits. Stops being Spiderman for a while. Crime in the city jumps by 75% and Spider is convinced by Aunt May (who supposedly doesn't know he's Spiderman, but speaks to him about the importance of being a hero, and why Spiderman shouldn't quit because little kids need heros..yadda yadda. So, Spidey puts the suit back on. Then his powers return.What?He regains focus....he something filler, more filler....and now he has his powers back.whatever.This, however, is where the movie starts to pick back up.Gong into the movie, I was frightened that they'd mess up Doc Ock like they did the GG. But, I was spared that. Doc Ock is now...IMHO...one of the best movie villains ever. Beautifully done...if not hampered by silly lines a good chunk of the time.So, really....I have 3 problems with it.1: Most Important. They rushed the middle I think. 2: James Franco is a horrible actor and ruined every scene he was in. 3: Kirsten Dunst is ALSO a terrible actress...though not nearly as bad as Franco. Not only did this films Mary Jane have zero sex appeal but she looks fairly terrible throughout the whole movie. Lot's of close-ups on her half opened eyes (put the bong down) which reminded me of Garfield. Maybe it's just her Cat shaped head. I dunno. But her lines are some of the best in the movies, and she blows'em. In an Uncool way.It may be assumed that everything I DON'T complain about here...I absolutely loved. The effects are outstanding...mostly because they're seamless this time. The CGI is some of the best I have seen. Not to mention the sequences with SM ""flying"" through the city on his webs is outstanding...and has the capability of making a casual movie goer with a weak stomach sick. Bring It On! I say! Good stuff. SM himself is outstanding. Tobey nailed this character.The over-all story is solid, and there are nice toucher oh humor everywhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent second installment!,"This movie was brilliant and remember I am a girl, and therefore not into comic books at all.From the fantastic opening titles which briefly retold the first movie to help you remember it, in case you hadn't seen it recently, to the better than expected ending.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continued their good work from the first movie, and the rest of the returning cast were great, especially the newspaper editor, whose name I can never remember (sorry).The story had a good pace and enough impact moments to keep you going, and the dramatic portions were usually followed by some humor or a good action scene to move the story along, and there is still plenty to tell for a third installment too.I couldn't find any faults with the movie at all - the special effects were fantastic, I know a lot of it was CGI, but it was not obvious CGI, and the music really went with the movie in total.The only question I ever have with superhero movies is - where do their clothes go to? But that's too prosaic to worry about when it's a Marvel type story, so I will just brush that thought to one side.I gave this movie a 10 because in my view it is well worth the price of a movie ticket, in fact I could go see it again and would not begrudge paying twice (but since I have a subscription card I go free anyway!).The 10 vote was not because it is the best movie I have ever seen, it was because it is 100% worth seeing, just bear in mind there are some violent parts that may not be suitable for either young children, or people who are bothered by that kind of thing.Thank God for Spiderman, I watched it back to back with Thunderbirds and if you are reading this review for pity's sake, do NOT see that movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You don't just know what is going to happen, you even know *how* it is going to happen.It's always the same procedure: love story - Fight - Peters Problems - Fight - Peter's Mum - Fight - love story - Final Fight.Even the special effects are not breathtaking.

Greatest Comicbook Movie of all time,"Spider-Man 2 (2004) directed by Sam Rami and starring Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina. Spider-Man 2 follows the sequel of Peter Parker (Maguire), battling between his identity, his friendship and the villain of the film Doctor Octavis (Molina). Spider-Man 2 is the greatest superhero/ comic-book movie of all time and has much as I consider the Dark Knight the gold standard of CBM film making, Spider- Man 2 is still the peak. That movie? Nolans TDK to me will never surpass. Yes from cinematography, to sound design, to writing, The Dark Knight is the CBM that every studio director and writer try and mimic. But we're talking 13 years of Spider-Man 2 being called the greatest, over Batman (1989) and Superman (1978) it had suspense, comedy, romance, character development, an enthralling sub plot behind Aunt Mays financial problems, to Doc Ock. The CGI was fantastic and wasn't used as a crutch like the next 3 Sony projects to follow. The story was heavy hearted and sad, and the plot was actually really good. And the acting has never been any better. Overall my grade rating is 100% (A+) I really love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
utter crap,"It surprises that movies like Spider-Man 2 often gets such glowing reviews from the critics but movies like Bad Boys II gets critically blasted by everyone. This has to be one of the worse movies that has been released theatrically this year. Even though I seen this movie a month ago, I felt like it was time to re-comment on this film. The main reason for this film's disappointment is because the tired old formula that is being used in superhero movies and action movies these days, which happens to be love. I'm so tired of producers wanting to throw love in every action movie that comes out. Don't they know that love messes up the whole movie!!!!!!! Geez, I understand if this movie or any other movies in this genre or any action movies period have love in it but it was too sappy from the beginning. Even some of the dialogue was cheesy. Peter Parker saying corny stuff like ""Punch me, I bleed!"" What kind of young person our age says stuff like that? This movie had more love then a Jenna Jameson film! This was another potentially good action film that was ruined by the theme of love. Like I said it still amazes me how movies like these get critcal praise but if Jean Claude Van Damme releases a movie it have to be deemed as ""the worse movie of all time or ""the worse movie of his career."" It surprises me that many people said that this movie was really good because this is a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time and many individuals agree that sequels aren't better then the original(at least that's not my opinion). I mean when you go into a theater expecting an action movie, you'll get this movie-a two hour love triangle about a superhero who doesn't know whether if he should continue being spider-man or fall in love with that no good Mary Jane. I assure you this, If I would've liked this movie, no one else would've liked it. Skip this one when it comes out on t.v. and DVD.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A little less talk and a lot more action,"Although this movie as a whole was entertaining, it had it's moments when you were looking at your wristwatch wondering when the next ""good scene"" would arrive. Although romance is good in a comic book & its big screen counterpart, it shouldn't be the heart of the movie. My feeling is that Sony Pictures was trying to target a larger co-ed audience and not target specifically the males exclusively. In addition to the romance storyline, the story further developed the life and emotions of Peter Parker and the effects of his uncle's death towards him and Aunt May.Another key point is that this movie needed more action between the villain and hero. Spidey's key nemesis isn't introduced in full-villain form until almost 45 minutes into the movie. Aside from fiscal/possessional gain, Doc Ock doesn't have any real purpose for opposing Spidey. Also, there isn't but about 10 minutes of dueling between the two of them.As far as the acting goes I think Maguire does not fit the mold of Spidey. I have a lasting image of the constipated look on Parker's face as he's trying to long jump the gap between the two buildings. The best acting in the movie would belong to J.K. Simmons (J.J. Jameson).Any true Spider-Man fan will like the movie for the comic nature of it alone, but will still be longing for the ultimate comic-book-to-big-screen conversion that I haven't seen since Tim Burton's Batman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Spider Man,This movie is the best Spider Man-Movie of Tobey Maguire's Trilogy. Peter Parker/ Tobey Maguire's Spider Man was the best in this movie and it's not even close. Dr. Otto did a really great job and he is a really good villain and made the movie more interesting. The movie is a 10/10 and I would recommend to Marvel fans and Spider-Man fans obviously. If you've never watched a spider man movie you should definitely watch this one.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"But, how can this film be in best 250?","Maybe we'd also give it several Oscars as well, wouldn't we? Just because Peter seems the next Jim's mate in Dumb&Dumber 3 and they pick Tobey's eyes before every scene, it doesn't mean any strange nor deep travel inside the complexly tormented personality of Spiderman. The love story.... sucks. As in the first movie, the best is Kirsten's nipples.Stupid staff: - Dr. Octopus needs the money for buying material for a new machine: will he go to a K-Mart with this money or has he thought better to order all material through internet store (address: this iron hodgepodge near the river).... come on? - How to stop the chemical sunny reaction at the end of the film?...

"Superior to the original, with some problems worked out!","Before going to see this sequel to 2002's ""Spider-Man"", I read a very positive review of it, and after doing so, I had high expectations! Surprisingly, I left the theatre disappointed that night, and failed to see how it was superior to the first (many clearly to believe it is). However, after watching ""Spider-Man"" again on the small screen more than 2 1/2 years later, all the praise the movie has received suddenly made sense to me!It has been two years since the events we saw in the first movie took place. Peter Parker is still Spider-Man, but unfortunately, he hasn't been having the best of luck lately. His life as Spider-Man is causing nothing but trouble in his life as Peter Parker. He can't seem to ever be punctual, which makes it very hard for him to keep a job and make it to his university classes. Also, due to misunderstandings, Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osborn no longer consider him their friend! His life as Spider-Man isn't going so well, either, as lately, his powers have often been malfunctioning, and the Daily Bugle is constantly trying to make him look bad to the city. So, Peter decides to give up his life as Spider-Man and move on. However, with a new villain threatening the town, Dr. Octopus (Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist whose invention has gone wrong and taken control of him), it appears that Spider-Man is needed!I guess I was disappointed when I saw ""Spider-Man 2"" in the theatre because it was a bit darker and more dramatic than I expected. However, when I watched the movie again, I was obviously prepared for that, and managed to see a lot more in the film. It definitely has more funny moments than its predecessor (there certainly aren't any moments in the first ""Spider-Man"" movie that can match the part where Peter is on an elevator in his Spider-Man suit). Also, despite some dragging around the beginning, the excitement is probably more consistent, with more action in the movie, and the dialogue, while not always perfect, doesn't get quite as cheesy as it sometimes gets in the first movie. This second installment involves more romance between Peter and Mary Jane, but it never gets quite as embarrassing as it does at least once in the first.Sequels may not usually turn out to be as good or superior to their predecessors, but ""Spider-Man 2"" turned out to be one of those rare cases! Overall, this is certainly not an absolutely perfect superhero flick, but it comes closer to being one than the original ""Spider-Man"" movie adaptation. So, I wouldn't expect this movie to be quite the same as the 2002 blockbuster. I also wouldn't expect it to be quite the same as the comics, if you're at all familiar with those. However, if you want good action, a bit of humour, and some drama, you will likely find it all in this 2004 smash hit!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
re:  Near Perfect,"I have only just watch this movie. And its one of those movies that makes you look at yourself. Its thats good. The Cgi effects aren't over the top, its well integrated within this movie. I like this movie better then the first movie, as the story is even stronger.It gave us the chance to see what being a superhero really must be like. Everything is put on hold for Spiderman.I think Spiderman is the real reason why Marvel Comics enjoyed so much success. But I still like the X-men.The are different plots and lines within the movie that make it worth while watching throughout the film.Mary Jane - and her agonising choice between her choice and Peter Parker.Peter Parker and his relationship with his boss, Mr Jonah Jameson.The flash back conversation between Peter Parker and his Uncle.His relationship between Peter Parker and his best friend.A real good movie, that really shows how Peter Parker came over many of the hurdles mentioned above.The action is first class as well. I think that the best shots are still with him Webslinging his way throughout New York. It looks fantastic.Please let have Spiderman 8. Please don't finish off this wonderful Superhero character....If you read the stories of Spiderman you will realise that he has many, many stories that can be used......If you are reading this Hollywood take note.This is one of the finest Superhero movies ever made.

Fun action adventure,"Spider-Man 2 continues from where the first one ended. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is trying to divide his life between real life and his career as a Spider-Man, while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is franticly trying to find out who spider is, so he could wreak his vengeance upon him because of his father Norman, who was the Green Goblin. Meanwhile Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is trying to figure out if Peter is worth the effort and if she should just go on with her own life. And then we have Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who will turn into Doc Ock after a small mishap.In all Spider 2 is more complete and better rounded up movie than the first one was, because the main players are already introduced and this time they can grow better as characters. Only new character to be introduced really is Dock Ock, which is a part that Molina deliverers very nicely. The script holds together, the acting is good and direction very fitting to the story.Even though Spider-Man has never been my favourite comic hero, this movie does deliver good entertainment and I found it to be good presentation of the hero. It certainly is worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Aunt Mae, where are all my Comic-Books?""","The major Principles Return for the Sequel to the Mega-Hit and Deliver, once again, about as much Fun, Social Commentary, and Mayhem one can expect from a Mega-Budgeted Movie of this sort.One could comment, and many have, about the endless Restating of Spider-Man and Mary Jane's on again off again Romance and the Heavy Handed retelling of both the Yearning and Dismissal of the Two. It gets to be a Bit Much.Putting that aside, the New Villain, Doctor Octopus, is brought to the Screen with an Incredible visual Accuracy of Doc Ock's First Appearance in the pages of the Sixties Comic. Alfred Molina is a Scary piece of work. Along with His Alter-Ego it is a Villainous Vulgarity. He has No Qualms about Dropping and Old Lady to Her Death in a Heartbeat.The Effects are Outstanding for the Creature and His Metal Limbs become a Presence to be reckoned with.

Spider-man 2 A Much Better Than Expected Sequel,"Spider-man 2 was a much better than expected sequel. It's better than the original with more improved special effects, humor, a nasty villain, and more intense action. Director Sam Raimi did a great job of making this sequel which is the best of the three films. Spider-man 3 unfortunately was the worst of the trilogy. This one however is definitely worth seeing because it's that good. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-man and he continues to be a good choice for the character. Peter's now in college and what he wants more than anything is a normal life but his character feels a duty to protect people with his amazing arachnid abilities. Kristen Dunst returns as Mary Jane and she's okay in the part but like the previous one she isn't good much to do except eventually being the lady in distress again later on in the film. James Franco is back again as Harry Osbourn who blames Spider-man for his father's death. Franco does a decent job as Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do and his character lacks screen time. Alred Molina joins the cast as brilliant scientist Otto Octavious who after a freak accident becomes Doc Ock because of four mechanic arms melded to his back. Molina like Dafoe makes for a menacing villain and is well developed. Also his character fortunately doesn't have a corny costume like the Green Golbin did in the original. No offense. Rosemary Harris also reprises her supporting role as Peter's Aunt May. She isn't really given much to do either but Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited screen time and Bruce Campbell shows up once again in a cameo appearance as a theater usher. The special effects are an improvement over the first one and so are the action/ fight sequences most of them between Spider-man and his nemesis Doc Ock. The one standing out is of course their fight that starts off on a skyscraper near a giant clock and then on top of a speeding train thats grows more intense as their confrontation escalates toward it's conclusion. The final showdown between Spider-man and Doc Ock near the end was a bit of a letdown compared to train one but everything else that happened before in the movie made up for the somewhat rushed conclusion. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally problems that the original had too but this sequel is still a very good movie. It was much better than expected and I was fairly impressed with the film overall. Spider-man 2 is one of the best sequels (besides The Dark Knight, and T2 Judgement Day) out there with just the right amount of well balanced intense action, character development, humor, drama, some suspense, and impressive performances by the cast especially Molina that's sure to please almost any comic book fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a well done sequel,"As the ""Evil Dead"" movies showed, Sam Raimi knows how to do a good job with sequels, and ""Spider-Man 2"" affirms that. This one has the title character (Tobey Maguire) battling Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) while still wooing Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Granted, this IS a sequel, so one might wonder how much they can do without repeating things from the original. Well, they have a lot in store for ya. I will say that Doc Ock doesn't look quite as menacing as the Green Goblin, but he's still one nasty dude.All in all, I don't know whether I would call this a masterpiece, but Sam Raimi still has some good ideas. To paraphrase the first movie, he has shown great power and great responsibility. Most of the cast from the original (James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, Bruce Campbell) also returns. Quite good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spinning a web,"Sam Raimi in his second installment about the comics hero, Spiderman, outdoes himself. The film is not only pleasant to the eye, but it's  fun to watch. The technical details are incredible. The movie will keep the viewer entertained with all the high acrobatics and daredevil tricks.The only thing that bothered me, is that this Spiderman is bicoastal, or maybe bicitizen. I'll explain: During the elevated train scene we are given a view of Second City, Chicago, as those trains only circulate in that city, but not in New York, and that's been so for many years. It's incredible that we're watching something taking place in Gotham and suddenly we're in the Loop with danger to fall into Lake Michigan if Spiderman doesn't stop that train. Maybe it was only me, but since I couldn't stay to check the credits, I've no idea if it's indicated in them.Toby Maguire does a tremendous job as the hero who spins webs all over the city. Kirsten Dunst is also appealing as M.J., the woman that Peter Parker adores. Alfredo Molina is excellent, as always, as the bad scientist who is a monster. Rosemary Harris as the aunt is perfect and James Franco is also good.A fun time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A comic book movie for adults? No way!,"In ""Spider-Man"" we got the introduction, and now we get the story -- a darker, deeper, more poignant tale that defies the boundaries of comic book movies and dares to venture into the territory of motion picture excellence.The first ""Spider-Man"" was a very good movie, and one of my favorite films from 2002. It contained a sort of underlying complexity, surrounded by a simple cover that made it worthy of recommendation. The setup of Peter Parker's superhero powers was the most entertaining aspect of the movie, and its fight scenes were explosive in more ways than just one.Now, in ""Spider-Man 2,"" the complexity becomes even more elaborate. The film takes on a dark edge that deals with the hero behind the mask -- Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), the human being, not Spider-Man, the invincible superhero alter ego. The action is reduced to secondary importance; the characters take first place. It studies them, their motivations; what makes them tick. The first film didn't only introduce Spider-Man, but also his friends -- now, we sit back and watch their progression unfold on screen.The film picks up two years after the original. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) continues his academic pursuits, whilst parading about as Spider-Man when he finds the time. However, with his grades falling, his part-time jobs failing, his love life crashing and his social life burning, Peter decides to abandon his alter ego persona and develop a social life. Then ""Dr. Octopus"" (Alfred Molina) -- an eight-limbed fusion of human form and robotics -- begins to terrorize the city, in the hopes of resurrecting a science project that turned him into the ""mechanical monster"" he is. The four extra limbs have altered the Doctor's personality, and he is no longer a friendly scientist but a deadly villain. With crime rate up 75%, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) marrying a famous astronaut, Harry Osborn (James Franco) planning revenge on Spider-Man, and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) losing trust in her nephew, Peter must choose between his friends and his duties -- be Spider-Man, or Peter Parker? His final decision is predictable, but the film deals with his course of actions leading up to his final decision, and adds a strong sense of humanity and realistic struggle to a rather unrealistic story.Doc Ock was always my favorite villain from the Spider-Man franchise (closely followed, or equaled, by Venom, who is rumored to show up in the next installment), and Alfred Molina does a commendable job of portraying him. He isn't exactly how I had imagined him, but far more believable given the circumstances of his transformation. Maguire once again proves that he can handle this role and Dunst is given a larger part in the film, whereas Franco is thankfully given less screen time (although the implications of his final appearance in the movie are breathtaking).Some action enthusiasts might be disappointed in the lack of constant fighting in ""Spider-Man 2,"" and the majority of the film is indeed spent focusing on the characters. I liked this. ""Spider-Man 2"" returns to the roots of comic books, in which the characters are the focus -- not the action.  I am not a comic book fan, but one thing I have gathered over the years is that comic books do present an extraordinary medium for character study -- comics allow people across the world to share the trials and tribulations of the story's protagonist(s). ""X-Men"" was successful because it utilized this structure of storytelling, placing unbelievable characters in a believable world; ""Spider-Man 2"" is even better, one of the most thrilling rides in years. It creates a surge of joy that I haven't experienced since the first ""Spider-Man"" came out.All in all I think most praise should be given to director Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead,"" ""Army of Darkness,"" ""A Simple Plan""), who handles the material with respect for the fans, while simultaneously managing to entice non-fans into Spidey's web. And the movie manages to have a lot of fun despite its serious nature -- look for a cameo by Bruce ""Ash"" Campbell from the ""Evil Dead"" franchise as a so-called snooty usher, and even a brief appearance by Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin (yes, he's still dead, but his spirit lives on).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ho-hum,"As a comic book geek and a Sam Raimi fan, I really expected much more from this film. I wasn't a big fan of the first film, and this film had flashes of greatness but really fell flat for the most part.The action sequences were excellent, though some were intensely (and unnecessarily) violent. The CGI looks much better than the first film's, and makes this one worth seeing.The biggest flaw in the film is the fact that it includes long, drawn-out (and frankly boring) sequences of exposition that detract from the action. I'm tired of seeing the inner struggle of Peter Parker. Where the heck is Spider-Man?I hope in Spider-Man 3 that there will be less Aunt May, and more butt kicking.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Comic Book Movie. Ever.,"Not that Spider Man 2 has much competition for the above title, but rest assured that it will remain at the top of that list for a very, very long time. The film certainly does not represent Raimi's or Maguire's (or Dunst's even) finest moments, but they put together such a terrific package that it's impossible to dislike.Spider Man 2 represents a great amalgamation of special effects, story, character, and feeling. It is everything the first Spider Man was not, namely exciting, thought-provoking, and moving.Spider Man was a noticeably weak film, as most origin stories are, with an unbelievably weak villain (it's hard to believe that Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin could be so...dull). The movie was nicely diverting for the two hours you spend at the theaters but, when you left, you left without any residual effects. Spider Man left your mind as soon as you got outside the multiplex.Spider Man 2 is different. Aside from its lackluster name (why wasn't its AKA Amazing Spider Man used?), there's nothing wrong with the film. The effects are fantastic and, unlike in the original, do not draw attention to themselves. The performances in Spider Man were adequate and here the central roles are solid. Maguire and Dunst do not ""act better"" necessarily, but they are required to show more depth and intricacy than in the original film. Alvin Sargent is a very capable screenwriter and brings to this screenplay a craftmanship missing from David Koepp's. Sargent has more experience writing emotional nuance; for Spider Man's character, emotional nuance is key. Capturing Peter Parker's torture and ambivalence is no easy task; it requires a deft pen and Sargent came through. I'm also sure Michael Chabon's involvement did not hurt.What also separates Spider Man 2 from its predecessor is its humor. Spider Man lacked Raimi's typical gallows humor; the sequel, though certainly dark in tone, has moments of great slapstick humor. Raimi seems more in control of this picture, more assured in his ability to create a big-budget extravaganza.This confidence, I think, made the movie better. Raimi, more willing to take chances, swung for the fences and made it.Spider Man 2 is the best summer, popcorn movie I've seen since AI. It's also one of the few times a movie deserves its immense success. Though you should have seen this on the big screen (twice), I hope it will translate well to TV where everyone can enjoy it over and over.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Like X2, the annoyance of Cyclops cannot be lost; in this franchise it takes the form of Kirsten Dunst and Rosmary Harris. The CG spidey is still unrealistic but looks better than in part one. All in all it is a far superior movie but it doesn't reach the heights of X2 because of director Sam Raimi, the impending success of this one will ensure he sticks around for part 2 but I think the franchise will reach new heights once they change directors.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The main appeal of the film though is surely the special effects and stunts, which are spectacular beyond belief, even if the train sequence is something one would expect Superman to pull off but not Spider-Man.

How a film from 2004 has become my all time favourite comic book movie in 2017,"I might had seen Spider-Man 2 (or parts of it) many-many years ago, but I couldn't clearly remember, and since I heard so many people praise this movie recently, I finally decided to check it out. And I'm so happy I did, because this movie is great!First of all, it's masterfully written and directed. The characters are well fleshed out, the story is engaging and emotional, the camera- work is fantastic, and there's a lot of humour in it.The performances (Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina) are all solid, but if I had to pick my favourite character from the movie, it would be J. Jonah Jameson played by J.K. Simmons. He shines throughout the film, his lines and the way he delivers them are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and he looks as if he jumped right out of the comics. Which, by the way, can be said about the whole movie. Spider-Man 2 is unapologetic about being a comic book adaptation, it doesn't try to be overly realistic, you can tell, Sam Raimi had fun making it.Spider-Man 2, for me, is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre, because it puts the emphasis on the people, their relationships, their character development, and it's not just a fun comic book flick, but a great film with genuine humour, heartfelt drama and a couple of spectacular action sequences (watch out for the train scene!). There are several subplots (Peter's relationship with MJ, his friendship with Harry, his relationship with Aunt May, the story of Doctor Octopus), but the movie handles all of them in a way that it doesn't feel bloated, and by the end they're all resolved in a very satisfying way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Improvement on the first in every department and still a contender for the best Spider-Man movie.,"Taking place two years after the first in order to give a glimpse into the college life of Spider-Man is super refreshing after seeing all the high school Spidey stuff in the MCU.The increase in budget after the success of the first movie is evident, the fight scenes are crazy good in this movie as Spider-Man and Doc Ock make for some great building-scaling fights, plus that super amazing train scene!Speaking of Doc Ock, Raimi continues with excellent casting. I can't see anyone else playing the character now. They also do a great job of humanizing the character with his interactions with Peter beforehand. Overall, I think the characterization for everyone was done wonderfully.The movie also knew how to be serious when it needed to be. Peter and Mary Jane is a complicated relationship done right, making you want him to win the girl no matter what.And the heart dropping scene of Peter telling Aunt May what really happened to Uncle Ben was so well done. This movie is sad while also being way funnier than the first. Jameson gets more screen time and I love it!Definitely one of the best superhero movies I've seen in a while, if not of all time.

Spider-Man at his Best,"Why is Spider-Man such an enduring character? Part of this is the way that he connects with people- it has been noted that his costume covers every inch of his body, so you can't tell who's inside it. Because of this, it's easy for anyone, regardless of race or gender, to imagine themselves as Spider-Man. He is such a relatable character, because at his heart, Spider-Man is just an ordinary kid, with ordinary problems, who just happens to have superpowers. He is still vulnerable and has plenty of everyday problems in spite of, or even because of, his status as a superhero. This is what makes Spider-Man who he is, and why 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"" works so well.""Spider-Man 2"" is the definitive Spider-Man movie because of how well it nails this central aspect of the character. Throughout the picture, we see how Peter Parker's responsibilities as a superhero have negative effects on his personal life- he has trouble maintaining a job, difficulty paying rent, and he's unable to have proper relationships with those he cares about. We as an audience understand his hopes and dreams, and feel his frustrations when everything doesn't work out- we connect with him, and want to see him pull through. The movie works because it is, first and foremost, a character piece.But that is not to say that ""Spider-Man 2"" is not a superhero movie- far from it. Although the movie is frequently a very compelling drama, it still has more than its fair share of exciting action scenes, in one of several areas improving on its 2002 predecessor. The movie's set- pieces are expertly crafted, filled with energy and excitement. In contrast to the cartoony physics of its predecessor, ""Spider-Man 2"" has more realism to it, grounded but still stylized enough to feel like a comic book movie. The many scenes of the titular character swinging through the city are breathtaking, and make the viewer feel as if they are Spider-Man. And the ""train sequence"" is not only the best action scene in a Spider-Man movie, but also one of the best action scenes in any superhero movie, period. This is one of the best superhero movies in terms of its structure, with equal doses of action and drama, neither one ever overpowering the other- it feels natural and organic.This is also one of the best comic book movies in terms of its tone and style. The movie presents a perfect balance between realism and stylization that is perfectly fitting for its source material. The movie recognizes that in matching the relatability of its protagonist with its setting, the depicted New York City must feel grounded and realistic. But at the same time, it acknowledges that this is a comic book movie, and doesn't shy away from the silliness inherent to the genre- after all, this is a movie where the kid from ""Pleasantville"" jumps around in red and blue spandex and fights a guy called Dr. Octopus. Although there is plenty of drama and seriousness, the picture is also quite funny. (Ex: Pretty much any scene with J.K. Simmons) This is a movie that knows exactly what it is- nothing more, nothing less.On top of that, the movie is rather impeccably cast. Tobey Maguire nails the boyish charm and relatability that is essential to Spider-Man, crafting a character that we root for throughout the entire movie. Although she didn't have as much to do in the first movie, Kirsten Dunst really grows into the character of Mary Jane in this one, becoming more of a deeply realized character. Alfred Molina turns Dr. Octopus, traditionally a rather one- dimensional, cackling supervillain, and transforms him into a deep and tragic figure, a good man with good intentions who goes down the wrong direction. And Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons are each so perfectly matched to their characters that they seem to leap off the pages of the comic- Simmons in particular captures the nature of J. Jonah Jameson so well that he stands among Christopher Reeve, Heath Ledger, and Robert Downey Jr. as one of the best castings in any superhero film.""Spider-Man 2"" is pretty much a perfect superhero movie. It nails every detail perfectly, making the correct balance between action and drama, between seriousness and fun. It is both exhilarating and thoughtful, and can be enjoyed even by those who aren't traditionally fans of the genre. ""Spider-Man 2"" is by far the best Spider-Man movie, and is right up there with the best superhero movies ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
another perfect sequel,"Just like 1st sequel this one is perfect too. High presence of technology, science, reality...except of course for the few things that makes this scifi. Ironically the science part - the fusion - is very real and in time with current real life science events. That is what makes it more interesting.

It's a terrible joke... But thank you for coming.,"I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year. While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X-Men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history. I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best ""character study"" films of the year. That this sequel was more than just good vs. evil, but also an inner dilemma between Parker's personal lives and that which he has been called to do. While this may have been the case, what actually translated onto the screen was a reassurance that Toby Maguire was miscast, Kirsten Dunst is loosing her sexual appeal (though Raimi felt enough self-guilt to place her in water to reveal her ""bits and pieces"" for the pre-teen in all of us), and that you can go too far with a villain creating a cartoon instead of a physically frightening creature.So, where do I begin? At first I had hope, here we find ourselves following Peter as he attempts to get to work after noticing that he was running late. He has just a few minutes to deliver some pizzas (oh, how the mighty do fall) or he will be fired from his job. He apparently really needs this job, so he resorts to transforming himself into his alter-ego personality Spider-man to help him get out of the tight situation. While we are stunned by this cheap display of his super powers, we assume that it will show that Spider-man is a crafty guy. Immediately, we are proved wrong as Peter Parker is fired and forced to go back to his run-down apartment that he cannot afford. Instead of showing us a hero for children to look up to, we have a guy that says to the youth of our nation, be late to work, don't pay rent, and everything will be just fine. This is not the character that I was hoping for. This only leads us deeper into the mind of Peter Parker as he struggles to maintain a very busy life. Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up. When life throws you lemons, go ahead and cry like the babies that you are, or at least like Toby Mcguire has patented.Spider-man is not the hero for our youth. He is not the passionate crime-fighter that we have envisioned or at least that was drawn for me in the first film. Instead, Toby is given the possibility to ""grow"" his character and give him ""5000 dimensions"" that continually fail. He uses the technique of huge-teary eyes to portray the struggle that is happening inside of him. He never really feels strong. He never really makes a decision. He only does what the villain forces him to do. He continually remains indecisive and weak through all moments of this film. I lost respect of his heroine status. I instead saw him as this whiny kid that couldn't handle the pressures of the job that he was handed. He cries, and is wimpy instead of showing a true emotional struggle. This only proved to me that you couldn't take an independent actor, one that prides himself on the dramatic element, and give him a role in a huge-budget film. I once thought of this in the first film, but this sequel only proves my theory correct.This goes the same for Kirsten Dunst, who progressively became uglier throughout the film and whose bosoms fluctuated in size in nearly every shot. She was drenched yet again for the pre-teen audience and for those that like to use the stop-motion feature on their DVD player. She was useless, and perhaps should be replaced for the third installment to this series. Finally, there was the unsupportive villain that seemed less ""evil"" and more like a cartoon Elmer Fudd, constantly messing up and not really causing any chaos or destruction. He didn't frighten the people of Spider-man's city, so why should I be frightened of him? Molina was horribly cast as Doc Ock, only proving that a large man with tons of robotic work can be evil, or at least try to be evil.Finally, I would like to say that Raimi needs to go back to his roots. For me to ever be interested in one of his films again (especially after this sequel), I would need to see Raimi go back to his roots. He needs less money, better scripts, and an unknown cast that can prove themselves and try something new. All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters. It was sad, it was poor, and it was an inexcusable issue. Raimi is a ""cult"" film director that has eyes the size of Toby whenever money is thrown his way. This was a very poor film. It was exactly what Hollywood represents and the type of film that I despise. There was no substance, no structure, and nothing exciting about this sequel. It was, for lack of a better word, very poor. I am embarrassed to say that I have seen this film, and will deny it whenever anyone asks. This is my final word on this film. Good-bye!

"""There's a hero in all of us""","Cinema as unabashed heroism. A spirited expansion of Raimi's first installment but contained in feeling. If Spider-Man was a hokey (but beautifully earnest) origin story, Spider-Man 2 is a tightly plotted comic-book masterpiece, utilizing duality as a basis for the film's tender romance versus its unhinged, euphoric action set-pieces. With a brilliant villain in Doc Ock (wonderfully played by Alfred Molina/Rahad Jackson), this remarkable sequel builds conflict out of Peter Parker's personal relationships, allowing seeds from the original film to grow and blossom yet never restricting itself as a ""sequel"" that can't be viewed on its own.Sam Raimi is the star of the show here even with the Grade-A cast of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J.K. Simmons and the aforementioned Alfred Molina. Every scene has its own particular life and genre to it, whizzing past Horror, Romance, Action, and Drama so that the best aspects are carefully picked and placed in the right moment at the right time. It *feels* like a comic-book - like panels manifesting on the screen - and multiple sequences evoke that same kind of tactility and essence. Whether it's a villain introduction with enough discordant screams and jarring clangs of metal and flesh to give children nightmares or a train fight scene of immaculate power and excitement, Raimi effortlessly crafts it all.But it isn't excessively dour or ""dark"" (see: Jared Leto sending used condoms to his costars) in spite of tackling mature issues. It knows the core of the Spider-Man character, his importance and grace, his weaknesses and flaws. The exaggerated, geeky world that Sam Raimi created is full of peril, but the viewer trusts the hero of the story, who after saving a train full of people, to get right back up and fight for his city. It's why ""he's just a kid, no older than my son."" or ""don't worry, we won't tell nobody."" melts my heart into a gigantic puddle, for I feel for the bystanders just as much as the hero; a triumphant savior swinging against the sky.However, I'd say that my heart collapses even more with each viewing because of the romance between Tobey and Kirsten; a classic story forged out of longing for a connection felt ever since the late- night trash trips in the backyard. When Mary Jane asks for a kiss, it's not only hopefully for a recognition of love, but for a recognition of a hero. That upside down kiss in the darkened alleyway as rain fell down their bodies meant more for both of them than you'd think, and when that satisfaction is cut short through Doc Ock (again, personal influences can't stay out of both sides of Peter's life), the audience experiences the same fearlessness, the same passion, the same goddamn HEROISM as Peter as he bursts out of the coffee shop rubble (Raimi's usage of heightened cinema is unstoppable) with his vision clear and his mind opened.And when it's all over, the infatuation is limitless, with doves taking flight and piercing white and orange hues signaling a yearning hope for a better day. A world where subway passengers protect their hero without hesitation. ""Go get em, Tiger."" she says as he dives into the crisp summer air, unaware if he's coming back but understanding that fact. Mary Jane's face says it all. As he merges with the sunset, we're thinking the same thing. Spider-Man 2 feels like a literal end to a certain kind of Superhero film, one with the freedom for montages, exaggerated lightning and thunder claps, and above all, a close- up with two lovers suspended in midair against a web.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best Sequels and Superhero Movies Ever Made,"""Spider-Man 2"" is a very rare thing, a sequel to an outstanding film that far surpasses that film. This film does everything right. It takes all of the best elements of its predecessor and expands on them.Tobey Maguire once again nails it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. His character is given great depth, and it was brilliant the way they dealt with the split personalities of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. The relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane is further explored in this one.Alfred Molina as Doctor Octavius makes for one of the best villains ever in a superhero movie. As a villain, he is very threatening with his deadly mechanical tentacles, but at the same time, he's a character you really feel for.The story is very compelling and dramatic. Peter decides to quit being Spider-Man and tries to live a normal life, and meanwhile, Mary Jane is going to get married. However, when Mary Jane is in trouble at the hands of Doc Ock, he realizes that Spider-Man is his true calling.The action scenes are truly magnificent. They are expertly directed, thrilling, and truly edge-of-your-seat. The stand-out, of course, is the fight on the train between Spider-Man and Doc Ock. So exhilarating and flawlessly orchestrated, it may well be the greatest action scene ever in a superhero movie.The supporting cast is once again stellar, as is the soundtrack. You also gotta love the message that sometimes you have to make sacrifices to do what is right.The first film still has a special place in my heart, but this film outdoes it in pretty much every way. It has a better villain, a more mature storyline, and action sequences even more enthralling than before. A must-see movie and one of the best sequels and superhero films of all time.RATING: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A far more superior follow-up to the first!,"Seeing as how Spider-Man became a huge success, Sam Raimi decided to make a sequel in order to capture the spirit that made the first film a huge critical hit and two years later, in 2004, he succeeded, but not only that. This film takes everything from the first spider-man and transfered and transforms itself into a far more superior follow-up! While the first spider-man wasn't a masterpiece due to it's clunky editing and corny dialog, this film has absolutely no flaws at all.The story is much more compelling than the first, the visuals are fantastically made, the pacing is wonderfully brisk, the special effects are top-notch, and the music score from Danny Elfman is as better as ever with some atmospheric moments throughout this follow-up. The strongest aspects goes to the much stronger acting (Tobey Macguire and Kirsten Dunst gave their solid performances and are as likable as ever. Alfred Molina is a great villain and lives up to the Green Goblin from the first and the other actors did well especially James Franco.) and the groundbreaking action especially the fight scenes with Spiderman and Doctor Octopus.Overall, a far more superior film that is always worth-watching.

Cool movie ! from l3ad BOy,"This is why they invented movies. It's a dazzling story of love, loss, adventure, courage, heartbreak, tough choices, and tender feelings with a rescue from a burning building, a runaway train, a world-class villain, and a really great kiss. It is smart and funny and touching and exhilaratingly entertaining. S2 has sensational special effects integrated with a first-rate script and outstanding performances to illuminate the characters and tell the story -- and to show us something about ourselves. But most of all, this is why they invented movies because director Sam Raimi knows how to make things MOVE.Few movies have so mastered motion. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) swoops through the skyscrapers. A train hurtles across a track that just abruptly stops. A car flies through the air. Raimi is all but re-inventing cinematic story-telling before our delighted eyes.In the first movie, we saw Peter Parker's joy in the powers he developed after being bitten by a radio-active spider. When his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) was killed because he failed to stop a thief, he resolved to devote his life to help people. And that meant no close attachments because anyone he cared about would be vulnerable to attack by bad guys who wanted to pressure him.As this movie opens, things are not going well for Peter. Even his Spidey powers can't get those pizzas delivered by the 30-minute deadline when there are people to save along the way. Aunt May's application for a loan to save her mortgage from being foreclosed has been turned down. He is having trouble in school because he doesn't have time to do the work. His best friend Harry (James Franco) is still angry because Peter won't tell him what really happened the night Spider-Man killed his father. Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), the girl he loves, is giving up on him because he can't tell her who he really is or how he really feels. He can't even do a load of laundry without making things worse. That Spider-man suit chafes. Spidey can't even sling those webs the way he used to. The last hors d'oeuvre at the party is always snatched away just as he reaches for it. Maybe it's time to quit.Harry introduces Peter to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose devotions to his wife and his work are inspiring. Harry is financing the doctor's experiments with fusion energy, so complex and dangerous that they must be conducted with tentacle-like mechanical arms that are controlled by artificial intelligence. But in the grand hubris tradition of myths and comic books, the experiment goes terribly, tragically wrong and the doctor's wife is killed. The four artificial arms are fused to Octavius' spine. Devastated by the loss and overtaken by the arms which move like serpents in the garden of Eden, he becomes a villain known as Doc Ock, stealing what he needs to resume his experiments.But Harry controls one of those ingredients, and he says he will give it to Doc Ock in exchange for Spider-Man. Molina is brilliant in both incarnations. His kind Doctor Octavius has a glimmer of benign madness. And his Doc Ock shows us the tortured soul that cannot help being thrilled by power. The weakest part of the first movie was the villain, with his dopey mask and over-the-top monologue. But Molina's Doc Ock is a villain for the ages, a man who shows us his real face so we can feel the struggle for his soul.The comic book elements are all here, with spectacular fight scenes and teen-friendly existential themes. Peter has to struggle with feelings of isolation and not being understood or appreciated. He is aware of the irony of his working for justice for others when his own life is filled with people who judge him unfairly.One of the screenwriters was Michael Chabon, who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about comic book creators called The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, and his rich appreciation for the mythic appeal of the comic book tradition brings depth to the story. Spider-Man and Doc Ock have many parallels. Both were granted extraordinary powers through mutations caused by accidents in scientific experiments. Both struggle with their alternate identities, represented in visual terms by frequent use of reflections. Both struggle with devastating losses. In a nice moment that gently underlines and broadens what is going on with the characters, Peter watches Mary Jane perform in a production of The Importance of Being Earnest in a scene where Cecily talks to Algernon about his pretending to be someone he is not. And a street musician sings the Spider-Man song, at first a little tentatively and off-key but then, as Spidey re-discovers who he is, with more assurance, hitting the right notes.This is a sumptuous summer treat that succeeds on many levels. It is that rarest of treats, a popcorn pleasure with heart, soul, and insight.Families who enjoy this movie may also enjoy the original Spider-Man and other comic book movies like Superman and Batman. Adult viewers may enjoy Wonder Boys, another Michael Chabon movie starring Maguire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Spider-Man 2""-  One of the greatest Superhero films ever made.  A masterpiece of the genre.","Just two years after director Sam Raimi shattered box-office records, wowed critics and earned almost universal adoration from audiences with the surprisingly thoughtful and wildly popular release ""Spider-Man"", the promise and potential of the franchise was fulfilled in perhaps the most magical of ways. That being with one of those rare sequels that was an improvement over the original in any and every way. ... one of those one in a million follow-ups that enriches the characters and story, bringing the franchise to the level of perfection. A continuation that was so strong, it could stand tall on its own, and be viewed as an incredible accomplishment even when viewed outside of its franchise.Yes, 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"" is not only a sequel that outdoes the original in every capacity, but is also an immensely powerful film in it's own right when viewed as a cinematic experience. And even to this day, it rises above virtually all else to stand as one of the greatest Superhero movies of all time, joining the ranks alongside other beloved works like Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" and Donner's ""Superman""""Spider-Man 2"" is a masterpiece.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is having difficulty balancing his dual life as a struggling college student trying to make ends meet and as superhero Spider-Man. Things are only made worse as his best friend Harry (James Franco) holds a grudge against Spider-Man- who he blames for the death of his father, and when he learns that Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is in a serious romantic relationship with another man. With so much stress on his life, Peter begins to notice it take a toll on his ability to fight crime- his powers are being negatively effected by his lack of focus.Peter soon meets scientist Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina), whom is working on a new source of energy in the form of fusion. However, Otto's life is destroyed in a tragic accident- his wife killed and his body is fused with an experimental set of metal arms that are controlled by an advanced artificial intelligence whose only goal is to complete the experiment at any cost. Now dubbed ""Doctor Octopus"" by the media, and under the influence of the AI controlling the arms, Otto begins to lose his mind and resort to crime to attain the funding needed to restart his experiment... an experiment that could threaten the safety of the entire city. And so, despite his complex personal life, Peter must make the decision on whether to try and stop Otto- a man he greatly admires and respects... or give up the life of a hero once and for all.What truly elevates this film beyond the parameters of it's relatively standard storyline is the exquisite handling of theme and character thanks to the small team of writers responsible, for Sam Raimi's continued dedication to crafting a fun-yet-contemplative atmosphere and visual style, and of course the absolutely magnificent cast.Alvin Sargent (""Ordinary People"") adapts the screenplay from a story treatment by award-winning novelist Michael Chabon and the quirky and delightful duo of ""Shanghai Noon"" scribes Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. (Though there is some dispute that Gough and Millar may have done uncredited work on the script.) It's an incredibly complex script, expertly intertwining themes of redemption, doubt, love and the decline and rise of personal responsibility. It strikes a fine balancing act that makes sure to give every supporting character a purpose, establishes and pays off definitive character arcs in all major players, and also grounds the film in a hyper-realistic way. Gone are the pacing problems and occasionally hammy dialog present in the original film... here, everything has a reason for being, and it fits together as an exquisite experience.Director Sam Raimi knocks it out of the park with his guidance and visual storytelling in this installment, building off of and elaborating on the excellent work he had accomplished with the original. His kinetic sense of wonder and deep adoration for the comic-book roots of the franchise are on full display, with beautifully crafted visuals that make perfect use of movement and scene composition. He also goes very experimental in key moments to help and deliver a unique style that both compliments and occasionally contrasts with the original, maintaining a sense of visual continuity while also allowing the sequel to sort-of be its own thing. From a wonderful visual montage set to ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"", to a delightfully perverse and eerie hospital sequence that's a clear call-back to his earlier work on the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, Raimi excels like he never has. Bravo, sir.The cast is just a revelation, effectively building and developing their characters to grand new heights with their incredible performances. Tobey Maguire is given great depth and even pathos in this installment, and he shows his acting chops with a grand portrayal of a troubled hero that still resonates to this day. Dunst is able to inject far more character into MJ, and even though you liked her in the first movie... here you finally see her portrayed as a realistic and flawed human. Franco is a blast as a man spiraling down the drain, grasping to maintain some control. Returning actress Rosemary Harris is an absolute joy as Aunt May. And Alfred Molina gives a performance that I still feel is the absolute epitome of the comic- book villain brought to life. He's emotional. Charming. Identifiable. Threatening. But most of all... most importantly... human. Molina set the gold standard for villainy with this film and I still think he's yet to be topped.Add to that all of the incredible aspects of the production- from the wild score to the gorgeous cinematography... and you have yourself one of the greatest comic-book movies ever made. A film virtually without flaw.""Spider-Man 2"" is a perfect 10. You owe it to yourself to see this masterwork of action and emotion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than the first,"Spiderman came more to life in this movie than the first. This movie is based on Spiderman #3, #50 and #55-#59 where Doc Ock nearly did away with Spiderman (and almost killed May Parker). Once again director Sam Raimy ( or Miller and Gough ) chose one of the best stories of the earlier Spiderman series. The movement of Spiderman is really what we expect from John Romita Sr. days of Spiderman, and it was exciting to see this version of Spiderman come to life (I still believe he was the best Spiderman artist).Asides from Doc Ock, many characters were introduced in this movie that could be future Spiderman's nemesis like J Jonah Jameson's son John Jameson who would become a superhero himself one day, and Dr. Connors who everyone knows is the infamous Lizard. If they keep building up this franchise this way, I think we're in for a treat.JK Simmons is spot on as J Jonah Jameson.

Not Only The Best In The Series; Also One Of The Best In The Genre,"Let me just tell you this: I love Spider-Man 2. Love it, love it, love it. I always have loved it, and undoubtedly always will. Now, let me tell you why I love it.First of all, it starts off with the characters already developed and established. This means no time is wasted in explaining who the people are. The introduction of how Peter Parker became Spider-Man has already been told, which gives the film the ability to begin at an already-quickened pace, which it definitely takes advantage of. From the minute the narrative starts, you as a viewer are automatically hooked. This movie does not fail to get your attention... unless you have really bad ADHD.Also added into this film that are missing in most superhero films: emotions. Tons and tons of emotions. Whether it be the ill-fated love between Peter and Mary Jane, the tense rivalry between Peter and Harry, or the saddened yet insightful words of Aunt May, this film gets right down into the hearts of the people who matter most. The movie doesn't overuse action or stunts; it uses them as a powerful compliment to the even more powerful storyline.Another point that must be observed is the pure awesomeness of the villain. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is, in my mind, the quintessential comic book super-villain now ever since I've seen this film. His performance is spectacular and the character is just wonderful. I mean, once you catch just a glimpse of Doc Oc and his four mechanical legs, that picture will stay in the back of your mind for at least two months, give or take. He's also a superb character because he has such a powerful story and strong personality, which is clearly illustrated before he becomes Doc Oc. The reason why I love him so much as a villain is because he is human, and he's not completely evil at heart. It's a clear example of how good, intelligent people can be driven away and turned into something they're not, but then also deals with the importance of redemption.I won't give away too much more, since the movie really is worth seeing. When viewed, in my mind, I can't find anything that a viewer would find wrong or out of place. It's a fun, light-hearted film with a strong message and deep emotional scenes. There's also great action and comedy throughout. The acting is terrific on everyone's part, from the lead role down to every little extra you find in an elevator or on an elevated train. Also, with a villain whom you can feel compassion for and a hero you can really connect with, this movie can be related to pretty much anyone's own life.The bottom line is... if you've had troubles in your life, you'll be able to connect with it. If you've ever been unsure of who you are or what you're supposed to be doing, you'll be able to connect with it. And if you've ever given up a dream to do what's right, you'll be able to connect with it. And if you haven't experienced any of those things, good for you. Watch the film for the fun of it. It's one hell of a ride. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

When Spider-Man Juggles His Problems as Much as His Webs,"In this second installment, Peter Parker proves that even with superpowers, you can still be the king of bad luck. Between his love life, as unstable as a web in a storm, and his buddy Harry Osborn dreaming of taking him down, there's enough to make anyone throw in the towel... or a web. Tobey Maguire is spot-on, perfectly balancing the everyman and the tortured hero. Watching him struggle somehow makes us feel better about our own lives.Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus is a villain with as much class as he has arms. His angry-octopus look and mad scientist ambitions instantly place him among the best cinema villains. Sure, a guy losing it because of his gadgets does feel a bit like déjà vu (hello, Green Goblin), but let's not nitpick: Octavius is badass, and his fight scenes are like a mechanical opera.Sam Raimi proves once again he's the perfect conductor for this web-slinging symphony. With nods to Evil Dead for the fans, he masterfully blends horror and action. Raimi knows how to glue us to the screen with breakneck pacing and unforgettable sequences - like the iconic train fight: an absolute masterclass.J. Jonah Jameson is the cherry on top - the guy we love to hate. J. K. Simmons goes full throttle, turning every scene into a verbal punchline festival. This man could make a stapler seem like a lethal weapon. Special shoutout to his bursts of laughter, which hit Peter like a slap to the face.The plot is intricately woven: twists, moral dilemmas, and action scenes that hit like uppercuts. Add a soundtrack that perfectly matches the mood, and you get a film as tightly crafted as Spider-Man's webs. Raimi strikes the perfect balance between drama, humor, and spectacle without ever falling into cliché.Spider-Man 2 isn't just a superhero movie; it's a masterpiece that shows you can combine blockbuster thrills with real depth. Between stellar performances, razor-sharp direction, and unforgettable action sequences, this is big-screen greatness. If you love blockbusters with soul, this film is your destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An excellent continuation of Spider-Man,"Another one of the best sequels ever made, this movie correctly keeps up with the previous one. Tobey McGuire, Kristen Dunst and James Franco are still great in their roles, Alfred Molina was a worthy successor as a villain. His character Dr. Octopus is very well written and his origin story is terrific. Danny Elfman's music does not disappoint either and the special effects offer excellent action sequences. There is a lot of action, humor and a great plot for Peter Parker's story. Sam Raimi managed to continue the Spider-Man story in a respectable way. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better then the original,"This one of those sequels that surpasses the first one. A great blockbuster. A great second installment to the series. A great superhero film. There are some similarities to this and Superman II. If you have seen both, then you should know what I am talking about. If you liked the first one, then you will love this. A great second Part. I highly recommend this film. I love all 3 films. I loved this film. One of the best superhero films out there. If you are a DVD collector(Like me) then you should add this to your collection.

Worse than the first,"This movie is quite awful. The plot is simplistic, at best, and just a sorry excuse at worse. The love story is painfully corny, to a truly unimaginable degree. The movie is littered with inconsequential events and random bits of slapstick humor (i.e. Siperman randomly falls. hahahah... terrible) The plot does not even try to make any scientific sense, the villain has no real reason for being and Spider Man is a terribly fake character. The directing is I think the reason behind it all since the actors are otherwise decent, but have been warped into mediocrity for the sake of this movie. Even the action is sub-par. It is decent but nowhere near deserving of the great reviews it has gotten. I give this movie a one, simply because of the over three thousand simpletons that gave it a 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The BEST superhero movie of all time!,"I like many superheroes, but Spider-man is my all-time favorite of the bunch. He just appeals to everyone young and old alike, with factors people can relate to; from Peter Parker's nerdiness to character development, to real-life problems such as family affairs, love, finances, jobs and so forth. I liked the first Spider-man movie (a good teen movie to boot), but this one took what was good about that one, improved it, and any negatives were fixed. What you have here is the perfect mixture of action, humor, drama, and suspense in one total package. Solid performances from Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina, in fact Molina himself is a good version of Spider-man's deadliest foe, Doctor Octopus. You can even feel for him a little bit and even though you want Spider-man to stop him, at the same time you feel a little sorry for what he goes through in the transformation into villain role. I won't reveal the ending, but I will say it is a total triumph. This is so good, even the great critic Roger Ebert just had to put it on his top ten for 2004 (it ranked 4th), and that alone is a ringing endorsement",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An absolute joy from start to end,"Spider-Man 2 is a god damn excellent movie. It manages to improve upon the first movie and be way better than the first movie. The story is way better, the villain is way better, the characters and acting are way better, the score is still great, it's still beautifully shot, and even the action and visual effects are so much better, and for what it is it's just an exciting fun movie. Even all the corny stuff is great, it's really entertaining and charming. Everything that this movie needed to have improved upon the first movie this movie does and does well. Upon rewatching this movie, it's way better than how it was remembered in memory. All the best stuff in this movie is everything going on with Peter Parker, between him trying to balance his real life and him being Spider-Man was really interesting, him constantly struggling and messing up and him quitting so he could get his life together, and he decides to come back to being Spider-Man was all perfect. It captures everything I love about Spider-Man and why he is my favorite superhero. It's an incredibly creative, entertaining and fun movie with that same style that hold together the movie. Purely based on my love for the movie and what this movie gets right it's kind of a perfect movie, nuff said.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride.""","This is a dazzling story of love, loss, adventure, courage, heartbreak, tough choices, and tender feelings. Plus it has a rescue from a burning building, a runaway train, a world-class villain, and a really great kiss. It's why they invented movies. It's smart and funny and touching and exhilaratingly entertaining, a sumptuous treat that succeeds on many levels. Screenwriter Michael Chabon understands the mythic appeal of the comic book tradition, and his touch is evident in the story's depth, an example being Molina's brilliantly played Doc Ock. He's a villain for the ages, a man who shows us his real face so we can feel the struggle for his soul. The comic book elements are all here, with spectacular fight scenes and teen-friendly existential themes. Peter has to struggle with feelings of isolation and not being understood or appreciated. He is aware of the irony of his working for justice for others when his own life is filled with people who judge him unfairly.Spider-Man 2 has sensational special effects integrated with a first-rate script and outstanding performances to illuminate the characters and tell the story -- and to show us something about ourselves. But most of all, this is why they invented movies, because director Sam Raimi knows how to make things move. Few movies have so mastered motion. Spider-Man swoops through the skyscrapers. A train hurtles across a track that just abruptly stops. A car flies through the air. Raimi is all but re-inventing cinematic storytelling before our delighted eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrible.,"It is extremely difficult to find a way to understand why was this flick made. Of course, because it is a very easy way for studio to get a little more money, this is obvious. But why, oh why, do they make it so terrible?It seems to me that no one in this movie really was interested in making a film. Screenwriters seemed to have focused on playing cards while they should have written the script. Besides all the teen movie clichés, dialogue was absolutely nonsense.

The best 'Spider-man' movie of the three,"With a great story, great villain, and even more drama and action than the first 'Spider-man,' the second Spidey installment thrilled its viewers across the globe, and deservedly so.Doc Ock was a fantastic villain choice, and really is a nemesis for Spider-man. The action scenes, though heavily relied on CGI, are fantastic, and are OK on being CGI-heavy since they looked so realistic and so cool. On a personal, internal level, Peter Parker accepts who he needs to be as a superhero, rather than shunning the responsibilities that he has been given.Mary Jane is torn between two men, a recently-returned astronaut and Pete. Her fateful decision at film's end directly follows Pete's exciting last encounter with Doc Ock.'Spider-man 2' is definitely one of the three best superhero movies of all time, and arguably the best. 3.5 stars/4",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man's Finest Hour or Two,"For some this review will appear contradictory as almost a year ago I stated that 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' was the greatest Spidey flick. Consider that statement promptly withdrawn. 'Spider-Man 2' tops it in every conceivable way. It is in my mind a better film than 'The Dark Knight'. 'Spider-Man 2' grips from the get go and its webbing does not loosen its hold until the end credits crawl up the screen. Even the opening titles are imaginative, clips are not shown of 2002's 'Spider-Man' and its events but comic book panels. They dazzle your eyes and keep you waiting and wondering as to how the events will unfold. Peter Parker played by a Tobey Maguire whom embodies nerdiness, has now taken up the mantel of Spider-Man and this takes precedence in his life over his college work, job and wannabe girlfriend Mary Jane Watson played by the marvellous Kirsten Dunst.Parker even struggles to stay friends with Harry Osborne played by a scene stealing James Franco, who vows that Spider-Man will pay after the events of the first film where Harry saw Spider-Man return his father's dead body to him. Parker is leading the double life but as a new villain emerges to terrorise the city of New York will he be able to protect the ones he cares about? 'Spider-Man 2' raises the bar to staggering heights, heights which even Spidey would fail to climb. What makes this sequel better than its fantastic original is not merely awesome special effects and an increase in budget. 'Spider-Man 2' is more entertaining, romantic, energetic, visually dazzling and boasts one of the best villains of Cinema since the birth of Darth Vader. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus or as J Jonah Jameson Editor of the Daily Bugle says Doc Ock for short. Molina gives an all-round better performance than dare I say it Heath Ledger as the Joker. Molina lends Doctor Otto Octavius much heart, emotion and gravitas which contribute to a more engaging character and a better developed one. As Octavius accepts his destiny, he falls into a world of crime which he cannot escape from. He is not a villain by choice, but by consequence. Once his science experiment goes out of control his world does too. Losing his wife does not help matters and he so strongly believes in science and his life's work that he is willing to cause the death of millions or even his own.The action scenes work so well because we actually get the sense that Spider-Man is a person in between all of this destruction. These scenes which involve a flurry of CGI wizardry see Spider-Man fling himself towards his opponent, but most importantly they look real. Even the emotional aspect is ramped up. Parker loses his job, comes ever so close to failing his college course and finds out that Mary Jane has a new lover. All of which contribute to Peter Parker losing his powers as Spider-Man in the majority of the second act. But it all makes sense. Parker is not invincible as a Super-hero; he is a real person, with real issues and real problems. All of the other Spider-Man films failed to capture this deep level of emotion and make it have an impact on Parker's life as a whole. We get a deeper knowledge of Peter's infatuation with Mary Jane. He loves her, but by the same token, knows that she will never be safe because of his crime fighting life. It is this struggle that makes this tale of heroism so much more than your average film about good versus evil and far more emotionally complex and involving as a whole.The comedy lends a light hearted feel and tone for the film, it never becomes too serious or too dark, and this is about as far as you can get from 'The Dark Knight Rises' as possible. Furthermore, it relies more on visuals and not the all too obvious humour present in the new Marc Webb films. The score itself is perfection, everything that a Superhero's theme should be and more. Danny Elfman firmly cements himself as a grand composer alongside the likes of John Williams and Howard Shore. In all honesty I could talk about this film for 127 minutes, the runtime of 'Spider-Man 2'. Do you need any more reasons to purchase this film right away? Well let me sum it all up.'Spider-Man 2' is compelling evidence that the best films don't have to be Biopics or Dramas. But films that offer character development, humour, wit, romance, action and pull on your heartstrings. 'Spider- Man 2' is the greatest Spidey flick hands down, by the longest thread of web that Spider-Man can conjure. If 'Spider- Man' is to undergo another reboot then perhaps it is time to reconsider Sam Raimi as the Director and for Tobey Maguire to don the outfit for one last spin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He exposes his identity 3 times in less than half an hour, once to a whole train of people, its slow, the humour of Spiderman is sadly lacking & I can honestly say the only redeeming piece of this mess was the fabulous Doc Ock, Alfred Molina is magnificent & steals the whole show. Take out half an hour of nonsense (raindrops keep falling on my head scene? Whats THAT all about), pull it closer to what comic book fans want & don't hack with the formula & bring back Spideys sense of humour & you might just have a near good movie here!

The supporting cast, including Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius/Doc Ock, also deliver standout performances that add depth and complexity to the story.The action sequences are thrilling and visually stunning, with Spider-Man's web-slinging and combat skills taken to new heights. The film's use of special effects is impressive, creating a sense of scale and danger that is truly epic.The themes of sacrifice, identity, and redemption are explored in a powerful and meaningful way that adds emotional weight to the story.

Spider-Man 2 is the blueprint for every superhero movie and was the first perfect superhero film.,"Spider-Man 2 is undoubtedly the best in the Sam Rami trilogy, but if you expand outward to include any superhero film, including Nolan's Dark Knight series, new era DC and the entire MCU, there are only a handful of films in the superhero genre you would describe as 'perfect'. Only a few you would change nothing about and could not be improved at all, and Sam Ramis Spider-Man 2 was the very first.Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius is the perfect villain, with a tragic path to villainy and a strong motivation as an evil individual and a powerful character arc throughout.Tobey Maguire puts in his best performance as the webslinger and brings real emotion to the role, really being able to portray the pitfalls of leading a double life and the toll it takes on Peters family and personal life, an angle that the next two generations of Spider-Man movies haven't been able to do properly.The plot is expertly balanced with the action and the slower more intimate moments and doesn't suffer from any pacing issues that have been a pitfall of many superhero movies.Spider-Man 2 is with a doubt the first perfect superhero movie, and has become the formula for so many films that have followed in its footsteps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best superhero sequel ever made?,"In one of the best superhero sequels ever made, Tobey McGuire reprises his role as Peter Parker who is struggling with life's challenges, money, love and living and what's more he is losing his powers. And with more crime arising, Parker faces difficult choices concerning his personal life.Breaking the opening weekend Box Office record, the Spider-man franchise grew wider and this 2004 sequel has been described as one of the best superhero sequels ever made, and I couldn't agree more.With a much better opening to the first film, we are thrust straight into Parker's life as he tries to balance his job, his money and his university classes. Having many issues gives the film depth and is intriguing to watch each situation develop.This film is similar to the first, with a focus upon dramatic issues such as his love for Mary Jane and the loss of his Uncle Ben. There is a slight feeling of repetition but in context it is understandable and gives the characters more emotion and understanding.There is more action in this sequel, watch out for one of the best fantasy fight scenes in motion picture history, which so happens to be on a train. Excellent direction and nail biting close scenarios. There is always a question of realism but nevertheless that situation was simply outstanding.The effects are great, as you would expect and much better than the first. I'm personally not a big fan of CGI but regardless this was special and was made so by Raimi's direction.There are plenty of twists and turns in store and with the added action and more deep situations it makes the plot even more special.Though the love scenes are questionable they aren't as corny as the previous films and are enjoyable to watch.

"High expectations, met!","Before viewing this film I had heard the previews stating it was better than the first. Now that I have seen it, I agree. That puts this first sequel in rare company -- The Godfather II, Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back and Aliens come to mind. I was never a Spiderman comic book reader but I used to watch the animated half-hour show every morning before school. Doc Ock was a large villain (well-done by Molina) but I did not remember the mind control of his prosthetic arms as portrayed in this movie. It raises very interesting questions about man-machine neural interfaces. While mind control seems far-fetched, addictive dependency does not. The special effects were great. Peter Parker's internal conflict and time-management failures living the life of your ""friendly neighborhood"" Spiderman seems to be a natural progression of his whirlwind journey into superherodom. This is a departure from Bruce Willis's character in Unbreakable who has a long awakening period to come to terms with his extraordinary powers. I was a fish on the hook being reeled in with the romantic tension between Mary Jane (Dunst) and Peter (Maguire). Some felt this was too slow for the movie development. I did not. Maguire just comes off as the quintessential Clark Kent -- no way that guy is a superhero! This is why the elevated train scene is so powerful for this movie. The foreshadowing of the third movie seems to be setting up the return of the Green Goblin. I don't think I want to see the GG by himself for the next movie.

The film focuses on Peter Parker and his life as Spider-Man, with his problems and responsibilities.
If there is something that makes this film better its predecessor is how it completely immerses itself in the protagonist. In this film we see introspection to the hero in a way that has never been seen in superhero cinema until today.
The facts on screen are so measured and feel so organic that it seems as if nothing in the movie is random. Director Sam Raimi himself is better than ever and pays special attention and care to this stage of the character, turning this film into something beyond just one more hero adventure. Without underestimating the work of Tobey Maguire, who is dedicated to his character and endows him with an indescribable emotionality and humanity.
There is nothing more to say besides that 'Spider-Man 2' is one of the great movies within the superhero genre and is, without a doubt, an absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than the first, but pointless altogether","While the special effects and story lines are greatly improved from the under-whelming first Spider-Man movie they alone can't make this movie worth your money. The strongest points of this movie were in the supporting roles of Aunt Mae, Dr. Octavius (before he turned evil) and of course Harry Osborn. They were the only characters that acted like actual human being in this movie and the only actors that didn't just chew up their words and spit them out.For me the real problem with this movie is that it accomplishes nothing that wasn't a part of the first film. All the themes of the original are just redone here, and for no apparent reason. We learned from the first movie that 'With great power comes great responsibility' and that 'there's a hero in all of us'.So why is the sequel not trying to cover any new territory? Peter loves MJ but they can't be togetherum why? Obviously her life is in danger already so what would it hurt to tell her? Peter is reluctant to become Spider-Man and struggles to use his powers, yeah that happens again to. The news paper irrationally hates Spider-Man yet Peter sells them pictures for only $300?!?! Paparazzi photographers can get THOUSANDS of dollars for a picture of Brad Pitt or Madonna or Britney Spears, so why is the clown only making $300?All in all if you liked the first movie you'll like this one more.

In the movie Peter struggles with personal and mental issues. And also stress because of his biggest secret, his double identity.My favorite thing about this movie is that the way they handled Peter's issues. They're not fake like in other superhero movies. He is a real person who deals real issues and tries to get over them. Also the entirety of Aunt May's character is what makes this movie poetically beautiful.

Peter Parker's story in this part is a bit longer than part 1, but still very interesting. The story is smoothly developed.

The best Superhero movie of all time,"I have watched a hand full of super hero movies in my lifetime. I don't have any nostalgia with the Sam Raimi movies. But my god, this movie did not disappoint. I love this movie, it's so good. Tobey Maguire is hands down my favorite Peter Parker (movies), he does such a great job being a loveable dork. And the fact Peter is such a relatable character to me really justifies how well Parker's character is done. Kristen Dunst who plays Mary Jane is also an amazing character. But I do think that she is a bit harsh to Peter in this movie. I get her problems with Peter missing her play, but you don't have to rub it in his face. Oh yeah, Peter is treated like absolute garbage in this movie. He can't balance out his own life and his Spiderman life. Being Spiderman causes issues for him in his real life. He loses his job, he misses the love of his life's play, he is failing and missing class and it's all because he is Spiderman. He comes to the conclusion that he doesn't want to be Spiderman and it's sad, but very beautiful that Peter is giving up Spiderman for the sake of his own life. Watch it for yourself, it's absolutely amazing. The villain Dr. Otto Octavious played by Alfred Molina is the best villain in superhero history. I don't think such a tragic backstory could compete with the villains from the whole MCU. I find his goals are very reasonable and understandable. Oh yeah, and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is perfect. I give this movie a 9/10 for aging pretty well and being one of the best Superhero movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I liked the first one, but this one's better","First ""X-Men,"" then ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and now this. It seems we are seeing the dawn of a new trend amongst Hollywood blockbusters: that sequels should be more substantive and emotionally resonant than the original movie. While the first ""Spider-Man"" was worthwhile merely for being fun popcorn action-movie escapism, the sequel deals with weighty moral issues and closely examines inter-personal relationships without either dumbing things down (think ""Superman II"") or dampening the super-hero excitement (think ""The Hulk"").The first movie was all about Spider-Man and his powers. This movie concentrates more on Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). His moral code may just be ruining his life, not only in terms of his relationships--he cannot tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) that he loves her, and his friendship with Harry (James Franco) is strained--but his grades are slipping and he can't hold down a steady job. And it's all because he feels that Spider-Man has a responsibility to combat evil.I won't take up too much space with Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), because even though most of the action is centered around him, he's really beside the point. I will just say that although Molina is a gifted actor, he has not quite mastered an American accent. And the convoluted new back-story for Doc Ock regarding nuclear fusion and artificial intelligence is probably the weakest part of the movie. One misses the simplicity--however childish or dated--of the original comic, where a nuclear explosion gives Ock telepathic control of the mechanical arms.Sam Raimi's action sequences are as impressive as ever. But unlike the first ""Spider-Man"", they are not the real core of the movie. Instead, it is small, quiet scenes that stick in your mind. My favorite part of the entire 127 minutes is the part where Peter tells Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) exactly how Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) died. All the shots are static, the set is no different than it would be for a small, independent drama, and the only effects we see are the actors' thespian skills. Raimi fans will know he has also used similar techniques to wonderful effect in ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Gift"".I don't want to spoil the end for anyone, except to say that it does a superb job of setting up ""Spider-Man 3"" by taking the Peter-Mary Jane relationship to a different level, and with a creepily effective surprise cameo.All in all, this is hands-down, the single greatest super-hero movie of all time, and this is coming from someone who thrilled to Christopher Reeve as a little kid and Michael Keaton as a teenager. Although there will probably be no Oscar consideration beyond some technical awards, this movie strongly deserves 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Still the Best Spider-Man Movie? 100% Yes.,"Let's be real-Spider-Man 2 is still THE Spider-Man movie that every other Spidey flick gets compared to, and for good reason. Sam Raimi didn't just make a superhero movie, he made a movie with heart, depth, and real stakes. And, of course, Tobey Maguire? Forever the OG Peter Parker.Right from the jump, you feel for Peter. This guy is struggling to balance life as Spider-Man and just trying to survive as a regular dude. He's broke, can't keep a job, and the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), seems like she's moving on. The way Raimi makes us feel Peter's struggles hits harder than most superhero flicks, and it's what makes this movie so much more relatable.And then we get Doctor Octopus. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock? Iconic. The guy's the perfect mix of genius and tragic villain. That hospital scene where his arms come to life? Horror vibes all the way. Molina plays him with a level of sympathy that makes him one of the best superhero villains ever-he's not evil for the sake of it, he's got layers.The action scenes? Still legendary. That train fight between Spidey and Doc Ock? GOATed. It's the kind of scene that gets your heart racing no matter how many times you've seen it. Plus, the stakes feel REAL-Peter's mask is off, and he's fighting not just for the city but for the people who know who he really is.What I love about Spider-Man 2 is how much it focuses on Peter's personal journey. The whole ""do I even want to be Spider-Man anymore?"" arc is fire. You feel the weight of his responsibilities, and it's so well done that even people who aren't superhero fans get pulled in. It's about choice, sacrifice, and how being a hero comes with a price.And let's not forget, that ending? Chef's kiss. Peter finally gets the girl but still knows that being Spider-Man will always come with complications. It's bittersweet, and it hits just right.Spider-Man 2 is the blueprint for superhero movies that mix heart, action, and character development. 10/10-this one's still swinging high.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely web-tastic,"I've seen this 2004 sequel to the 2002 one about several times and it's absolutely brilliant. Tobey Maguire sure did his great job for playing as Peter Parker/Spiderman. That British fella Alfred Molina also did his great job for playing the baddie Dr. Otto Octavius known as Dr. Octopus. It's probably one of the best 2004/sequel films of all time. I still have it on DVD. I got it for Christmas in 2004.Back in summer 2004, I saw this at Ormonde Cinemas (then UCI, now Odeon Stillorgan) with my friends as teens and we thought it was amazing.If you've watched its 2002 prequel Spiderman before, you'll enjoy this 2004 film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best Superhero Films,"In the second installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi brings us one of the best comic book/superhero movies ever. I still remember how blown away I was after watching this movie in theaters after it's initial release. The action, the story, the special/visual effects...everything was spectacular and came together to create an awesome ride. Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his real life with his role as Spider-Man. He's unable to keep a job, failing his college courses, and ruining his friendship with longtime love Mary Jane Watson; on top of all that, his best friend obsesses over Spider-Man's role in the death of his father. Meanwhile, an experiment to create fusion by nuclear physicist Otto Octavius leaves him with four metal tentacles welded to his body and an insane desire to recreate the dangerous experiment, risking the lives of half of New York City.Where do I begin? I absolutely loved this movie. The first movie was a great film as well, but it's sequel seemed to take everything a step farther. I felt the story was better in this installment; it manages to fit in so much development but never feels overwhelming and without losing the audience in too much plot. The film concentrates on Peter's personal troubles just as much as it does the Doc Ock storyline. In fact, Doc Ock's transformation doesn't even occur until nearly 40 minutes into the film, but with so much else to absorb, it doesn't hurt the film. And once Doc Ock emerges, the movie only gets better from there with great battles and memorable moments. The hospital scene in which Doc Ock awakens is probably the best scene in the movie (and oozes with Raimi's style) and the battles between hero and villain are some of the best superhero battles created for film.Alfred Molina and the actual character of Doc Ock ranks as one of my top favorite villain performances. Raimi made Octavius and sympathetic character in the film, rather than completely evil, and Molina was a perfect fit for the role. While I was a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and his Green Goblin in the first film, I feel Molina and Doc Ock have topped him. We also get great returning performances from the key players: Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Harris, and Simmons. You can tell they've all become comfortable with the roles at this point and are grasping their characters even better than before. We're also introduced to Mr. Ditkovich (Elya Baskin), Peter's landlord, who injects some humor into the story.As you can see from my rambling, I was a huge fan of this movie and, as much as I've seen it, it never gets old. While it's not the greatest comic book adaptation out there, it definitely ranks with the best. Director Sam Raimi proves that he was meant for this franchise, embracing it and improving with the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On par with original,"A worthy followup to the first Tobey Maguire film. It kept me engaged which I admit doesn't often happen in superhero films. I have found this one to be just as well written and acted by the cast. The character of Dr Octavius brilliantly played by Alfred Molina was very well crafted and unlike Willem Defoe's green goblin going mad, there still remains a shred of decency in Doc Oct, nice twist toward the end. James Franco reprising his role as Harry and plays it a bit of an obnoxious douche taking over OZ Corp. The chemistry can be felt between Maguire and Dunst, my only real criticism is that they're in their 20's but do the whole meek and shy act like a 13 yr old would do.

Raimi wisely and avoid putting the focus on the special effects. He values the most different characters and relationships between them,"After the resounding success of the original film, Spider-Man 2 came to Brazil taking almost 8 million people to the movie theaters in the country and many millions more around the world. After the positive reviews of the fidelity and style transported to new media, the director Sam Raimi was called again to take control of the second part, produced just two years of his predecessor. Raimi reassembled the same cast and inserted specific holdings. In this production, one of the bases of the writers was the famous edition of the Spider, known as "" Spider-Man No More ""(originally published in the journal"" The Amazing Spider-Man # 50-51-52 ""), where Peter Parker realizes he is pressured by popular pursuit (caused by Jameson and his editorials), and is setting aside their personal life, friends, family and studies. He decides to abandon everything and stop being the superhero and ends up generating for fans of the comic with the iconic image of the uniform Spider in the trash and Peter leaving. In the movie, the hero goes through the same dilemmas and realize that there is something wrong when their powers are disappearing gradually. Convinced involuntarily by Aunt May and seeing that the city needed a symbol to protect her, he decides to return to wear the uniform of the arachnid.The film begins two years after the first film, when Spider-Man defeated the Green Goblin. Peter Parker is still trying to reconcile the superhero with his personal life without much success. Parker, due to heroics, is always changing jobs for its constant delays, is always neglecting his studies with the notes increasingly low and can never meet the expectations of his Aunt May going through difficult times after the death of his uncle Ben. Also still hiding her love for her friend / love Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and keeping away from it to not run risks by being with him. He still has to deal with his best friend Harry (James Franco), who feeds a growing anger at Spider-Man because he considered him as the murderer of his father, and with the appearance of Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) , a brilliant scientist who after having an unsuccessful experiment that killed his wife and he did have tentacles attached to the body that just manipulating your mind, making it a gentle person with an unstable, causing it to try to finish his failed experiment at any cost.Unlike other productions blockbuster success, Raimi did not fall into the traps and famous does not sin by excess, correcting some mistakes earlier and expanding personal conflicts of Peter Parker, torn between the life of a young student and the responsibility to defend the people, and well developed and iconic scenes action of the highest quality. Spider-Man 2 was the main cast, and brought a much more interesting villain menacing Dr. Octopus. Raimi and screenwriters show new elements that will please the most ardent reader of comic books to the average viewer, with a generous dose of action, adventure, comedy, romance and suspense. It is clear here the successful attempt to make that character as human as possible, focusing on the dilemmas of teenager Peter and clashes with situations adulthood. The sub-plots, which began in the previous film, gained more prominence and depth in this sequence. The friendship between Peter and Harry is in play, the passion of Peter and Mary Jane is threatened when she announces that he will marry another man, Peter has to talk seriously with his Aunt May on the fact in the death of his uncle Ben, not to mention the conflicts of the Spider and its difficulty maintaining dual identity.Spider-Man 2 already like in the opening credits, showing a well-made opening that makes a kind of homage to the world of comics and the previous film, mixing striking scenes of the original film with images using the language of comics. As a result we see an interesting transition from face Mary Jane in a commercial giant Peter always having to look at her even trying to forget it at least a little. After this, we see many comedic moments as well explored as the dialogue scenes with Parker Mr. Aziz, the pizza shop owner to whom he makes deliveries, and especially in unusual pizza delivery taken by Spider, culminating in the scene where he clumsily tries to push some sponges into the closet and listening to the pizzas were delivered after hours and would not be paid. And beckons Spider-Man talking to someone wearing a man in a scene in the elevator after embarrassing the powers of the hero failing in the air, and the two stand there like a man dressed in a costume building was the most normal thing in the world and the two are unsure what to say or do. Perfect scene that makes anyone rolling with laughter.The jokes, incidentally, are much more constant in this part of the work, but they end up not taking the attention of adventure. The first hour contains a lot of comedy. Besides the aforementioned pizza delivery, we have scenes where Peter walks by the college to the tune of ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"", the scenes at the party where the marriage of Mary Jane with John Jameson Parker would be announced and is trying all the time grab a glass with drink but never get, and all the scenes in which it appears the great great J.Jonah Jameson, played by JK Simmons with the classic phrase end in marriage he asked not to serve caviar.The action scenes are even better and grander compared to the original film. Raimi has already reached the first film a great balance between the language of comics and its transposition to the screen and kept the same kind of framework and scenarios, aided by a technology far superior just two years after the original film and were led once again by John Dykstra. In this film, the director makes the actions of Spider occur mostly at night, but still using many plans in close, as in the original, avoiding using the camera still. Speaking of technology, we have to take your hat off to the stunning visual effects used. Are far superior to the first film and bring fluidity and credibility essential to the work. The fight scenes in the bank between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, the fight scene between the two climbing one of the tallest buildings in New York is that Aunt May hostage, and the enigmatic scenes of the subway and the grand finale are perfect examples of the use of computer graphics. The appearance of Dr. Octopus is an evolution to the stark armor worn by Green Goblin in the first film and the work is impressive, further increasing the fear of the villain. Deservedly the work of John Dykstra led the Oscar statuette in 2005.In contrast to the technical creativity to such scenes left a little to be desired. The repetition of ideas is very present: Mary Jane is kidnapped again and participates in the final climax of the film having his life threatened once more. Even Aunt May appears in danger at the hands of the villain of the movie and there is again a fire in a building almost identical to the 2002 film. There are moments of great importance and lack of creativity left a little to be desired. Fortunately, following the spectacular scene of the subway, the car scene invading the cafeteria, and climbing and fighting in high rise buildings always excite with an efficient use of slow motion in key moments.Over the stretch, the film presents its best scenes and merges with the special effects mastery with touching scenes. At the scene of the subway, for example, the spider has to save the passengers of a train wreck, and when Spidey ends up having to show his identity secret after his mask on fire, passengers end up holding the hero and lead into the train. One then says ""It's just a kid ..."" taking the words from the mouth of every one on that train, we were surprised to be a really skinny teenager responsible for the heroic act. Even better is when the passenger support and say they will not tell anyone your identity, returning his mask because the admire and recognize it in fact a true hero.The scene where Mary Jane kisses her current boyfriend upside down trying to simulate the kiss he had given with spider in the previous film and her disappointment when she felt it was not the same love she felt the hero was also marked. In another scene is when Mary Jane goes after Peter, after leaving her future husband astronaut on the altar. After the couple Parker and Watson declare themselves and be together and Mary Jane claiming to know the risks they run and they still wanted to stay with him, a close relation closes production in a close-anguished face of Mary Jane to have to watch your from beloved to save the day once again. It's a beautiful picture and it shows very well the difficult relationship that would have to go together from that moment on.The photography Bill Pope, the art direction of Neil Spisak Bob Murawski and editing seem to be one thing in the construction of the language of comics to the big screen in a way rarely seen. Impossible not to say that all the action scenes and romance were conducted by master Danny Elfman (""Alice in Wonderland""), again repeating the partnership's first feature. themes were reinforced and marked again a soundtrack unforgettable and touching. Despite having defects such as recycling ideas cited, Raimi has no obligation to tell the origin of the friendly neighborhood, and takes viewers right into the action without losing any time. In Spider-Man 2, he acts wisely and avoid putting the focus on the special effects. Raimi values the most different characters and relationships between them. Could be a blockbuster which balanced well the various genres present in the scenes and is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies of recent times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I can't believe Raimi got away with this.,"Perhaps the perfect superhero movie, and one of the biggest improvements as far as sequels go. Well, as far as sequels to movies that are already good go. Because I do like 2002's Spider-Man, though I think Spider-Man 2 holds up much better. It's technically more advanced and I think visually more confident, too, to the point where I'd say it's Sam Raimi's best movie overall.What I appreciated this time around is that it gets more emotional without necessarily getting darker or more gritty. I do think The Dark Knight is the other great superhero sequel of the 2000s, but it is a rather grim and serious film at times (I could understand some people finding it overly serious). Spider-Man 2 is funnier and, at times, sillier than Spider-Man, but it doesn't overdo it. It finds more interesting ways to explore its characters more, being very funny at times in a way that also contrasts nicely with the more heartfelt moments. It's generally good-natured and really lovely in how sincere it is.I think it's also Kafkaesque, which would be funny if intended, given the bug connection that would make to The Metamorphosis. The world hates Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2, and never has the typically underdog Peter been more of an underdog. It's done in a way that makes him more endearing while also making the cosmic cruelty of his life kind of funny. Mel Brooks said something along the lines of ""me stubbing my toe is a tragedy, but a comedy is when you don't notice an open drain on the street and fall into it."" Spider-Man 2 goes the extra step; you really want him to get out of that open drain, but there is something kind of funny about how far he falls. It could be relatable; I think Spider-Man 2 is one of the best movies about young adult struggles.Oh, the action is all really good, too. The pacing's relentless, and very few special effects look iffy, which is impressive considering Spider-Man 2's age. Perfect cast, lots of creativity, very fun, genuinely moving. It feels like it might've been fun to make (who can say for sure), and I love how much personality New York City and its citizens in this film have compared to some more recent superhero movies. It's the whole package. To paraphrase J Jonah Jameson staring at Spider-Man's suit, the movie was a 10/10... I just couldn't see it at the time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This one was Much better then the first,"I know that in the first one they had to get the characters into place, (which to me they took forever to do) making it so dry in areas that I found myself dozing off and on through it. But, in Spiderman 2 they got right down to business while putting Doctor Octopus's character into place. To me, the action was so packed that I had no chance of dozing off. Casting Molina was a good chose for Dr. Octopus, and he's not that bad of an actor. McGuire and Dunst still need a little work though, but they are getting better in their acting as they get older. To me this one was much more entertaining then the first movie. And the two things I liked most about this movie was: 1. they didn't go from scene to scene in a comic book style and 2. The computer graphics were wonderfully done. The one thing I didn't like though, was the last five minutes, when they decide to turn it into a chick flick. That, I could have done without.

First off, I have to give props to Alfred Gould and Miles Millar for crafting such a brilliant story and continuation to this character and this original trilogy of movies. You have Peter Parker struggling to balance everything in his life whether it be him trying to keep a job, succeeding at school and make time for his friends while also being Spider-Man. It goes to show that what Uncle Ben said to him in the first movie is true. I also loved that this movie has him losing his power temporarily as it really shows his struggles of being a superhero this leading him to stop being Spider-Man for a while. This leads to him living a normal life for once, but unfortunately it means that there's no one out there to save the day and it only takes a conversation with his aunt where he understands that he needs to Spider-Man for everyone in New York. It goes without saying that everyone in the cast once again so an fantastic job with their performances and they're even better in this movie. I also loved Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus and he is easily the best villain of any of these Spider-Man movies whether it be live-action or animated. The train fight in this movie is one of the best action sequences in any superhero and comic book movie that has ever been made. You also have that sequences with Dr. Octavius killing all of the doctors that is straight out of a horror movie, which makes sense given that Sam Raimi is the director of the original Evil Dead Trilogy. The movie also does a great job at setting up the conflict between Peter and Harry in the next movie. Speaking of that, my final positive for this movie is that it has me excited to rewatch Spider-Man 3 (2007) because while I have certain problems with that movie, I might find myself enjoying it more now that I'? Binging through all of the Spider-Man movies.Overall, I absolutely adore Spider-Man 2 (2004). This is my favorite Marvel movie of all time as well as one of my favorite superhero and comic book movie movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
SAVE YOURSELF!,"Please! No spoilers, no explanations necessary... save yourself! Run as fast as you can BEFORE buying a ticket to this hokey, cliché'-ridden disaster of a drama-fest way-off-target movie... Yeah. It's that freakin' awful. One lackluster scene after another. The bad guy? An overweight soggy-diaper of a science miss. Did this guy say ONE thing that was scientifically accurate? Did ANYONE making this film take a physics class??! What the h-ll's the matter with people today? Just because you drop some shiny dimes on a flick, it's automatically good??! This was worse than some of the third rate 1950s B-movies my Grandmother forced me to sit through in my youth!

great one,"""Spider-Man 2"" swings into superhero cinematic glory, offering a thrilling adventure that not only surpasses its predecessor but sets a benchmark for the genre. Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker captures the essence of the conflicted hero with sincerity, while the film editing seamlessly weaves together action-packed sequences and heartfelt character moments. The strength of the movie lies in its ability to balance the superhero spectacle with a compelling narrative that delves into the personal struggles of its characters. However, the weakness may emerge in moments where the CGI may feel slightly dated by today's standards. The music, composed by Danny Elfman, complements the web-slinging escapades with a memorable and heroic score. With an 8/10 rating, ""Spider-Man 2"" stands tall as a testament to the potential of superhero storytelling, delivering a cinematic experience that soars with emotion, action, and the enduring spirit of a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Lame doesn't even begin to describe it...,"We've been to see two sequels this weekend, and were thoroughly disappointed with both. Besides Spiderman 2, we also saw Shrek 2 - I'll put my remarks about that in the appropriate place.My major criticism of the film comes under the heading of ""character development"". Despite going to inordinate lengths to try and paint the main protagonists as real people with real concerns, this side of things fall flat. The characters remain one-dimensional, with Kirsten Dunst contributing mainly screams and a gratuitous wet-dress-no-bra moment.Tobey Maguire also fails to deliver a convincing performance as Peter Parker, and seems to have been cast for his ability to get into comic book poses, rather than his ability to deliver lines in anything but the most whingeing tone. It's not surprising Spiderman has enemies - after just 2 hours in the cinema I was ready to slap him, too. And asfor Peter Parker being a genius? It'll take a better actor than Tobey Maguire before I believe that.James Franco also makes a meal of things.What this most reminded me of, to be honest, was an episode of Smallville. James Franco has taken all his cues from the young Lex Luthor, certainly. The difference is, I would have enjoyed watching back to back episodes of Smallville more - they actually have a plot, some character development, some acting ability, and actors who are capable of obtaining some empathy from their audience. Oh, and it's free to watch on the telly,too.The continuity also sucks in this film - it's simply not credible for James Franco to find his father's bad guy kit in a secret room when it all got destroyed at the end of the first one, and his Dad had to break back into his laboratory to get the only prototype in the first place. Or did he, somewhere along the line, create a duplicate MacGyver style in case he trashed the first? Not credible.As for the action? Snore. What happened to the random chasing of bad guys in between interludes with the villain, with a few good punch-ups and some wisecracks?So - very simple to fix: recast the lot and get a decent writer on board.One of my largest criticisms is that the entire film just seemed to be building things up for the next sequel, rather than trying to stand as a film in its own right. The result is the feeling that I have completely wasted my time. There are film trailers more interesting and exciting than Spiderman 2. Failing that, watch a few episodes of Smallville - you'll be a lot less disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"I had to rewatch, tobey maguire was an amazing actor during this movie, and Sam Raimi somehow created one of the best superhero movies in my opinion. The pacing was great, the storyline was amazing as it showed peters struggles during college, but also keeping his job and helping people as spiderman. Lost for words.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The true Hero we need,"Honestly, where does one begin. This film truly shows how the life of a superhero can be at times hard and injust, that not everything is perfectly balanced and that it is not just good guys fighting bad guys. In a way, it feels more real than the majority of recent superhero movies. I remember watching this as kid and being more than invested, it blew my mind and even when I watch it again after all these years, I can still say that it is hands down the best superhero movie made in history. No other marvel movie comes close to it, not even Avengers Endgame. So do yourself a favor and watch it right now because it's movies like these that inspire us and help us get through these hard times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
8 limbs of awesome superhero fun!,"Spider-Man 2. Considered by many to be the best of the web-slinging trilogy, this movie nailed it as one of the greatest moments in the Spider-man history. Appropriately, there are about eight reasons why I love this masterpiece.Story: Peter Parker reaching a difficult time in his life (love for MJ, Aunt May's financial problems, failing Dr. Connors' class, etc.) and having to face another villain causing him to consider what life to choose is a great idea for a story. It's such an important part of his life in the comic books that it's hard not to put it in a movie.Peter/MJ Romance: Sure Spidey had other love interests in the comics, but Mary Jane stands out on top. Their love is taken to another level as both struggle to choose between love and the lives they choose, making each of them more 3-dimensional characters. This is all very subtle.Villain: Doctor-freaking-Octopus! Considered by Stan Lee himself to be one of the greatest villains of all time, Doc Ock is finally brought to life as the tentacled terror he is. Like in the comics, he starts out as a good person and someone Peter can relate to, but fate deals a tragic hand as the nuclear physicist is fused to his artificially-intelligent mechanical arms and he sets out to finish what he started by any means necessary. Spectacularly executed and the design of his arms is excellent.Action: These are some of the best action scenes I have seen in a superhero movie. Superior to the ones from the first film, the battles between these 8-legged critters literally takes you to new heights as they practically beat the living crap out of each other. AWESOME!Effects: While the effects like the CGI of the first movie were kinda obvious, this films effects are a major improvement. It almost makes me have a tricky time telling whether something is real or a computer effect and that is impressive. It all makes the action more amazing to watch.Cast: Most of the classic characters are played by a fine cast with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Alfred Molina doing excellent jobs playing their parts, even if Tobey is a little too goofy and dorky. Rosemary Harris does an even greater job here as Aunt May as she goes through a significant change in her life throughout the movie. Lastly, I absolutely enjoy J.K. Simmons as Jameson, who's just wonderfully hilarious and portrays the character perfectly.Themes: The themes are substantial. Spider-Man 2 brings another aspect of the whole great power/great responsibility, that is it is ultimately determined by how we choose to lead our lives, and this is enhanced when you're a hero or villain. This coupled with a few other themes discussed in the film brings a sense of reality to the story.Dr. Connors: Also known as the Lizard, he is my favorite Spider-man character of all time and I am so happy to see him here. LONG LIVE THE LIZARD!!!Without a doubt, this is a spectacular sequel, better than Spider-Man 1 and 3. Wanna see 8 limbs of awesome superhero fun, then this is the perfect movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doc. Otto Octavius stole the show for me!,"It was not as efficient as the first part because that was the movie that introduced me to the universe of superhero/comic book movies first of all. Secondly, it laid the groundwork for a personality who would inspire generations that are to come.Whereas, this sequel feels more like an opportunistic encashment, banking on the popularity and the solid foundation that its cherished predecessor built.That said, I still had lots of fun, and it's a good movie overall. And part of the credits must go to Doc. Otto Octavius, for he had been a memorable villain and became one of my favourites in the world of Spider-man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular Sequel!,"It's not uncommon for successful films to spawn sequels, some are just thrown together simply because a certain film drew large amounts of money at the box office. However, there are exceptions. This film is a perfect example of that. When I watch the first two Spider-Man films, it becomes clear to me that Sam Raimi had a deep understanding and love for the character. There are certain things that I want and expect to see in a sequel: I want to see the story arc(s) continue, and I want to see the characters grow. A good sequel will, and should always have these! To make a long story short, this is what I got with Spider-Man 2. The story borrows elements from the film ""Superman II"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man #50"" (Spider-Man no more) In which the hero struggles with what he wants, and what is right for the people that he protects. Without a doubt, it's a great story for a comic book/superhero film to have. The returning cast are still excellent in their roles, as well as the new actors. This also goes for Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus. It's just an excellent film all-around. So you may be wondering why I love these first two films, (I won't be reviewing Spider-Man 3.) and why I detest the reboot films? well here's why:Reason #1: There was no heart put into the reboot films. To me, the reboot films just felt like a quick cash-grab. A slapped-together attempt to keep Spider-Man from transferring back to Marvel.Reason #2: The supporting characters had no depth. In Amazing Spider-Man 1&2, we never get a sense of who Captain Stacy, Gwen Stacy, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Harry Osborn are. The films just move way too fast to let these characters develop!Reason #3: The Villains have no charisma. The only things that The Lizard, Electro, and ""Green Goblin"", do in the reboot films is this: Fight Spider-Man, get defeated, get incarcerated. The villains in the first two Sam Raimi films on the other hand, have memorable lines of dialogue, intense fight scenes, and iconic looks. The original villains leave an impact on you, the only thing that the new villains leave you with, is a desire to fall asleep.Reason #4: Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a horrible person! Whether he's in the costume or not, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker comes off as a complete douche! He acts like he's above everyone else, never keeps his word, and only cares about himself. A FAR cry from the good-hearted hero from the comics. Tobey Maguire on the other hand, personifies the character of Peter Parker. As Peter, He's an awkward, shy, nerd, but also, he genuinely loves and cares about the people in his life. As Spider-Man, he's the underdog. Even if the odds may not be stacked in his favor, he'll still do whatever it takes to defeat the villain, and protect those that can't protect themselves. These are my reasons as to why I don't like the reboot films. In my opinion, the original two Spider-Man films were perfect. It took me a while to see it that way, but sometimes it takes something really bad to make you appreciate something really good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WoW where to start...,"Wow i cant believe this is in the top 250 of films on IMDb. Godfather being first is bad enough... OK I'm digressing from my topic. Hmmm well to start off i never saw Spiderman 1, but was forced into watching spiderman 2 as a result of peer pressure. I did not enjoy it at all. It was so cheap and predictable. I especially hated the part where... wait i hated the whole thing. there's no point bitching about every single bad part or id be writing a whole research project. But one of the amazingly horrible sences was at the end where the huge sun fusion reaction of whatever goes into the river, and how the mad scientist who made this and whos fault it was redeems himself by doing this. God this sorta sounds like a Disney movie to me. And of course spider man gets the women at the end and not the poor astronaut. Only good part of the movie was spidermans boss who kept dissing him and being mean. I enjoyed these parts. It was kinda whack how it was spidermans fault how his uncle died?? Also the train scene was amusing. I think spidermans webs tearing up all the buildings killed more people then on the train, i mean he wrecked like 3 miles of buildings along the railroad track... haha. enough. no more wasting time on this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't open the caviar!,"The cast of the original franchise-and by that I mean the only acceptable franchise-is so perfect. They could have kept making movie after movie, rather than passing their batons to two new casts in the last ten years. Unfortunately, if you love Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane, James Franco as Harry Osborn, J.K. Simmons as J. Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, you've only got three movies to enjoy them. Still, three movies are better than none, and it's always a fun weekend to break out your boxed set and have a marathon.In this one, Alfred Molina guest stars as the villain Dr. Octopus, and while his acting helps the movie along, his character isn't the most interesting of the villains. Following on the heels of the intriguing Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus would have been a major let-down had it not been for the fantastic special effects. It's not Alfred Molina's fault, and he does the best he can with the character.Peter Parker still has an unrequited crush on Mary-Jane, and in this movie, she's actually engaged to his boss's son, Daniel Gillies. Peter's pal Harry is grieving over his father, so if you want to see the gorgeous face of James Franco pouting in nearly every scene, this will be your favorite of the three. And if you think he's cute in this one, you'll just love the third movie when he gets his smile back. Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. You don't really need one if you're in the middle of the trilogy; you're not going to turn back and leave the series hanging at this point.What I love about comic book movies-the good ones, not the unnecessarily dark ones-is that they always have plenty of comic relief to remind audiences that it's all a fantasy. J.K. Simmons gets to deliver one of the funniest lines: ""Call the caterer. Tell her not to open the caviar."" He's hilarious in this movie, as he tries to turn Spider-Man into a menace through his newspaper. Rosemary Harris gets a meaningful monologue about how important it is to do the right thing even when everyone else is against you, and Elya Baskin makes his presence immortal with one word: ""Rent?""See-who needs plot when you've got memorable moments that make it nearly impossible to choose a favorite of the three movies? The first movie is my favorite because of the introduction to the story. The second one is my favorite because of the incredible scene when Tobey stops a crashing train. The third one is my favorite because James Franco and Kirsten Dunst make an omelet. Call me sentimental.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great responsibility comes great drama,"I liked the first Spiderman but could not quite understand why it was considered to be that brilliant. For me the silly Green Goblin ""costume"" spoiled much of the fun. With Dock Ock we have only the second best Spidey villain but as played by Molina he is much, much better for the film. He is exactly like I thought Ock should appear on the screen. Dito for J. Jonah Jameson. He was just amazing. Please Hollywood, there is nothing wrong in considering a best supporting  actors award for him. There are a million great things in this one and I cannot thank the creators enough for giving us a sequel that captures the spirit of the original comic. There is really love and respect for the original but with a lot of unique new ideas that make this work perfectly. (Putting the Bugle into the Flat Iron Building was a stroke of genius.) I still think it was wrong to start with MJ instead of Gwen Stacy - the only real love of Peter Parker - but given the fact that today's readers would not know her that is okay especially as Kirsten Dunst plays her role in a way that unites character traits of both Gwen and MJ. When Peter gave up his Spiderman identity (I think in #50) it was one of the greatest issues in the series and writer(s) of this wisely built the script around this emotional highlite with nearly exactly the image from the comic. Bravo. I do hope the the third part will be as good as this. But if the creative team stays I have no doubts that it will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sucked,I went to see an action movie and all I got was a boring beginning that didn't start picking up into the end which I didn't' get to see cause I was sleeping through it. I love Kirsten Dunst she's a great actress very pretty too. I mean could they make the movie seem more realistic. Daredevil was more realistic and I still believe that it was a better movie than the two Spidermans combined. Tobie Maguire isn't' that great of an actor and he just flat out stunk again. The only reason I went is because my family went and the only worthwhile thing was seeing how beautiful Kirsten Dunst looks like in a wedding dress. By the way it was so easy for her to figure out that he was spiderman she knew it at the end of the first why didn't they go into that instead of drawing it out and having her engaged to some wack off in NASA.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spidey Really IS Amazing,"Saw a sneak preview last night. OMG! Awesome! Great story, great writing. Someone was paying attention when they wrote this. If you're a comic book fan, you'll be amazed at the closely followed storyline(s) from the Spiderman comic. Not lots of action in the beginning, but it's interesting all the same. When the action starts, it doesn't stop. I was so stressed out by the end of this movie, but in a good way. There's always at least one problem with even a 10 rated movie - after all that action it goes to credits playing an incredibly lame song. It's just, it just doesn't fit. I know that seems petty but a pounding beat would have suited far better than the slow song that they chose.Tobey acts his butt off. His character is in a constant state of upset through the entire movie and you just feel for him. Alfred Molina is GREAT! Perfect casting. Everyone else is good too but they're not the focus of the story.A few surprises, especially at the end. Very cool. Gotta see it again.

If these producers thought about to put something original from themselves,they did !! But i've found lots of paradoxes between the movie and the cartoon. For instance,the murder of uncle Ben is not same in both ones. Or MJ doesn't ever meet JJ Jr. in the cartoon. (They make them marry in here.)And also, the cast of Peter Parker is disappointing. He is not even close to the original Peter Parker. Ýn the cartoon,he must be at least 1.85 & 80 kgs and muscular..

The biggest summer disappointment. (for me),"so watched it today and i think this is the biggest disappointment of all time to me. It's a normal, stupid sequel. I liked the first but this one is just crap. Everythink's full of CGI crap.(as you mentioned sequels nowadays are like these). Sequels nowadays destroy the first one. They always think they have to use a newer version of cgi program or whatever. Just because they think they have to do it better. Who likes this stuff? The villain wasn't as good as willem dafoe. Tobey Maguire still thinks he's god. although he didn't do much. He's just a guy you know to get all the money in. Like orlando bloom etc. Maguire only had to wear 5 times the costume and say like 30 lines and that's it. The rest of it will be done in the computer. I hope for Sam Raimi he won't do the 3rd part.

One of the Best Sequels,"Not only one of the best superhero sequels but one of the best sequels of all time! This movie goes above and beyond in developing this ravishing world further whilst not straying far from its predecessor. Without hesitation, Sam bullies and knocks Peter Parker down, again in an effort to focus on the man inside the Spider-Man. That being a bigger subject in this chapter of this story as displayed through the 'antagonist' that a minority of fans were displeased with. Despite Doc Ock having limited screen time, in my opinion he is one of the better characters Spider-Man has had to face mainly due to him not actually being the antagonist, moreover a man suffering the same as Peter, fighting the demons inside. The momentous swinging segments were glorious and in a lot ways better than the first movie, growing in power as Peter grows as Spider-Man. In favor of that, Danny Elfman's iconic score is orgasmic to the ears, building an empowering sensation whilst painting Spider-Man as the righteous, morally pure superhero that he is. Although dialogue has that Sam Raimi cheesiness, every character is brilliantly acted, even the characters whom play a small role; and in addition, the gorgeous set designs they stand all corroborate in creating this New York atmosphere that feels ever so lived in. The action is entirely Spider-Man-esk as both characters crawl over New York as though their sandbox, using anything and everything to stop the opposing force. And the mash between CGI and real elements worked incredibly well adding a small amount of realism.

Best Superhero Relatable Film Ever,"Where do I even begin with this Masterpiece!!!! Sam Raimi did it again bring all Comicbook Spiderman fans a great movie sequel to its predecessor, Spiderman (2002). The film builds off the foundation the Original set and absolutely knocks it out of the park. This movie is by far the most relatable superhero film that has so many lessons you can learn from in it. We see Peter struggling in his normal life due to his responsibility he feels to continue to be Spiderman out of guilt that Uncle Ben was killed in the Original Film. As a result his life is falling apart fast as he gives all the attention to Spiderman. When he learns to forgive his self for Uncle Ben's death he is able to let Spiderman go and starts to build his life back though he loses his powers due to him not being honest in what he really wants til he finds who he really is and wants and learns that he can be both Peter and Spiderman at the same time is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!This Movie does what no other superhero film does and that's showing the struggles of balancing your personal everyday life with the duties of being a superhero all at once. There will NEVER BE ANOTHER SUPERHERO FILM LIKE THIS ONE.

the amazingly bad movie,i would not recommend seeing this movie if you have seen this you know what I'm talking about.The movie was slow hardly any fight scenes and when there would be it would include mj and he would always think of M.J and then he would scream her name it was like the last one and then i just sat in my seat looking so bored cause of the slowness of that movie you can go ahead and see this movie and then you will see what I'm talking about almost all kids who love this comic some of them even look bored. But if you like chick fliks then go see and you will like i recommend it for those who like chick flicks. I know all I'm doing is bad mouthing the movie but the people i saw it with they bad mouthed too.If you see it it would be a waste of money,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the possibly best films ever made,"Spiderman 2 shows the depth that director's all around have to use. Spiderman 2 has that energy to please any audience to make them feel like they know Peter Parker.Peter Parker has to decide whether he wants a life of responibitly or a normal life. Peter does some sad things in this film that made me cry. I felt as if i was spiderman and i was the one making the desicions. Mary Jane has to decide if she wants a life of danger or one that is quiet that doesn't involve Peter or Spiderman. We know she ends up with Peter in the end but if you see at the end of the movie, we see her head against the window door with a sad face. She knows that her choice will or could claim her life. Seconds thoughts are everything right now. She is going to die if she stays.Harry Osborn now knows who Peter really is and as the movie goes on, he begins to realize that Peter shares his loyalty to Spiderman and not him and he becomes increasingly more mad.

Better than the first one,"Very few sequels ever surpass the original film. Spiderman 2 is one of this select club of films that is actually better than the first one.Tobey Maguire continues to impress as an actor, putting to shame the initial critics when he was chosen for the role. He gives Spiderman depth, vulnerability and a certain boyish charm. Kirsten Dunst, while not one of my favourite actresses, turns in a decent performance.Sure, Doctor Octopus is a ridiculous villain. But this movie is about more than just the plot. The film-making has matured here. There is more subtlety to the execution of the scenes and the story.Spiderman 2 is a great action/adventure movie that's a lot of fun to watch. It probably ranks up there as one my favourite superhero movies of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Call me crazy, but I enjoyed the first one a little more","I thought that as far as sequels go, this was a great follow up. But, Spider Man 2 was, for me, lacking something that the first one had. It's crazy, but I can't point it out. I just enjoyed the first one more. The special effects are amazing. The acting is fine. I do give Sam a lot of credit. He did a great job on the sequel. Like I said, it just didn't give me the same satisfaction like the first one did. I would recommend. Especially if you enjoyed the first one, you will like this one.

Caught in the web again!,"I just can't help it. I'm a sucker for romance and I am touched so deeply to see the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I think it is one of the reasons why I seem to like the second Spiderman movie a bit more than the first. I actually believe that the second movie is a necessary continuation of the first one since the first one leaves the viewer hanging. Throughout the second movie, Peter Parker struggles to learn his destiny and how to create a balance in life, which is essential since the first movie ends without him being able to do this.The acting is also excellent. Sometimes sequels aren't as successful as the first, but I can honestly say that this one was just as praiseworthy as the first.

Oh yeah.  This was a kickin' flick.,"This movie was awesome. Some people with clear mental deficiencies might say things like, ""We rented Spiderman 2 because we hated the first one so much and hated it even more,"" but don't let such an obvious breech of intelligence detract from the greatness of this little film. It's better than the first, and that says a lot. I went into this film not expecting very much, as sequels tend to disappoint (see: Blade 2, X-Men 2) but dammit, this movie was just the perfect sequel. The story progressed naturally, with Parker's inner struggle between being a normal young man and being a super-hero who does good but ultimately hurts those around him. Al Molina was an excellent choice to play Doc Oc. He made perhaps one of the crappiest comic book villains into a character of awesomeness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Actually better than the first movie.....WOW!,"When Spider-Man came out in 2002, I thought that the movie was a sheer work of genius and could not be surpassed by any sequel....well how wrong I was.Because when Spider-Man 2 came out in 2004, I was pretty surprised. This movie is one of the best movies ever released. Everything was perfect in the movie, the acting, directing, action, even the script and story were perfect. The moments when the story didn't even matter were perfect!Sam Raim and Tobey Macguire simply out did themselves in this one. And Alfred Molina was pretty good too, and if you ask me, he probably had a better role than Willem Dafoe did as the Green Goblin in the first movie. And don't get me started on J.K. Simmons who plays J.Jonah Jameson(funny as always).But unfortunately as in all movies, it had its downfalls. The downfall of this movie however is the corny lines that MJ says in the movie.But besides that, the film was good and very enjoyable, I strongly recommend this movie to people who are fans of the first film and the ever loving comic books.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Cannot believe the ratings for this movie, it's crap","I think the only way to survive this movie is by getting drunk prior to watching it.It's slow, over-dramatic ( which is OK in a b-movie or if the ingredients had been mixed up properly ), boring and so-on. I don't think you are supposed to sympathies with the villain in these kind of movies, but Spiderman is simply too much of a loser to feel for. Consequently, I cannot believe the ratings for this movie. It's got little or no humour (kind of essential I'd think ), bad acting ( or is that on purpose? ) and a lousy script. Perhaps I'm missing the point and it's actually wickedly funny and has all the marks of a classic, but somehow I don't think so.I did enjoy Spiderman 1 for what it was worth: a straightforward action movie, but that's not enough to save this one.I have come to rely on the ratings from IMDb.com however, this surely must be one of the worst blockbusters ever.

Excellent sequel to the first with a well thought out plot.,"''Spiderman'' 2002 was fantastic but for me only gained 8/10 on a whole. Spiderman 2 is one of those rare films which outclasses its prequel in many respects such as the part where peter parker has to decide who he is and whether being spiderman is the right path to take. Everything from the first sequence with Joes 29 minute guarantee rush to the twist of harry Osbourne finding his fathers green goblin equipment at the end keeps the mind of the viewer well and truly interested at every stop.My personal favourite moment is the train sequence with doc oc and spidey. When first viewing this part of the film the exhilaration is eminent and frequent and overall truly fantastic. I also loved the way it seemed that the doctor (not doc oc or Connors the one peter goes to see about his problems) and aunt may at some point in the film seemed to know peter was spiderman but does not really let on to the audience.Overall a great sequel with good fights, good plot, romance and great music!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of my favourites,"Granted, I'm only sixteen, and haven't seen many movies before about 1975. But I've read many, many Spiderman comics, and this film captures the essence almost completely.Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first in every way. Better story, much better villain, although there is nothing wrong with Willem Dafoe. He did the best with the character he was given. But Molina conveys an actual sense of emotion to the audience. It actually made me care about him. Plus, the fight scenes were 10 times better.Peter and MJ's strained relationship actually makes you care about what happens to them. You actually hope it turns out great for them in the end. Maguire and Dunst are the perfect cast.Franco is a superb Harry, and is just how I'd imagine him to be. Ruthless, but caring and friendly. Harris is as loving and caring as Aunt May would be expected to be.I have one problem though, and that is that Spidey is not as witty as he should be. He has barely any snappy one-liners that we've come to expect from the wall crawler.But apart from that, this is a cinematic masterpiece, mixing comedy, drama, action and romance.Roll on Spider-Man 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man 2 another horrible movie in the vein of the first.,"Well, I just got a chance to watch Spider-Man 2 again. I must say this is a bad movie. Period. Every time I get into and think ""ahh, this isn't that bad"" something stupid happens or there's some cheap crappy effect. Let's start at the beginning the whole pizza scene was absolutely horrible. I mean who cares. Spidey has these amazing powers and this is what he does with them? I know he wants to be a normal guy but this is just stupid. What else? Well, Otto introduction was horrible. Those stupid arms and the control mechanism in the back of his neck. Isn't it enough that through his actions his woman was killed and now he's obsessed with getting it right for her sake? Now everything he does is governed by these arms. Oh and then there's the Evil Dead like scene with the arms in the hospital. None of that is called for. Some of that stuff was pretty brutal. Not that I personally have a problem with violence but I wouldn't let my kid who'd want to see this movie see that. Save it for darker comic characters like The Punisher or Black Widow. And I absolutely hate the whole ""I don't want to be Spiderman and now my powers go bye-bye."" What a load of crap. And yes I know that idea was pulled from a comic but some of comics pro including Lee himself said maybe that wasn't the best idea. It's a bad idea simply because of the purpose of Spidey. ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Take one away and Spidey in pointless. That's one of the problems he faces in the comics he can never give up being Spidey because the powers are aways there. And the train scene was total crap. Let's take the word of a little kid that nobody's going to tell anyone of my identity. Meanwhile, you can picture someone running out the back of the train to break the news. But what's it matter, by the end of the movie half of New York know's who he is. Over all this movie isn't worth the time. It's a bad story and other than Ock and JJ there's nothing but bad acting to go with it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An action movie gone sour.,"After the first spider-man movie my anticipation was another action flick with a little romance thrown in. But, spider-man 2 came across as a Shakespearean tragedy with a little action thrown in. Peter parker's relationship with Mary Jane was an important part of the picture and I think should have been explored but it was elevated much higher than necessary for an action flick... The special effects was great and the action that was present was good. I can enjoy a good love story with heart brake and heart ache but not at the expense of blowing things up, mischief and mayhem. The train scene was great action then went straight downhill. That ""win one for the gipper"" stuff is just very hackneyed and usually not very well done as is the case in this movie. Even though spider-man is a comic book character and if you read the comic book you had an idea of how things would end up, the movie seemed to telegraph what was happening next to whom and when. There was no real drama just a lot of Kleenex moments which don't fill the void for some action.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

While I have been unimpressed with most of the recent superhero movies (The Punisher, Hulk), the Spider-Man movies have continued to remain a step or two ahead of the pack. While not staying 100% true to the original comics, they don't stray too far. The production is top-notch and give us a visual treat with out going too far beyond believability. Despite some initial reservations, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have proved to be quality choices for the roles of Spider-Man and Mary Jane. Along with a solid supporting cast and good direction by Sam Raimi, the Spider-Man movie franchise has set the bar for superhero movies in the 2000s. I'm looking forward to the next installment.

That's all thanks to this movie. This is the best movie ever. YES!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!! Well, the plot of this movie is simple but very intriguing. It's all about how Peter Parker has been living two lives since he became Spider-Man after being bit by a genetically enhanced spider. His responsibility was to use his powers for the good of man kind. After being lectured by his uncle Ben saying ""With great power comes great responsibility, he went off and disobeyed him.

My favorite super hero movie~,"I really enjoy this film so much.You will never guess what the spider-man wants to be. He is flying all around the city to save the people who is suffering the dangerous. I think everyone will love the hero like spider-man.And I believe there is a hero around us. Theykeep us be honest, give us strength, make us noble, and finally allowus to die with proud. Ever though sometimes we have to initiativelygive up the thing we want most, even our dreams. Spider man will alwaysencourage us.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them. Readers could identify more completely with heroes like themselves than with remote godlike paragons. Peter Parker was an insecure high school student, in grade trouble, inarticulate in love, unready to assume the responsibilities that came with his unexpected superpowers. It wasn't that Spider-Man could swing from skyscrapers that won over his readers. It was that he fretted about personal problems in the thought balloons above his spidery face mask.But he has the heart to help the people without any return, it is worth for me to learn.Spider-Man 2 is a wonderfully conceived and executed film. There are some stylized moments，however，particularly those dealing with Peter Parker as just a typical, somewhat hapless guy. And these decisions may prove to be a detriment for those wanting to see a superhero be super. The tone of the film is certainly more lighthearted than the Dark Knight. And that may be a detriment depending on taste.The objective truth is that Spider-Man 2 is one of the best films I have ever seen.

A bad review for Spider-Man 2...? How shocking!,"Alright this will be my first time commenting on a movie here at IMDb. The reason I joined was because it was just so irritating to see some of these awful movies receiving rave reviews. 10/10 for Spider-Man 2? I have a question: Have you ever seen a movie besides this one? Is it simply that you don't have any good movies to compare this to? Now on the whole I don't really like comic book movies. That's not to say I don't like any and it's definitely not to say that I don't like comics. So with that out of the way let's jump into the problems.One thing a director or writer must be careful of is bad dialogue. Conversations that seem awkward or would never, under any circumstances (including hypothetical situations) occur. The conversations between May and Peter are so corny I had to force myself to continue watching. I know some of you might argue that it's a comic book movie so it's allowed to be corny. That doesn't necessarily mean anyone is going to like it. The first Spider Man was tolerable for me because it didn't have this problem.The second problem: the characters. Peter Parker is portrayed as being reserved, shy, etc. Where did this idea come from? He's a superhero! He is allowed to be cocky, to make bad jokes about the villains, and to trust in his own abilities and knowledge. Let's move to Dr. Octopus. I can summarize this with a Chris Rock quote: ""What happened to just being crazy?"" Why is the doctor is some sort of a struggle with his mechanical arms throughout the movie? Why can't he just be a villain? The third: the annoying people of the city. Their fondness for our webbed hero is overplayed. Some of this part is simply ridiculous. Watch it you'll see what I mean.In conclusion, please don't give this movie a good review. The fate of all movies which are actually good depends upon it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More Human than Spider. Troubled Peter Parker languishes through Spider Man II,"In the second installment of the adaption of the Marvel comic book hero's saga. Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) is exhausted and disillusioned at the prospect of continuing his double life as his alter ego Spider Man. Beset with financial troubles and lovesick for his childhood sweetheart Mary Jane Watson, Portrayed modestly by beauty Kirsten Dunst. Fearing he can never be with Mary Jane and protect her from Spider Man's mortal enemies at the same time, He sets out to try and erase Spider Man from his consciousness. But there are plenty of pitfalls along the way. And the more Parker tries to keep things calm, the more catastrophes flare up. Most of them just aching for the return of the wall crawler. And when yet another mad scientist is hideously altered by a benign experiment gone awry, there is never any real doubt that Spidey will return. Otto Octavious or Doc Ock, one of Spider Man's main nemesis in the best selling comic book, is portrayed with maniacal intellect by Alfred Molina. A fine actor who has had excellent rolls in lots of top notch films including 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' but will probably always be remembered as 'Moody' in the docudrama 'Not without my daughter.' If I did have a problem with this film it would be with Mcquire. If you're going to remain true to the gist of the comic book, which I think this movie otherwise does an excellent job of. You'd have to also remain true to the Peter Parker character. Peter Parker was not a nerd. He was a shy young man who blossomed through the lessons he learned as the incredibly powerful Spider Man. Mcquire looks to me like a real nerd, and therefore he has no room or way to blossom. I think they could have fit someone hunkier with a set of horn rimmed glasses at the beginning and convinced me that they had bulked up through web slinging and grown up through crime fighting while still looking like a movie star. In Mcquire's defense, playing a super hero can be difficult, because it is so outrageous to think that someone could ever posses superpowers, left alone make anyone believe a real human being would choose these reactions to the world in their situation. And he is credible inside this theory. I'm not saying Tobey Mcquire is an incompetent actor, I'm saying he is wrong for this roll. He is simply too milk toast for my tastes. Especially when he's attempting to court the beautiful Dunst. Who's elegance leaves no doubt as to why Spidey would prefer to be human. There are lots of pluses though. Molina is a strong and convincing villain. And the special effects are an absolute wonder. The entire effects crew received an Academy Award for their efforts and it's easy to see why. The deadly artificial limbs sported by Doc Ock, are as convincing as they are terrifying. Whether he's walking down the street, climbing a wall or battling the wall crawler toe to toe, it is a breathtaking spectacle. I have never seen a film, including the amazing 'Star Wars' sequels, which could boast effects as realistic and stunning as these. For fans of this genre there is no drop off from Spider Man to Spider Man II. It is much more like another issue than it is a sequel and this is a credit to the brain trust behind this engine whether or not they meant to present it this way. They tease you with the human struggle, then knock your noggin off with thrilling action. This is a blockbuster worth every penny.

"A Clone Of Superman 2, But That Is No Bad Thing!!","Spider-Man 2 is a rare sequel that is much better than the original movie.Plot In A Paragraph: After two years of fighting crime as Spider-Man, Peter Parker's life has begun to fall apart. The girl he loves is dating someone else, his grades are slipping, he cannot keep his jobs, as he is always late due to some crisis always coming up. He reaches his breaking point and gives up life as Spiderman. But at the same time after an accident scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus, having four long tentacles as extra hands.Tobey Maguire is much better this time around in the lead role as Peter Parker. Raimi also gave the sequel a very memorable villain in Doctor Octopus, as played by Alfred Molina, who was terrific as Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man 2 gives Otto a tragic backstory and you did actually feel some pity for him. Director Sam Raimi gives us a good story too, with Harry Osborne (again brilliantly played by James Franco) hunting Spiderman down, for what he believes is the murder of his Dad as a subplot.The screenwriters of Spiderman 2 must have studied ""Superman II"", because its story is very similar to The Man Of Steels sequel in many ways. Both films re-cap the first film through their opening credit sequences. In this film, Peter Parker chooses to give up his double life as a superhero in order to have a relationship with his one true love, Mary Jane. In ""Superman II"", Clark Kent gives up his double life, and his abilities, so that he may be with Lois Lane. In both movies, the hero is urged not to give up his powers by a relative, and both regain their powers when it's needed. In this film, a train-full of people stand up to Doc Ock, and he easily dismissed them. In ""Superman II"", a street-full of people stand up to General Zod believing he has killed Superman, but he simply blows them away. And finally in both movies the love of the heroes life finds out his secret identity.But copying a movie considered by many to be one of the greatest Superhero sequels ever made, is no bad thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
First movie I ever walked out of,"I have watched thousands of movies in my life, from the very best to the very worst. Even the bad movies have their redeeming characteristics: until now. The slow painful tedium was like a root canal, without the sense that it's actually worth it in the long run.If you saw the first movie, you'll know that Spidey is a neurotic doormat desperately searching for something in the way of a personality. If you loved the first movie, you'll be pleased to know he doesn't show any sign of growing up and getting a life. He's still just as useless, and shows even less chance of getting over himself than ever. Nor will he ever get the girl, which, in this humble reviewer's opinion, is a good thing. She deserves better, but not by a heck of a lot.Such morbidly pathetic characters can be watchable if there is some realism, wit or spark. Unfortunately, in Spiderman the acting is terrible, the dialogue could be written by an 8-year-old, even the direction and cinematography are weak and incoherent.""So what,"" you say, ""Spiderman is an action movie"". I'm afraid not. Spiderman 2 is an inaction move. Nothing happens, dreary scene after dreary scene of Toby in a street somewhere looking expressionless. The greatest rush is when Spiderman's web malfunctions and he falls out of the sky. A fitting end, you'd think, but no such luck.There are scarce few action scenes and they are among the worst paced I've ever seen. And we've all seen enough CGI recently to not be too thrilled by a guy with robot arms who doesn't do anything except wave them around a lot.If you want to watch home movies of Toby Maguire tripping over his own feet on the footpath, this is the movie for you. It was about this point that I realized that my life was too short. About 20 minutes later, I realized I wasn't even watching the screen any more, so I walked out.

Blockbuster of the year?,"Going into Spider-man 2 I was somewhat dubious about the hype surrounding it. I was a tad unimpressed by the first film, it never surpassed X-Men IMO, at times it felt a bit artificial and the time elapsing device seemed to miss out a lot of key events and just assumed we'd guess what happened since they left college. The action was pretty special at points, but somewhat marred by the CGI, which I was never convinced by.Spidey Mk 2, welds the story far more convincingly together, managing to deal with all the various plot strands, character development and adding some very humorous moments (I'm still guffawing at the lift scene, the busker was a most amusing bit of in jokery, and Bruce Campbell would get an Oscar if there was one for hilarious cameos), all the whilst delivering awesome action. The attack on the bank and the train sequence are big screen action to the max. I was literally gasping at points there. Best of all is probably the operating theatre, as Doc Ock's tentacles kick in to life, with devastating effect.Sam Raimi's roving camera adds to the experience, the camera zooming in to detail the key action.There are some smartly directed little moments to, like Peter running across the rooftops trying to recover his powers (a wonderful flipside to his ""discovery"" in the first film) which are filmed with real pizazz. There were a few other moments where the camera pans round in such a way as to be in itself exciting. Kudos to Bill Pope for helping bring the cinematography to such an exciting level. I'll need to see it again just to remember all my favourite bits.I guess the sheer scale and scope of the movie will diminish on the small screen. What makes both movies so great is the way you are sucked into this take on New York, the world of Spidey. Something all great movies do and it's best represented on a mega mutha of a screen.This is one of the best blockbusters in recent years, up there with Mr Jackson's masterpiece. It delivers everything a film should laughs, emotion and excitement, a genuine hero. There are some thought provoking messages too, the idea that in everyone there's a hero, it's inspirational stuff. I think people will still be warming to Spider-Man 2 for years to come. Nine out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
all out praise for a great movie,"In my not so very humble opinion this movie was better then the first one. That idea could be inspired by the face that I like Doctor Octopus better as the bad guy then the Goblin.I think they did a good job with the special effects, for being a bit of someones fantasy it is not overdone in a way that you can not think of it as a small piece of reality.The story line is cool, and some in some of the scenes the special effects are breathtaking!Basically, if the movie was a hotel it would be a five star one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Epic,"I give this mark because its not possible to give 9 and a half and 10 is going to far. This film is an epic, the best comic book adaptation of all time. Fantastic completely understandable villain with a goal in life other than to destroy Spider-man just because.The plot really focuses well on the personal difficulty of being a superhero, and not that this is so important but I was quite amused by the prospect of Spider-man delivering pizza for a living. I have seen some have a go critics moaning about tha fact that Spiderman 2 has tried to be too funny and too romantic and failed, but these people have entirely missed the point of spiderman, this is a comic book adaptation, its an action film you can turn your brain off in this film and feel like a boy again. And if it throws in a couple of only slightly amusing jokes and a little romance? Thats fine, its Hollywood nice to have a bit of that in there and not take itself too seriously all the time.I am going to be topically boyish and say ""if you didn't like this film your probably not worth knowing""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

a vast improvement over the original,"As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way. But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us? What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love? That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in ""Spiderman 2,"" a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous ""Spiderman"" from 2002. Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door. Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves. When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal. It is this added intellectual dimension that gives ""Spiderman 2"" the thematic heft that ""Spiderman 1"" lacked.The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche. The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around. A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective. His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through. The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.I wasn't a big fan of the first ""Spiderman"" movie, but ""Spiderman 2"" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist. Raimi may have struck out the first time around, but he has managed to hit a homer - or at least a solid triple with the bases loaded - this time at bat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""With the actors more comfortable in their roles, Spider-Man 2 swings high""","Peter Parker can't seem to catch a break. Being Spiderman has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him he decides that he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore. Then a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus. Peter realizes that only Spiderman can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spiderman for the death of his father, wants him dead.Sam Raimi being the Spider-Man fan that he is, finally is able to treat the audience with a superhero movie to be remembered. Spider Man 2 goes down in history as one of those sequels that is able to out due it's predecessor.The sequel improves on so many things that were wrong in the original, here the actors are finally comfortable in their roles, like Kristen, I didn't believe her in the first one, but this one I did. She was able to showcase her emotions more and the chemistry was there. Franco's character and performance was over-the-top. But Franco uses this to his advantage and pulls it of. Alfred Molina stole the show in this film, he was Doc Ock, perfect villain and perfect for the role. McGuire is now Spider-Man, whereas in the original, we only saw him as the nerdy Peter Parker, it took him two tries, but he finally nailed it.I loved how it went all Evil Dead in the doctor scene, with the people screaming, then out of nowhere BOOM, chainsaw, classic Sam Raimi and a great homage to his best film to date. But who can forget the Bruce Campbel cameo, and Hal sparks of course. Was there too much comedy??? well, I'm 50/50 on that, the one scene that everyone seemed to hate, but I loved would be the ""Rain drops keep falling on my head""The little freeze at the end had my laughing, because it's Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle comedy for perfect situations. Although there was too much comedy from Peter and not enough from Spidey...I only recall one comedic thing said from Spidey, to Doc Ock in the bank...something along the lines of ""Here's your change"", then throws money at him. Where is the friendly neighborhood Spidey we all grew up with and love.The train fight is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. I was waiting for him arms to rip out of their sockets when he was trying to stop the train from crashing over the edge. The CGI is a big improvement here, it's not all goofy comic book looking, here we see a man swing from building to building, anybody notice the costume looks darker in the CGI moments, maybe it was just me but it does.One gripe with the villain...not enough screen time. I wanted to see more of him, but whenever he's on the screen, you know it's good. It's clear that Molina is the scene stealer here.The film though was a little lengthy, they could of taken out a ""swinging moment"" here and there, those were all over the place. Raimi ends the movie perfectly, setting up the third installment, with the look of ""Am I doing the right thing?"" on MJ's face. Nice homage to The Graduate. Raimi flushes this film full of classic homages, whether it's from his own, or just classic films like King Kong, they always add a nice touch of coolness to the film.This is one of the better superhero movies out there, the fans of Spider-Man will enjoy and the movie goer will be entertained, this is a winner in my books",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A classic, overshadowed by two mediocre reboots","I didn't know Spider-Man at all when I was born. After 10 years later, I found myself collecting money to buy the magazines including Spider-Man comics. I loved him. At 2002, when I was 22 years old, Spider-Man's movie was released. By the director Sam Raimi, whose work I admire a lot. Movie was so good. It had a great cast, well executed story, amazing CGI, and a comic feel to it. I was very excited for the second one. I mean who wasn't? 2 years seemed impossible to wait for me. When it finally arrived, I was pumped. And I left the cinema with a good feeling. This movie right here had everything. Alfred Molina's likable villain, Peter's hard time with his alter ego, great performance from JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, comic relieved scenes and great CGI. But aside all of that, it was a magical tale of love and adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The worst £6.50 I ever spent!,"I remember being taken to see this cinematic offering when it was released here in the UK some years past. My now ex-girlfriend, I recall, woke me rather violently after I had drifted off at some point during the previews.I only wish she could have left me sleeping. Once awake I have to admit that I not impressed with what I witnessed on screen.Both Maguire and Dunst are actors of reasonable quality when paired with the right cast and directors. Maguire put on reasonably good shows in both 'The Cider House Rules' and 'Plesantville' I have also seen Dunst do rather will in a number of differing roles 'Interview With A Vampire', 'The Virgin Suicides' and when working with Cameron Crow, she put on a spectacular performance in 'Elizabethtown'.With Sam Raimi's help they have actually managed to participate in a film that was SO BAD I was actually angry when I left the theatre.The lackadaisical narrative, the shallow characterisation, sketchy continuity (especially during that ridiculous sequence on the train where we all saw Spidey doff his mask whilst trying to stop the passenger train careering off the end of the track by leaning against the front of it, only to have said mask returned to him by two kids inside the train. How on earth they ever managed to find the thing is beyond me).What all this boils down to is that perhaps this is one of the worst films Hollywood has ever produced. Apologies to all my friends who, for some reason, believe this This Thing to be the epitome of comic book movies. I'm sorry with no characters deeper than a specimen jar, no great narrative, no endearing features what so ever, aside perhaps from Ms Dunst (who was decorative more than functional in her role) this is utter tripe. Trite and tested tripe I grant you but tripe none the less.Perhaps the true, die-hard fans of this Spidey sensation see something in it that I am missing, but while I still have an ounce of respect for my cinematic sensibilities I'll be giving it a big old thumbs down.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the ultimate super hero movie,"Here is an example of a film where a movie can be ranked ""great"" or ""spectacular"", and it's sequel being ""even better"" and ""flawless"". The ""great, spectacular"" film is the first Spider-Man film by Sam Raimi and the ""even better, flawless"" film being Spider-Man 2, also directed by Raimi.""Spider-Man 2"" succeeds over the first film in all aspects. The parts of the first film that were weak, are improved. The spectacular parts of the first film are now on an even more epic level. In ""Spider-Man"", I had always felt that the development for the origins of our ""heroes"" and ""villains"" were rushed through just to make way for the action and main story lines, which isn't necessarily a bad idea. But in this action-packed sequel, it can deliver MORE action and have BETTER story lines and origins for the characters. The origin for our new villain, Doc Ock, was more understandable, realistic, and developed on the screen and through research than the origins of Spider-Man's first screen villain the Green Goblin. What's more, ""Spider-Man 2"" delivers us more character development so we can treat these characters like real people with real problems. Peter Parker's struggle is now to live two lives at once. Both of them with heavy responsibility. And of course to deal with the new villain in town.Another thing I liked about ""Spider-Man 2"" is that the villains also seem two-sided like real people. There's nothing wrong with a villain who is just pure mean, nasty, and murderous. But Doc Ock is showed as also having a good side to himself as well as a bad side. Human frailties are equally effectively shown in him as in our title character Spider-Man. Both of these characters have aspects of them that need to be shown through computer graphics, and sometimes, they are entirely in CGI. Like the first film, these effects are flawless and now the winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.Overall, ""Spider-Man 2"" is an improvement over ""Spider-Man"" and the third installment ""Spider-Man 3"". It is the best of this epic super hero trilogy, featuring the best storyline, drama, special effects, action, and development.

This was one of my favorite movies of 2004.,"This was one of my favorite movies of 2004. Tobey Maguire's performance was flawless.

Even in the movie, the passengers on the train were willing to risk their lives to protect him. You could just feel the turmoil that he felt when he realized that he couldn't have a life with Mary Jane.Kirsten & Tobey have amazing chemistry, it was a pleasure to watch them interact. I'm not one for action movies, but I really liked this movie, I liked the fact that the love story was a major part of the film.

Majestic movie making in every respect,"In 1981, Sam Raimi unleashed himself (and Bruce Campbell) onto the film world with his first masterpiece; The Evil Dead. Since then, Raimi has gone on to make many films, and hasn't disappointed with a single one. And that more than includes this one.It has become a common opinion among certain people that movies which are heavy on action are brainless and therefore can't be intelligent or have an emotional impact on the audience. The first Spider-Man, and the X-Men films have already disproved this theory; but Spiderman 2 puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt. Many movies that try to blend together several elements end up falling down somewhere, but Spiderman 2 manages to blend more than a few, and blend them into one coherent masterpiece. Within the plot are elements of romance, sci-fi, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and even a little bit of horror, Many films that have tried to blend several elements have failed, but here they all blend together nicely. All the elements of the plot come together, and all are definitely needed for the movie to flow; it is obvious that all these things weren't put in the movie just so the film could profess that it has lots of different elements; there is nothing in the plot of this movie that could be taken out without making the rest of the movie fall apart; in that way, the movie is efficient and yet expansive and ambitious at the same time.The movie starts as it means to go on; with a very exciting pizza delivery sequence. Yes, even pizza delivery is exciting in Spiderman 2. After that the movie is a roller coaster ride; when it's not dazzling you with adrenaline fuelled action sequences, it's pulling at your heart strings with emotionally rich exchanges. Some action films let up when they aren't giving the audience an action sequence; but this one doesn't. It's exciting all the way though. Some of the exchanges, particularly the ones between Aunt May and Peter Parker are genuinely heart felt, and because the characters are so well thought-out and appear on screen as rounded human beings; these exchanges are allowed licence to make you care for the characters. The characters in the movie are a mixed bag, with each one being made up of a number of desires and insecurities, which translate onto the screen both effectively and believably, even in spite of some of them having super powers.Technically, this movie is majestic. The action sequences are truly breathtaking and seeing Spider-Man battle Doctor Octopus around a number of different locations is an unforgettable experience. The acting is also something of note, as the movie is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble. I don't like Tobey Maguire much, but he was made for the role of Peter Parker, and he really does excel with it. The role wouldn't have been believable if it was filled by someone butch, and so Maguire makes for a believable Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst doesn't have as much to do here as she did last time, but what she does do is just fine. The great Alfred Molina fills the role of Doctor Octopus, and like Tobey Maguire was made for the part. Simply put, he's immense in this role; he's intelligent looking enough to be believable as the scientist and nasty looking enough to be believable as the super-villain; thus capturing the essence of his character in both respects. J.K. Simmons steals the show as J.J. Jameson, the head of the newspaper in downtown Manhattan. Every scene with him is a delight and much of his dialogue is absolutely hilarious, which gives the film that all-important third dimension.As previously mentioned, Sam Raimi started life as the director of the fantastic cult hit; The Evil Dead. Despite this film being completely different and on a much bigger scale than the aforementioned; it is evident that Sam hasn't lost his roots. Obviously giving Bruce Campbell a cameo shows this (although I'd have preferred more Bruce, myself), and Sam also reminds us of The Evil Dead with several tributes including a lovely chainsaw sequence, and a workout for the 'Raimi-cam' on the train scenario. The Evil Dead was notable for, amongst other things, the fact that it was extremely well directed. Sam Raimi is an extremely underrated talent and really should be mentioned along with the directors that hog all the praise more often. His direction is extremely assured, and he manages to make everything about the film thrilling and as interesting as it possibly could be.Spider-Man 2 is a film that further disproves the theory that movies based on comic books are brainless and stands out as one of the very best films this decade, not to mention it being a member of the exclusive 'sequels better than the first' club. If you haven't already; see this movie pronto.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Liked it better the second time,"When I saw this movie in the theater I wasn't impressed at all. I thought the romantic scenes were too much and a bit unbelievable.I still think that some romantic scenes are unbelievable. For example near the end when Peter rescues MJ from a falling wall they almost have a one hour conversation. However when I saw the movie for the 2nd time on DVD I realized that it is a true interpretation from the comic book in where Spidey and Peter struggle with all facets of life. Therefor I think this second movie is even better than the first because of the romantic struggle.I think in the end, when the third movie will be done, this second movie will really be an in betweener. Just like, for example, Back to the future II.I am going to give this one 8 out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Funny, emotional, clever, and amazingly good!","The story: Very good and clever. Keeps a very good sense of continuity within the comic book and uses a few juicy story lines from the book as well. At first, rumors had it that Peter Parker simply loses his powers, but the writers made something very interesting out of that twist rather than him simply ""losing"" his powers. I won't say anything more than that on that subject. Peter has relationship problems with M.J. and Harry as he is being tortured through the life of being Peter Parker and Spider-Man. On the side, he battles Doctor Octopus, personally I thought he was a fantastic villain and amazingly menacing.Spider-Man 2 is without a doubt the greatest superhero film of all-time. It captures a very unique style of action that makes it memorable from beginning to end. The acting was pretty good. James Franco did an amazing job as he had the most dramatic scenes and Molina is one heck of a villain in the movie.

Spider-Man 2,"As a maniacal scientist (Alfred Molina) plots destruction against the city, Harry (James Franco) continues his obsession with the superhero he believes is responsible for his father's death, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) tries to get on with her life after being rejected by her true love and Peter (Tobey Maguire) begins to question whether or not he has what it takes to be a superhero.Director Sam Raimi has thrown out traditional sequel conventions and made a thoughtful follow-up. While this makes for a slower film, it is a better one. He has succeeded in making a comic book into a truly excellent film, something I did not think was possible after the failed attempt with ""Hulk."" The special effects, settings and story are all top-notchparticularly the effects. In this day and age, computer effects are mostly overrated and poor. While they are obviously fake in some parts, they are better than in most movies. All returning actors have stepped back into the characters as though they have never left. However, J.K. Simmons (as Peter's boss), as good as he is, seems to belong in a different movie; he's too over-the-top compared with the rest. But, the few missteps are easily forgotten. This is a truly wonderful movie and a testament to what a wonderful filmmaker can do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great story with an even greater movie,"Blockbuster summer movies always carry with them a ""harder they fall"" risk. Fortunately, this movie avoids that trap, and is one of the most visually compelling action movies of all time. That it has a plot which could survive without the special effects only makes it that much more compelling.The movie begins a few years after the last one ends, with Peter Parker, ever-troubled super-hero, unsuccessfully attempts to juggle his studies, some throwaway jobs, and his duties as a superhero. Spidey may be a superhero, but he's also human (one major appeal of Spiderman in general is the scientific basis for how the heroes and villains got their powers), and never is this more apparent as in the beginning of the movie, when his life comes apart at the wheels. Something has to give, so Peter decides to sell Spidey's costume to J. Jonah Jameson (the Spidey-hating, uber-thrifty editor of the Bugle)for some walkaround money. The custome becomes a trophy for Jameson, who gloats over running Spidey out of NYC in his paper. J.K. Simmons turns in the best performance of the movie if one considers just how well he brought the one-dimensional Jonah to life.After Spidey (Toby MacGuire) quits, of course, a supervillain arrives on the scene to drag him out of retirement. ""Doc Ock,"" as he is called, winds up with four metallic tentacles (arms) attached to his body that do his evil bidding after his experiment for ""perpetual fusion"" (read: cheap electricity) goes wrong and begins sucking the world into its reactor (the way the sun would). With no more funding from Harry Osborne to get the ""Tridium"" (what makes the reactor run), the Doc decides to do whatever it takes to continue his work: that means getting more Tridium from Harry, but to do this, Harry makes a deal that he will only trade it for Spiderman.Spiderman presents himself for the battle, but his powers have been on the fritz, and begin letting him down in some painful ways (such as in midair, when his webbing no longer works). Peter Parker (Spidey's alter ego) even consults a doctor and frames the problem as a dream, and is told that Spidey's problem is more likely stress and exhaustion. This is underscored by his powers still partially working, and it is established that Spidey just needs to find his groove again. With Doc Ock wreaking havoc, and with MJ (Kirsten Dunst) moving on with her life, and with his financial difficulties, this is not going to be easy.Peter tries to adjust to life as a normal civilian, but every time he witnesses a crime, he hears duty calling, and he can't break from the past. Compounding his difficulty is that while he was ""on break"" from being Spidey, Peter misled MJ into thinking he had changed, which only furthers the rift between the two (MJ is set to marry Jonah's hunky astronaut son). Needless to say, we get a climax, a native's-eye view of New Yorkers (including one very ungrateful man on a runaway subway car who derides Peter's attempt to stop it), and some very touching scenes involving Aunt Mae, who shows that when called upon, even she can fight the bad guys effectively.This movie excels in the same way as the entire Spiderman series: Peter Parker is so much like most of us that we actually could see ourselves doing what he does, and he also shows that having Superpowers, while not entirely a curse, definitely do not solve one's life problems. In fact, the only time Parker is decisive and without doubt is when he is in costume, and the only uncertainty he feels about that is part of the larger issue of whether or not he is harming himself by saving the world. The moral dilemma is common among activists in that they routinely have to sacrifice personal gains for the greater good, leaving them with the feeling that when they were invited to life's party by God, they were handed a broom and told to clean up the mess created by everyone's fun.Normally it would be a negative to say that the actors portrayed their characters as if they were from the comics, but since this movie is based on the comics, that is yet another plus. Dunst is particularly adept at bringing MJ to life in this way: she really acts as if she were hurtled into this universe from the pages of a cartoon.One would have to have lived in NYC for a long time to appreciate the subtlety with which the city is brought to life. New Yorkers are portrayed in the movie as selfish and into themselves, but also able to rise to the occasion when required to, showing a level of humanity and compassion that can only be understood by natives. On the train, Peter loses his mask in the course of saving everyone, and it is clearly understood that despite the large size of the crowd who has now seen Spidey, that no one will ever breach his confidence. This is New York at its best. I also love the way the movie didn't rename New York, and instead embraced the city rather than alluding to it. Without this characteristic, the movie would have been far less entertaining. One minor part of the film served a double purpose, as it showcased a NYC street musician who happened to be playing the old Spidey theme from the TV cartoons on her violin.Not only is this movie a ""must see,"" but it is a must-see even in a group of a dozen other ""must see"" films. If there is anyone out there who doesn't like this movie, I'd be interested in hearing why. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would finish watching this movie and feel like the time and money spent were not worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
you have to be joking,"What a major disappointment. What a mess. There were times when I laughed out loud (and many of those around us did the same), so embarassing was the scene/symbolism (I mean, the religious references as Spiderman was handed down the train over the heads of grateful passengers - you kiddin me?).So wanted to enjoy this, but the pseudo-pyschology was risible, the baddie hardly threatening, the text stuck its own mire of garbled webbing, the erotic frisson about as sexy and believable as being caught in a giant spider's web in the dark during a particularly heavy storm... Shall I go on? Nope - not worth expanding on. Complete pile of tosh.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
its not better than the first part,well if u see the first part its cooler than the second part because in the second part there is not much action than the first one but it has improved and this time he was almost unmasked that made the film more worse but yes in this part there is a lots of surprises a lot of special effects and the trailers made fans go wow! but some parts of the movie was kind of boring including the flat because why did he have to stay i a flat when he had his own home that part made me sleep but i liked spidermans moves which was so cool like the train part where is goes through that bridge subway that made the crowd in the teather go wow! ya!! but the best part of the movie would be the car flying through the glass which was good and i think everyone liked it and its no time waste but its a good movie and believe me you'll never regret watching this movie ya and don't ever forget to take your tissue box with you,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's just pure fun with a great story, & some really great special effects thrown in with it.this franchise in my opinion has now asserted itself as the premier film franchise in the comic book/superhero genre.

As entertaining as a movie can be,"""Spider-Man 2"" is filled with clichés, melodrama, and comic-book excess--all of which add up to a glorious, but gloriously human, spectacle and the most fun I have had watching a film in recent memory.I went to a midnight showing with a packed audience, most of whom were probably fans of Spider-man, both the first film and the comic-book character. I suspected this when cheering applause broke out at the cameo of Stan Lee, one of the co-creators of the original ""Spider-man"" character.Not everyone, however, was a fan. The person seated at my left was an older gentleman who was obviously not there for the movie but to escort his young, female companion on his left. Due either to boredom or untreated ADHD, his legs sometimes shook, vibrating my chair and annoying me. About halfway through the movie I felt a strange stillness; my neighbor's legs had stopped shaking, and he actually seemed interested in the movie, whispering the odd, excited comment or two to his much younger companion.I doubt many fifty-plus-year-olds will rush out to see ""Spider-Man 2,"" but if some do, they might be surprised to find that they relate to a web-slinging, wall-crawling superhero, but they shouldn't be surprised, however, if they swallow the tension of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) as he admits an awful truth to his beloved aunt May (Rosemary Harris), or feel their hearts swell when Parker answers the call to duty by saving the life of a little girl, or suffer the sharp pangs of unrequited love as Parker watches Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), his (not so) secret love, in the arms of another man. The last scene arouses even more pathos, if not irony, since Parker, continuing a theme from the first ""Spider-man,"" believes he must keep himself distant from Mary Jane in order to protect her.Normally in reviews one outlines the plot or at least gives a brief synopsis, but plot is almost superfluous when describing ""Spider-man 2""--superfluous in the strictest sense of being more than what is needed or required. The plot could have come straight out of the pages of a Marvel comic book: Mad (or, to be politically correct, ""aggravated"") scientist undergoes horrendous transformation, kidnaps girl, threatens millions of lives, and can only be stopped by eponymous hero. Almost any good-guy/bad-guy scenario would have provided sufficient scaffolding. What the writers (Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Michael Chabon, and Alvin Sargent--incidentally, the Hollywood system of giving screenwriting credit is notoriously murky in its rules and final attributions, so I list the contributors without giving anyone any more or less weight) have fleshed out, however, is the concerns of a young college student (Parker) trying to balance responsibilities at home (a widowed aunt struggling to keep her home), at school (he's failing his classes), on the job (when he has one), to his dead uncle (whose death he feels responsible for), to his best friend (who believes Spider-man killed his father), and to his true love (whom he loves too well to actually love). And he's the only one who can stop the mad scientist.What allows the film to succeed, even in potentially ham-handed scenes as the villain cackling that no one can stop him, is the complete devotion of the cast and the filmmakers to Stan Lee's then-revolutionary idea that the most compelling heroes were not the Olympian half-gods or native sons of Krypton. Instead, he gave us Peter Parker, a nerdy teen-ager and social outcast whose entire pre-Spider-man life revolved around his school studies and the close orbit of his uncle and aunt who both raised and cared for him.Hardly the mold for a great hero. But a hero he becomes in this movie, though not without reluctance, doubt, and several second-thoughts, and when he finally embraces the webbed mantle, we feel that he has come to his burden honestly. We can test the genuineness of this feeling in a scene where the almost-martyred Spider-man is borne aloft by the people he has just saved. The overt symbolism warns us that we should be on guard for the grand gesture and operatic. Instead, we feel his sacrifice even more acutely from the quiet and concerned reactions of the people to their fallen and vulnerable hero. That the filmmakers and actors can capture this between scenes of heady, computer-generated kineticism and somehow not lose momentum or the audience's attention results from judicious cutting of the ""action"" sequences and generous cutting of the dialogue and non-action scenes. Thus, we feel Peter Parker at his most vulnerable not in the tentacled grasp of his nemesis Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), but swallowing his words between furtive glances as he tries to answer Mary Jane about his love for her.Though the movie's drama and tension result as much from the inaction as the action itself, the aerial and acrobatic fight sequences delight with both originality and detail. In an almost toss-away gesture, Spider-man retrieves Doc Ock's tossed-away victims and hoists them onto custom safety nets all while giving chase to his fleeing foe and avoiding his crushing tentacles. Another striking scene involving webs, this time with Mary Jane during a moonlit night, is far less busy, but no less dramatic, and calls to mind the poem ""The Spider and the Fly.""I thank all involved with ""Spider-man 2"" for bringing to the screen a faithful comic-book adaptation. But more important, I thank them for bringing to life a modern myth and filling two hours of my life with drama, excitement, and the purest form of joy that only a ten-year-old without a care in the world can feel when he has lost himself in the pages of a comic-book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Spectacular Sacrifices of Peter Parker,"The writers and filmmakers of this sequel to Spider-Man(2002) are to be commended for at least one thing: they actually advanced the story of Peter Parker and his acquaintances. The characters progress forward, a novel concept these days, and so this is not just a rehash of the first Spider-Man movie. I believe the writers, perhaps with director Raimi's input, consciously made this decision, so that we have that sense of actual changes happening to the hero and his supporting cast. It's staggering to think they spent $200 million on this but I guess that's what you need to perfect the computer FX - Spider-Man now looks realistic in every shot, not just 75% of 'em.It really is two years later from the end of the 1st picture: Parker (Maguire) juggles college, part-time jobs, and super-heroing - all not very well. With only 24 hours in a day, why should this be a surprise? Something's got to give, and it turns out to be super-heroics. The central theme continues from the first film, that Parker sacrifices pretty much everything to continue in his role as mankind's helper - until, that is, psychological blocks in his mind cause his powers to peter (no pun intended) out. The story is based a lot on the key issue, #50, of the comic books, from the sixties, as well as Annual#1, in which he seems to lose his powers. The introduction of villain Dr.Octopus in issue #3 is also pivotal. Doc Ock (Molina) is another revelation here - they gave him a wife here, contrary to the books - but this turns him into a sympathetic figure, despite his raw power and the havoc he causes. As Stan Lee himself would say way back when, the most interesting villains are the tragic ones. Molina's final scene is truly haunting, as a result, and trademark Raimi.Also continuing from the previous film is the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). But, this thread definitely advances leaps & bounds by the end. I hope they continue in this vein in the 3rd film. I hope there's a marriage by the end of that 3rd pic and things don't just stagnate. I hope Harry's (Franco) story evolves and maybe concludes. This could be the makings of a really great trilogy. The writers also pulled a daring stunt in having Spider-Man's identity revealed to so many people throughout the film, but it all works in underlining the enormous sacrifice required by Parker on a daily basis. Above all, it helps if you don't have just a faceless super-hero.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does whatever a spider can and then some!,"Peter Parker returns again on this excellent sequel to last year's Spider-Man.  The characters are more defined, the story more complicated, and the action even more satisfying.  One may say of the previous movie that it was more a character-driven film than an action movie and this one equally follows suit, thankfully.  For those who are familiar with the comic (I myself am a fan) will notice that much of Peter's life is filled with angst and you get see a substantial portion of that here as he juggles his social life and his superhero life.  Tobey Maguire adds more depth to his acting muscles as he alternates from poignantly sad scenes to hilarious mishaps.  Kirsten Dunst has a more well-defined and well-written role here as Peter's long-suffering love interest.  J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is nearly flawless and has some of the best lines ever.  As for the action scenes... I've seen this movie twice now, the second time recently on IMAX. The action scenes are still pretty spectacular (it was even more apparent seeing it in an even bigger screen) and doesn't spend too much time on already-noticeable details for ""maximum effect.""  In fact, some parts zoom by so quickly it can be tough just trying to keep up with the furious action.  Sam Raimi knows how to frame it just right so the swinging among the buildings by Spider-Man looks breathtaking.  What is really cool about a movie such as this is that it doesn't rely on the tried-and-true easy way of entertainment (eg. action).  Every action set piece in this film feels well-earned as it is placed on a foundation of strong characterization and story.  10/10.  One of the rare great sequels that outshine the original, right up there among the greats  as ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Empire Strikes Back.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth the wait,"I procrastinated on watching this, because I wanted to see it at home. It was only fair, since I saw the first one at home. I'm used to hating sequels, but this one surprised me. It was one of those movies that I *think* the sequel was even better than the original. I'm going to buy copies of both DVD's and one day watch them both back to back.Toby McGuire is adorable as usual, and this movie gave a much deeper look into his character and what drives him. He was a bit more bold and more focused, but a little slow to react to what his heart told him to do, which kept me on the edge of my seat. I found it easier to follow than the first one, though I didn't have a problem with that in the first one. This one was just more explanatory.I would not actually call this movie a love story. I think it was more an action/drama with a little humor thrown in, and some lingering angst from the first one. All performances were brilliant, I thought.

One of the Best Superhero Films of all Time,"Spiderman 2 is an exception to almost every rule in the book. It's a sequel, it's a superhero film, and it follows another very good film. The stage is therefore set for an awful movie. However, Spiderman 3 is anything but awful. First, we have the special effects. Unlike the first Spiderman film, the action is no longer cartoonish. Instead of looking like a cheap video game, everything looks real. The acting is also satisfactory or above across the board. Maguire and Frnaco are much less awkward, Dunst is more believable, and Alfred Molina is fantastic as Dock Ock. In Spiderman 1, the Green Goblin is corny and not-at-all intimidating. Dock Ock, however, is a terrific villain. Though Molina is not always frightening, the ""tentacles"" are amazingly threatening and cool to watch.

Spidey outdoes Spidey.,"My Take: Better, faster, wilder and deeper than the original.In summer movies' case, the only attempt to make a sequel better than the original is that it should be bigger and louder. The original SPIDER-MAN was everything a fan boy could want from a comic book adaptation (You tell me! I'm not exactly one of them), and the only way the sequel could be better than its predecessor is that the sequel should have bigger special effects, louder surround sound and leave everything else in between (New story? Who cares!).Same is not the case for SPIDER-MAN 2, for not only does it live up to the expectations had for it, it also outdoes and occasionally out-leaps its predecessor. Bigger special effects and louder sound abound, SPIDER-MAN 2 also holds the same sharp focus on characters and a new and different story that isn't just a blueprint for tons of new special effects director Sam Raimi has in store. The character of Peter Parker (still wonderfully played by Tobey Maguire) is more developed, showing how he balances his careers as both the web-slinging superhero and young college student Parker, who also is in desperate need for a job. Kristen Dunst returns as MJ Watson who now blends in deeper in the role. the action-packed moments come in fast, when the film reveals its new and even better villain, the semi-evil Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), originally Dr. Octavius, attached with self-operating mechanical arms on his body.Like the very best of summer entertainments, the special effects moments are thrilling and exciting (if you don't find the scene where Spidey tries to stop a runaway train exciting, you're probably low on sugar). But one thing about SPIDER-MAN 2 is the fact that when the moments of character development and human elements come, it doesn't disappoint. The characters are interesting and fine to sit trough, and unlike most characters in summer movies, they don't look like special effects themselves. I'm not really a fan of Sam Raimi's works, but he'll definitely get his audience when making these would-be series, and SPIDER-MAN 2 should serve as a guide on how to make the future sequels.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Turning Point in the Superhero Genre,"""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) swings effortlessly to the forefront of the superhero genre, solidifying its status as not only the best Spider-Man film but as a pivotal moment in the evolution of superhero storytelling. Directed by Sam Raimi, this sequel transcends the confines of its genre, delivering a narrative that is both emotionally resonant and action-packed.Tobey Maguire's return as Peter Parker/Spider-Man is nothing short of iconic. Maguire's performance not only encapsulates the physicality and agility of the superhero but delves deep into the internal struggles of a young man burdened by the weight of responsibility. In ""Spider-Man 2,"" Maguire elevates the character to new heights, making this installment a benchmark for Spider-Man portrayals.Alfred Molina's portrayal of Doctor Octopus adds immeasurable depth to the film. Molina's nuanced performance brings humanity to the antagonist, making him a compelling and sympathetic figure. The on-screen chemistry between Maguire and Molina is a masterclass in superhero storytelling, creating a dynamic that propels the film beyond mere spectacle.The significance of ""Spider-Man 2"" in the superhero genre cannot be overstated. Its impact on subsequent films is evident in the way it seamlessly blends thrilling action with genuine human drama. The exploration of Peter Parker's personal struggles and the consequences of his choices set a standard for character-driven superhero narratives that resonates to this day.Visually, the film remains a spectacle. The web-swinging sequences and action set pieces showcase the character's agility and power, with visual effects that stand the test of time. Danny Elfman's musical score enhances the emotional beats, contributing to the film's overall cinematic excellence.For those seeking the quintessential Spider-Man experience and a pivotal moment in superhero history, ""Spider-Man 2"" remains an unparalleled and enduring masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic! Even better than the first.,"Luckily for me, I first saw this movie at the cinemas where basically everything you see there is a better experience than at home on the sofa. The picture is clearer, sound perfect, and lighting is great. It was particularly so in this picture because of the great action sequences made with the special effects. The scenes that mostly gave me tingles were the ones where Spidey and Doc Oc fought one on one, especially the train ride scene.Moving on to the story, I thought the plot was excellent, sticking to the very well known comic book created by Stan Lee. The acting was well done by lead Richard Maguire, who to me was the perfect choice for Spidey. Kirsten Dunst is fine as Mary Jane Watson, Alfred Molina as well with his performance as Doc Oc. Franco's performance is quite good too as the tortured Harry, as J.K. Simmons is always funny as J. Jonah Jameson.All in all, the story is great, acting excellent and special effects wonderful.

Sam Raimi just keeps getting better,"This is how sequels should be. Sam Raimi has remembered the most important thing that made the first film great, the story. The action almost blends into the background as you get caught up in the turmoil that Peter Parker is experiencing. You find yourself (or at least I did) routing for him as a person and cheering as he defeats his own inner enemies. His (non)romance with Mary-Jane in this film is heartbreaking but ultimately leads to an amazing climax that had me jumping up and down in my seat.The special effects were a treat as well. They have ironed out the cartoon look to Spider-man himself with his web spinning acrobatics looking less comical this time around. Doctor Octopus looked fantastic (if the reason behind his arms was pretty lame).This is the best superhero film yet but I feel that Sam Raimi still has more to give.

better than the original,"I watched this movie at a midnight showing, and after a long and hard day's work that started at 6 a.m., I can honestly say that I was awake and alert throughout the entire movie. Spiderman 2 easily surpassed everything that was done in the original (hopefully the box-office record too). The graphics were improved, there was much more comedy, and it even was quite touching at certain points. The villain, Dr. Octopus, played amazingly by vet Alfred Molina, is even better than Willem Defoe's Green Goblin (and doesn't look half as ridiculus).

Raimi Weaves a Great Web!,"This sequel to the first Spiderman, a film I thought was imaginative and wonderful, is at the very least that film's equal and in all probability a better film. The story picks up with Peter Parker resuming his career as the webbed crusader while going to school and trying to make ends meet as a pizza delivery guy. He also pines for Mary Jane, must hear the relentless diatribes of his friend Harry on what he will do if he catches Spiderman, and stand idly by as his Aunt loses her home. Well, Peter must realize who he is and what he wants in life - of course, while he does this a well-meaning scientist turns into a four mechanical armed menace and threat to the city of New York. Dr. Octopus becomes Spidey's number one nemesis and director Sam Raimi once again dazzles with his flair as a director in creating suspenseful action scenes, poignant, touching scenes, and some scenes with real humour. This again is not Citizen Kane but is a fine film with a great story, solid characterizations, exciting action-packed tension, some great CGI effects, and some good ole' fashioned fun. All of the performers return for a second bow and do equally well again. I particularly thought Rosemary Harris's performance and McGuire's were the most well-rounded. Alfred Molina is Doc Oc, and he is excellent. I wish he had had more time as the sane doctor, because he was very credible. As a villain, he was able to throw off one-liners very nicely as well.

am I the only one...uhh...?  lame?,"If you look at what happens in this movie, you can basically see that the 2 in the title is pointless, this is just spiderman one, all over again. Spiderman 2 is boring. It has a few good laughs, mostly unintentional. It has a few scenes that are just pointless. It has a few good action sequences with a few references to Raimi's Evil Dead awesomeness. Now that being said, I must pay my respect to Sam Raimi-a talented and amazing action sequence director, for sure. The rest of the movie however, was boring and predictable. It was predictable because the exact same things happened in the first film. Switch out how the bad guys move around, swap out high school angst with your basic quarter life crisis, throw in a bunch of Mary-Jane (excuse me, totally rad M.J.) in trouble scenes, Aunt Mae in trouble scenes, another boring and so far from reality science lecture by some slightly flawed pre-bad guy bad guy, throw in another spidey saves a mass transit train, and then fill the rest with the exact same relationship dialogue from the first film. To prevent our country from going nuts and killing each other in the theater-give em the Ross and Rachel friends ending...whew, that made it all worth listening to ALL OVER AGAIN. I am completely surprised by the audience and critical response to this movie, it really doesn't deserve the way the country is spitting its web juice all over it. I was hoping this would be an awesome coming of age story, a story about self confidence, how finding that is the cornerstone of becoming a man. It wasn't that. If you think it was, go back and see at what point Peter remembers what his capabilities are...not when he decides that he's back, after a long slow motion sequence of him running across a roof top...no not then, when it wouldve couldve shouldve been about self confidence.

Sequel entertains fans of the series and characters..,"When the original Spiderman hit the big screen in 2002, it helped to reinvigorate the comic book movie franchise.

The film builds on the story from the first movie, where Peter Parker first learns of his unique, spider-like abilities.If you're watching a sequel, chances are you've seen the first movie. Therefore, this go-around is geared towards developing the characters and their relationships. Peter, a.k.a.

His love interest, Mary Jane Watson, has grown tired of waiting for him and is engaged to a wealthy space cadet. Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn, is still dealing with the death of his father, for which he blames Spiderman. Throw a new villain into the mix, Dr. Otto Octavius, and there you have it.Director Sam Raimi uses the same style he did in the first movie, but makes significant advances in special effects. The moving tentacles of ""Doc Ock,"" in particular, helped earn Spiderman 2 an Academy Award nomination for best visual effects.As expected, Tobey Maguire delivers as Peter Parker. His shy, gawky demeanor is perfect for the role and fans of the series can only hope he stays on for the duration of the franchise. He was rumored to have been replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal for this film due to a back injury, but stuck with the project. His status for Spiderman 3 is up in the air.Alongside Maguire, Kirsten Dunst's performance as M.J. is so comic book-like that you can almost envision a box over her head containing her lines. While not the best actress in some situations, she is definitely the perfect choice for this role, a part that requires a certain amount of overplaying at times.Then, there are the character actors, most notably J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson and Alfred Molina as ""Doc Ock."" Both do a fine job and add something special to their scenes. Molina has a presence about him that oozes complexity. You can feel the internal conflict between ""Doc Ock"" and Otto Octavius, especially towards the end of the film when Octavius tries to pry himself away from the prosthetic tentacles that bind him.Several potential villains are introduced subtly throughout the film as well, although I won't spoil the surprises for fans of the original comic book. Hopefully, those fans will get to see these new villains in many future installments of the franchise. As long as the core of Raimi, Maguire and Dunst stays in tact, moviegoers can always expect a treat from their friendly neighborhood Spiderman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, the cops in New York must suck.","Once Spidey takes a hiatus, the crime in NY shoots up 75%? What good are the cops if they need Spidey to do 75% of the work? What was the crime rate before Peter Parker got bitten by that mutant spider?And what is the deal with Peter Parker's ""promise"" to Norman Osborn (a promise he never actually made) not to tell Harry that he was the Goblin? This ""promise"" compromises Peter's ability to clear Harry's misconception that Spider-Man killed his father. But why can't Peter simply tell Harry that the Goblin killed his father? It wouldn't be anything but the truth, would it?Lastly, why the heck don't Doc Ock's tentacles feel the pull of that energy nexus thingie?But, seriously, I don't want to pick this movie apart too much. In fact, part of the appeal of the movie is the fact that these sort of outrageous situations are depicted almost believably on the screen. Of course Spider-Man needs to be important to the crime-fighting effort. Otherwise there'd be no real reason for him to exist. And Harry Osborn needs a reason to hate Spider-Man; otherwise he'd never end up as the next Green Goblin (oops! Hope I didn't spoil anything.) And Doc Ock would look pretty silly if he didn't ""magnet-proof"" his tentacles (this may have been explained during the movie; could be my attention lapsed at the moment)The movie is basically a comic book, faithfully and believably adapted to screen and that, apart from the human interest story, is its main strength.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not That nice...,"OK, lemme see.. about this movie, the effects are really nice, you hardly tell real from CG, they really improved this one from the first one... but the plot... COME ON!!! get real man, it really sucks... just another stupid Hollywood story the took a nice comic book plot and somehow transformed to this lame ass story... too bad!! oh and the effects for this metal arms of doc ock, that stuff look like taken out of a terminator movie... try to do something original guys!!!! tobey maguire is getting better in his acting a lot better but this girl that plays mary jane, dude she really need some acting lessons =P i hope this gets better for the third movie...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a lot of silliness with some decent action,"I had a hard time with this movie. I will concede that the action was pretty good, but overall I found the plot weak and not terribly compelling. Most movies don't bother me, but I had a hard time suspending my disbelief on this one which prevented me from really getting into it. So Dr. Oc has come up with an ingenious fusion device. Ok, no sweat. What I found hard to buy was that for the sheer convenience of his work he just sat down and came up with a set of 4 nearly indestructible metal arms that he wired into his spine, which, by the way, were equipped with super intelligence capable of taking over his brain. This makes absolutely no sense. First of all, the development of such a thing would be equal to that of any fusion device. Secondly, there is absolutely no reason such a device would have to be equipped with super AI. And finally, when he is using it at first it really does not look like he really needs to have these extra intelligent arms. It would have been nice had they done a little more work to introduce the evil arms in a more plausible manner.The other thing that got me was that Dr. Oc was perfectly willing to do Harry's bidding and bring him spiderman to get some tritium. Ok, come on. You are an evil villian with 4 powerful indestructable arms capable of crushing someone's skull and you are on a crazy rampage to rebuild your fusion reactor with no desire to stop and consider anything else. Would you: A) agree to hunt down spiderman and bring him back to get your tritium or B) start pulling off his fingers one by one until he hands it over. Hmmmmm. This part of the plot (which was quite a major part) made no sense to me at all. The Dr. doesn't care about spiderman, he cares about his fusion, why would he waste time chasing spiderman around?Finally, the science here was a bit sketchy. Tritium, of which it was critical to have for use in the fusion reactor (this part is true), is supposedly very rare and only 25 lbs of it exist on earth. Ok... Tritium is not rare and occurs natrually or can be produced in a nuclear reactor. Do you have a glow in the dark watch? Hey, that probably has tritium in it. See any exit signs that glow? Those have tritium in them too. I know, it's just a movie, but still... They could have at least made up something he needed to make it a bit more believable.Finally, the acting in this movie was a bit sub par. James Franco as Harry is not the least bit believable, come on who buys him as a powerful intelligent leader of a major research company? The Dr. himself seemed a bit over the top. Toby did ok, however some of the dialogue he was fed was dripping with cheese and there is only so much you can do with that.Overall, it was ok if you can easily suspend your belief. Personally I would have rather waited until it came out on video and saved some money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love Story meets Matrix,"I am 42 years old and just loved this movie. I think about it in terms of ""Love Story meets Matrix"". The movie is 70% plot, and 30% action, which is a perfect balance. After watching the DVD, I had to review the action scenes at least 5 times each. The camera work in this film is absolutely fabulous. There are plenty of 180 degree stop-action pans worthy of any jujitsu master. In the classic Spiderman comics, Spidey could overcome any super hero but his conquest of teenage women were actually his greatest challenge, and Toby McGuire drives home this point with an understated elegance and all the awkwardness of a 16-year old's demeanor.If you are a 12 year old boy looking for spider man to bust some heads, for 135 nonstop minutes, this is probably not your movie. If you are 13 and above, and if you've seen Spiderman I (and even if you haven't), you should enjoy this movie immensely.If i had to criticize something about this movie, i'd say that the villain (Doc Oct) is written (in this film) in kind of a goofy way. I think the best improvement to this movie would have been, to change the villain's character to be more believable. Alfred Molina does a great job with the material his was given, as Doc Oct, but his behavior and glib demeanor seem incongruous with an evil villain of a spiderman movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost flawless,"This movie is quite a rarity when it comes to the success of comic book superheroes making their appearance on the big screen. Pre-90/95 efforts may have been quite good but the current 21st century efforts at making flashy versions of the classics have almost always been failures even though they had a few good things going for them. Not so in Spiderman's case. While the first movie itself was quite good, this sequel is almost flawless in terms of story, acting, action and special effects. The direction and screenplay are also very good and the cinematography is just unbelievable. There's little more to be said. Just go watch this movie if you have'nt done so already. You'll be impressed without doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a great film,"Spider-Man left us all with a great heartwarming sense of victory, and after 2 years, everyone was ready for a sequel. The photography, which I felt had what I call a ""70's"" feel to it, had been erased and everything seemed more up-to-date. Anyway, the film is like a magnet. The story pulls you in and you are drenched in the sorrow of Peter Parker's sad life. Then things change; a new villain rises up.Doc Ock interrupts Peter's difficult life, and Spidey swings back into action, fighting this ferocious fiend alongside a building. There is a long distance between the next fight and everything in that distance is great. Harry and Peter's friendship begins to take an ugly turn, and MJ finally turns the other cheek when she realizes she can't trust Peter. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up his life as Spider-Man.A new, more confident Peter Parker emerges; things seem to become a little brighter, although Harry is falling apart. Doc Ock then requires a chemical and he agrees to bring Spidey to Harry.Things again go sour for Peter, and he feels he has come to a dead end. Then he goes to help Aunt May and everything changes. Peter decides to return as Spidey. The movie from this point on, has no flaws whatsoever.Peter goes to meet MJ at a diner, when Doc Ock suddenly comes back (in a very dramatic and cool way) to find Spider-Man. He takes MJ away, and Spider-Man goes and tracks him down. The begin a fight atop a clocktower, and the fight takes them to a train below. This fight is the second best in the series, only the Queensboro Bridge in its predecessor winning. Eventually, Spider-Man loses, and is taken to Harry. I won't spoil what happens next, but Spider-Man fights Doc Ock and he changes again and becomes a normal person, saving MJ and Peter.The film ends on a cliffhanger (sort of). Where the first film failed (such as random, forgettable scenes) this film surpasses, each minute getting better and better. And now Spider-Man 3 is on the way, and Spdier-Man 2 is the right film to follow-up. Watch the film and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is such an all-around great film that it can't fit in just one genre,"This has got to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. You wouldn't normally expect much from an action movie and a sequel, but this film is incredible. Not only does it deliver intense action sequences and amazing special effects, but it has depth in both its plot and characters.I've never seen such an all-around great movie. It's exciting and intense, but gives the audience a chance to actually care about the outcome, and doesn't constantly bombard them with cheap thrills.It has romance as the comics require between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but it doesn't let things get bogged down with mush. Instead it goes for a realistic depiction of romance, and remembers that it is only a sub-plot.It has humor, and some of the jokes are done better than most comedy films. But it has perfect timing for each, not ruining the drama but complementing it by making it more human.And almost above all it's got drama. Sam Raimi completely outdoes himself and captures the appeal of Spiderman perfectly. Spiderman is revealed as a human being, mortal, vulnerable, and having his own wants and needs that conflict with crime-fighting. Woven into this is a concept of what it really means to be a hero in real life, and the personal sacrifice involved.This is a one-of-a-kind film that has redefined the genre, and has captured something unique and amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing...,"Raimi's follow up to his 2002 blockbuster Spiderman, is nothing short of 'amazing'.

If you haven't seen the original, do yourself a favor and get acquainted with this series, it's worth it.Spiderman 2 does what very few sequels do, and that is build on the original and top it, with more story, more drama, more action, more suspense, more character, more emotion, and just more. We don't feel like we're a million miles away from the universe created in part one, yet it all feels new and fresh. I'm glad they did not do anything drastic to Spiderman's suit.

"Superb, Beautiful Blockbuster, The Best Of The Year","""Spider-Man 2"" improves upon nearly every inconsistency, flippancy, and futility which might have compromised its predecessor, in ascending to a sensational entertainment far, far better than any other film this year. This is smart, conventional, touching, and edge-of-your seat entertainment, where we find ourselves constantly gripped by the story, the relationships, and most especially, the action sequences. The characters are believable: Peter Parker's struggle to balance his supreme duties as a superhero with his personal duties as a student and worker and his desired relationship with Mary Jane Watson can be entirely understood by anyone who consistently feels overburdened and unwieldy. This ""side-story to the action"" provides us with a compelling reason to root for Parker in his quests to ""save the day"" and recover from his own problems. I became so engaged with nearly every character, including the ""villain"", Otto Octavius, because the story provided me a reason for involvement, in nearly everything these characters experience. I was compelled by every action sequence, from Spider-Man's signature web-slinging adventures, to the ""experiment-gone horribly wrong"", to the breathtaking, adrenaline-rushing showdown between Spidey and Doc Ock. This is probably the best single ""blockbuster"" I have ever experienced, practically free of any significant flaws. Funny, touching, compelling, and exhilarating...

Everybody who disagrees with this gushing review is wrong,"Spiderman 2 is the definition of a superhero movie, and Sam Raimi shows he hasn't lost a bit of his directorial vitality since Evil Dead. He throws the camera in every direction during this film, its like the Citizen Kane of summer blockbuster Marvel movie sequels. I mean this is daring stuff, its like throwing stale old Hollywood into a blender and throwing in a touch of 70s cinematic flair.Maguire hits the spot for the second time round, adding a significant amount of emotional backbone. The setting is used well, the New York solidarity touchingly corny. Doc Ock is f*ckin A, and beats the Green Goblin with that old ""My uncontrollable robotic arms are my own worst enemy"" schtick. Finally, need I remind the hot blooded males and sexy ass lesbian readers of this site how fine Mary Jane is. I could make a pun about web fluid but I'm just going to say it out loud to myself and laugh instead.I've spent way too much time writing this review, because I could have just reminded my fellow IMDb readers that the movie has a chainsaw in it, instantly demolishing any other negative reviews.

The guy brings charm and polish to a villain who - well, let's face it, Doctor Octopus isn't upper-echelon, and it's not just first-rate effects that make Ock as exciting as he is here.He's also integral to a movie that, like all the great sequels, tops what came before. More J.K. Simmons, bigger web-swinging thrills, A- game fight scenes, and they're all in the service of a story that focuses on the human underneath the mask. Peter Parker's burden is ever more cumbersome here, trapping him in a life that allows for no personal growth; the awesome responsibility that always comes first.

A superb improvement on the first film,"This movie excels both as a comic book movie, and a sequel. It's definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time (although I don't think anything will be able to beat X2 and the first two Batman movies). Not only is it an excellent sequel (which isn't that common to begin with), it's also one of those rare sequels that is actually better than the first film (other examples are Aliens, Terminator 2 and X2).Almost everything in this film is better than in the original Spider-Man. I'll start with the most significant example: the characters. The character development in this movie is absolutely fantastic, easily comparable to the X-Men movies. It's never been easier to identify with Peter Parker. I've always wondered how super-heroes managed to balance their real lives and their super-hero lives like it seems that they do. Spider-Man 2 shows us that it's not as simple as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Clark Kent/Superman make it seem. In fact, Peter Parker struggles so hard to maintain both his real life and his crime fighting life, eventually he gives in and realizes that he has to choose one path or the other (he realizes this with the help of a wonderful speech from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris)). Mary Jane's character is also much deeper than it was in the first film. While it may seem that she's given up on Peter and found love somewhere else, the truth is far from that. Not only is she not sure if she still loves Peter or not, it's also apparent that she still hasn't forgotten that one kiss she shared with Spider-Man in the first film. Alfred Molina's character, Doctor Octavius (or Doc Ock), is one of the most believable villains in any movie. His character is completely three-dimensional, something relatively rare for an on-screen villain. We can see exactly where he's coming from, why he does the things he does. He's not the usual two-dimensional villain, who is just there to oppose the hero. The only other villain as three-dimensional as Doctor Octopus, off the top of my head, is Bill in Kill Bill (although there are no doubt many others like this).The action and CGI has improved tremendously since the first film. While the CGI in the original Spider-Man was always a bit iffy in my eyes, they've clearly done a much better job. The combination of real footage and CGI is almost unnoticeable, and it's virtually impossible to tell the difference between the CGI Spider-Man and the real Spider-Man costume (except that the CGI Spider-Man does things that Tobey Maguire would never be able to do). Doc Ock's tentacles definitely stand out as an amazing CGI achievement in this film. They look excellent. The action is stunning. While, for an action film, the action is relatively scarce, when it kicks in, it does it magnificently. Spider-Man's fight with Doctor Octopus on the train is one of the most exciting and amazingly executed action scenes I've seen (not comparable to the action in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or in The Matrix Reloaded, but it's close).Sam Raimi, director, does an absolutely brilliant job. His intentionally corny approach is what really stands out in this film  it never really takes itself too seriously. He also uses some low budget b-movie trademarks, such as quick zooms and corny one-liners. While some people don't like this approach, I thought it was brilliant. Raimi returns to his roots (in a way) with his directing style. His style of shooting is very reminiscent to his earlier films in the Evil Dead series. One of the most significant examples of this is the scene with Dr. Octopus in the hospital room, which was absolutely brilliant. The camera angles, and some of the elements (such as the nurse scraping the floor with her fingernails), are pure Evil Dead.There were all sorts of little bits and details, really tiny ones, that made the particular scene they were in worthwhile. For instance, the lady playing the violin in the street is singing the theme song to the original Spider-Man cartoon from the '60s. Another great reference was in the hospital room scene. While the entire sequence is reminiscent of The Evil Dead, the shot of the hand on the floor still holding the chainsaw is an obvious reference to an identical shot in The Evil Dead II. Brilliant.To sum it all up, this movie is a superb improvement on the first film (which was excellent, don't get me wrong). Sam Raimi clearly focused more on the story and the characters this time, which was wonderful. Unfortunately, some things could have still been worked on. For instance, the general structure of the film is very reminiscent of the sequels to other comic book movies, namely Superman II and Batman Returns (the whole 'abandoning the hero role' thing). And still, while it's also an extremely entertaining flick, Spider-Man 2 has much more behind it than just crowd-pleasing. It's definitely one of the best movies of the year so far, but we have yet to see what the second half of 2004 has in store for us.

A superior superhero flick,"Being a superhero was never easy. I suppose Sam Raimi liked melancholy movies, ever since he made A Simple Plan. Melancholy, or sadness, was the main point of the movie. ""It's the superhero movie for people who don't go to superhero movies,"" Roger Ebert says.There is a bit of a melancholy element behind the sequel to the Spider-man. Peter Parker faces numerous personal problems, which bring down his self-esteem and bring in a whole lot of dialogue. (Which I didn't think was corny!) First of all, there is Harry. If you can re-call the first movie, Harry is still upset about the death of daddy. He knows Spider-man is connected to it, but doesn't know that Peter is Spider-man. Now, he wishes to take revenge on Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-man. So much for being a best friend! Next in line, is Mary Jane. Apparently being a superhero isn't all it's cracked up to be. There seems to be so much trouble, Peter can never arrive in time for his appointments. Sadly, one of them is Mary's play, which Peter has promised to see, but can never make it! And to think that Peter and Mary Jane almost had a relationship. Too bad she's getting married to somebody else.Every superhero needs a villain, and Doctor Octopus is the one for Peter. After his experiment goes wrong, he accidentally fuses four metal tentacles onto his back. Now, crazed to finish his failed experiment, he puts the city in danger. Poor Peter. Only superheroes can stop the super villains. Now he must defeat Doc Ock. Add that to the ""to do"" list.What more can we pile on?!?! Sadly, Peter there's much more. His grandma doesn't trust him, his grades are dropping, he can't even pay the rent and his stress even results in drastic consequences. Wow, after saving the lives of all those innocent people, so much bad happens to him! I wonder if karma does actually exist. Well, at least not in movies.Spider-man 2 is a definite improvement on the first. Sam combines drama with action sequences to help the those with short attention spans.I hope Raimi has a lot more in store for us, because this is solid proof that sequels can live up to, or even surpass the originals.

the best comic movie ever...arguably,"I have been a reader of Spider-Man since I was a child. While the first movie exceeded my expectations, the second reached a new level. I believe Spider-Man is (thus far) the greatest comic book movie series created and that Spider-Man 2 is the best individual comic movie. The only competition i would concede it is batman. while that movie was very stylized and re-envisioned Batman and comic book movies, if you watch it today, I believe you will see that it has not aged too well. In particular, the Joker's boom box toting hench-men are a little dated. Spider-Man walks the line of putting its fantastic characters into the real world without making them campy or unrealistic. Of course there is the sci-fi fantasy element, but who couldn't imagine a character just like Peter in their college class? In my opinion, his cinematic development has in two movies dwarfed the development of Bruce Wayne or the Clark Kent (who I felt were kind of one dimensional on screen). Also, Spider-Man has managed to convey some dark scenes and strained relationships (as in the books) without slipping into a completely dark and depressing atmosphere.I think Spider-Man 2 works so well because of the attention to character development. While some long time readers will complain that ""this"" or ""that"" didn't happen in the comic books as it did in the movie, its clearly an unfair analysis. How could you expect 40 years worth of story to be converted into a trilogy of movies, as Spider-Man was originally slated to be (im aware that since there has been rumor of as many as six spider-man movies on deck)? Besides that, as much as i love the comics, especially the older origin stories, and Spidey's classic battles with the likes of the Green Goblin, Kraven, Sandman, and the Vulture, just to name a few, I have to admit that many of those origins would be difficult to translate in to a fantastic reality on screen, and i do believe Raimi has tried (and succeeded) to make these characters as realistic as possible.When this movie was coming out, I wasn't too excited to see Doc Ock. He's never really been one of my favorite villains (that was Green Goblin). However, even though this movie didn't feature one of my favorite enemies, I still love it for the human element and the character relationships. Even though the characters and stories may differ some from the original comics, the SPIRIT of the characters is dead on. Raimi has, in my opinion, beautifully captured the heart of the characters and their interaction with one another. I couldn't imagine anyone putting Peter Parker on screen any better than he has, and I think Tobey Maguire has been phenomenal in his subdued portrayal of the luckless hero.As a Spider-Man fan, I couldn't have asked for a better director than Mr. Raimi, who himself is a lifelong spider-fan. He has translated a character that I grew up on onto the big screen, and i wouldn't have any of what hes done changed if i could. Spider-Man 2 transcended the big summer blockbuster with great dialogue, character development, and romance. He combined a great, smart story with jaw dropping action. I couldn't have asked for anything more of this movie, and if one and two are any indication, all spider-man fans should be anxiously awaiting Spider-Man 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The acting is superb, the story is great with a great meaning, and the CGI has improved greatly from the last movie, and the love story is even more heart-wrenching than the previous installment. If anything, some will probably find the extended version more fulfilling than the theatrical version.A must-see! 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best comic book film.....,"While Spider-man did a decent of job introducing us to all the main characters and story-lines, Spider-man 2 takes all the ingredients from the first movie and gives us a true masterpiece to enjoy. It has everything from action to romance to drama and not to mention fantastic acting by ALL actors.It is rare that sequels are better than the original movie, but Spider-man 2 is an exception. It out-does Spider-man in every which way.This is a gem of a movie and if even is looking to add to their DVD libraries or wants a movie that will never fade on you, this is it! Congrats to Sam Raimi and his crew! and Tobey Maguire.......who is to spider-man as Christopher Reeve is to superman",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
These votes have been rigged,"This movie should not be in IMDb's top 250 movies list! I watched it once in the theaters, and it seemed as though it had been written by a child. The only way this movie could rank this high is if someone rigged the vote.What I mean is, someone who would stand to profit if the movie did well has obviously gone through the trouble to vote thousands of times. Consequently the rating of the movie is skewed to appear a 7.9. At best this movie should get a 6.0If and when you vote for this movie, lower the score you would have given it by 2.

"Disappointing, too many groaners not engaging enough","This review is targeted at thirty somethings like myself who consider our time valuable. I generally enjoy comics (reading, not collecting) and especially like Spiderman. DISCLAIMER: THIS POST DOES LOOSELY DISCUSS THE END.The movie is quite disappointing from the get go. It starts off very slowly which I don't usually mind but it never gets off the ground. His love interest is completely a pre-teen fantasy of an adoring lover who looks past all his shortcomings. I realize that this movie panders to that crowd but the adoring little girlfriend is painfully cliché. The bad guy, Doc Oc is actually not all that bad but I found that to be the only refreshing part of the movie. The plot meandered through his personal life, which is completely uninteresting in the movie but acceptable in the comic. The pop psychology littered throughout was the most painful like when his old aunt goes on about Spidey being a good role model and the world needing heroes. The ending is excruciating with the heroic rescue and romance. As B-movie as you can ever get with such a high budget flick. Not sure how so many people loved it.All in all, save yourself the time, money and aggravation, Cheers, Enn.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bewildering,"I went into this film looking forward to it, it had broken records in the US and so I expected a fun, good humored action film. Sadly I was wrong, the action scenes were limited and the the main plot centers around Spider-Man's feelings. It was far too predictable, the humour was poor, and far too long was spent on whether he wanted to be Spider-Man (but I thought this was dealt with in the first film) and then right at the end the deal with the bad guy. If you want to see an action film don't see this, if you want to see a film in which nothing happens see this. Having seen this and The Hulk I just hope that other comic book films have more action and more entertainment. The pain of ""Raindrops are Falling on my Head"" will never go away.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For hardcore Spiderman fans only,"I saw this tonight and thought it was quite poor. Very slow at times and I didn't find the acting between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst convincing. The pace really hurt the storyline, and didn't learn from the mistakes of the first film. Some of the jokes e.g. mops falling out of the cupboard had people laughing out loud at the cinema. They brought a wry smile to my face but weren't that funny. The CGI was not so spectacular in some places. Doc Ock looked completely different in CGI form, and near the end where Spiderman turned away from the camera to jump away the transition to the CGI Spiderman was noticeable. The film's saving grace was really in Dr. Octavius and Parker's Grandmother. Overall I would give it 6/10.Clearly this is a film were I am against the majority, like I was with 'Signs'.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Quite frankly Spider-man, your amazing.","This so far has been the best movie I have seen all year...it was all I expected and more. Better than the 2002 hit, this Spider-Man is well worth seeing. A plot I was not expecting when I saw the previews helped too, as it continually surprised me with where it went and where it was going. The special effects are top notch, as was the acting, and generally everything about the movie was just great. Not the typical summer action movie, this movie had heart and just has to be one of the best comic book movies made if not the best. The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man really having a tough go of it as of late. He is late for classes; he cannot hold on to a job, he is neglecting his friends all while trying to lead a double life. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist is developing a process to make energy. Of course, this is Doctor Otto Octavious. During the two hours you are in for a ride both action wise and emotional. Spidey loses his powers because of all the problems he is having in his life personally and the good Doctor has an accident that causes him to fuse with metal arms he created to handle the unsafe fusion process. The highlights of this one include a very good bank heist by Doc Ock (dubbed that by JJ Jameson) and the best action sequence in any comic book adaptation a fight that starts on a clock tower and ends on a speeding train. Doctor Octopus is a definite improvement over the Green Goblin as he has much cooler fights with Spidey, plus he looks and fights more like the villain in the comic than the Goblin did. The focus in this one, however, is mostly on Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he tries to deal with the enormous powers he is given and trying to find a way to deal with his love for Mary Jane Watson a girl he seemingly can not have. That is what also made this movie work for me...I just can totally relate to his situation. Not that I have super powers, but any woman I fall for I never act upon because I think they will be better off not knowing me. I also have the bad luck and I am a bit of a klutz. Heck, if I did have powers I would have abandoned this life long ago. All in all a great movie that I look forward to buying on DVD. The best superhero ever...go get em' Spidey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst...,"I just had, what could quite possibly have been the worst movie going experience of my life. In part due to the high expectation's for midnight movies and the huge let down of this experience! People where making so much noise. So many people got up, over 9, which start's to get really annoying! The kids behind us started saying ""This movie is gay"" and ""This sucks"" about 25 minutes into the movie. You could tell most of the people were not enjoying the movie, and I get the feeling most of America will not enjoy it near as much as the first. That all said and done; I loved this movie, I thought it was great! I loved every minute of it. I didn't dislike any of it. I thought it was so much fun! Not only fun, but great as well. I liked the look and feel. I liked the opening credits and I loved the closing swing, almost directly cut from the first, but it was great then and it's great now. I do believe I may go see this movie again. Probably alone, but who cares, I want to have a good experience at this movie so I won't have a bad feeling after seeing a great movie. I hope I'm wrong about most of America not liking it, I hope it does twice as well as the first or else the third, if made, will be very piss poor.

"Surpassed Spiderman1 just as ""T2"" did the original Terminator","As others have been saying, this movie is possibly (probably) the best comic book movie ever, and one of the better movies ever period.

This is not only the best Spider-Man film but also one of the best superhero films of all time!,"After all of these years and many new Spider-Man films, I still don't think any has quite managed to get to this level of sheer awesomeness!!!!This film delivers on everything to be honest and it takes what worked on the first film, and makes it better!This film is a big part of my childhood to be honest.Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Spider-Man has always been my favourite!I've always been able to relate to his version of the character?Tobey Maguire is once again amazing in this film!!!!!!!You get to see a more vulnerable side to Spider-Man and Peter Parker!The stakes are much higher in this film too.Not just because of the villain and his plan but because Peter loses his powers?!He has an emotional breakdown and he gives up the role of being the hero!You get to see the world and what it would be like without him, and then how everybody wants him back!Even J Jonah Jameson...
It's an interesting 'What if' subplot to be honest!It's also relatable too!Everybody has emotional breakdowns and then has to find their way back to being themselves again?Spider-Man 2 has a lot of heart to be honest!!It's inspiring and the film does a really good job at putting you in the suit of Spider-Man!!!What would you do?!Kirsten Dunst is once again good as MJ but unfortunately she isn't given as much to do this time round.She still has really good chemistry with Maguire though!!James Franco is back as Harry and we get to see a more devious side to his character.Then we have Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus...
Perfect casting!!!!!!!!I honestly cannot imagine anyone else playing him!Molina does a terrific job at bringing some humanity to the character.He isn't just a villain?You understand his motives and you even feel sorry for him too!I love the ending when he gets a chance to redeem himself!The tentacles and character design are actually really impressive to be honest!!!!!It's amazing what the film's crew was able to do with this character at the time of its release!!I really enjoyed the hospital scene too!It actually felt like a horror film to be honest!!!I'm really looking forward to seeing Alfred Molina return as this character again in the upcoming Spider-Man No Way Home...
Rosemary Harris is once again perfect as Aunt May!She's as wise as Yoda!!This version of Aunt May has always been my favourite!She's actually always reminded me of my Grandma to be honest!JK Simmons is once again a scene stealer as Jameson too!Every time I think of Spider-Man, I come back to this film!!!!!!This film is full of so many moments and shots that have become really iconic over the years!!!The action is filmed fantastically too.It's big and it's breathtaking!Even after all of these years too!The train fight is still one of my favourite action sequences to appear in a superhero film!!!Overall this is a film that delivers on everything that you want to see from a Spider-Man film, and so much more too!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst sequels ever,"I honestly liked the first movie, no masterpiece but one of the best based on comic books ever. I liked it because Parker was presented like a ""real"" person that faced problems and transformation into a super hero was fun to watch and gave you a good feeling. The sequel is just another stupid Hollywood movie, with American flags everywhere (ok you are patriots), with a stupid plot where a stupid so called dramatic situation ends with an unjustified moronic happy ending. The sequel is all about special effects (really bad work, looked really fake), Octopus is awfully conceived, the newspaper editor-in-chief is ridiculously over-acting.

"Tears of joy, and a standing ovation!","As a kid growing up in the 1970's, I never missed Spider-Man in the comic books and the Sunday paper. By far, my all-time favorite villain and episode(s) involved Doctor Octopus.I was severely disappointed by the first Spider-Man, and had pretty much given up on Hollywood ever doing a proper comic book adaptation. Although the first one was watchable and not too bad, it fell far short of my expectations. At best, it was mediocre.This one not only met and exceeded them, but it utterly overwhelmed them. Finally, I have lived the dreams of my childhood brought to life on the big screen, and clearly CGI has at last achieved its potential. God, but I regret having missed this in the theater! If you ever liked comic books, Spider-Man or the Dr. Octopus episodes then RUN, don't walk, to your nearest video store and rent this. Then RUN, don't walk, and buy it so you can watch it over and over.This film has renewed my hope that Hollywood still has a vision, and still has capable (even excellent) screenwriters, directors, animators and producers.The best movie of 2004, and easily among the five or ten best movies I've ever seen.

The Best Superhero Movie Of All Time,"Remember my ""Spider-Man"" review? Where I said that I was an enormous fan of the character but that the film wasn't exactly a ""great"" superhero flick? While I said ""Spider-Man"" was a really good but not quite great superhero movie, ""Spider-Man 2"" I think is easily, without a doubt, the best superhero movie ever made. Yes, even after all the MCU movies and ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy, I STILL believe this is the best superhero movie of all time. Its style, its pacing, its action, its emotion, its intelligence, its effects, its characters, its fight scenes. I could watch this movie a million times and not get tired of it. It's everything the first ""Spider-Man"" film should have been and for my money the gold standard for the superhero movie genre.I love the idea of a superhero film examining just how hard it is to be a superhero; taking a look at the toll it takes on your life and just how much you have to sacrifice. ""Spider-Man 2"" demonstrates that perfectly. Peter Parker sacrifices any chance at true happiness he has and puts nearly everything at risk simply to protect the city and it's people. Even after he momentarily stops being Spider-Man, he still sacrifices one of the few things he still has, his trust with Aunt May, in one of the most emotional scenes ever in a comic book movie. In fact, all of these characters seem to go through some harsh hardships throughout the movie; Mary Jane is getting married despite conflicting feelings about Peter, Harry Osborne is dealing with insecurities about not living up to his father as well as having to weigh his relationship with his father with his friendship with Peter, even Otto Octavius spends the entire movie chasing an impossible dream, largely in compensation for his wife's death. All of these characters arcs are told wonderfully and I found all of them compelling and incredibly investing.Remember how I said the romance in ""Spider-Man"" completely failed and almost sunk the entire movie? Not at all the case here. We see much more of Peter and Mary Jane as friends, we see them really interact beyond just being lovers and really examine and reexamine the roles they have in each others lives, we see them truly support each other in very hard times and put each other before themselves. These were things we never saw in the original ""Spider-Man"", but we see them here. On top of that, Kristen Dunst actually does an excellent job here now that she's given an actual CHARACTER to play, and we're rooting for her to find happiness and stability in her life just as much as we are Peter.Speaking of Peter, Tobey Maguire completely dominates in this film. He truly manages to make Peter Parker a sympathetic and likable character here, and there are multiple scenes where he just oozes emotion. He has the awkward and dorky charm of the original, but he adds far more emotional weight and tragedy to his performance here than in the first movie.Speaking of improved performances, James Franco does phenomenal work here. Like Peter and Mary Jane, he struggles and he often makes the wrong decisions, but you can tell this is more out of confusion and indecisiveness than any ill intent. Like Maguire, he brings far more emotional weight to his role in this movie than it's predecessor, and it's a better film for it.Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus may be the best villain I have ever seen in a comic book movie, he's in the top 3 no doubt. I've always been a fan of Dr. Octopus as a character since reading the comics, but I gotta say, Raimi's Dr. Octopus may be better than anything I have read in any of the ""Spider-Man"" comics. Molina together with a phenomenal script by Alvin Sargent turns Otto Octavius into one of the most sympathetic villains I've ever seen. The loss of his wife, his reputation and essentially any hope of a normal life leave Doc Ock to grasp desperately to the only thing that still matters to him anymore; finishing his fusion reactor. He is as much driven by regret and hopelessness as he is by passion, and Molina is great at depicting the good Doctor's sorrow, fear and brokenness. Also, kudos to the effects team on Dr Octopus's arms. The mix of CGI and animatronics on them were detailed, realistic and scary as Hell.The style of the movie is perfect. Sam Raimi made a name for himself as a Horror movie director, and with a villain like Dr. Octopus, that style works surprisingly well. One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Octavius's mechanical arms killing multiple doctors trying to saw them off while he is unconscious, and it truly feels like something straight out of one of his ""Evil Dead"" movies. It's intentional homage and it works perfectly. With that being said, the lighthearted and funny moments work just as well, what with J.J Jameson putting on Spider-Man's abandoned costume and masquerading in it around his cubicle or even charming little moments like Spider-Man shouting puns at Dr. Octopus during a bank robbery. The blend of both the dark and light aspects of Spider-Man make the film truly feel like the ultimate Spider-Man cinematic experience.The train fight scene is easily the best fight I've seen in a superhero flick, and it's doubtful it will ever be beat. The choreography and just the unique style of the fight fit Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus perfectly and it's just oozing with excitement.I could go on about this movie forever. It's just so GREAT. It had great heart, it had great style, it had a great story, it had great characters, it had great action, it had great effects...It's the best damn superhero movie ever.

A dull grey boring affair...,"Despite all its accolades, perhaps some deserved, I have yet to see any for Spiderman 2's pure entertainment value. Before anything else, I was expecting a good action/adventure superhero film with cool action (fight scenes etc.), thrills, and suspense. Instead, this movie is incredibly slow-paced, has minimal fight scenes between Octavius and Spiderman, and in total, they only constitute maybe 5 percent of the film's duration. Moreover, the way Octavius perishes can only be described as pathetic. I grant that there are some funny moments and that character development is in-depth, but this movie feels more like a drama than a superhero flick. I seem to remember that the first Batman was masterful in its mix of both elements.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Spiderman debuts in Amazing Fantasy #15 on August 1st, 1962","This is one of those occasions when the sequel is even better than the first film. Director Sam Raimi out-does himself and crafts an excellent sequel. Returning champs like, Tobey Maguire, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons, along with another brilliant soundtrack by Danny Elfman, features a new bad guy in the guise of Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina). This film moves into the era a Spiderman, that was covered in the comics in the mid-to-late 1960s, leaving the inspiration of the Steve Ditko years in the first film and moving onto the inspiration found during the John Romita SR era of the comics.It moves Peter Parker (Maguire), into his college years and a set of new challenges, like making it to classes, keeping a job, dealing with Harry (James Franco) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), dating each other, Aunt May (Harris), being evicted and spider-power issues. Sam Raimi manages to capture the pure spirit, that makes Spiderman/Peter Parker a great character. It further proves the Spiderman mantra, that with great power comes great responsibility. Aunt May shows some toughness too in this one. It is also good to note, that you can probably enjoy this film, even if you have never seen the first one.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Does everything right the first did wrong.,"""Spider-Man 2"" is an huge improvement over ""Spider-Man"".In my comment for ""Spider-Man"" I complained about several things. One of my biggest complaints was that it was a movie that looked great from the outside but was shallow and empty on the inside. ""Spider-man 2"" looks great from the outside AND from the inside. The depths and emotions are handled better as in ""Spider-Man"" and the characters have become more interesting. Sam Raimi still tries to make the movie more than just a superhero movie but difference with his other movies ""Spider-Man"" and ""Darkman"" is that it works this time, even though the whole 'spider-man quiting' thing was a bit cliché and perhaps not needed.The main thing of this movie is to entertain. The characters have become far more entertaining and there is far more humor added, something I'm extremely happy about.Also the villain has improved big time Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is far better than Willem Dafoe's Green 'plastic mask' Goblin. The villain is cooler and more entertaining and Alfred Molina himself does a better acting job than Willem Dafoe did. Still I was glad to see Willem Dafoe in a small role in this movie, as long as he doesn't start wearing that 'Power ranger' outfit again.Another thing that has improved is the action. ""Spider-man"" was seriously lacking some good action scene's, luckily ""Spider-Man 2"" is filled with some spectacular action and some great fights between Spider-Man and Doc Ock along with some great looking special effects.The ending leaves the door open for a lot more Spider-Man sequels and after seeing ""Spider-Man 2"" I'd say; Bring them on!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very bland superhero vehicle,"The film is less of a Spider-Man movie than a Sam Raimi movie starring Spider-man and Dr Octopus... who curiously resemble Raimi IRL. The film is full of bad CGI, bad slapstick, wacky camera-work and flat teenage melodrama. It's ""deeper"" than the first in that it's full of tragic characters, but it cartoonish in its rendering. Its hard to care about anyone when the cast are all wooden, the directing is juvenile and the script is cliché. But, while overlong and completely idiotic, the film is a crowd pleaser: flashy, fast, loud and easy to understand. Sam Raimi is like the poor man's Spielberg or Zemeckis, which was in demand in the early 2000s. This film is a poor copy of Superman 2. Watch Superman 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Instead it focused on how heroes are within us all (as Aunt May said), how technology has consumed us and how its important to sustain love no matter how difficult the circumstances.Peter Parker (Maguire) is still fighting crime but he's also trying to fight his guilt over his Uncle Ben's death, his true feelings for Mary Jane (Dunst) and the truth about his identity to Harry (James Franco).I think its a movie people would really enjoy, I have it an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good,"As a rule, there are way too many adaptations of comics (especially the superhero kind, which I don't like) and sequels coming out of Hollywood. So if there's a sequel to a comic adaptation, that bodes ill.Not so in the case of Spiderman 2. And it's not about the action sequences, that look like they had a very big budget. If you like those, you won't be disappointed.No, Spiderman 2 invites you to think, without being pushy on the morals front. There are no meaningful speeches or metaphors that a toddler would understand. Instead, there is plenty of humour that doesn't get too tacky, and there are even tender moments, notably at the end of the subway scene. That one, I actually found touching.It's difficult to elaborate on the film without giving too much away. But if you have a chance to see it, it's well worth it.

Doc Oc is a very interesting villain...Just like The Green Goblin, he seems to be insane, talking to his four mechanical arms. ""A voice...in my head...""

Arguably the best superhero film to date,"Wow. Usually, sequels don't surpass the original. But this one did it with flying colors, and then some. ""Spider-Man 2"" was completely above my expectations, considering how good the first film was. I was blown away by the eye-popping visual effects (a solid improvement from film #1), the engaging characters (Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker), the heartbreaking and heart-lifting drama (all without being too clichéd or corny while remaining true to the spirit of the comics), the bad-ass villain (Alfred Molina surprising us as a VERY convincing Doc Ock), and the comedy needed in a Spider-Man movie (i.e., the Laundromat scene; the elevator scene with Hal Sparks; the terribly off-key woman singing the ""Spider-Man"" theme; the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"" montage).While the first movie introduced us to Peter Parker and how the troubled teenager became Spidey, this movie shows us how difficult his life is. Juggling his schoolwork, paying his late rent, delivering pizzas, taking pics for the Bugle, fighting crime, AND trying to tell MJ how he feels about her, just shows how taxing Spider-Man has been on his life. And yet, he keeps at it, thinking that it's his moral obligation and responsibility to protect those who can't protect themselves, all because he was indirectly responsible for his uncle's death. And now he's reached the crossroads where he must decide whether or not he should carry on with this burden or start life anew, without Spider-Man. Sam Raimi does a brilliant job directing this film, and it doesn't hurt having an Oscar-winning screenwriter and Pulitzer-winning author at your side writing the screenplay.Tobey Maguire once again dazzles us with his performance as the tortured Parker, Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane, and James Franco improves greatly from the first movie as the Spidey-hating Harry Osborn. But the real showstopper is Alfred Molina, fantastically portraying Doctor Octopus (considered by many comic fans as one of the best supervillains ever). Despite in the first film having Willem Dafoe's very good performance overshadowed by the clunky, Power Rangers-like costume, Molina has free rein as the sinister Doc Ock, accompanied by those four, bad-ass metal tentacles (an amazing marriage of CGI wizardry and live puppetry). There'll be some moments where you feel really sorry for him, and some moments where you want Spidey to bash his head in. ""Spider-Man 2"" will attract fans of all kinds of movie genres: action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, romance, drama, and comedy. If you're looking for a summer blockbuster, a movie that'll make you feel good, or a superhero movie at its best, see ""Spider-Man 2"".

Web Crawler Hits Absolute High,"Spiderman 2 ****1/2/*****Spiderman 2 is the perfect sequel. It combines the character from the first one with improved special f/x and a more natural script. Spiderman 2 is also an action/superhero movie that appeals to more than just the teenage boy. The bulk of the film is not pounding rock beats and images of extreme stunts done mostly by the f/x geeks on their computers. Instead, there is human weakness in this movie. There is pain (yes, the emotional kind) allowing for compassion to be felt for Peter Parker, making it easier for the audience to root for him. 	 The story picks up where it left off. For those who missed out on the first one (that's right, we judge you for it) will be brought up to speed by a cleaver set of comic book style animations shown with the opening credits. Even if you were one of the millions of people that saw the original, the pictures are a good reminder and help jog you memory of those key plot events. Knowledge of Spidey's first film is essential because this second story is not a new adventure all together, as most sequels tend to do, but instead it continues to dig into the effect earlier events have on Peter Parker.Peter (Tobey Maguire) appears to be a failure. Perhaps this is why we love him. We see that he is no different than us and that appeals to our perhaps subconscious desire to be superhuman in one way or another. He's a failing school, his career and his love life. Who can't relate to at least one of those? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), on the other hand, is doing fabulous. Her acting career has picked up and she's becoming that star we all also want to be. She's going to get married to an astronaut and it appears to be the it' life. But there's still Peter who she wants to be with but Peter just can't seem to make it happen. He keeps letting her down. In turn, Peter is heart broken about hurting MJ again and again and so he decides to start a new life.This is the story about Peter without Spiderman. Of course that doesn't last as a new villain appears on the scene. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) is a man but he just happens to have four extra mechanical arms. The arms have a life of their own, thus making them superior to Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin that we saw in the first film. One of the important aspects about this genre of movie is that if you're going to make sequel, you must replace the villain. We've already seen how the first one was beat; we crave fresh blood. That, in a nutshell, it the action genre moviegoers attitude.Well, Doc Ock deliver and actually has the audience gasping here and there. Just like Peter, Ock is human too. He's simply exercising another desire, to be rich and powerful. He is the epitome of `How far would you go?'In a summer full of sequels, Harry Potter and the box office cash cow Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 is nothing short of its predecessors. In fact, it's much better.  More than living up to the first one, Spidey is good time had. ****1/2 out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
left me giddy,"the movie held my attention the whole time. i was never itching to check my watch; in fact, i wouldn't even let myself get up and run to the bathroom. thus, at the end of the movie, i was shaky and felt like i was about to burst. i'm not sure if this was partially due to a full bladder but i think it was mostly because the movie was AMAZING. i'm going again this weekend. loved loved loved loved loved it!!!i often noted the brilliance of certain artistic elements. i just remember a few key scenes where i really noticed something about the originality of a shot or the artistic use of color or light. the action sequences were also very well-tempered with short jabs of humor which were actually in very good taste and quite amusing (nothing corny or disappointing).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A better ""movie"" than part 1, a worse ""spiderman film"" than part 1","Special effects were great, story was alright...acting...well, it sucked. I'm sorry, MJ was awful.I'm not going to break down the specifics, but if you have read Spiderman over the years you'll notice Hollywood showed it's evil head once again. While it's obviously a ""spiderman"" film, the fact he shoots webs and wears a read spiderman costume are a few of the things they got right...where as they got a LOT more wrong.People who don't follow spiderman do not need to read on and on about how different it is, as they really won't care.  People who follow spiderman won't need to read what the differences are, they are obvious.  I have yet to speak to a person who follows spiderman who beleived this film to be a triumph.Was it a good movie?  Yes.  Is it the best ""superhero"" film?  I think so. Unfortunatly for people who have followed Spiderman over the years, this was a let down.  It's like watching Rocky for the first time if you love boxing. It's just too far from the original idea.Hollywood...I'm tired of you.  I'm sick of it.  Please don't ruin OLDBOY with Bad Pitt, and DO NOT put Keanu Reeves in Casshern when you ruin it with your remake.What is wrong with the original Spiderman?  The comic has been selling for years and years, but apparently hollywood decided they needed to add more to the character...well, sorry...you flopped",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Hero in Us All...,"At one point in Director Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"", Peter Parker's Aunt May (wonderfully played by Rosemary Harris) says of heroes:""...I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.""This nature or distinction of hero is what really resonates and distinguishes ""Spider-Man 2"". A hero resonates across cultures. He or she is distinguished by courage, selflessness, nobility, honor, and most of all-- heart. Whether or not the hero in this case wears a red and blue spider suit to save others, what matters is the inherent greatness of the individual in action. Hero is to the soul. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man embodies the possibility of the hero in all of us. Maguire has such a humanity about him, and is so commanding in his stillness and calm. His understated performance choices punctuates Peter Parker's courage and compassion. Along with Sam Raimi's masterful direction, and Alvin Sargent's character and plot driven screenplay, ""Spider-Man 2"" is compelling work. I think that it is better than ""Spider-Man', and one of the best movies of the year. ""Spider-Man 2"" also has a more evolved love story between Peter (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) which really works. And of course the CGI effects are phenomenal.This time around the storytelling is not so linear. Peter (Maguire) is burning out as Spider-Man. He has forsaken his love for MJ (Dunst), aware that if he revealed his love for her, her life would be endangered by his enemies. Consequently, Peter is suffering. The new enemy is Doc Ock (a compelling Alfred Molina), who because of a tragic fusion experiment becomes fused to deadly mechanical tentacles. Though the villain, Doc Ock is not entirely evil. Originally Dr. Otto Octavius is a good man who falls victim in the pursuit of his dreams to transform the world. This is a wonderful touch. Molina is effective in retaining his character's vestige of idealism throughout. Also returning in 2, is a charismatic James Franco as Harry Osborn, who has sworn vengeance on his father's ""murderer"", Spider-Man. Along the way, Harry and Dr. Ock form an unholy alliance against... Spider-Man.Sam Raimi is a master storyteller. His narrative style is powerful, compelling, and has a sense of humor. The action sequences and CGI effects are visually stunning. The scene in which Spider-Man attempts to save passengers on a runaway train is simply awesome. The romance between Peter and MJ is very touching. Raimi also provides some dramatic surprises. Toby Maguire's performance as Peter gives Spider-Man 2 its soul. As Peter, he is doing this best ""to be steady"", sacrificing what he wants most, and being true to the part of himself that is hero. A hero is one that inspires those around him or her to greatness. So a hero reminds us of the very best in ourselves-- the part that is compassionate, courageous, and noble. ""Spider-Man 2"", though just a movie reminds us all, of our own greatness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does for superhero movies what Rocky did for boxing movies!,"A remarkable achievement, this is not just a great Marvel comic flick it's a great flick period. Even if a person had been living under a rock for the past 30 years and had never heard of Spiderman...they couldn't help but get wrapped up in this touching and courageous story about a societal underdog overcoming his self-stigmatization and learning to believe in himself again...ultimately triumphing in life and love. I absolutely loved the fact that the CGI and fight sequences weren't the sole purpose of the movie...but merely enhanced what was already a splendid tale. Too often we see the reverse of that...where producers, directors and screenplay writers take a few spectacular special effects and try to wrap a mediocre story around it. This is the complete opposite...a story about a human being who happens to be blessed (or cursed) with a gift that he's trying to come to terms with. The fight and flying sequences just complement the story seamlessly. I can't wait for the DVD and will probably be paying for it again at the theater before it ends what is sure to be a long run! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just barely outdoes the first...!,"Spider-Man 2 ruled! I just saw the midnight showing and I must say that I was NOT disappointed. The action scenes were great, and the drama played off really well, just as they did in the first one. The slight injections of humor were very nicely done; I found myself laughing out loud a number of times.Maguire's and Dunst's performances were top-notch, and played off of each other better than in the first movie, if only because the story allowed for it more in this one. Alfred Molina's portrayal of Doc Oc was noteworthy. He came off as far more intimidating than Dafoe's Green Goblin (again, if only a result of the story and character itself). Rosemary Harris' Aunt May shines again, when she actually has screen time.The CGI at times looked a little ""video game-ish,"" but I found it easily dismissible. The only qualm I really have about this movie is that Spidey's climactic battle with Doc Oc seemed a bit anti-climactic actually. It's not bad; if only the fight had actually lasted a tad bit longer, it may have been just right. You'll see what I mean if you see the movie.I was leaning forward almost the entire movie, and after just over 2 hours that gets a little uncomfortable, but the movie was great! While the first movie was more plot-driven (to me), this one seemed to be more character-driven, focusing specifically on Peter/Spider-Man (of course) and Mary Jane. Spider-Man 2 and its predecessor are examples of the kind of movies that I would like to make: the right amounts of story, character depth, action, drama, and romance (yes, romance; if you get real technical, both movies are somewhat of love stories, with all the other stuff making them entertaining and engaging). While not a perfect movie, Spider-Man 2 does exceed the first movie, if only by a little. Go see this movie (and if you haven't seen the first one, see it beforehand)!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"Having just seen spider man 2 at a sneak preview, I am amazed. The special effects were so amazing that it was hard to tell that there were any. The fight scene between Doc Occ and spider man was truly fantastic, probably the best special power fight scene in a movie so far. Above the action, and above the special effects was the story of how Peter Parker tries to live his life and Spidermans, the introduction of Dr. Octavious, Mary Janes career, and Harry Osborns obsession with killing spider man. Based 2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker is truly struggling being spider man, having to sacrifice everything. MJ has become a star. Harry has taken over Oscorp and is funding Dr. Octavious' (who Peter Parker idolizes) research in the hopes of making Oscorp larger than ever. If you liked the first one at all, you will love the second, and probably even if you didn't like the first one, it is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first,"As good as Spiderman was, II is better. What set Spiderman apart from other comic book heroes was his alter ego. You got to know who Peter Parker was and felt an empathy. Sam Raimi really brings Peter Parker out in this movie. Spidey II has better visual effects, an arguably better villain, great dialog, a super plot and MJ looks as good as ever, Jameson is as big a butt as ever. Perhaps the best part about this movie is that it set up Spiderman III perfectly. Perhaps the weakest part of this movie is the soundtrack. I forgot it before I left the theater. However I paid to see the webslinger in action and that's what we got. What more can I say? Get in line and fork over your bucks to see this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sequel ruined by two stoo-pid subplots,"Released in 2004 and directed by Sam Raimi, ""Spider-Man 2"" stars Tobey Maguire as the troubled hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with MJ (Kirsten Dunst) and battles Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist who has acquired four long tentacles as extra appendages. Rosemary Harris returns as Aunt May while James Franco returns as Harry Osborn.There's this ongoing myth that ""Spider-Man 2"" is a great movie. While Doc Ock is excellently realized the movie is severely flawed by two subplots: Since when are Spider-Man's powers dependent upon Peter's confidence level? He received them via a radioactive spider bite, which has nothing to do with faith/belief. And what about the stoo-pid subplot where Spider-Man's identity is revealed to a dozen New Yorkers on the subway train with the implication that they're going to keep mum about it. Why sure!The movie runs 127 minutes (135 minutes extended cut) and was shot in New York City, the Los Angeles area and Chicago (the train sequence).GRADE: C-",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Want another serving?,"if you liked spiderman... better get ready for more...spiderman 2 has got more thrills, spills, and chills than the tour de france... the flow of story was brilliant... by the end of the movie, you'll be wondering that you wished that the spiderman 3 would feature the lizard (aka curt conners, as mentioned in the predecessor and the sequel) and the 2nd incarnation of the green goblin.but anyway, the fight scenes (special mention goes to the clock to the train scene) was a masterful stroke of genius...i always told my friends that if your did not watch a movie like this that your are missing half of your life... so why the heck are you still reading this worthless review... go watch it and see what i mean...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can't wait for the third part !,"Amazing movie. The best comic-book based movie I've ever seen in my life. I felt like reading a wonderful comic while watching the movie. The scenes with Spider-man flying over New York, the script, the fights, the jokes, Doctor Octopus, the special effects... All the actors that appear in the movie are great in their roles (I think that's definitely Sam Raimi's merit as I do not consider Tobey Maguire a great actor) I loved Spider-man 1, X-Men or X-Men 2, but the ""comic-book feeling"" is so intense in this one, that I'm sure that anyone that has read Spidey comics will enjoy this to the limit. Great ! Can't wait for the third part !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
