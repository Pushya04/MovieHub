"If you have not seen it, see it, because it's awesome. If you have seen it, see it again, because it's still awesome!","I watched this movie for the first time like 10 years ago, and I had to watch it again now. This movie is a combination of genres, and it does a really good job of tying them all together. Horror, thriller, mystery, comedy and parody. The movie shows several horror clichés that have been seen countless times and the characters do the opposite of these clichés, with humor, which was great to see.The Cabin in the Woods is about five stereotypical horror movie characters that are going to spend some time in a cabin in the woods. But there is so much more to this cabin than you know. As the movie tells you: ""If you think you know this story. THINK AGAIN."" and that is so true, especially the ending. This movie has one of the most epic and unexpected endings I have ever seen. I was so entertained by this movie, and I strongly recommend it. If you have not seen it, see it, because it's awesome. If you have seen it, see it again, because it's still awesome!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I understand it's not for everyone (and I might have a slightly twisted sense of humour), but to me, this is pure cinematic pleasure","I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

Truman Show... but make it every horror movie you've ever seen,"Originality built off the foundation of every cliche in the book... mad you didn't think of it first? Haha This had a really solid and original concept that was truly the star of the show in this film. Supported by solid execution in pacing, acting and the balance between horror, comedy and adventure. It kept the intrigue and engagement up throughout. It felt nostalgic yet new, fresh and exciting. It was a well rounded, throughly planned/ thought out, entertaining film.Im not sure it was QUITE as funny or clever as it felt like it thought it was. The only comedy that landed was due to the acting ability of the stoner. He kind of saved the comedic aspect of this film. And even then some of it was hokey. Great casting all around though, solid actors.Also I think the grand scheme of the plot could have used some more interesting elaboration. I wish we could have gotten a little bit more background on the rituals and how/why they were doing them. They gave us just enough to be passable, but I would have liked more.I would love to see a sequel to this made today, over ten years later. It would be interesting to see how they could expand upon this concept (and not make it trash, as so many tend to be). While not perfect, this movie really checked all the boxes for me. 7.5 rounding up to an 8, would recommend for a fun time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic,"What fun. This is a horror comedy with every monster known to man and then some. It's funny, smart and you can't predict this one. Sigourney Weaver shines as usual. A bunch of young cutes go to a cabin in the woods to be young and cute together. Unknown to them this cabin is infested.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Either you love it or you hate it!,"I'm not a horror fan. Although, films pertaining to demonic possession scare me into a four year old, it's just not my taste. I'm also pretty late in watching this movie. I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon's name in the credits for producing and writing.Overall, I loved this movie. It started off as your typical horror film, but turn into something much bigger and more authentic. Every horror in the past twenty years has been predictable. You know who is going to die, you know who the killer is, you know if the dumb blonde runs off screaming into a dark hallway she's more than likely going to have her head get cut off. But this movie was the exact opposite because I had absolutely no clue what was going to happen next. I'm sure a high percentage of people will not appreciate the sci-fi twist to the movie but I loved and thought it was an awesome idea. All horror movies are kind of science fiction anyways. It seems like all the killers are super human anyway because they don't seem to ever die no matter how many times you shoot them, stab them or hit them with a truck. This movie just did it on a larger scale.The script was solid as well. Joss Whedon writes the best dialogue and knows how to play off of cliché's and those corny predictable monologues and speeches.To everyone saying they hated this movie, it's obvious that they don't like change and are probably upset because the originality of this film pretty much slays all their favorite horror movies to dust. It's not Oscar worthy but it's a great Friday night movie with your friends that will keep everyone on the edge of their seat, anticipating what's going to happen next.I have to hand it to the filmmakers. They definitely made a film that no one would have ever thought it. Just like my title says, you either love it or you hate it. You can't please everyone but this customer was satisfied from beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is how to do a parody,"After the ""parody"" movies of the 2000s comes The Cabin in the Woods, a lesson in how to poke fun at a genre while still telling a compelling story. It incorporates all the clichés of the horror genre but in a clever way that all ties together. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, the film goes off the rails and goes into completely new territory.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original cliché,"If you are a fan of art drama or you simply don't like the horror genre, I can understand if you hated this. But for every true fan of horror, with at least a basic knowledge of at least cult horrors through the history of the genre, this should be a real joy. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a weird movie that can not be precisely genre determined. It gathers horror ideas seen countless times and turns them upside-down. Nothing in this movie is new, but the greatest thing about it is its ability to make something very original using totally outworn horror cliches. This is a parody and homage at the same time. It is a funny-scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one-liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute. And the final revelation is at the same time one of the most ridiculous and one of the most awesome things I have ever seen on the big screen. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a real gem and I loved it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Did you see the film I saw ?,"I don't know why people are saying that this film was an abomination and advising others not to see it, because it has all if the element required in a fantastic horror.For me it re-ignited the flame in what was a dying genre, being poisoned by numerous of extremely bad films. Not only did it make it's way into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith that people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only remakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....) or prequels, ( Prometheus ).This movie is full of twists and turns you don't know what way it's going to go. It's smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by all the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.Overall, I rated this movie a 10 because it deserved it. This was one of the best films I've seen in a very long time and is one that I'll be watching over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I FREAKING LOVED this movie!!!!,"The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot, I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes (Jock, Slut, Party-Guy, Nerd, Virgin) who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is, its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?To be honest, the less you know about this film, the more awesome it will be. I felt that the trailer gave away a bit too much of the twists and turns one can expect from the film, but at the same time the image of a bird flying into a giant forcefield is what will set this film apart from the generic horror films that hit the theatres today. The Cabin In The Woods tells you upfront ""You think you know the story..."" but of course you don't. This is Joss Whedon after all. Fans of Buffy and Angel will get a kick out of this, as actors from that universe make their way into this film.It's been a long time since I've had a lot of fun at the movies and the Cabin in the Woods was a lot of fun. It's an odd movie to sell, because a lot of it has to be kept secret to make the second half of the movie exciting and fresh. It blends a few genres together, the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. Both Whedon and Goddard worked on Buffy and Angel, which was a balancing act of genres, so they knew the right tone to get here and they nailed it. They take the clichéd aspects of every horror film and put it in here, to brilliant use. We actually get to see reasons for stupid character mistakes, which made that whole aspect of the film fun.Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and stole every scene they're in. I would love to see these two character actors work together again, they made this film really fun and they are a joy to watch on the screen. The young actors, including Thor himself Chris Hemsworth, sell the clichéd horror characters very well. In most horror flicks I can't stand any of the characters, here I was rooting for all of them.There are some truly hilarious moments, I am dying to talk about them, but doing so would ruin the surprises. All I can say is that I was laughing throughout the entire film, I cheered, I clapped and I enjoyed myself. There are a lot of horror references, most notably The Evil Dead, so it's fun to spot things here and there. Horror fans I think will really get a kick of of this flick and I pray it does well, cause it's the most fun I've had in a long time.Drew Goddard's first directorial gig, he had a lot on his plate and he managed to pull off one hell of a film. It helps when you have someone like Joss Whedon in your corner, but I applaud him for being able to pull off the tone perfectly, I imagine the script to screen process was identical. This is a very clever script, with laughs, gore and surprises at every corner. When you have Goddard, whose worked on Buffy, Angel, Lost and wrote Cloverfield, teamed up with partner Joss Whedon who is one of the best writers working today, then you know you're walking into something special. I can't recommend this flick enough. When it comes out, you must go see it.Just makes sure you don't know much about it beforehand, or it might ruin the awesome factor.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun and unique!,"The Cabin in the Woods (2011) follows a group of friends who go on vacation to a cabin and find themselves getting more than they bargained for. Overall, this is a fun and interesting horror. It's definitely a love letter to fans of all things horror, including fun little references to other films.The cinematography is very lacklustre and I definitely expected more in terms of colour palettes and camerawork. The lighting is fairly poor at times too, and it's hard to see what's going on. However, there are a few shot transitions that I really liked.The sound design is also quite basic, and it doesn't really help to set up an effective atmosphere. However, I did like the score. It isn't entirely original, but it's a lot of fun and very attention grabbing. Also, there are some super funny music cues throughout.We get a good feel for the characters, and although they follow very basic tropes, this just adds to the 80s inspired charm of the film. There are some hilarious lines, paired well with distinctive and goofy performances. I particularly like Fran Kranz as Marty and Bradley Whitford as Hadley.The film is unique from the start, and a fun and easy watch all throughout. It doesn't drag and feels a lot shorter than it is. It does get a little confusing at times but I feel it's explained well and in an easy-to-digest manner.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I loved it, but I can totally understand why people would walk out of the theater and find it terrible.","I'm a big Horror Fan. I have been since I was a young child. I've never seen anything like this movie before. It's a combination of everything. It's taken everything from every other Horror Movie and thrown it all into this movie. But what is really impressive is the fact that the movie has it's own (original) plot.What people seem to get confused about is that this is also a comedy. If you haven't laughed within the first 10 mins, then you better walk out right now, because the movie is exactly the same all through out. I was laughing all the way through it. This movie is just bizarre. One of the most bizarre Horror/Comedies i've ever watched in my life, is fact, the most bizarre Horror/Comedy i've watched in my life.Don't be expecting any scary scenes or anything suspenseful, because this is the wrong movie for you.The acting was great, well written, well directed and excellent comedy one-liners and with the best twist i've ever seen! This movie is exactly where it needs to be, it's a cult movie. It's ""EXACTLY"" what it should be. I'm part of the cult following! A cult classic and the best movie i've seen of 2012!

"Youthful monster movie delivering lots of noisy action, frights and shocks","Pretty good horror movie, full of mosters with a lot of entertainment and amusement. Some guys (Chris Hemsworth as Curt , Fran Kranz , Jesse Williams) are there to pick up the girls (Kristen Connolly as Dana and Anna Hutchison) for a long weekend at a lakeside cabin that Curt's cousin owns . The likable five friends on their RV go for a break at a remote cabin, where they get more than they bargained for, discovering the truth behind the cabin in the woods . If you hear a strange sound outside... have sex. If an old man warns you not to go there... make fun of him. Quaint abandoned property... sold. You think you know the story. If the basement door swings open... go down there. Five friends go to a cabin in the woods. Bad things happen. We work with what we have. There is a greater good, and for that you must be sacrificed. If something is chasing you... split up.An original and attractive plot in which a lot of monsters stir from the depths to cause wreak havoc , apart from a breathtaking final with total chaos , mayhem and extreme destruction . Somewhat different monster film that turns to be a jokey but extremely gory pastiche , but still somewhat entertaining . The film has chills , action , thrills, hilarious moments and the rest is a nice spoof hokum . The sympathetic and young cast as Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth , Anna Hutchison , Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams giving agreeable acting and being finely accompanied by a more veteran support cast as Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, Amy Acker and Brian White. There are a lot of cinematic references concerning failed rituals from other countries o various classic monsters , in fact , the Kyoto ritual is a remark to Ringu or The Ring , to Dracula , Werewolf , to King Kong, and the Stockholm ritual is a reference to John Carpenter's The Thing , being this latter film a beloved and influenced cult movie for Goddard . Writer Joss Whedon and director Drew Goddard created over 50 different types of monsters that were created specifically for The Cabin in the Woods . Director Goddard tells about The Cabin in the Woods : ¨So much of this movie ends up being about mythology in general, and our pagan nature... When you're dealing with archetypes you're dealing with things that have been around forever, and that is very much at the heart of ""Cabin in the Woods,"" that this isn't just about horror movies, this is about mythology, and who we are as a people, and what we keep doing to youth, and how that we have this need, as people, to idealize youth, and then marginalize youth, and then destroy youth. That is a pattern our society falls into, and has fallen into, since we first came out of the caves¨.It contains a suspenseful and thrilling musical score from David Julyan . As well as a brilliant and colorful cinematography by Peter Deming. This clever motion picture was competently directed , being Drew Goddard's directorial debut , here he returns to the tradition al Hollywood gang of monsters and he performs around imaginatively with the genre while giving several cool touches . Previously , Drew worked as a production assistant in L. A. after graduation. A spec script Drew wrote based on Six Feet Under (2001) came to the attention of both Marti Noxon at Buffy, slayer (1997) and David Greenwalt at Ángel (1999). Both wanted him but because Marti found him first, Joss Whedon determined Drew would go to ""Buffy"". He became a staff writer for Season 7 (2002-2003), writing five episodes . Once ""Buffy"" was over , Drew moved over to ""Angel"" and became the executive story editor for Season 5 (2003-2004), writing four episodes. Drew also found time to contribute two stories to the ""Tales of the Vampires"" comic series and after producing notorious TV series as ¨The Good Place¨ , ¨Daredevil¨, ¨The Defenders¨, ¨Lost¨and films as ¨Cloverfield 10¨, ¨The Martian¨, The Cloverfield Paradox¨, ¨Bad Times at the Royale¨ .

"A film for anyone who has ever complained that they don't make good, original horror films anymore.","I would normally be leery of giving out a perfect 10 rating, but if ever there was a modern horror movie that was worthy of a 10, it's this one. ""Cabin in the Woods"" has done what I no longer thought was possible for a horror movie, it blew my mind and showed me something I never expected. When I first saw a trailer for this on television I thought ""Oh great, another recycled, clichéd horror flick. Can't they think of anything other than putting a group of young people in a stale setting and kill them off one by one?"" Well it would appear that they can. This is a film that is nearly impossible to market effectively without giving anything away. Some of the more recent trailers have included much more footage that gives a glimpse into what this movie REALLY is about. Word of mouth should be the biggest factor that helps make this movie popular. I just hope for your sake that no one spoils this brilliant gem for you. It's best to go into it with as little information as possible. I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. They could've taken this in an entirely different direction if they simply wanted to shock you at the end. Instead, they treat the film like a slow, steady reveal. In fact, the opening scene does not even feature the group of kids that we follow on their horrific trip to the cabin. Instead, it opens with the ""other"" side of this story and the characters who get about as much screen time as our heroine and her pals. The result is a cinematic experience like none other. The audience is fed bits of information little by little throughout the entire film, so you're always hot on the trail of this story's secrets. You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality, every time this plot reveals a twist, it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you, but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger. I'm so glad they wrote the script this way. I feel like 9 times out of 10 the writers of today would be too tempted to create a story that hides everything behind the curtain and focuses solely on the kids at this cabin. That way they can build up to a final payoff that no one would ever see coming. This payoff is too big to simply catch you off guard with. They got this right, a movie that isn't only original for the end of the third act, but a refreshing journey from start to finish. Go experience this film before you overhear people talking about it at the water cooler.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Redeeming qualities, but disappointing","I'm a Joss Wheedon fan, so I had pretty high expectations for this - and it just didn't live up to them. For a John Carpenter movie, this'd be pretty much middle of the road, and for a Ewe Boll flick, this would be a masterpiece, but it's not really up to Joss's usual standards.The single most disappointing part of the movie is the editing - much of the action is shown in dimly-lit, flash-cut closeups. The film editors, having seen all of the footage shot, know what's going on; they forget that the audience doesn't, and much of the action leaves the audience wondering what the heck just happened. This trend in cinematography is already longer-lived than it deserved; maybe Hollywood will get over the 'flash cuts cause excitement' nonsense and get back to telling the story, rather than manipulating the audience.Other than that, there was a new twist on an old genre, some good fun, some mystery to solve, some characters you could care about, and an unusual ending. Worth seeing, but don't expect a masterpiece, and accept that there's action that you won't quite be able to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the best, most original horror films in years","The horror genre for me has been pretty mediocre for the past several years, and so I have pretty much ignored a lot of horror movies that have come out, with the exception of a few. However, after the buzz surrounding Cabin, I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough, Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want, from our favorite clichés to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say, every horror fan should go see this.I won't spoil the story, but to get into things a little, we focus on the age old tale of horror films: friends go to a remote cabin for some RnR and then the **** hits the fan. And when it does, it does so gleefully. It would be easy to blow this off as a simple parody, but it's not. I won't say how, but this is essentially a horror movie within a horror movie, and it's mostly dead serious. There's plenty of humor throughout, mostly due to Fran Krantz stoner character. And in fact, pretty much all the actors play there parts well. They are likable characters, even if they are cliché, but the clichés are part of the entire point. And in such areas, these characters are great. If you're worried about the horror aspect of the film, fear not, it delivers immensely. There are plenty of chilling scenes, though I wouldn't necessarily call them scary, and there is plenty of gore for the gorehounds, particularly at the end.To say much more would be to give away too much. I certainly had a few qualms about the film, but they were few and far between. And the less you know the better. I will only say that if you've been looking for good horror film, this is it. Whedon and Goddard have delivered in every way and their film will be remembered for some time in the same way Scream was remembered for shaking up the genre. This is similar, but different in oh so many ways. Go see this movie. It's the kind of film that comes out once in a blue moon.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A New Horror Camp,"The writers of this film stated that they didn't like how the horror genre has become. Full of unlikable characters that we don't care if they live or die. Cabin in the Woods sounds like a generic horror film with a generic premise and generic horror characters. When you see it closely, it's an intriguing high concept satirical horror film. It may look absurd but it's actually brilliant and smart. It has campy scares and some good laughs. Cabin in the Woods is an enjoyable horror film with an unlikely twist.Horror movies have lost its suspense because we don't care about the characters and the characters are particularly dumb to make decisions to survive. It make sense in this film. The actors did a great portraying these clichéd characters. Chris Hemsworth and his body already makes a good jock character. Kristen Connolly is pretty likable. Fran Kranz steals the show as the pot headed dude.Some will say it's generic but it's actually intriguing. I'm not gonna give everything away but I'm gonna say it's a bit absurd but it's smart and inspired. It's also a bit scary, though some of the jump scares didn't work but it's much better when the scares goes campy. I'm not gonna reveal the monsters either. There are ridiculously hilarious moments which lightens the grimness. The thrills and suspense are always there.At first, you thought it's just another horror film but when you pass through the rest of the film, you will realize that this would be a remarkable experience. I have to agree with one of the critics, ""The less you know about Cabin in the Woods, the better"". It looks absurd but it's smart and creative. It gave substance to all generic horror movie nonsense. It's Campy, Hilarious, and Fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The last 30 minutes are worth experiencing,"This is my second time watching this movie. And while I'm not a fan of the gore genre, the last 30 minutes are truly something unique in the genre. They must have prepared a lot of costumes for those 30 minutes, which is a shame because there are quite a few ""monster"" characters who only appear for a few moments. Overall, this movie really lacks quite a bit. The lines are too banal, a multinational group of sick fanatics create a secret company that captures people and sacrifices them. What do we expect from that company? Director Ripley shows up for a few minutes? No. The plot of the movie is quite sketchy and unrealistic. A bunch of monsters appeared out of nowhere like a cosplay festival and all we know is that each character is kept in a cube, no one knows why or how these monster characters can exist, perform missions, and return to the cube. I need a detailed story here, this makes the movie more interesting than it already is. And our young adult characters? The first hour of the movie I mean, so boring. Everything makes me a little uncomfortable. That fanatic company was introduced too early, the way it works is similar to ""Battle Royale"" but this only makes the viewer's experience worse. There are no interesting human characters in this movie. Remember, this is not a bloody comedy, and so I really wanted to swear during the first hour of the movie. Including the fact that they have a bunch of stuff in the basement, the setting is good but the effect is zero. But I like the idea of this ""Squid Game"". If only they turned this movie into a show, developing little by little, every specific detail. That would be a show I would want to see.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Joss Wheddon dared to be different...and different he gave us.,"After the opening title, we are thrown into the social standard of the guts and glory horror we all know and love. Five friends decide to drive their van out to an abandoned cabin in the woods and along the way they come across a creepy old man at a run down petrol station; nothing could go wrong right? And what would a stereotypical horror scenario be without with out it's cliché's characters; the stoner; the jock; the nerd; the popular girl and the virgin - well, sort of. Much to the hilarity of the film the group do just about everything you shouldn't do when in a creepy cabin; which results in them fighting for there lives when suddenly under attack from bombarding creatures of the night.As for the rest of the plot, it's pleasantly far from what you would normally expect; and balances out stunningly between a well mixed cocktail of classic horror and laugh out loud humor. Seeing how I'm still traumatised from when people told me the ending from The Sixth Sense, don't expect me to tell you what happens in the rest of the movie - of course, aside from the killer unicorn.If you look around on the internet really closely, you will notice it's the highest rated Horror Movie for the past 7 years since The Descent. You will never see another Horror Movie like this...EVER...PERIOD! In the large array of god-awful horror films to be recently brought out onto the big screen and direct to DVD/Blu Ray, The Cabin In The Woods is a refreshingly needed milestone to the long drying out horror genre. Aside from the somewhat awkward and pretentious cameo from Sigourney Weaver, The Cabin In The Woods is a deliciously bloody, funny, well acted, all round brilliantly written and directed satire of the horror genre.

Flipping the horror genre on its head,"An incredibly clever and meta take on the horror comedy genre. It is both a love letter and a criticism on the cliches and tropes used in horror movies. What makes this film unique is how it uses the tropes for its narrative purpose.I personally, would move or remove some of the scenes in the first act to give the movie a sense of mystery. There is a lot of scenes with a certain duo that I feel would have been better introduced in the second act. That way the first act feels more like a cliche horror movie because it gets completely flipped on its head in the second act. Apart from that, I find this to be a throughly enjoyable film!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bloody fun twist on the isolated cabin sub-genre,"If anyone knows how to have fun with pop culture horror conventions, it's Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Avengers) and he and Director Drew Goddard craft a funhouse of a horror movie by doing just that. And we are happily along for the bloody fun ride. Cabin is a movie where the less you know going in, the better. So, I'll simply say that it starts out with the classic young partiers heading up to an isolated cabin scenario and then turns this horror sub-genre into something quite different and deviously fun. Aside from a really clever script and the fact that Drew Goddard knows how to craft suspense and scares, despite letting us in early on what is going on, we also get a bunch of likable characters (including Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth) to root and care for. This is very important to make a horror flick work and so many films today makes their leads unlikable jerks who we could care less about. We are only scared when we care what happens to the antagonists and here we do. We like this bunch of characters and it adds to the film's effect that we don't want to see them suffer the fate that has befallen them. And what a clever and cruel fate Whedon and Goddard have in store for their victims. And, in turn, providing a clever and inventive blood soaked horror for us. The FX are top notch and the performances from his cast, especially leading heroine Kristen Connolly, are good and help make the scenario work. The script provides plenty of scares and gore but, also gives us some tension-relieving laughs with Whedon's trademark sly humor. Everything is blended together well by director Goddard, who gets us primed and ready for the 'all hell breaks loose' final act. A real horror movie blast!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Puppet Masters,"Good evening, everyone! I'm Mr. C Reviewer, and tonight we'll be diving into the film The Cabin in the Woods. I had the opportunity to watch the movie on Netflix. This movie originally premiered on December 11, 2011, and has a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes. It is rated for viewers aged 15 and older. Notably, parts of the film were filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The estimated budget for The Cabin in the Woods was around $30,000,000, and it grossed approximately $70,038,838. As someone on the autism spectrum, I found subtitles to be incredibly helpful, greatly enhancing my ability to follow the dialogue throughout the film. In instances where dialogue in the movie was delivered in Japanese, English subtitles were automatically displayed on the screen. The film was directed by Drew Goddard, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Joss Whedon.Summary: A group of college students who embark on a trip to a remote cabin in the woods, unaware of the fate that awaits them. As they settle into the cabin, they begin to uncover the dark secrets that surround itReview: -I appreciated the film's opening, as I found the initial scenes to be captivating and skilfully established the premise of the story. We are introduced to technicians working in an underground facility, followed shortly by a depiction of five friends setting off for a weekend retreat at a secluded cabin, which cleverly invokes classic horror conventions. This setup allows viewers to immerse themselves in the narrative while anticipating the familiar frights typical of this genre. While I enjoyed experiencing both perspectives-the technicians and the group of friends-I believe that revealing the technicians' viewpoint more later in the film would have enhanced my enjoyment. I would have preferred to delve deeper into their storyline as the plot progressed, as it didn't provide much of a surprise. I appreciated the film's distinctive premise, which offered a nuanced exploration of genre conventions, the concept of free will, audience expectations, societal values surrounding entertainment, and our shared complicity in the consumption of violent media. I appreciated the intricate world-building in the film, which showcased both originality and depth. It was particularly engaging to uncover the motivations behind the technicians' actions as the narrative unfolded, culminating in a thorough explanation of their roles and intentions towards the end of the movie. While the film commenced with a compelling introduction, there were instances where the pacing appeared somewhat inconsistent; certain segments of the narrative seemed to linger longer than necessary, while others felt hurried following a more gradual development. I admire how the film skilfully blends humour with horror, crafting a distinctive experience that both parodies and pays tribute to classic horror conventions. However, I personally expected a bit more comedic content throughout the movie; while I found moments to smile at, I didn't often find myself laughing, as some parts felt somewhat contrived. I appreciated the casting choices for the film and found the actors' performances to be commendable; I feel that they embodied their characters with a level of charm and relatability that transcended typical clichés. The soundtrack effectively balances tension with moments of levity, reflecting the film's narrative structure that alternates between horror and comedy, seamlessly complementing the on-screen scenes.-I found the depiction of gore that the film had was impressively executed, contributing to a striking sense of realism. I was enjoyed by the film's cinematography, which employed a variety of shot types to enhance its narrative. The gentle lighting established a nuanced atmosphere that I found appealing; however, while all the essential elements in each frame were distinctly visible, some parts could have benefited from additional brightness. Personally, I often adjust my screen's brightness for a better viewing experience, which proved particularly advantageous during this film. I appreciated that the film incorporated CGI in several scenes, which were effectively complemented by practical effects. This combination enhanced the sense of realism in the horror elements. The hybrid technique facilitated more imaginative monster designs and sequences that would have been challenging to realize with practical effects alone. However, there were certain CGI moments that appeared less convincing than others, especially regarding specific creature designs.-I appreciated the film's conclusion, finding it both refreshing and thought-provoking. However, the abrupt ending left a sense of unresolved closure, as this intentional ambiguity allows for various interpretations. While I value this creative choice, I can understand how it might frustrate viewers who prefer a more definitive resolution.I rate each film I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it a 6.5 Remember this was what I thought about the movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the rare Hollywood big budget horror films worth your time,"The Cabin in the Woods (2011) is a movie that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a group of friends that decide to rent a cabin in the woods for a getaway. Little do they know the cabin is run by a government organization that has different plans for them other than ""fun.""This movie is directed by Drew Goddard (Bad Times at the El Royale) in his directorial debut and stars Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Kristen Connolly (The Happening), Jesse Williams (Brooklyn's Finest), Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers), Bradley Whitford (Get Out) and Tim DeZarn (Fight Club).This movie has a really good cast that's pretty impressive. I was impressed at how creative this movie is from a storyline and an execution stand point. This was smart in how it's not a standard ""cabin in the woods"" plot. I adore the horror elements in this every time. The sickest part of the movie has to be the truth or dare/deer sequence. 😂 Although, I will give the movie credit for a great use of a bear trap, the RV kill and the entire ending is fun (maybe a little too heavy on the CGI at times, but still fun).Overall, this is a creative and well done addition to the horror genre that's absolutely worth a watch - One of the rare Hollywood big budget ($30 million) horror films worth your time. I would score this a strong 8-8.5/10 and consider it a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An absolute masterpiece homage to horror movies,"This is one of my favorite movies so this review will be a little (ok, a lot) biased. I love watching horror movies and so before I went to see this film a friend of .one said ""it isn't what you think. It will surprise you."" Now, I went to see this movie thinking I had it all figured out. Despite my friends warning, I thought I had figured out the twist and would see it coming. Boy was I wrong. Within the first 5 minutes, what I thought was the twist was already revealed and the movie still played out with more twists, humor, and deaths than I could imagine. The movie is a bit explanatory at times opting to tell us what is going on instead of us figuring it out, but I feel it works because the entire movie is really like an introductory coarse on the tropes of horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mixed bag but overall a satisfying and enjoyable horror,"The Cabin in the Woods has a very fresh and intriguing concept which opens the door for lots of outlandish and inventive horror.I do think the structure could have been better so as to preserve some of the surprises and maintain the suspense, but overall it was a well executed plot.The cast were well above par for your average horror film, with pretty decent performances all around.There were plenty of cliches to wade through in this film but never to the point where it became a chore. Lots of good horror sequences and imagery.I would say though that this film was rarely scary. It didn't have a huge amount of suspense or dread to it, which I would have liked to see.Overall though a solid horror film which gets by on its fresh and engaging concept.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Outstanding,"There are no words to express how amazing this movie was. What one would assume would be a typical horror cliché is actually treated to one of the most creative movies I've ever seen. Although most people could expect what the movie contained from the previews, as I did, they will still be blow away by this movie. Not from the acting or directing or anything like that, but from the pure originality of the movie. The last horror movie I remember seeing that was this original, inventive, and down right badass was Scream, and with a equally satisfying deliverance of it's gritty, gory, grisly, and tongue in cheek attitude. Anyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their money's worth and then some.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A complete waste of time, talent, and technology","I've seen some bad horror films in my day, but this piece of $hit takes the cake. It is totally nonsensical, utterly ridiculous, grossly exaggerated, completely absurd and a blood fest, no, a blood orgy is more like it. And those are its good points.The premise is so tired and worn. As I watched the girl descend into the dark basement alone I knew then it was schlock. What woman in her right mind would do that in such a creepy old, dark house in the middle of the woods? But alas our brave heroine whom earlier was so grossed out by a piece of art that she had to put a blanket over it, now has grown a pair of balls.There is no way any review can spoil this movie as it has spoiled itself.I feel like suing the producers to get the 95 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this crap.And that Signourey Weaver and Bradford Whitley would even lend their names to this made me lose all respect for them as actors. Times must really be hard for them to sink this low.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meta enough that it isn't (too) horrible,"I like this film because it's a movie about horror movies rather than a horror movie itself.

Too predictable at times,"The main problems I have with this film is:1. It had the longest scene in it I ever watched in a film, that I could predict entirely. The culprit is an entirely redundant shot with a CGI eagle at the start of the film. Who thought it would be a good idea to put that in?2. There are many other scenes that gave me a similar feeling of wasted time by making me think: ""yes, I get the point, this refers to a famous horror movie, please move on to the rest of the story.""3. The actual premise of the film, the stuff that could make it interesting, is compressed into the quite short ending and was mostly predictable from the start.'The Cabin in the Woods' gives away too many hints from the start on. Drop those hints and it would become more interesting, at the condition that the viewer didn't already pick up the hints elsewhere like in the trailer, a short summary, or reviews. If you don't know anything yet about the film and this is the first review you read, stop reading if you plan to watch it. The less you know about it, the higher the chance that it will be interesting.Overall, the film was entertaining enough that I would give it a 6/10, but it was far from the great and original experience I expected it to be from other reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It began OK, but towards the end it became so pathetic that i was watching it just for the sake of telling people that i have watched this movie and how awful it is. It sure was different but it was not good different. If you haven't watched this movie, then do not i repeat DO NOT watch it. Why? because it sucks. Unless you are one of those who enjoy watching things wayyy far from what makes sense do not watch it. The end was just stupid.

One of the best black comedy horror movies I've ever seen.,"I love horror movies, and I also love Whedon, and also enjoyed Cloverfield, done by Goddard. Combine the three and I was giddy from the go. I do remember the first time I saw the trailer I was intrigued but a little skeptical, but now having seen the film, I understand the trailer more. It's hard to talk too much about the movie without giving away something so I'll keep this short. The marketing campaign, I'm not sure if it was done as best as possible, as it tends to market it as purely horror when the movie is clearly more black comedy. That isn't to say that horror fans will be left in the dust, much the opposite, as there are so many elements that hardcore horror fans will love.An original horror movie, it will make you laugh, it will make you wonder what the hell is going on, and it will delight you. It reminds me much of Scream in the style of writing and some of the story, it definitely has some commentary going on, which is one of the reason why I think horror fans will like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as it thinks it is, but great last half hour","For the first hour of its running time, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is a fairly awful movie. It comes across as a semi-spoof of THE EVIL DEAD and all of its ilk with one of those oh-so-witty post-modern twists, in which the whole set-up is being televised and broadcast a la THE TRUMAN SHOW. For this first hour, the film is saddled with an obnoxious script and the kind of characters you'd find in a cheesy B-movie. I'm not quite sure what Joss Whedon was thinking.Then, at around the hour mark, there's a huge, huge twist and the film becomes something else entirely. It becomes a higher-budgeted spin on the likes of CUBE, and then of course there's a sudden onslaught of monsters which will delight any fans of the horror genre. Sadly, copyright means that some of the monsters only resemble cinematic creations of old, like the Lord of Bondage and Pain guy who looks like Pinhead from HELLRAISER but isn't. Imagine if they'd had the rights to show all the great movie creatures - now that would have been great!So, for the finale, this film becomes a post-modern spoof with references to anything and everything, not least my old favourite, H. P. Lovecraft. The thing it most brings to mind, for me, are the two WAXWORKS movies with their celebration of the depth and breadth of horror movie monsters. The CGI effects are passable, and the script is never as good as it thinks it is, but it is quite a bit of fun at the end. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS as a whole doesn't hang together and both acting and direction are bland, but it's a film that's been purpose built to appeal to movie fans so it's worth at least a single watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great fun but don't give away the secret,"It is really hard to review this movie adequately without giving away its party piece but I will try and do it justice without spoiling anything.Basic premise is 5 students (usual horror movie clichés) go on a break to a cabin in the woods and get more than the bargained for. So far so done before but this is totally different. The opening sequence and even the trailers point to the fact that all is not how it seems and we begin to find out pretty quickly what is happening.It is a superb idea and the first 2 acts are among the best horror/ sci-fi / black comedy film of the last decade or 2. The final act was a bit too over the top for my liking but was still great fun. The acting was solid, the script funny and well paced. The effects were a little comic book but again due to the nature of what is going on I suppose that should be expected.This really is a genre of its own, the hype surrounding it is unjustified because whilst it is unique it's a bit too ridiculous at times but then again I suppose that's the point. It's best described as Evil Dead meets the Truman show but you really will have to see it. It's marmite and you will either love it or hate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deconstruction and subversion of horror tropes.,"But I would expect no less from the mind of Joss Wheadon, the man that gave us ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". This is a movie that, like ""Scream"" did in the 90's, deconstructs horror movies in an entertaining and rather original way.Tell me if you've heard this story before. Five teens head out to a secluded cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun, partying and sex. But they're not alone and soon find themselves fighting for their lives as a supernatural force kills them one by one.Of course this has been done before. Movies like ""The Evil Dead"" immediately spring to mind. But what makes this movie such a pleasure to watch is that we get to see behind the curtain as it were and see what leads up to the whole situation.To say more about the machinations that go on behind the scenes would be giving away too much of the plot. Suffice it to say it's a very satisfying explanation as to why we always see the same kinds of horrors going on in our movies.Recommended for fans of horror, comedy and those that like their movies to be a little different.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A unique take on the horror genre,"I honestly thought this was a horror movie but I eventually realized it is more of a horror homage/tribute to campy, cheesy, and predictable films of the genre.

"Unique, Terrifying, and Loads of Fun","With the state of horror films being reduced to little more than jump scares, The Cabin in the Woods stands out as one of the most unique films in the genres recent history. Leading you to believe that it is a common campy slasher flick, the underlying plot has you puzzled and questioning the real story behind the scenes. With an excellent cast, each character plays their role perfectly and their over-the-top attitudes become less of a stereotype with the plot justifying their standard horror actions. Between the scares and blood, there is still plenty of great jokes and solid humor sprinkled throughout the carnage.

"i get it, but it still doesn't mean it's a good film","so here goes...i get it! the concept, the whole story within the story, the horror movie clichés, the play and pretty much minor parody of 80's horror/slasher movies (most notably Friday the 13th). that being what it was i was perfectly fine with it. the jokes with mordecai being on speaker phone, the pothead referencing that the jock has never been the alpha male, that was good and funny. now with that being said the ending was a total miss. the movie is going in the right direction, even with the workers working the cabin and the whole ""monsters"" angle. after that the end veers off into a whole different direction, very unnecessary. i mean OK, basic horror flick pays homage to the 80's slasher film and other films and then WHAM!! the random sacrifice and appease the gods angle. it just doesn't fit, it doesn't work...if it was a test on human adaption and survival amid disastrous and traumatizing consequences and situations, i would have bought that more than i bought this. that's what made cube work. granted, this isn't cube and if the writers went that angle there would still be haters. hey! they bit off cube!! either way that would have been a 10 times better film and STILL different in it's own right for the BETTER. not different for the WORSE like this ending concept that seemed thrown together and without any real meaning or purpose. the writer's had a good thing going and threw it out the window. it's OK though, i'm used to it in 21st century cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One for the horror fans,"It has literally been years since the horror genre had something nice to offer, with crap security camera footage ""films"" dominating the landscape (crap like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY) after the demise of the once mighty torture porn (SAW and the rest). Just when horror fans like me began to lose hope, along comes THE CABIN IN THE WOODS which plays as both a tribute and a subtle parody of the horror genre.The basic plot is basically a copy-paste version of EVIL DEAD; some teens go to a cabin in the woods to party and then cue the ancient unspeakable horror. If you think that's bland, remember that the trailers made it obvious that there was something more to this bare bones plot and by god, there IS a lot more than just a bunch of teens getting high and drunk in some run down shack. If you haven't seen the trailers prior to the film, well let's just say you're in for a lot of twists and turns. To say anymore about this could end up spoiling more than one detail so I'll just say that the plot is a lot smarter than you could expect.While it does pay tribute and homage to an old, tried and tested genre, the movie doesn't fail to be both funny and horrifying. It does more than just play out the genre conventions straight. The script is dotted with moments of random dark humor that work in the story's context. The dialogue points out some flaws and stereotypes of the genre but it never does it in an ""In your FACE!!"" way similar to say, SCREAM (not to say it's bad); it's really subtle so if you know the conventions, you'll get the jokes. The characters may act in their stereotypical ways but for once this is actually justified. Every little bit of the genre that made it more of a joke as the decades went by is given justification and it works.The horror is old school; kill shots, decapitations, nightmarish creatures, etc... none of that kill shot cutting seen a lot in PG-13 garbage or the shaky camera crap seen way too many times. This is a HORROR movie so people die on screen, not off screen like today's ""horror"" which are too scared to show even a drop of blood. Visually it may not be the most impressive collection of on-screen kills ever imagined but in a time when almost everything is being marketed to children, this is more than a refresher.THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is really for the horror fans; it's for people who've grown up with the likes of Freddy Kruger and have grown weary of today's ""horror."" It's not only a fright-fest, it's a lot smarter than one could expect and it works. If you're new to the genre or you don't really like it, you'll either get it or not. Otherwise if you like horror movies with some sort of passion, you'll like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Meta Horror,"You can't make one movie that will appeal to everyone. Even within a genre there's always going to be people hating or loving something that the majority thinks is obviously the complete opposite. This isn't ""true"" horror, it does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of wit. There are quite a few nods and there are many little things ""hidden"" in the subtext or out in the open for people to discover. Even simple things as the ""running upstairs"" cliché gets a spin (or at least I think it does. But with Joss Wheddon on script duties, I'm pretty sure this was no mere accident).Talking about clichés, you do get a few, but those clichés are there and they are always getting a spin that works. It doesn't look like Joss tries to make it work. He just makes it work. And while I did stress out the comedy factor, this still pulls some scares and does get dirty and bloody. Not for the faint hearted then.This warrants repeat viewings, just to catch even more hints, jokes and just pure Wheddon magic (for me at least).

Goes out on a limb but falls short of the grail,"Few clichés are as tired as the by now infinitely wearisome 'teenage college kids spend the weekend in a cabin in the woods' format.For some reason horror movie producers and directors still seem to think this format is workable, maybe even a trope. But that's not true. Show me someone who isn't bored of the 'cabin in the woods' setup and I'll show you someone who's been living the past three decades (if not four) living with an indigenous pygmy tribe in the remote depths of the Amazon jungle where they don't even know what a trope is. In short, dear Hollywood - we are pig-sh*t-sick of the cabin in the woods scenario.Thus, a film entitled 'Cabin in the Woods' is making a bold move with the movie-going public. There's an inevitable sense of foreboding. A sinking feeling that movies, and therefore society, are on the decline; that the brazen title of this latest horror outing is indicative of the 'couldn't give a flying flick' attitude of the powers that be; a cinematic microcosm of the mire we are expected to live in on a daily basis, to take on the chin, to accept as read, to swallow like good little boys and girls. Here is society personified in a film title and we know all too well what to expect. We pay our fees, bend over and drop our trousers as we've grown accustomed to doing of late.But wait! Something is amiss.Sure, we're looking at a group of teenagers going to a cabin in the woods for a weekend break. And sure, one of them is a muscular 'jock', another is a blonde, over-sexed bimbo, another is a pot-smoking know-it-all sarcasm vendor and yet another is the ubiquitous prissy virgin, annoyed that her friends have set her up with the token 'stud' and won't even allow her to bring her text books to the cabin. Sure, everything looks suspiciously familiar from the outset - even down to the grumpy local yokel and his serial-killer mannerisms. But don't let appearances deceive you.Cabin in the Woods inserts its tongue into its cheek from scene one. It recognises the clichés and sprains them. It gives the middle finger to sense and throws itself with wild abandon into the silliest, yet most original plot you're likely to see this side of a Tarantino picture.And then it falls sadly short, drawing up a few furlongs shy of an instant classic. The problems are not numerous, but jar nonetheless. Plot holes, for the most part. Questions unanswered and threads unresolved. The premise is inspired yet never fully realised. The characters contain potential but fall foul of the formula. Ultimately, in trying to parody a genre, Cabin in the Woods becomes its own target and sinks into a paradox of self-defeating ideas. In the end it morphs into something quite original but far beyond the initial mission statement, wading its way toward an inevitable conclusion having succumbed to those unoriginal scenes it seeks to mock.Ultimately, a unique horror, black humour of the deepest black with a sprinkling of eugenicist philosophy for good measure. You'll enjoy it, I guarantee. Whether you'll take anything away from it other than a smirk is less certain.Could have been a genre-changing catalyst, but succeeds only in adding a few new layers to a previously shallow sub-genre. Great fun along the way and no less worthy a motion picture for those failed and lofty intentions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meta Horror Parody,"This film is a sort of a deconstruction-parody of the horror movie; it shows appreciation for the genre and put a hilarious and creative twist on what we as fans love about a post modern classic horror movie and what makes them great. The plot is really two separate subplots that converge to make it's third act a home run drive, and as great and integral as the stars like Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver are, their star-power isn't overshadowing anyone else, leaving room for the lesser known actors to shine when they need to. While it technically is a horror movie at is core, it has elements of thriller, mystery and comedy on a meta level, and it's a real breath of fresh air, which goes to show how phenomenal the writing, production, and direction of this film was.

Best seen with friends,"""Cabin in the Woods"" is horror/comedy - a type of movie I haven't seen in awhile but one that I have always enjoyed.It was done in the same vein as Evil Dead (they go to a cabin in the woods and accidentally unleash evil by reading a passage from a book), Scream (meta-horror aware of the rules), and...Scooby Doo (bunch of friends pile into a van and there's a stoner guy who provides comic relief).You can't go into this movie thinking that it is going to be traditional horror. I know the trailer promised that but guess what - IT LIED. You will not experience gripping fear or be scared or want to crawl into your mommy's bed. You might pee your pants when you see the unicorn though.Cabin is the perfect ""bad movie night"" movie that you watch with a bunch of friends, a bowl of popcorn, and just laugh and have a good time. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you shouldn't either.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Yeah ... it's fine, but ...","I would file this film under ""good idea executed kind of poorly"". A lot of it doesn't really make much internal sense. Apparently our group of kids ""picked"" the form of their demise once they arrived at the cabin ... but the cabin is named after this threat, as established before they got their. The form of the ritual that needs to be performed is very very specific, yet none of the other ones we see happening match the form at all. Why would the facility have a button that opens all the cells at once? Well ... all that aside, I generally think that as horror parody, it's very thin. I don't understand the ""it's going to permanently change the genre"" hype that went on. ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" is a far better skewering of genre tropes than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rejuvenating spin on the horror genre. Funny, scary, gory and loads of FUN","I went to a preview screening of this in London last night night.Its one hell of a fun and radical ride. Notice IMDb has only a two sentence synopsis for this film? Its for good reason. The least you know about the plot the better. In fact don't even read reviews...wait, you can read my one though! Just know that this is a horror movie that is scary, funny (in tone with Evil Dead 2, Zombieland and Scream) and very gory with an outrageously inventive script that makes this a refreshing and rejuvenating take on films with suggestive mundane titles such as...well, The Cabin in the Woods.Its not necessarily unique as all of its parts have been done before in past films but what is unique is how ingeniously it fuses those genres together. Even naming the different films its inspired from would be spoiling the fun.The performances by the 5 stereotypical friends are very enjoyable. The comic relief hippie , the sex driven couple, the shy dude and the shy girl. What raises my eyebrow a bit is that the actors look older than the ages they are meant to play but these are experienced and mature actors and so they probably deliver better performances as 19/20-ish year old than most 20 year old actors would. Chris Hemsworth, for instance, is 29 and though he doesn't look like a 20 year old, he acts it and his charisma more than makes up for that optical failure.There are a few surprises along the way including a nice cameo. Horror enthusiasts might also delight in picking up several horror references. You may or may not predict the ending, if you don't, good for you. To be honest the ending wasn't such a big revelation to me as it was intended to be but the roller-coaster journey ride made it all worthwhile.Its the perfect film to see with a lively Friday/Saturday night audience from which you'll hear both laughter and girlie screams aplenty (at least that's what I got from my audience). But just go and have a real fun time with this however you choose to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why Does This Film Exist?,"All horror film story lines are the same these days; a few teenagers go out to a remote holiday cabin with no communication with the outside world and decide that they have to fight whatever it is that's trying to kill them all until they die one by one. What made this film worse than all the others is the fact that it concentrated so hard on having a terrible, cliché story line.This film is a disgrace, and it is an insult to all good horror movies that ""The Cabin In The Woods"" was even advertised as a scary film. It wasn't even remotely scary, in fact the only time it made me jump was when the credits started rolling and I jumped out of my seat to be the first to leave the cinema.To summarise, the story line made literally no sense, the acting was weak and I'm still laughing at the fact that this film was categorised as a ""horror"".

Just when you thought it was safe to leave your grave...,"A Joss Whedon co-script credit state-of-the-genre teen horror/comedy, with just a hint of conspiracy theory, delivers on the laughs and a few thrills, but not the chills – unless you're of such a nervous disposition that you shouldn't be watching horror in the first place. A very acceptable alternative to the occasional pretension and over seriousness of even such self-conscious ventures as Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity and Insidious. The title gives the game away – this is horror as cliché, parodying itself, but thankfully at a much higher than Not-Just-Another-Teen-Movie level, scaling the same heights of postmodern genre-bending meta-horror as Scream and Jason X, in this case, a pleasant buzz and head-high blend of The Truman show, Bruce Campbell ... and Scooby Doo.***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** Keeping Earth's ancient evil giant gods happy has gone super hi-tech (with modern high priests not unlike movie moguls and control-freak directors using the stock-in-trade devices of the horror genre as its tools, including in this case the ghosts, ghouls and monsters ). It's a secret global industry, with rules/rituals not dissimilar to the postmodern horror guideline laid down in Scream, the number of victims, the order in which they die, the role of the virgin, etc., etc.. The gods are getting angry and they must be appeased. Various appeasement projects around the world fail and it's up to the US to save the day (which for some reason I'm sure intentionally reminded me of the Fox network's view of the global economic crisis). For a moment it looks as if they've pulled it off, but they suddenly realise in the middle of something like a wrap-party that it's going wrong and they are in serious trouble... the ""sacrifice"" industry appears to have become too tech-sophisticated for its own good, and finally appears to have succumbed to that scariest of all scenarios, human error. No wonder the hi-tech priests talk about simpler times when all they had to do was throw virgin's into volcanoes...At this point we are in a strange dilemma, do we want the ""bad"" guys to win and safeguard humanity, or do we want the dumb youngsters (so dumb they almost make dumb-as-they-come inbred redneck zombies look clever) to survive and secure the horrific destruction of mankind?All this happens in the first half of the film, and while the execution of the idea is interesting and entertaining, the telescoping of the normal 90 or 120 min horror narrative into this much shorter time, coupled with the fact that every clichéd move is intentionally telegraphed, tends to rob it of any jump-out-of-your-seat moments that were potentially there. But that's hardly what the movie is about, and in the second half it really comes into its own in a roller-coaster of subtle, not-so-subtle and over-the-head-with-a-baseball-bat referencing of too many genre favourites to mention. After I've watched it a few times more for the laughs, I might watch it once more to see just how many I can identify, they come too fast and furious to get in just one or two sittings, but if you don't get at least a dozen the first time, you are something of a tourist in this territory.OK, so there are as many plot holes as there are clichés and if you don't buy into it or want something genuinely frightening (why?) it will come across as horror 101. But with some friends, some beer and pizza, it's hard to go wrong with this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not what it seems,"The Cabin in the Forest (2012)

Otherwise, Cabin in the Woods has no compelling story, no heart, and (most fatally) no soul.

If, however, you like to watch movies to think and feel in new ways, then this movie will feel pretty hollow.I cannot leave this review without bemoaning the unrepentant smarminess of flattery masquerading as entertainment.

"See what I did there?  (Yes, Joss, now shutup)","Fun and entertaining deconstruction of horror film tropes. If there's a problem, it's kind of like when a magician explains how a trick is done, which spoils the fun. Here, the horror elements are never scary, because you see the gears turning. We can normally suspend disbelief for 90 minutes and believe zombies are real, but not here. Second problem, Joss Whedon simply can't get out of his own way. He can't just do something clever, he has to stop every ten minutes and tell everyone how clever he is. It gets tiresome. So this is a fun ride, and often very funny, not scary, and the presence of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford is invaluable.

This film had no idea what it even was,"PROS: The one thing, if anything, is the acting. Although most actors were not too good, like with most large cast films, there were some scenes in which the acting was genuine.CONS: Holy moly where do I begin. I understand that this was supposed to be a horror comedy, but where was the substance?! I liked the idea of how the movie was supposed to make fun of how horror movies work, but the fear that was still supposed to be there wasn't. Important scenes were too short and not important scenes were too long. This was seen when the climax of the movie was 30 minutes long and should have been 5. This made the movies plot confusing and it made the build up of tension boring. The other thing that was really aggravating was the resolution. The final part of the movie made no sense and had no real conclusive qualities. This is a great movie for an up in the air ending, I agree, but the finale is completely irrelevant and so stupid.

Just what the horror genre needed,"Over the years, the horror genre, particular the 'slasher films', have slowly deteriorated, with the odd shining star now and again. Needless to say, many of the films placed into the horror category follow virtually identical plots, only differing in location and characters. The reason 'The Cabin in the Woods' succeeds therefore, is because it recognises this cloning of horror films and turns it on its head.The writers of the film took the cliché genre and made into something very clever and unique, taking many viewers by surprise and giving me hope for the future of the horror genre. The film wasn't riddled with scares and I won't be losing any sleep because of it, but 'The Cabin in the Woods', despite all its twist, is still a horror. It has blood, tension, killers and a nice dark, clever plot to glue it all together.To begin with, I found the film's concept quite confusing and, before realising what the writers had done, found it rather far-fetched. If anyone is unsure of what goes on in the film, watch it first and then look it up if you still aren't sure as it may change your opinion of it.I don't wish to ruin any of the story, so I shall finish by saying 'The Cabin in the Woods' was a refreshing experience, written by creative minds and featuring a well-formed cast, supported by well-made special effects. If any of you are tired of watching the same old slasher-horror movies, you will certainly appreciate this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Well made and worth a watch,"When the slasher-in-the-woods subgenre originated back in the 70s (with films like Savage Weekend), and then was made mainstream by the Friday the 13th series, the concept of a bunch of good-looking 20-something actors playing jumpy and screaming teens attacked by an often unseen menace lurking on the outside of a cabin, was fresh enough to hold its own suspense and provide scares in and of itself. Such days are long gone, however, and the makers of The Cabin in the Woods have taken the consequences of it; the premise here is largely (actually exactly) the same as in the aforementioned films, but to spice things up, there's a parallel storyline of a group of operators in a Nasa-style control room monitoring and predicting the teens' every move - and in a very cheerful manner at that.""Say what?"" you might be tempted to utter when trying to make sense of it all, and that is of course exactly how the filmmakers want you to react. This is the surprise element, and those are crucial to every horror film. The problem with this one is that while it is both amusing and wildly creative, it also negates whatever effect the storyline one could have had. Granted, the filmmakers' (Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon, who both worked on TV's Buffy and the spin-off Angel) hypothesis is that storyline one already is ineffective given the genre's history, but that doesn't really help us much.With a structure more akin to Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn, I believe The Cabin in the Woods could have been effective as well as a great display of creativity, but as it is now, it's a horror film for film students; a horror film speaking only to your mind and not your gut, which is much like porn speaking to your sense of morals. With that said, the film is all the way both well made and worth watching, and the unabashed, full-fledged finale certainly does the film justice and gives it an integrity which modern American films in the genre has been sorely lacking lately.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This well designed and executed blend of college-horror and Office Space works on a host of different levels and has a bit of something for everyone.Cannot recommend this film highly enough.

So Many Great Things But They Didn't Come Together for Me,"The Cabin in the Woods (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4)Horror-comedy with a familiar location (scary cabin in scary woods) with familiar characters (virgin, slut, pothead, athlete, brain) but with one major twist. The least you know the better so let's just say that five people go to a mysterious cabin in the woods and soon they're attacked by monsters. I must admit that it's been a very long time since a horror film made me think but that's exactly what THE CABIN IN THE WOODS did. I was thankful that I had a thirty-minute drive home because that would give me time to think about the film. It's strange because I enjoyed so much about the movie but in the end when the credits began to role it just didn't work for me. I thought all five actors were extremely good as were Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. I thought the special effects were pretty good once everything got going. I thought the atmosphere in the woods was very authentic and I thought there were a couple good, old-fashioned jump scenes that really worked. I even thought several bits of the comedy worked including the various jokes with the pothead. Even the big twist that I won't ruin was an interesting spin on the familiar subject matter. So, why did I enjoy the film more? In the end I just don't think all these different things came together for a complete movie. Yes, I respect the filmmakers a great deal for trying something new and I give them a lot of credit for not delivering your typical slasher but at the same time I just felt it went overboard in the final act. We're given an explanation for what we're watching but this too didn't work for me. I actually thought the best moments in the picture is when they go for straight terror and this happens in the woods as our five victims are being stalked. For the sake of the film I won't ruin what monsters attack them but they're very effective. Perhaps a second viewing would help. Again, it's strange to enjoy so much about a movie and not come away liking it more but THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is just the type of film that I respect more than I actually enjoyed.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Deconstructionist Horror film writen by people with a passing interest,"This is a DECONSTRUCTIONIST horror comedy a la Scream, without that film's style. The failings fall 100% on the writers, everyone acted their part well, it was well directed, I just didn't LOVE IT. It is an enjoyable, turn your brain off movie with really really clumsy homages that border on Family Guy levels of referencing other properties. ""Are you really a horror fan? Do you remember this movie? How about this movie? OR THIS ONE... We're going to throw you for a loop and add some foreign references..."" This wasn't written by HORROR fans, but NERD CULTURE FANS. While there is an overlap in those two fandoms, it's not as much as this movie thinks it is. Joss and Drew are true blue NERDS, they're more Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Comics people, not horror people. This shows.As I said, the movie was fun, but told from a perspective from people with a passing interest in horror. Think more fans of like Event Horizon, HP Lovecraft Cosmic Horror fans; instead of Zombies and Ghosts Supernatural fans or even Slasher/Psychological Thriller fans. As a result, what happens is this becomes a ""CHECK LIST"" movie, which they even acknowledge in the film itself, but it's one of those instances where you acknowledging you're doing that ""THING"" doesn't forgive the fact that you're doing that ""THING"". Like Family Guy's Quagmire character, just because you acknowledge he's a creep doesn't then make it okay to write him off as a 100% creep. It's like a priest making a Catholic Church Pedophilia joke... if that makes sense. Just do the trope, don't acknowledge you're doing the trope.It's a good ONE watch film, it's light hearted enough, and decent. It focused on being more GENERAL AUDIENCE APPEALING than, say like a Scream which had a decent General Audience appeal, but was clearly made for Slasher fans and making a black comedy light-satire on that genre. If the two writers understood the source material better, this could have been a better movie. Like seeing these two tackle like an original Sci-Fi IP, or even like their version of Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers done more comedic would probably be great for this team, and would probably end up coming out like Guardians of the Galaxy but more jokey and not forced to shoe-horn MCU tie-ins.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Genre-Gasm & Horror Love Letter,"THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) A Review by JP February 5, 2015GGGEEK-GGGASM I've been a devout fan of this genre-bending orgy of shrewd, cliché-exposing (& utilizing) elements since its release just under 3 years ago. With a sales rank like an offline used copy of Stephen King's novel ""It"", ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is one of the rarities people seek out for purchase in a physical format. Ginger Geek God Joss Whedon, creator of ""TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1996-2003) & director of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (2012) collaborated with Drew Goddard (TV's Lost Producer, World War Z Screenwriter, & this film's director), an unknown (& apparent horror aficionado) at the time – and under the veil of a simple slasher flick brought serenity (geek puns intended of course) to a basic concept, turned it on its ear, flipped it over, dashed it with a touch of nearly every category of film, and pumped-out one insane, intense, hilarious, grotesque, maddening, silly, intentionally-ridiculous social satire. It occurred to me while showing it to a reluctant horror-hater that this film had even more layers than I'd truly embraced upon earlier views. With few exceptions, the sad slasher sub-genre is reverse-endowed with a thoughtless equation that has filled both theaters & studios' wallets since the late '70s (right around my birth). There are few exceptions. This is one of the best.THE CAST IN THE WOODS (& BEYOND) The standard-issued castfor the horror filmwith the stereotypical whore, jock, scholar, stoner, & the ""innocent virgin"" worked well for the most part with: an overly-pheromone'd Anna Hutchison (TV's Spartacus); sexxxy-with-shorter-hair Thor aka Chris Hemsworth (Red Dawn)-who totally channeled Josh Hartnett from Halloween: H20 (1998) (though I am in NO WAY complaining); smirk-cheeked, Mochaccino, godly-blue-eyed (& bodied) Jesse Williams (TV's Grey's Anatomy); ironically-written*/often helium-voiced toke-stoker Fran Kranz (The Village); and perky-lipped, bright-eyed Kristen Connolly (TV's The Bay). Stud-strutted Bradley Whitford (TV's West Wing) & ""moves-like-Jagger"" Richard Jenkins (The Witches of Eastwick) finagle thetheI guess I could say ""sub-plot""(sorry, it's REALLY difficult not to drop a spoiler with this one) and the 2 suit-&-tie, HR-reported-daily fellows add worthy cheese & momentary empathy to balance this complex tale of crazy good facets I'm shocked ""Cabin"" managed to convince a green light from even Lions Gate Entertainment. No disrespect LGE, but if I chose to be disrespectful, I could cite a series of torture porn known as the ""Saw"" films. Obviously GGG Whedon's impressive (or buff-y) résuméor perhaps the highly-manipulative demonic invading his soulless gingerly, nom-worthy shell cast a spell. I couldn't say for sure, but I'm glad it got funded! Just when you think you have it all figured-out, *!!!!!G-G-Ginger S'Nap Slap Beyotch!!!!!*, everything changes. Information is givenwhen it is intended to be questioned.5G NETWORK Technically, dark lighting & slick cinematography by Peter Deming (Scream 2-4, Mulholland Drive) added to the gloom vividly which complemented the genuine fright it built oh-so-very-delicately. Considering the scope of this story, I sometimes forget just how under your skin it burrows. That's a credit to GGG & the Great Goddard. Yes, I can call him Great from one film. That should be the best indicator of how inventive & intriguing this impaling-unicorn of a gem is, but the 5-Gs can't take all the credit. Much like Hitchcock owes an immense wealth of gratitude to legendary ""Psycho"" (1960) composer Bernard Herrmann for the success of that film, the 5-Gs should bow to an intense, booming score by David Julyan (Memento, The Descent).DAWN APPROACHES I would love to go on for another 570 words, but I didn't mean to go this long. To close: at least 4-Stars-Worthy, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a love letter to horror, sci-fi, comedy, and probably every other genre in the celluloid spectrum; one of the most enjoyable gore-fests attainable (even to those who hate bloody films). One warning: if you have phobia(s)don't be distracted by the potential of it popping-up. It will.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012) - A Clever, Genre-Bending Masterpiece","Drew Goddard's The Cabin in the Woods is a wildly inventive horror film that flips the genre on its head, blending classic horror tropes with biting satire and a twisty, unpredictable narrative. Co-written by Goddard and Joss Whedon, the film is as much a love letter to horror fans as it is a critique of the clichés that dominate the genre. It's smart, funny, and often terrifying, with a payoff that's as audacious as it is satisfying.At first glance, the setup feels like a standard horror premise: five college friends head to a remote cabin for a weekend getaway. The group fits the archetypes often seen in slasher films-the jock, the stoner, the virgin, the scholar, and the party girl. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that their trip is far from ordinary. Behind the scenes, a mysterious organization is orchestrating events, manipulating the friends' choices and unleashing a series of horrifying creatures upon them.What sets The Cabin in the Woods apart is its clever deconstruction of horror conventions. The film takes familiar tropes-like the creepy old man warning of danger or the characters splitting up-and turns them into part of a larger, meticulously planned narrative. The script is razor-sharp, filled with humor and meta-commentary that never feels forced. It simultaneously delivers genuine scares and moments of absurd hilarity, balancing the tone perfectly.The ensemble cast is excellent, with Kristen Connolly (Dana) and Fran Kranz (Marty) standing out. Connolly gives Dana a relatable vulnerability, while Kranz's stoner character provides much of the film's humor-and some surprising insight. The supporting cast, particularly Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as the cynical yet oddly likable technicians controlling the mayhem, brings a darkly comedic energy that elevates the story's satirical edge.Visually, the film is a feast for horror fans. The creature designs are imaginative and terrifying, particularly in the film's climactic third act, where chaos is unleashed on an unprecedented scale. The special effects are top-notch, and the filmmakers clearly had a blast packing the film with Easter eggs and nods to classic horror films. From zombies to giant snakes to unsettling clowns, the sheer variety of monsters adds to the sense of dread and excitement.Beneath the blood and carnage, The Cabin in the Woods has something meaningful to say about horror as a genre and its relationship with its audience. The film's meta-narrative explores the morality of enjoying fictional violence, questioning why audiences crave these stories and what sacrifices are made-both by the characters and by those who consume such tales. The organization's need to appease ancient gods through ritualistic horror feels like a commentary on the cyclical nature of genre filmmaking and the expectations placed on creators.The final act of The Cabin in the Woods is a breathtaking spectacle, combining chaos, humor, and existential dread in equal measure. It's a bold and satisfying conclusion that avoids the usual happy ending, instead opting for something darker, more thought-provoking, and utterly unforgettable.The Cabin in the Woods is a triumph of genre filmmaking-a movie that works both as a thrilling horror film and as a brilliant satire. It's a movie for horror fans by horror fans, packed with enough scares, laughs, and surprises to make it a modern classic. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the genre or someone looking for something fresh and unexpected, this film is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Odd look at reality TV,"Kicking off with a strange prologue featuring amazing performances from Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, The Cabin in the Woods is a satirical take on the supernatural slasher genre.After this offbeat introduction, we're introduced to a group of 20-somethings played by Kristin Connolly, Fran Kranz, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison and Jesse Williams, who are on a Summer getaway in the woods by a lake, which of course is almost comically familiar.Once there it's discovered that the 5 friends' whereabouts are perhaps linked in some way to what's going on in the mundane and institutional workspace we see in the prologue.This is mostly an entertaining enough film, although on re-watch really doesn't hold much weight. Most of the film's joys are relatively consistently brought by Fran Kranz, who is playing a dropkick who chain smokes pot constantly, but who, in a lot of clever and funny instances is a good voice of reason for particularly Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison's characters. They are written as horny bimbos and jock douches to the nth degree, but many of Fran Kranz's moments help keep the film's overly sexualised nature in check.The film features an onslaught of recognisable horror icons and scary figures, such as werewolves, demons, giant snakes, flying monsters, and redneck zombies.They're all implemented in a somewhat original, fun way, with humour and a lot of gore.It's great for a one watch with friends, but beyond some various fun, but incredibly surface-level novelties, it won't go down as one of the all time greats.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror with Character,"Really good. Cool story that rolls steadily and gruesomely uphill into absolute chaos. Lots of surprises along the way. The old familiar bunch of kids in the middle of nowhere being picked off one by one, but that's only half the story. The antagonists, apparent and hidden, are threatening beyond any semblance of normalcy. To put it lightly. Way, way unique. Some of the scenes are absolutely mesmerizing. It's a great combination of futurism or sci-fi with horror, and even a bit of comedy. I smiled throughout. All the characters are identifiable and relatable.

One word to describe this movie: CRAP,"Because this flick got 7.1 ratings, I couldn't stop writing my first ever review on IMDb. The movie has no storyline, no terrifying moment. I begged for it to end, hoping for something interesting to come by. I wonder who voted 10 for this movie, probably this was their first horror movie. There are thousands of good movies that do justice to their genre. This movie is a proof that movies cannot be watched based on IMDb ratings. A classic like ""Drag me to hell"" has lower ratings than this crap. If you haven't watched it yet, Good for you, stay away and save your time. After climax, I was like what have I just watched?

Little do they know that there is something very sinister going on in the cabin, and soon they find themselves fighting for their dear lives.""The Cabin in the Woods"" looks a bit like a low budget film because of the harsh lighting and the way visuals are presented. However, it has Chris Hemsworth and Richard Jenkins in it, so it can't be a low budget film. Sigourney Weaver appears right in the end too, which is quite a pleasant surprise for me! As for the story, it is interesting and entertaining. The gory horror scenes are so over the top that they are comedic at times. It is a bit wrong to chuckle at these scenes but I cannot help it.

The ironic comedy detracts from any sense of thrill or horror,"SPOILERS are included in this review.Many people will feel that if they don't like this film they will be criticized for not ''getting it''.Yes, yes we get the point...this is a post-modern satire on the clichés we always see in horror films, but it is not a subtle or sophisticated satire.Any point in the film where there is a sense of impending dread, the scene immediately cuts away to the Austin Powers style organization who are setting up the events. This means that the tone is constantly changing from horror to comedy. In so doing the film has no sense of real dread required to be a thrilling horror, nor is the comedy sustained enough for satisfying humor.The film is original and fast paced, but only because it has no narrative parameters. It is entirely anarchic in tone involving zombies, 60s b-film monsters, sci-fi, satanic gods, a Dr Evil style organization from a James Bond film etc etc. Any film can be original if it willing to just mesh together every genre with no real thought for continuity.The thing that keeps you watching is largely because you want to find out what the organization's motives are. The problem is that the answer i.e. placating evil gods....is just too ridiculous and superficial to be satisfyingThe film is simply too self-referential and self conscious to be genuinely thrilling.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cabin the 13th,"Ignoring the obligatory hick at a gas station that they are in danger, a group of supremely stereotypical college aged people go on a road trip to a relative's cabin in the woods, unaware that they are being monitored by, and in fact, almost guided by, a vary vague, nebulous organisation located in underground facilities somewhere. As they read from some Necronomicon-like book, they resurrect the dead nearby, who then proceed to wreak bloody havoc, much to the delight of this unnamed underground organisation watching them, and several others like them all across the world.Is the film a joke about reality television?It is alleged that this organisation rigs things like this to happen every year, in various countries across the world, to appease the ""gods,"" and by that I mean us, the audiences who watch these horrors. If these so-called ""sacrifices"" are not made every year, the gods are angry, which would cause the world to end. Which indeed, weirdly, does happen in the final seconds, as the gods return to earth to ..... kill everyone? Then what? I cannot give this film a rating, because I cannot decide if I liked it or not. It is either a brilliant satire of horror movie clichés and the audiences who watch clichéd horror movies, or two disparate ideas duct-taped together into one of the strangest films ever made. Either way, it is certainly memorable, but I can't imagine that it would work well on DVD. This is one of those times when this must be seen in a cinema to get the full effect. I actually thought I had walked into the wrong cinema, when the film began with a pair of what appeared to be Homer Simpson-like workers walking through a plant. When the title appeared, in a rather inane font, at least I was certain I was in the correct theatre, but I was still a bit puzzled by it. And I still am.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as mind-blowing as expected, but a great twist on the Horror genre!","Looks like Buffy creator Joss Whedon has found a big screen playground all for himself!*I am making this as spoiler free as possible!*I was intrigued to see Cabin in the Woods, but not obsessed; unlike some people I didn't realise this has been in the works for some time now, and I merely knew ""it does things differently"". That's enough for me. I see a lot of films, an awful lot, and some times they start to look and sound the same. Cabin in the Woods is a Scream-esque homage to the horror genre, but less of a parody and more of an actual twist on the genre. Five young friends go off on a road trip to spend a weekend in a woodland cabin, but when they arrive they awaken evil and uncover the multiple layers of secrets behind it.It is very hard to talk about this one without giving away the linchpin of its originality. So I recommend seeing this, it is a gore fest full of Joss Whedon humour (seriously, fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity should probably check this out!) and has a punchy subtext about every generic horror movie ever made. If you are a fan of your horror films, I'm sure you'll pick up on this.Some might see its deliberate clichés as exactly that, clichés, but that is in fact the point of the thing. Is that in itself uninventive? Well, that's up to the viewer, but Whedon always likes to have underlying ideas in his works, and doesn't beat you over the head with them. While I wasn't blown away by it as the hype was suggesting I should be, it was one of the more entertaining and original takes on the teen horror movie genre.In a nutshell, watch and read as little as possible. This review cannot express what goes on, but I can say that even watching the trailer gave away too much! Perhaps when the popularity dies down, and it becomes one of many random horror rentals, it'll shine all the brighter.Not as chilling or jump-scary as Woman in Black, but fun, gory and witty with its originality.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cabin In The Woods is a genuinely good story but not as good as it is made out to be,"Overall, Cabin In The Woods is an entertaining film, but slightly cliché. The storyline is a genuinely good idea, but the way it is presented is hard to follow and at times doesn't make sense. I found that the first half of the film didn't really relate to the second half, and it was a little difficult to get into. It is well performed by the actors who took on the roles of their characters excellently. Although predictable, it does make you eager to see the ending. I found this film quite interesting and would recommend it to fans of thriller and comedy, but horror fans may be disappointed as it is not as scary as it is made out to be in the trailer, it is funny rather than terrifying. Personally I found that it was more comical than scary. It was entirely not what I expected it to be, both in a good and bad way. Some elements were quite ridiculous but this made it watchable. The ending was a bit manic and hard to keep up with as there were so many different people, creatures etc, and I was disappointed with it, it could have been much better. There were many intelligent twists in the narrative as the film progresses which made it bearable. I rate it 6/10 overall as it could have been better and is overrated for what it is, but is a generally good story.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun and inventive.,Just back from the cinema. I quite enjoyed this. I am a Joss Whedon fan and knew that this would probably be worth seeing and wasn't going to be your generic teen slasher. What struck me was just how out-there the actual story line is!There are many different film references and this film is hard to pigeonhole in any recognisable genre. The obvious main reference being the evil dead films. Then the Truman show. There are even shades of his old TV show Angel.This film is very knowing. It is smart and aware but doesn't try and bore you with it. It's also quite funny in a lot of places. Most of the laughs coming from the stoner character. Played very very well by Franz Kranz. The special effects and inventiveness with the monster characters are particularly brilliant. Go see!,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What did i just watch??,"When i first saw the trailer for this movie, i was in such a hype to see it that i knew something must be wrong. I totally fell for the techy-residentevilish music and after all, the cabin itself, and was willing to deal with the cliché friends-in-a-remote-place-get-in-a-life- threatening-situation-from-which-only-one-couple-manages-to-get-out- alive thing. So i, foolish enough, sat down with my optimism and played this movie. Boy, was i wrong.First of all, the thing that got me 'what the hell' was the comedy- horror/thriller thing. This movie just can't decide if it's a parody of some sort, or a real horror/thriller which it claims to be. In the first half of the movie we've got some 'scary' scenes in and around (and on the way to) the cabin, which aren't really anything more than something- ugly-pops-out , obliterated by absurd scenes from the second half of the movie, in which we get to see a royal rumble of mostly nonsense and absurdity, mixed with some short script fillings, since the script seems to be written by an 80-year old granny who suffers from alzheimer's. The script itself consists mostly of holes and the story was not clear enough, so the main plot is that you don't really understand anything till the end, but it doesn't feel like you shouldn't, it feels like whoever made the script did it by mistake.The techy-residentevilish atmosphere and music remained on the trailer only, so i suffered from major disappointment when i realized that, since it was a great turn on for me (i'm a great fan of RE franchise). The acting wasn't bad at all, all of the characters did what they were supposed to, to be casual cliché adolescents.For the end, a comment on the ending: Sigourney Weaver really contributed to this movie. It sucks even more. It felt like a desperate measure to include her, and it didn't work out. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

And a new classic horror series is born!! This is what Scream did in the '90,"These are the days we remember why we love Lionsgate. After collecting years of dust (due to MGM's financial collapse), the mini-major is taking a pretty hefty risk with The Cabin in the Woods, Cloverfield writer Drew Goddard's directorial debut. It only adds to the flavor that Joss Whedon (of ""Buffy"" fame) co-wrote the screenplay for the high-concept slasher that stars the newly minted Chris Hemsworth (Thor). The most difficult aspect of Cabin is how to sell the movie without giving anything away, I'm about to experience the same dilemma in writing this review While there is a pretty heavy turn of events, one of the film's twists (if you can even call it that) is revealed in the opening scene. Cabin begins in an office atmosphere with co-workers Steve Hadley (Richard Jenkins) and Richard Sitterson (Bradley Whitford) comically riffing on a project they're working on. It's the mysterious setup that'll engage the viewer until the big reveal. Simultaneously, the audience is introduced to the stereotypical ""teens"" that are about to embark on a journey to check out a cabin in the woods, recently acquired by one of their uncles. The two stories eventually collide into a bloodbath of epic proportions.The strength of Cabin comes in the playful nature of the screenplay. Goddard and Whedon play everything tongue and cheek in a completely meta atmosphere. The two take loving jabs at the genre, making fun of the array of clichés horror fans are used to seeing, all without it coming off like a Scary Movie sequel. But the true magic happens in the full delivery of the promised ""slasher movie to end all slasher movies."" It's hard to elaborate without giving anything away, but it should be known that Cabin in the Woods will become an instant classic among genre fans. It's immediate. To say it's the Scream of the new decade is sort of a misnomer - seeing that people outside of horror may not ""get the joke"" - but for those on the inside, expect a heartfelt and blood-soaked homage to all of the films we've grown up watching.Ultimately, Cabin is an extremely fun movie that's beyond satisfying, especially for those expecting some sort of bloodbath. And even though there's a pretty heavy amount of CGI, there's an equal amount of unbelievable practical effects. Tonally, it all makes sense when you see it.While Cabin in the Woods is a tough sell to the general public, we as horror fans can only pray it finds its footing. It's one of those ""gateway"" movies that'll open the world of horror to an entire new generation of film buffs. There's something special about this slasher that hasn't been felt since Warner Bros. released Trick 'r Treat all those years back (and unlike Michael Dougherty's anthology, Cabin is blessed to have found a loving home.) While I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, it's definitely the kind of project that will leave its mark, especially on younger viewers. And with Jason Voorhees nowhere to be seen (again), it's the perfect movie to check out on Friday the 13th",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining romp with smart twists and incisive genre commentary,"Just watched The Cabin in the Woods last night. I meant to see it when it came out, but circumstances conspired against me, so I'm just now getting around to it. For better or worse, I had some preconceived notions going in, but I wish I could have had a clean viewing. I do think my expectations affected the experience somewhat.That being said, the movie is a lot of fun. Right from the opener with Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, we get a slightly different tone than usual. How many horror movies lead off with amusing banter amid the tedium of a (somewhat scientific-looking) corporate day-job? And really, for me, this tonal idiosyncrasy is what defined the movie.Unfortunately, it also limits the film somewhat, but not tremendously so. Without spoiling anything (because I wouldn't want to pass on those preconceived notions I mentioned) the movie is excellently written, the cast performs gamely, and the dialogue is sharp and enjoyable throughout. Classic horror tropes are toyed with, turned about, and molded anew. This is all great fun, but it's also relatively standard for horror satire.Where the film almost succeeds masterfully is with genuine horror-- actually generating scares. As with Shaun of the Dead, weaving real fear into the absurdity often proves a struggle, though both films give a noble effort. I'll also point out that this is where that initial tone and my preconceived notions may have colluded with the movie's mounting silliness to hold me back as a viewer (I can't stop thinking of one particularly drawn out scene where a large number of people are enjoying drinks while another person is horribly beaten in the background--it's hilarious, but not remotely frightening).In any event, it's an entertaining romp with a few smart twists that serves as an incisive commentary on the genre at large, particularly the more recent convention of introducing a cast full of unlikable characters as fodder for the primary antagonist(s).It also strikes me as the kind of movie that improves under the microscope of repeat viewings, as you catch more jokes and collect additional Easter Eggs.This one's a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fresh Take On Modern Horror,"On the dusty shelves at MGM's studios lay ""The Cabin In The Woods"", the new film by ""Cloverfield"" director Drew Goddard and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" writer Joss Whedon. Although completed three years ago the project was backlogged due to financial difficulties at MGM until Lionsgate finally picked it up and have finally distributed it ready for eager audiences to see. At no better time either with Whedon's upcoming highly anticipated ""The Avengers"" making the risk of this under the radar release minimal and lowering the effect of potential damage.Explaining any of the plot would be doing the film a disservice, as it's jigsaw-esque structure is one of its strongest points. The basic premise however is five high school kids take a break to a remote cabin in the woods where their stay escalates into disastrously horrific results due to an unseen force, which may or may not be controlling everything that is happening. It's billed and sounds as though it's journeying down the same road that most teenage horror-slasher films seems to take but that would be far from the truth as the story takes all the conventions of which we've grown accustomed to; the slow build-up, the unnecessary sex scene, the stupid decisions the protagonists make which cause you to shout at the scream due to their choices and throws it all on it's head creating a tongue in cheek comical look at how horror movies have become.All the characters tick all the boxes for the traditional teen horror movie conventions. Dana (Kristen Connolly) is the sensible, timid student; Curt (Chris Hemsworth) goes along the typical jock lines; Jules (Anna Hutchison) comes across as the girl who craves attention, dressing in scantily clothes; Marty (Fran Kranz) is the stoner who brings the comic relief and there's Holden (Jesse Williams) as the sensitive male. Unlike other horror movies with these presets we care for these characters as they essentially start as five normal teenagers, the story forces them to fall into their caricatures, which gives them more of human, approach rather than the stale interpretations that other horror films do. Alongside the cast are two other actors worthy of a mention Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as a duo, comical double act, their role however is not worth mentioning as it's better to be experienced not knowing.What really makes Cabin stand out amongst the long stream of consistent horror movies is how it manipulates and twists the traditional conventions of a teen slasher horror movie and turns it into a useful and developed plot choice. No one exclaims how the situation their in is remnant of the films they've grown up with, breaking that wall between the film and the audience, the conventions are used to push the story forward and give reasoning forward. For example, why do the majority of modern horror films include and scene depicting sex? Why do characters decide to split up, allowing themselves to be picked off one by one? All these are answered and none of the reveals for forced or unnecessary, but well crafted plot points bringing a tongue in cheek style to the story without over playing it unlike films such as ""Tucker & Dale Vs Evil"", a small independent horror-comedy which goes for the same vibe and oversteps it mark. Cabin causes for a sly satire.Any reservations about this film are minuet but are still worth noting. Though billed as a horror/comedy, the film rarely reaches any level of terror unlike the brilliance of ""Shaun of the Dead"" but never reaches the over comedic levels of say the increasingly tedious ""Scary Movie"" saga. It doesn't particularly reach a happy medium, however it does stay highly entertaining from the moment the titles appear to the end credits. During this 90-minute ride however are small plot holes, which may bring a viewer out of the experience, but for a film of this stature a certain level of disbelief has to be brought in on the audiences part. The whole premise could seem ridiculous as it plays out, especially during the final act where the tension and entertainment explode to a high-pitched level, though the film earns that right and brings a unique ending to the film that will stay engraved into your memory for weeks on end.With all the low standard horror films that are streamed into multiplexes it's refreshing to see a project not backed with an adapted script or a revitalization of a previous film, which provides a tongue in cheek approach to the horror genre. It's not a particularly deep character piece; neither will it sweep up a large amount of awards at the Oscars. It is however a highly entertaining, tense, comical approach to modern day horror movies, turning the genre on its head doing something bold and fresh. This is a film made by the fans, for the fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ever hated horror film clichés? Check this out,"I was reading through the reviews trying to understand why some people would dislike this movie... some say the comedy and the horror stuff seems too nonsensical; others mentioned it was the worst movie they ever saw (I'll bet I could point them into really bad stuff :D); someone even mentioned this was a movie for Scream lovers... I disagree (I, for one, never liked Scream).Ever hated how predictable most horror films are and why it seems that the only way the plot works is because all the characters seem to be making an effort to get killed? Here it is not different... but it is. True, I don't think this is a movie for everyone, but it is full of redeeming qualities and, most of all, manages to feel fresh.If you're looking for a serious movie you should step back, this is not for you. I must admit that I loved the irony in the whole film; certain scenes will bring you a smile and seem out of touch, but it is a depiction of humanity that has lost touch with reality. And that makes it believable.If you love (and hate) horror movies, you should absolutely check this out. It's a good ride and worth the watch if you're not feeling up for a soul touching film and you're annoyed at horror films' predictability.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Even in the first 5 minutes it's stupid and not exactly about the teens going to the cabin. It's not exactly what you expect it to be, it's totally different. I admit the movie does have funny parts but it is not scary nor gory. I was sitting in my seat praying for the movie to end. I almost walked out but I figured after paying for it, I might as well of stayed there to see the ending.I thought it couldn't get worse but then it did. I was very disappointed in this film.

The Hunger Games meets The Evil Dead,"This film is a parody of slasher films and simultaneously it's a love letter to them.
The film is about five teens who go to a cabin in the woods where they are faced with all kinds of terror, which they unknowingly choose themselves, because Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins and a whole team of people are directing it all in a ""The Hunger Games""-like way for reasons you will find out at the end of the film. All the classic horror tropes are present, so prepare for a fun ride.It's a great premise, and luckily also very well executed.The ending may not be for everyone, but I personally liked it very much.

The Cabin in Cuckoo Land!,"One of the most overrated horror/comedy movies to come out in the past decade, 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a mentally insane, senseless feature length film.Director and joint writer Drew Goddard managed to stitch together a script which lacks any cohesive features and the lack of intellectual presence within the making of this film make me wonder if a bunch of low life school children were behind its production. At points in the story, you will think you have switched films, and then switched again...and again. Imagine a man going to work in an office. The man in the office is eaten by a cow.The cow flies to Mexico and becomes an assassin. He works for a sheep who builds a bomb and blows up planet Earth. This epitomises how utterly ridiculous and senseless 'The Cabin in the Woods' is.To briefly explain the synopsis for the first twenty minutes, five teenage friends - including 'Thor' star Chris Hemsworth - head off to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. After some apparent humour, Dana (Kristen Connolly) reads a passage from a book which prompts the release of herds of flesh eating zombies.The film doesn't completely fail as some moments genuinely raise a brief chuckle or two (as they intend to) and the finale, if utterly ridiculous - is engaging and there is good use of CGI in the build up to it.Ultimately though, it depends on your view. You will either love this film for its willingness to be strangely original and daring, or you will hate it as it makes little sense and its humour is strictly for immature teens. I am the latter.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

I wasn't scared in this movie because the only horror was the killings and blood. I personally don't recommend this movie if your looking for a horror movie with a good scare.",,Anonymous,Horror

Even though I guessed it quite quickly, it's still a welcome change. Unfortunately this is the only thing that I can comment on positively. The rest of the film is the standard formula; hot chicks, cool jocks and scary surroundings. They added a druggie in an attempt to add some humor, but sadly the humor was quite cheesy, very predictable and I rarely broke a smile. I wonder if they had pre-screenings? The movie also lacked any scare factor and that should be the basis of a horror movie. All in all a 6 for effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very knowing of horror history,"Over the past thirty or so years, the horror and science-fiction genre's of cinema have created vast armies of devotional fanatics, that they have somehow become somewhat powerful within the film making world. We now lovingly call them ""fanboys"", and as a public we view them as geeks. However, in the genre cinema world, their opinions, and attentions upon the minutia of a particular film, or film series, can sometimes alter the direction the film makers were originally going to take on the film. The horror genre is certainly one of these more scrupulously deconstructed filmic forms, perfectly illustrated with Wes Craven's Scream (1996 - 2011) films. But what The Cabin in the Woods does within this deconstructionist context, is to actually take a stab at criticising the level of involvement in the making of a film of the fanboy's, and their connection with keeping something almost uniform, such as if the ""conventions"" of a genre are changed, it becomes an issue for the gimpy-kids.Writer Joss Whedon and writer/director Drew Goddard have constructed a rather witty, and intelligent screenplay, that does everything within it's power to keep the conventions of a kids-go-to-the-woods horror movie. We follow five friends as they go to a remote cabin. They meet a desolate garage owner, who has no ""gas"". They begin acting within film- world stereotypes, and horror film images build. However, parallel to this action, we follow two white-collar workers begin their day at a production studio, pushing buttons at a console. These suit and collar workers structure, manipulate, and construct the horror narrative, making sure that every detail adheres to the set conventions.OK, so it could be argued that this is simply another criticism of reality television, and another apocalyptic view of our future entertainment. I would have to say that it is a little more complex than that notion. Whilst the films poster visualises a mechanical nature of this ""puzzle house"", the films secrets do not fully expose themselves to the climax. With many, many references to other horror films, - The Evil Dead (1982), gets the most - and a finale that will have horror fans delighted (if somewhat perplexed if they ""get"" it). The script is very knowing of horror history, and manages to maintain interest throughout, despite its more metaphysical concept. It's also good to see that Joss Whedon is finally getting the opportunity to flex his more cinematic muscles, instead of his usual relegation to television.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mess of overly contrived nonsense,"Two stars because I did finish it (regrettably). I understood ""the point"" loud and clear, but to regard this film as some kind of intricate, genre-straddling masterpiece of cinematic renaissance is insulting on so many levels. The Cabin In The Woods is pure convoluted junk. It's as if they couldn't come up with one good solid plot with which to drive the movie. So they utilize a caterwaul of plots which are half-baked and mostly stolen. Worse yet, the subplots that they actually came up with on their own reach a level of cheesiness that surpasses all but the guiltiest of cheesy 80's horror. Aside from the story, the script is fundamentally generic and blatantly melodramatic. The special effects look great, but everything else about this film is a God-awful mess.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't go down those stairs!,"You don't see many movies that combine horror and comedy, at least not successfully. The last one to really pull that off was probably Scream. There have been some films in the genre like Shaun of the Dead and Slither, but those focused more on the comedy and were not really scary. The Cabin in the Woods is a new film which has some legitimate scares and also keeps the audience laughing at the same time.The film has a familiar setup of 5 young, good-looking people staying overnight at a remote cabin in the woods. They're even the stereotypical characters you'd expect to see in a horror film - a jock, a shy guy, a stoner for comic relief, etc. But what's different is that the group is actually being watched the whole time. They're not being watched by some serial killer in the woods or anything like that, but rather via surveillance cameras by an entire company. We learn this early in the film so I'm not giving anything away here. The question that lingers through the film is why are they being watched... is this some sort of test? Are they part of some crazy reality show? Things begin to happen to the group that are straight out of typical horror films. So you also wonder why the people watching them are so okay with what's happening to them. In fact, they have certain control over the situation and are even able to make their own adjustments.That's basically what keeps you so interested in the ongoings of the film. Instead of just watching these kids try to avoid being killed like any other slasher film, you're watching these other people watching the same thing as you are and wondering what they might do next as well. Just like Scream, The Cabin in the Woods takes the horror genre and tries to re-invent it by doing something completely different. Both films show us what we've seen so many times before with a new perspective. In a way, it's like they're addressing the tired clichés of these films and showing that you can put a fresh spin on them.The one thing I don't get is why the early buzz on this movie keeps implying there are some big twists in it. Like I said, we know the whole time that they're being watched and that those watching them have some control over the situation. There's no big revelation at the end that would have fooled you or contradicted what you thought was taking place; that's what's necessary to be considered a ""twist"". But I will say that the movie is well worth seeing, especially for the final 20 minutes alone which will blow some people's minds. It's pretty much a horror fan's dream come true as far as the amount of action and monstrous visuals we're bombarded with. In fact, the end made me wish the film had used something better than what they did use to scare the kids with through most of it. You realize the filmmakers could have taken a much more creative route than what they had the kids running from. That being said, check this out if you're looking for a good horror film that breaks from the norm.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Another clichéd, conventional backwoods horror . Or perhaps not?","The title, the setting, the casting of the young protagonists, the one-paragraph synopsis  All these aspects and more lead to suspect that ""Cabin in the Woods"" is just another derivative backwoods horror flick like there are thirteen in a dozen. Five of the most stereotypical college students head out to a rotten cabin the deep forests for a weekend of booze, soft drugs and premarital sex. During the first evening already, they stumble upon a cellar full of mysterious old relics and – not so surprisingly – unleash a type of evil that relentlessly pursues and eliminates them one by one. Yes, admittedly, this does sound exactly like the plot of ""Evil Dead"", so might this just be another passable and uninspired imitation of Sam Raimi's classic and a truckload of others? Oh hell no, because this is where the genius of writers/director Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard enters the scene. One brief look at the repertoires of both these men is enough to assume that they won't simply deliver such an inferior and unoriginal cinematic product. The aforementioned description may sound prototypic, but the opening sequence immediately state clear that the overall film certainly is not. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" opens with two aging men in suits – wondrously depicted by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford – babbling about random irrelevant private stuff when all of a sudden and totally unexpectedly the title torpedoes onto the screen in giant red letters! Intro's like these make my mouth water, as you know you're about to witness something very unique and unconventional. The further interactions between these men, and apparently a fully structured prominent organization behind them, run parallel with the unsuspecting students' trip. They observe and manipulate their every move and even place wagers on how the quintet will respond to a next ordeal. Meanwhile, the script also exaggeratedly puts the emphasis on how clichéd the set up, in fact, is. Each character perfectly fits into a specific category of archetypes (the jock, the nice girl, the bimbo, the stoner and the black model student), they point out themselves that they're heading to an area geographically cut off from civilization and they encounter the obligatory foretelling freak at the last gas station. The bigger picture behind all this remains mysterious and only unfolds in very small bits. Of course I will not reveal the denouement here, but you can rest assured it's something entirely innovative and unpredictable (and this comment comes from someone who has seen more than 3.000 horror movies). To evoke even more curiosity, I will still add that whenever you *think* to have figured out what's going on, Whedon and Goddard slap you around the head with another ingenious gimmick, sub plot or piece of dialog. Even though the duo accomplished most of their previous successes in the fantasy & Sci-Fi genres (""The Avengers"", ""Lost"", ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer""), they demonstrate great knowledge on horror classics as well. The similarities with ""The Evil Dead"" are evident, but there are numerous other slick and witty references to genre milestones such as ""Hellraiser"", ""Re-Animator"" and ""Ringu"". Totally refreshing film!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Have a good time at the theater.I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. They could've taken this in an entirely different direction if they simply wanted to shock you at the end. Instead, they treat the film like a slow, steady reveal. In fact, the opening scene does not even feature the group of kids that we follow on their horrific trip to the cabin. Instead, it opens with the ""other"" side of this story and the characters who get about as much screen time as our heroine and her pals. The result is a cinematic experience like none other. The audience is fed bits of information little by little throughout the entire film, so you're always hot on the trail of this story's secrets. You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality, every time this plot reveals a twist, it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you, but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger.If you look around on the internet really closely, you will notice it's the highest rated Horror Movie for the past 7 years since The Descent. You will never see another Horror Movie like this...EVER...PERIOD! In the large array of god-awful horror films to be recently brought out onto the big screen and direct to DVD/Blu Ray, The Cabin In The Woods is a refreshingly needed milestone to the long drying out horror genre.

A wet dream for horror fans...,"This movie was freaking AWESOME! If you're not into horror, you probably won't like this movie as much as I did. This is a pure and simple dark parody of the typical stereotypes of the horror genre. Chris Hemsworth was excellent as Curt delivering one of his best performances in his career. Fran Kranz plays the typical stoner, Marty, who I personally think was the best and the most likable of the five teens.

Fun film.,"Here we have an imaginative story that offers us a twist on the classic situation of young people who end up in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Once you enter an unknown situation, strange things begin to take place and these are woven together with a powerful logic where madness is generated and ends when there is blood involved. The cast is compelling, the writing is imaginative, and the motivation of the characters creates fun. The ending teaches us that the fate of the world, to the extent that it is under the responsibility of idiots, guarantees absolutely nothing. It is a movie to watch and have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Somewhat disappointing,"I wanted so badly to love this movie but just ... didn't. I think part of the problem is that A Cabin in the Woods (ACITW) is seriously mismarketed as a horror film when really, it's never scary and I'm not sure it's even trying to be.I'm not going to recount the plot because either you know it or you don't, in which case I don't want to ruin it. I'll just talk about what worked and what didn't (for me).The concept was very clever and I really appreciated that the film was willing to go so far off the reservation. There is a scene of utter Lovecraftian mayhem at the end that almost made the entire film ... you WILL know it when you see it! The performances are uniformly strong and the film looks good and it's well-shot. I admired the film's ambition and attempt to deliver something we haven't seen before.That said ... I felt that ACITW was more of a gimmick than a movie and for that reason I was never truly engaged in the story. The traditional horror elements failed to deliver what I like about horror: namely suspense and atmosphere. And the ""twist"" was somewhat predictable, stupid, and full of plot holes. There is a difference between knowingly recycling genre clichés and actually having something credible and new to say about them. ACITW never really seemed to get this distinction, and as a result it came across as a movie made by people who don't particularly understand or like the horror genre.Part of the problem is that I've reached the saturation point with these meta-exercises and after a while it almost seems like a cop-out. There are plenty of horror deconstructions out there (Scream, Behind the Mask: the Rise of Leslie Vernon, Shaun of the Dead, etc.). ACITW is better than some of them, not as good as others. Overall though it isn't any more insightful or clever than any of these similar films.I really don't want to dump all over this film because it has it's moments and if it leads some younger viewers to seek out the first Evil Dead or read some H.P. Lovecraft that's a good thing. And it definitely has more to offer than yet another half-baked remake.But I still can't help but think that the filmmakers should've just made an honest to god legitimately good and original horror movie, instead of taking the easy way out - recycling other movies and painting it all with an ironic gloss. Again, that final segment of the film finally goes balls out and finally delivers something we've never seen before. It's a shame I had to sit through so much of the same old crapola to get there.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Your grandfathers type of horror movie.,"The Cabin in the Woods has been pigeon holed as a deconstruction of the horror movie, a retro-styling of the genre... it's neither of those. Cabin in the Woods is, basically, a joyous celebration of the every horror movie ever made. And nothing more need be said. ... as we have to get to one hundred words however... is it funny? Yes, oh yes. If you've ever watched anything remotely horror related you'll laugh until your socks fall off. If you're a fan of mametesque dialogue you'll laugh til your socks fall off and if you were ever hoping Bradley Witford would again reach the dizzying comic heights of season 2 of the West Wing... you get the point. Forget spoilers - the first scene tells you everything you need to know about the movie - forget the trailers giving anything away - who cares - this is enjoyment de jeux. Fun for the sake of it. Every ten or so years someone pokes fun at the cinema in a way that no one else has done. The Great Dictator, Zelig, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Scream... and now Cabin in the Woods.

Not bad - not great,"Having to watch this movie for a project I'm working on, I was curious about the reviews, love it or hate it. Or sorta like it and kinda don't mind it.It was disappointing to me, sorry for the rabid fans, I liked the setup and was curious about the two levels, one with the group that went to the classic cabin in the hills, etc. and what the reality is. I have to say it let me down, and if you rabids want to see a really good ""science goes wild"", watch Westworld, which has a smarter setup and payoff, similar to what they do here. In a way, the spoiler is very much a spoiler even when you see what's really going on. And then the finale with the you-know-who cameo is a cheap shot, really.All in all, it's a collection of all the past horror movies since Halloween,which changed it all way back and which stands miles above this movie with it's zombies, creatures, basements, etc. Simply put it's a collection of clichés all spun together and to me, a disappointing end. It could have been a lot better if the creators were a little bit older.What I really didn't like is the ending, there was obviously no real ending after using all the clichés so when you're stuck without an ending, use something that doesn't have anything to do with the original characters.It did $70 million plus $12 million in other venues so it did okay. But I just wished they came up with some real ideas than just tired old clichés that didn't really work all that well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't believe the ratings for this film... this film is a waste...,"This film is a joke. I think it's too far fetched on a number of levels. The CGI is good, as are the characters who form the horror element, however, they would have been better utilised with another script.You are left hanging, pondering.... thinking... how could that; was is occurring by those who sanction it - be so acceptable? (you'll know what I mean when you see the film)..And by the end of the film, the storyline comes together - and I think the reason this film has been rated so highly is due to the element of originality given to any revelations/explanations offered to tie it all together.That's all well and good, but really, I think the system devised to deliver the goods in the film was too complicated for mankind to realise, manage or control on any level whatsoever and what was delivered was so under par considering the script that you'r e left thinking... man, with the what was available (especially in the lifts) could have been so much better utilised!Additionally: *I didn't get the feeling that I was gripped by this film. *I felt no connection with the characters. *You didn't really have to think too much. You just sat there and consumed information.....and before you knew it, there was 10 minutes of absolute madness! (which was somewhat satisfying!) and then it was over with more a puff, than a bang!I just left the cinema a bit miffed by it all for the reasons:a) Was it really deserving of these high ratings? (I think not)b) Just because the idea has not been used before in any other film that I know of, doesn't mean, it's a great idea and this film is amazing.

Metalanguage in Horror Cinema,"Metalanguage has already been widely used in cinema, and ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2011) is one of the clearest examples of how this approach can drive the plot of a horror film.The film plays with the clichés of horror franchises and films while paying homage to characters, situations and events that occur in several works of the genre. The metalanguage is what sets the script apart, being adapted in a very creative way and with a lot of humor.""The Cabin in the Woods"" may work for the well-informed, horror-loving audience.

Excellent: 9.5,"Modern gore horror is terrible. This is a general rule that, unfortunately, too many films have chosen to follow. And they all follow the same rules, such as who gets killed when, what kills them, and how graphically it is shown. No film as of yet has bothered to ask why, though. Until The Cabin in the Woods, helmed by Cloverfield writer Drew Goddard, and written by Goddard and writer extraordinaire Joss Whedon. Together, they have created a horror film so fresh and original, that it, quite literally, manages to transcend its trappings and become a horror film unlike any other. The closest comparison is Scream, as it too told a tale of meta-horror, poking fun at all the horror film cliches while maniacally conforming to them. However, in a brilliant twist I won't spoil here, all the rules are turned upside down, making every other horror film seem pedestrian by comparison. Of course, all the elements that are mocked are present in full force. Sexy teens go to a remote location, get drunk, have sex, get killed in a predictable order, etc. There's the jock, the bookworm, the promiscuous blonde, the innocent girl, and the smartass stoner (the latter portrayed by Dollhouse veteran Fran Kranz). They find a creepy cabin filled with one-way mirrors, dolls and latin inscriptions. Of course, said inscriptions must be read aloud, and brings upon the five friends a whole load of blood and misery. Ultimately, past the unconventional story, this is still a horror film. There will be jump scares, blood, and sex (though only briefly). So, if you're not into that sort of thing, this isn't the movie that'll change your mind. However, for horror movie buffs, there is something for everyone here. Every single horror trope is mocked and employed to spectacular effect. Splitting up, having sex, reading ancient text, and warnings from old men are all here, and all have consequences that are, naturally, beyond our heroes' imaginations.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
MASTERPIECE,"The plot of the movie wasn't really interesting, because it looked like a basic teen slasher horror movie. Eventually, it was one of the most UNEXPECTED movies I have ever seen! The storyline was very well written, so clever and very innovative. The filming location of the movie was basic, just a small cabin in the woods, but I really liked it. The characters weren't very interesting nor well-developed and only some of them were likeable. The killcount of the movie was HUGE, all the kills were so bloody and I really enjoyed them. Of course it wasn't a really scary movie and it didn't had many jumpscares. In my opinion, it's definitely one of the most shocking movies I have ever seen and it has too many plot twists and unexpected scenes. Moreover, that movie has some comedic scenes and they were really funny those scenes. Overall, it was a really intense movie, especially the ending scene. Last but not least, the ending of the movie was EPIC. By the way, I really hope they're gonna make a prequel, because I loved that movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining and smartly written and delivered,"I'm no great fan of horror movies and in particular I don't really like gore, so although I heard good things about this film, it never really appealed to me. I'm not sure why I ended up watching recently but I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found. Although the film opens in some sort of industrial/clerical banality, very soon we are in familiar territory as a group of college students head off to a cabin in the woods for a fun weekend. Despite the warning from an old man in a gas station about the dangers ahead, they continue up to the dark old cabin, where they find some weird things – although perhaps not as weird as what lies ahead.The plot is bang on the genre tropes for a reason, and it does it very well. It is almost ironic that as a 'cabin in the woods' horror, it is pretty effective in how it works even though it is mostly meant as a pastiche of the genre. True enough it is not particularly scary but it is gory and effective in the way that so many of these things are. The contrast with the men in the offices is nicely played on many levels. I really enjoyed the linkage to modern horror films from different cultures, and the passive and humorous way in which they went about their job. I'll not say too much more than that, because although it an aspect of the film that unfolds from the start and throughout, my enjoyment was greater for not knowing anything.The delivery of the film is good. In the horror sections it gets the tone right, but also balances it very well with dark humor – with neither detracting from the other. The cast are very good at what they do. The genre horror cast not only hit their marks but hit them well; Hemsworth and Connolly play their roles well, while Williams and Hutchinson have less to do but are still good. I enjoyed the Ash-referencing Franz a great deal. Meanwhile Jenkins and Whitford in particular do a good job with their side – delivering with good comedy but convincing work. The special effects have a good quality of looking trashy but still effective – very b-movie.The Cabin in the Woods is not as good as you have heard – it is one of those films that catches a lot of people by pleasant surprise, and as such it probably got a bit more hype than it could support; however it is an enjoyable film which cleverly plays with the horror genre while also delivering a good genre film at the same time. The comedy works surprisingly well and in the end it is a nicely written and delivered film.",,Anonymous,Horror
"So, it's a parody?","The Cabin In The Woods (2011) -A surprise to be sure and a welcome one. I don't like horror films and only watched this to cross it off of Steven Schneider's top 1001 films to watch list. I have to say that where we usually disagree, he seems to have got it right here.Although it's very similar to 'The Evil Dead' (1981), which I assume is the intent?, it's actually made with a much better budget, cast and production values.It built on that story in a clever way, with an idea that was certainly very different to what I was expecting. Let's just say that it wasn't all about the cabin or the woods. It's modern, an interpretation of a horror, brought up to date. Although you've got to be pretty fu(k@d up to come up with this sort of stuff.There's no stand out performances, but Chris Hemsworth was obviously hot, as was Jesse Williams, which always helps to make a film better for me.The special effects worked well too, I certainly didn't find myself questioning them at any point.In some respects it's like a double episode of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (1997-2003) if she was having a really bad day, without her super powers.Other than that, there's not much more to say without spoiling things, but if I can appreciate it with no taste for the gruesome, then you might too.667.81/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Um, no, ""Cabin in the Woods"" is NOT a ""horror"" film....but it IS a great comedic satire.","First off, for those who have seen the film, or just the previews, and wonder why the uber-hunky Chris Hemsworth's hair is short when he needs it long for his current stint as Thor, ""Cabin in the Woods"" was actually filmed in 2008 and then sat on the shelf for three years due to MGM going bankrupt. And being a so-called ""horror"" film, it was never a priority. Alas, it finally saw the light of day, which leads me to my next point...Which is, well, secondly, ""Cabin in the Woods"" is not really a ""horror"" film. Many are giving it high praise for being a completely original entry into the genre, some calling it one of the best horror films ever made. And, well, sorry, but they are all wrong, as this film is not actually a horror film. It is a comedy and a satire OF horror films, but due to the concept, there is absolutely nothing horrifying about it. At all. Nope, not even remotely scary.Why is that? Because I've seen literally hundreds upon hundreds of horror films? Well, as that could be true, it is actually because the horror and fear factor is stripped completely because everything you see on screen is controlled.The story is simple. Five stereotypical horror clichés get together and head to a...you guess it...cabin in the woods which resembles the one used in the greatest horror film ever made, ""Evil Dead,"" almost exactly. However, it is no coincidence each character is a stereotype nor that they got pulled to this cabin in particular. Without giving the plot away completely, I'll say as much as you learn within the first ten minutes of the film: everything that will happen at the cabin is being controlled underground by a bunch of weird dudes, led by an awesome Richard Jenkins.So, knowing anything that happens to these five kids is being totally controlled, any hint of fear or ""horror"" is completely stripped from this film. Why is it being controlled? Well, to learn THAT, you need to see the film.That being said, the film is well worth the watch. Even though it turned out to not be quite what I expected, ""Cabin in the Woods"" is definitely an original concept based on horror film clichés deriving from everything from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Halloween"" to ""Night of the Living Dead"" to the early writings of H.P. Lovecraft. It has a good cast of stereotypes, led by the aforementioned (and ""smaller,"" but still gorgeous) Chris Hemsworth and Jessie Williams of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame....along with a COMPLETELY out-of-left-field cameo by a huge-named actress whose appearance I won't spoil.Hilarious in its self-referential and ""Scream""-like laughing at the predictable aspects of so many horror movies, this non-scary horror film satire does start off a little slow, but keeps the laughs and grins coming until it kicks into high gear as you learn the secrets behind the cabin and the film truly takes off into an extremely enjoyable second act with a sequence of such amusing slaughter, it teeters on being one of the greatest in history.So, definitely not the best ""horror"" film ever made, but definitely the best satirical look at the genre since the first ""Scream.""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Take a trip into the woods,"Cabin in the woods is a master piece taking the horror tropes and turning them on there heads.Taking all the monsters from past and present genres they are dumped into a battleground feel within the woods.Its not easy to pull this off, like Freddy and Jason proved, but each got scare time and never once made it feel over the top.Joss Whedon can take the stereotype of a jock, a princess, virgin, lower and pot head and give them layers you or I have. They really seem like teenagers you would find on a college campus.The plot never once felt lacking or needed improvement and there isn't a chance for a sequel to squander the magic of the first.One thing I can appreciate about horror is if the comedy works with the scares and it pulls it off in strides.

Then you have Cabin In The Woods – the new generation alternative genre film. I call this an alternative genre, because without being uncertain what it wants to be – it knows exactly what it is – it is a film that breaks the borders of genre and the conventional. The acting is surprisingly adequate and the cinematography is really up to standard. The special effects are good and the sets and costume leaves nothing to be desired. None of these are above excellence, but all up to standard. Then comes the plot. It is fast paced, unexpected and completely new. The story delves into human fear and more than just individual fear. It delves into a primal fear of the...well, you will have to watch it to see what I mean. Do not judge this film by the first 45 minutes. It is setting you up for a much larger picture to come.

I thought that because of the reviews of the movie, and of course friends telling me to see it, that it would be decent. It's beyond cliché. Everything in it has been done. There are thoughtless ""plot twists"". And the ending is pretty much resolved by deus ex machina. Literally. The graphics are neat but not up to the standards of a true horror film. The suspense is contrived. I suppose if you're 12 and you've never seen a horror movie before you might enjoy it. But I'm 27 and I have no time for such useless movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actually 6.5 out of 10,"Last night I selected this one without knowing anything about it. From the name, I thought it might be a horror flick. That was my only expectation, and boy was I pleasantly surprised.The beginning was unusual, businessmen underground. Then cut to college kids going to a cabin for the weekend. I'm like, how is this going to mix? Well, it does. Heh.This makes fun of all the cliches in a horror movie, and then some. There are gory scenes, but nothing like Saw and the like. Some good jump scares. I'm not going to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it.Rent it, stream it, whatever. Just watch this one. I'll give it a strong 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie even though it's cliché,"Horror movie of 2011. Wonder how I missed this movie. In fact, the subject is very classic and cliché. But it manages to attract attention. The movie is watched and finished without getting bored. Good thing I watched the movie without reading anything about it. Coming to the plot, a group of young people consisting of 3 boys and 2 girls are going to a cottage in the woods for a weekend break. Wild things are happening to them in the hut. As I said, there are all the cliches in these kinds of movies. The trashy gas station on the road, the weird gas station, the hut in the woods, the game of truth or dare, etc. But there are differences on the subject. I'm surprised how I didn't watch this movie.

Masterful horror experience,"One of my favorites of the type, gives me such amazing vibes! A very original story despite some similarities.

Don't be shocked!,"I have to admit, the reviews I've read here about this movie surprised me a hell of a lot more than the movie itself did. It really makes me wonder what most of these folks were expecting.Joss Whedon himself said that the movie is ""an angry love/hate letter to the horror movie genre"", if I quoted that right - and that's exactly what it is. It's not without its share of humor, but make no mistake - it's very bleak and cynical. It's almost like Joss and Drew Goddard are actually admitting that there's nothing new in the horror genre anymore, and coming from the guys who made ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" such a fun TV series, it's a bit of a bitter pill to swallow. But then again...given how often he's had his TV series canceled before they really get out of the gate (""Firefly"", ""Dollhouse""), I really can't blame the man for wanting to vent a little. I kind of wish this bit of film vitriol had been more memorable, but if it refreshes him enough to keep him creating, then I'm all for it.There's blood. Plenty of it. There's also some boob-age. So all you gorehounds and permanent prepubescents out there that are really to blame for most horror movies in the last two decades sucking so bad, you're getting what you want. Quit complaining.There's also a heaping helping of CGI, which both helped and detracted from the second half of the picture.Also, for those of you who hail from outside the United States, a fair warning: there's an almost painfully Western mentality to the humor, here, which might not agree with your sensibilities. And I don't mean that as an insult; I'm just saying that the humor might not make as much sense if you're not willing to see it with an upside-down-Hollywood kind of viewpoint.Still...if you like Joss Whedon's work at all, this is well worth a rental, at least. Any of the reviewers here that claim that it's the worst movie they've ever seen don't know what they're talking about. If they like horror movies, then they've seen MUCH worse, already. I know I have. And there's enough of the Scooby-Doo formula at work here to be almost comforting.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No Doubt, the #1 Film of It's Kind......","(Ostensibly, a common, ""B"", teen horror film.

All they care about is entertainment, which accounts for the high ratings. Unfortunately, when the audience sees the same stereotype played out over and over again in the same type of movies, it becomes reality. The filmmaker has a larger responsibility to its audience.

"Part tribute and part criticism of the genre, celebrating and berating the clichés with its humour.","Although I know Joss Whedon very well from reputation, the only things of his that are distinctly Whedon I've seen (Serenity and a couple episodes of Firefly) I haven't enjoyed, but I'm always willing to give him a chance. The Cabin In The Woods plays on the formula and expectations of contemporary horror films, pandering to them, rather than breaking them, creating a film that is comedy before horror - with only one genuinely scary scene. It's part tribute, part criticism of the genre, celebrating and berating the clichés with its humour. It's true strengths, beyond the twists and surprises that sometimes don't deliver, are the characterisations that it plays with. It's littered with great personality, particularly with its stoner character, played by Fran Kranz, and the reliable chemistry emitted from Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins. Its frequent satire alleviates the tension, making it thoroughly entertaining but not as intense or engaging as it could be, playing it safe in its self-awareness. While it's not quite as good as some people are making it out to be, The Cabin In The Woods attempts to be the ultimate horror film, and succeeds in some parts, if just in the mainstream contemporary-American part.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mind-bending twists and turns make 'The Cabin in the Woods' a must-see horror film,"""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a clever and thrilling horror film that subverts expectations and delivers a fresh take on the genre. The film begins with a group of college friends heading to a remote cabin for a weekend getaway, but as they begin to uncover the dark secrets of the cabin and its surroundings, they soon realize that they are in a fight for survival against mysterious and terrifying forces.One of the strengths of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is its sharp script, which is full of clever twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The film also features a talented cast, led by Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, and Fran Kranz, who all deliver strong performances.The direction by Drew Goddard is also noteworthy, as he effectively builds tension and atmosphere throughout the film. The special effects and make-up are also impressive, adding to the overall sense of unease and dread.However, the film's biggest strength is its ability to subvert horror conventions and offer a fresh take on the genre. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is not your typical horror film, and it is all the better for it. It is a clever, thrilling, and highly entertaining film that horror fans will definitely want to check out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought it was a new spin on the horror genre,"Just got done watching this film. Came to see all the reviews either are 10 stars or 1 star (loved it or hated it). I actually fell somewhere in the middle more on the liked it side. Thought it was a clever spin on the quite predictable horror genre and that kept my attention throughout the whole film. It was obviously completely unbelievable and ridiculous in a lot of ways but hey I can suspend reality for a few hours if you can entertain me. And this film did just that. There were some good kills, some good sex, some funny dialog, and of course a spooky ass cabin. I would of liked even more kills, more sex, and better dialog but hey it was pretty decent. My biggest complaint was the monsters seemed way too unbelievable and way too powerful. Who created these? Humans? Or the earth demons? Why would they not die? That was the main complaint for me.

Another masterpiece by Ed Wood,"It's mildly tempting to give this absurdest, incoherent, pretender-to-mythic-significance of a film the brutal review it fully deserves.

But my experience on this site is that the cotton-candy-brained typical audience member viewing films these days would barely or never understand any references providing meaningful evaluation. Very sadly, that's about 95% of average viewers.Spoiler-- It's a statistical fact that less than 3% of American are unique subscribers to Newsweek, Time, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, or similar publications, based on Pew data seven years ago.

not your average horror film,"Plenty of killings, blood and gore, The Cabin in The Woods is ideal for any horror film fanatic. Despite the unknown cast, except for Chris Hemsworth (Thor and Avengers Assemble) the quality of acting is superb and introduces the audience to stars of the future. 5 teenage friends wanting to get away for a weekend of sex, drugs and rock n roll. You'd of thought that this would be something simple, relaxing and fun, but thanks to two sick and sadistic technicians it is turned into a weekend of brutal killings and suffering.The five teenagers set off for a weekend in a secluded cabin in the woods. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no way of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of objects but when one of the women, Dana, reads from a book she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. However, there is far more going on as the campers are under observation.Kristen Connolly plays the role of Dana who is the more mature member of the group but still likes having a good time. Chris Hemsworth plays Curt, Curt is the stereotypical high school jockey that likes girls, sport and drinking. Anna Hitchison plays Jules, Jules is the ""dumb blonde"" who is young and ready to party. Fran Kranz plays the role of Marty who is the stoner of the group, he turns out to be a very vital part of the film although you wouldn't think that from the first sight of him. Jesse Williams plays Holden, Holden is also a jock but he takes pride in his education. He is invited on the trip in an attempt to hook up with Dana. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford play the roles of Sitterson and Hadley. These are the two technicians who are observing the group, there night doesn't end how they hoped it would.The Director of the film Drew Goddard, also known for Cloverfield, Lost and Alias has done a stupendous job whilst making The Cabin In The Woods compared to Cloverfield which didn't get the best of feedback. He has redeemed himself with the making of this film which is good because he has a real talent for directing horror/ thriller films.The Cabin In The Woods is now available on DVD and Blu Ray in all entertainment shops and websites.If you have not yet watched this film I strongly advise that you do.

Extreme violence ... but with a moralistic message,"Horror movies can be categorized in implicit horror movies, in which more is suggested than shown, and explicit horror movies. An example of an implicit horror movie is ""Cat people"" (1942, Jacques Tourneur).""The cabin in the woods"" is clearly an explicit horror movie, more specifically a slasher movie with lots of blood in it. It stands in the tradition of films such as ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" (1974, Tobe Hooper) and ""Friday the 13th"" (1980, Sean Cunningham). I have been told ""The cabin in the woods"" has lots of genre references in it, but being not a very great fan of this genre I missed most of them.What is interesting in this kind of films is:the composition of the group of victims;
the order in which the victims die.The composition of the group of students (the victims in slasher movies are mostly teenagers, about which more later) is such that most types of students are represented. There is a serious student and a party animal. There is a sportsman and a nerd. This principle of representation is very old in the history of film. It was already applied in ""The old dark house"" (1932, James Whale), although in that film it wasn't about different categories of students but different categories of the English class society.The order in which the victims die reveals a moral judgement that is definitely conservative. Persons that are sexually active die first, especially if they are female. Just like fairy tales (in their original, more rough, form before Grimm and Andersen) they warn girls against the advances of men. See for example a film like ""The company of wolves"" (1984, Neil Jordan). The difference is that slasher movies are intended for a the age group of teenagers, an age at which curiosity about sex is often at its peak.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow - something a bit different!,"Over the last ten years or so, so many horror movies have been labelled as 'genre-changing.' And most of them have been utter tosh - simply regurgitating tried and tested formulas, filled with annoying horror clichés and even more annoying screaming teenagers.Enter The Cabin in the Woods. I picked up on the hype before it was released and deliberately tried to avoid finding out too much about it as I wanted to be surprised.I was surprised indeed. It was actually pretty good. Yes, it's horror. However, there's not an awful lot of gore or scares if that's what you're looking for. Instead, it pays homage to classic horror films like Evil Dead and rips them off in a good way, while at the same time introducing a slightly new spin on the genre.It's about five teenagers who take a trip to a deserted cabin in the woods the come to a sticky end, one by one. Nothing particularly original there, but it's the overall package that makes it slightly different to the norm.I won't say too much in case you don't know about there whys and hows of it all. Basically, if you like cheesy B-movie style horror films and you want one with a different plot which pokes fun at the many horror clichés you've become accustomed (and possibly desensitised to) over the years, then give this one a go. It may just surprise you.I really liked this film, but, after reading various Internet reviews, I've found a fair few people didn't. Their criticism was that either it wasn't scary or horrific enough, or that they didn't understand it. A fair comment on the lack of gore and scares, but I think the point of the film isn't to make you throw your dinner up or have a heart attack out of fright - but more to try and make something new out of something old. As for not understanding it - yes, this one does take an ounce more understanding that just a maniac in an ice hockey mask cutting people up with a chainsaw. Pay careful attention to the scenes in the office style environment which are interspersed with the story of the teenagers in the cabin - it should answer all questions.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before...,"SPOILER FREE (mostly)Cabin in the Woods is a movie who's success depends largely on how much you pretend the core joke is funny. For me, It was funny as in smirk funny, but not really LOL funny. For some people, this will be a riot. For others, a stale shaggy dog story. I'm a little in the middle.On the surface this is In the Mouth of Madness meets Army of Darkness. I don't think it's as threatening a premise as the former or as charming as the latter, but it does burn 90 minutes with some occasionally creative touches. Maybe this is more Evil Dead meets Buffy. Is it SAW meets Blade? Or is it Event Horizon meets Big Brother? All of the above. That's the whole point. The ""monster's ball"" of mayhem sequence is probably the most riotous fun of Cabin in the Woods, but the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up. The ending especially is pretty flat. The rest of the film builds so much to it and it feels like Goddard and Whedon forgot that in referencing so much other material, they really need to write something good of their own. The whole thing feels as disposable as a Big Mac container. There was a better last 2 or 3 minutes instead of what/who they threw up there before the credits roll. Or they ran out of money, which is a possibility.You could do worse, but I've already heard this joke a few times and it was better told and more entertaining when Kevin Williamson called it Scream.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The definition of fantastic-concept/average-execution.,"I love the idea of this movie.Perhaps this material would have been better suited for Adam Green or Sam Raimi.It's very difficult to discuss this film without giving away plot-points, and I'm not going to do that.It had some comedic moments, which I enjoyed, but the film didn't come anywhere close to meeting my expectations.I watched a slightly average Aussy horror flick last night that was better than this, ""The Loved One's""(6/10), only without the hype.I can tell you that the idea of the film is a 10/10... where do you think the other aspects of this film sit for me to rank it 5.7/10?They barely tapped into a brilliant story, and seemed totally lost in how to finish this thing. The entire set-up of the main characters needs re-written and re-shot, and it really starts the movie off with a huge THUD. I think the ultimate explanation or 'purpose' of the storyline is a bit ridiculous, and could have been better explained away(as it so terribly was), or justified(another ""you'll have to see it' statement).This brilliant 'idea' will split audiences. Some will gush over the idea itself, but I believe the idea only takes a movie so far. Perhaps the films humor will eventually open my heart to give this film a re-watch, but not any time soon.Sorry I feel the need to say it,... this film is a little over-rated. Not a lot. A little. It isn't a terrible movie, but it also isn't a 7.3 movie either.. Perhaps my expectations here are affecting my score a little bit.BUT, I love the horror genre. I believe this falls into the very average horror category,.. near the likes of the ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" remake or ""Silent Hill"", and not like the posthumously honored cult-classic that we were told it was upon release.57/100You'll like this if you liked: Cabin Fever(slightly better), Silent Hill(about even), Cube(slightly better), Zombieland(better), or Dylan Dog(worse).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What I loved about this movie is that it goes far beyond my imagination and anyone else's!,"There are certain works of media in the cultural canon that cannot be discussed without being ""spoiled"", because the element of surprise is fundamental to their laudable qualities. Eventually, just by simple desire to discuss it with other people, everybody finds out who Keyser Soze and Luke Skywalker's father are, why Bruce Willis is connected to Haley Joel Osment and how Dr. Jekyll relates to Mr Hyde. There are also films whose charms rely not so much on a shocking twist but a sustained run of unpredictability. The very fact that you know there is something beyond the initial surface idea is detrimental to the full capacity of your enjoyment, and yet, if you didn't know there was a deeper level, you wouldn't be interested at all. Just as something like Takashi Miike's Audition isn't your typical romance drama, Drew Goddard & Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods isn't your typical slasher film.The plot certainly introduces us to some typical slasher archetypes though. We meet handsome, athletic Curt (Chris Hemsworth) as he's throwing a football out the window of his girlfriend, newly-blonde Jules (Anna Hutchison), and her mousy roommate Dana (Kristen Connolly). On the receiving end is equally buff, bespectacled Holden (Jesse Williams), and soon arrives their prototypical stoner buddy Marty (Fran Kranz). Curt's cousin has an old cabin out in the woods (hey!) and fittingly, they run into an aggressive portentous old man named Mordecai (!) at a gas station (Tim De Zam) whose warnings they ignore. But as you might expect, peculiar things begin happening as they arrive, and their nubile young fun starts to take a dark turn as they begin exploring the cellar. We are also introduced in the opening credits to two men in business casual (Richard Jenkins & Bradley Whitford) who have their own relation to the goings-on.I was going to say that I wouldn't spoil anything that wasn't already displayed in the trailer, and that's true, but now that I re watch said promotional clip, it ends up revealing WAY more than I realized about the film. Instead of talking about the plot machinations (which, to quote Jeffrey Lebowski, are ample), I'll talk about its tone, which is knowledgeable and loving towards its subjects. Even in the slasher genre, the ""cabin in the wood"" trope gives everything a distinctly early-eighties flair. Considering its respectful nods to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, it's fitting that Cabin's closest modern equivalent is Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, two of the scant few recent movies that remember that horror doesn't have to be grim misery, and black humor can be as effective to making an audience warm to you You can make the macabre fun without making it a geek show. The Cabin in the Woods succeeds in being a wild ride that keeps you on your toes as well.Also strengthening the film's overall credentials is the acting and characterization, which is slightly more nuanced and interesting than your typical slasher. A movie like Hostel or the House of Wax remake, the characters were horrible people who I hated viscerally but felt no sort of rush when they died. The main group of people here is multifaceted and genuinely funny in many spots (Marty especially receives a ton of funny lines and Kranz manages to sell them with vigor, managing to be a comic relief character who actually happens to be funny). Even if there wasn't a suggestion of something else going on here, it would still be the most watchable group of slasher fodder I've seen in quite some time. Apparently this was filmed in 2009, which is why Chris Helmsford had so much time to grow his hair out for Thor. Befitting the creator's Buffy origins, the entire cast is attractive but not egregiously so, which really allows you to focus on the situation at hand.For that situation I've given you but the barest of bare-bones plot descriptions, and I'd encourage you not to go reading much of anything that speaks to much more than what I'm dancing around. It's the kind of film that even casual slips could taint, which is why I raced to the theater and caught the first possible show, before anyone spoiled it for me. I mostly avoided that problem by talking about the film without talking about the film. The coldest you can get is the best you want to be, and unless somebody tells you, I promise you won't guess where it goes. I think the film's filmmaking strengths, from the great Whedon and his buddy Goddard (responsible for some of the most acclaimed episodes of Lost, incidentally), are great enough that even if you do have it spoiled, it's still structured to pack a punch as it unfolds, but man, if you don't know nothing', you'll find a lot to love. As a matter of fact, I'll get the ball rolling: The Cabin in the Woods is a typical slasher film, The Cabin in the Woods is as normal as normal can be.

"Don't Go in the Cellar! Or the Elevator, for That Matter. Or the Janitor's Closet.

We then are treated to all of the typical conversations and actions that college kids in these kinds of movies would seem perpetually forced to go through and that we've seen a hundred times before, until the movie reveals that these kids ARE being forced through their paces and that we've seen this a hundred times before because someone WANTS us to see it a hundred times.The big reveal in this movie isn't that much of a reveal. The film is way too well written to overly rely on a gimmick. It sets the stage in its first scene, and develops its conceit through funny writing and clever plotting, not through major twists and ""gotcha!"" moments.In our age of instant gratification, it's probably pointless to try to keep movie secrets secret. Discussions with spoilers are started on message boards before the audience has even left the theatre.

I watched it because i had just written my own house in the woods film. reminds us all how important it is to entertain an audience but not a film i will remember in the long term.The evil dead references are cool but just reminded me what a fresh film that seemed when it first came out. Now that we have had the post modern take on the cabin in the woods genre it will be interesting to see if anyone can now do the same subject straight.The Lovecraftian feel was interesting too. i find myself almost wishing it had been played dead straight for chills and not with its tongue in its cheek",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
In a category of its own-- and should be reviewed as such,"In an attempt to be objective, I have tried to set aside my personal bias of being desperately in love with past works of Joss Whedon when reading the negative reviews of this movie. Admittedly, there is a SUBSTANTIAL bonus to being a Whedon fan viewing this film, as it is thoroughly steeped in his style.The biggest critique I see of this film in negative user reviews is that it is ""neither scary nor funny."" My response to this is that these people are trying too hard to make The Cabin in the Woods fit into whatever mold they were expecting. It's not scary in a traditional thriller or slasher type of way, and for the most part it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. Instead, what you're left with is a film that engages you 100% in the story and concept in a way that I can only describe as hilariously clever and innovative. I feel that comparing it to the original Scream is unfair, as Scream's parody style is much more tongue-in-cheek than CitW's ""What if THIS were the reason?"" approach.So... hang on through the first half of the movie, if you think you've got it all figured out. I found myself feeling disappointed as I came to what I THOUGHT was the end, only to then be given everything I didn't realize I wanted in a horror movie to make it all worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enter the Realm of 'The Cabin in the Woods,"The Cabin in the Woods is not your average horror flick. Whatever preconceived notions you have of this film will quickly be turned upside down during the film's running time. Fans of the horror genre will do their nut with this selection, owing to the ubiquity of blood and guts, genuine scares and a bizarre supernatural finale.The script appears formulaic, what with scantily-clad college gals, the jocks, the token black guy and the stoner. That's where this film turns convention on its head: it is not what it appears to be. The brains trust behind this film includes the likes of Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (Fans of the horror genre may recall 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.')The stars of the show are Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison.The film kicks into high gear with expectations of the group of 5 college friends enjoying a weekend getaway in a remote locale. What happens there is beyond expectation. Horror fans will be perplexed throughout the film's duration and thoughts of 'The Truman Show' and 'The Ring' are likely to be conjured up.

Homage till it hurts,"Co-written by BUFFY's Joss Whedon this is a high-tech new take on the Friday THE 13TH scenario. The new - or not so new - element here is that the horrors visited upon the five hapless occupants of a spooky lakeside cabin are being manipulated by a team of technicians in a vast laboratory beneath them, not unlike the people controlling the island in LOST.The 'controllers' include a couple of faces familiar from THE WEST WING and (appropriately) SIX FEET UNDER. There's even a cameo from Sigourney Weaver playing a variant on her AVATAR character.Joss Whedon has a lot of fun mounting an elaborate deconstruction (I blame Wes Craven for this!) of the last 10-30 years of horror movies. THE EVIL DEAD, THE THING, THE SHINING - almost every schlock-horror you can think of is referenced. The (ludicrous) exposition at the end is - almost - a throwback to the Denis Wheatley era (does anyone, apart from me, remember him?).The zombie assaults on our hapless cabin crew are as visceral as anything in the SAW series or its many imitators; the frontier into 'Torture Porn' is approached if not quite crossed. Great pace, super effects, lots of make-you-jump moments (not too many make-you-scream moments: that's harder to bring off today), but THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is like an extended Tribute Show. It doesn't have that vital spark of originality that gave, say, DRAG ME TO HELL its extra ""zing"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
For true horror fans - Stay away from this stinker....,"Wow, it's not often that you see a horror movie with such a high rating on IMDb. And that is what got me so excited to see it. Even the best horror movies I have ever seen usually get an average rating of around 5 or 6 here, so this one with a 7+ rating HAD to be simply amazing, right?WRONG...I consider myself a horror buff, having seen countless movies in the past 25 years. But this movie flat out sucked. I don't care if it's supposed to be some ""intelligent"" satire, or a ""spoof on the horror genre"". It fails at being a satire, and it fails at being horror. If anything, this is more of an action movie with effects. Not a horror movie!There are a couple of gory scenes, and the make-up and effects are good. I imagine a large portion of the budget went into making the CGI effects. And I'm all for good effects and gore. But when the movie - as a movie, doesn't hold up at all, then it's all a waste. Most movies with an effects / gore budget lower than this one are also way better movies - because they do what a horror movie is supposed to do; That is, keep you on your toes, feel unpredictable, feel scary, feel tense. And the less you know about why and what is happening to the main characters, generally the better!The Cabin in the Woods does NONE of that. From pretty much the very beginning, you know what is going on - and it ruins the movie from then on. 7+ star rating? Seriously people?

Not what I was expecting...,"The Cabin in the Woods sounds like a very generic horror film. I mean even the poster looks very typical but, trust me, this is no ordinary horror film.The Cabin in the Woods follows five friends who go to stay in an isolated cabin but soon find out there's more to it.This wasn't what I was expecting. I expected a dumb, cliché horror flick but Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard made this into a wholly original and unique film. It starts off just like how a cliché horror film would but it turns into something really clever. This film manages to use pretty much every horror film cliché there is and makes fun of it. After constantly getting remakes and sequels, The Cabin in the Woods stands out and is such a breath of fresh air.The script by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard is fantastic. They picked out all the corny aspects of any horror film and used them to create funny and insane scenarios. They even used the clichéd characters you would normally see like the dumb blonde, the nerd, the comic relief. It's extremely funny, clever and unpredictable. I had no idea how this film was going to end. It's best going into this film without knowing any plot points as then you will be constantly surprised.The Cabin in the Woods was a very entertaining film.

I expected better.,"I'm not really into horror/thrillers like most other reviewers here. I watched this movie as a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work. I liked it, the storyline unfolds neatly, and all of the 'what the hell is going on' moments were duly explained. The special effects are amazing. So far I haven't found huge storyline loopholes in afterthought.But, I'm not seeing the twists and surprises everyone else is describing. Joss Whedon's projects are usually so original next to each other, and I kept expecting the conclusion of Cabin to blow my mind, and go somewhere I never would have expected it to take me. I found the ending rather predictable, and pretty reminiscent of another of Joss's shows. I know it's hard to create meaning and depth in 90 minutes compared to a TV series, and maybe it's not expected in a regular thriller, but the ending felt forced.Overall I enjoyed the movie, even not being a fan of the horror genre. There were no cheap thrills, the graphics were good, the genre references are appreciated. But it's not the work of art I was expecting.If you want a good horror film, or want to see some truly bloody scenes, then you'll enjoy this movie and it's probably one of the better ones.

What did I just watch?!,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. AshlandSo absurd, it works; with maybe the most shocking aspect of ""The Cabin in the Woods"", the new Independent Slasher film from director/co-writer Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), being how this intriguing film had been shelved for almost three years. Beginning as a horror film 101 story and then progressively becoming odder and odder, Goddard seems to have found a new angle in the genre, simply by making a film which is entirely predicated on keeping the audience in a state of confusion, all the while keeping the entertainment level high throughout. And I enjoyed nearly every minute of it. But as much as I enjoyed this odd little horror film, there will undoubtedly be some who will absolutely hate it. Hate it, simply because in the midst of watching the movie, there will come a moment when one must throw out everything they think that they know about the horror films of today; and almost shelve their belief, as it were. And truthfully, that sooner it happens, the more you will enjoy the movie. Maybe the greatest compliment I can give ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is that its wide audience appeal, while hard to explain, does definitely exist.Synopsis: Directly referencing Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", ""The Cabin in the Woods"" starts off as a pretty routine Slasher film, where 5 teenagers (one slut, one jock, one nerd, one pothead and one good girl) go on vacation to a cabin in the woods (for some reason). It then takes one wildly outlandish turn after another, until it erupts into its gruesome, scary, very smart, funny and (most importantly) fresh climax, that no fan of any genre will see coming. To give you an idea of what I mean by ""outlandish"", there is a scene where a unicorn actually impales a man; and it's played for laughs. Yeah, it's that kind of movie. In saying that, ""The Cabin in the Woods"", in the age of bad Slasher remake after bad Slasher remake, is one of the most original horror films/horror satires there has been since ""Scream"". Blasphemy, I know. But the fact is, aside from being a film that is punctuated be being released at the right place during the right decade, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a film well worth checking out.As far as the superb comic timing goes, it does work here on a very self aware level. And this self awareness (or continuous winks at the audience) are so well constructed, that when the violence and overt sexual references do occur, and the film becomes cluttered with satirical references that may be lost on many, the supremely clever sidebars constantly keep ""The Cabin in the Woods"" engaging.Side Note: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and consummate supporting actress Kristen Connolly have substantial roles in this film; as well as the always wonderful Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) and a surprise cameo bywell I won't spoil it. But the acting, excluding Jenkins (who is superb here) will not factor in on whether you loved or hated ""The Cabin in the Woods"", so this aspect really isn't worth discussing.Final Thought: I am not going to say that this was better than last year's surprise horror film ""Insidious"" or than 2009's seldom seen ""House of the Devil""; it's just different. And again, this type of horror film isn't for everyone. Some may find that the plot twists here so off-the-wall that they may tune out all together. In fact, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" will work more for camp horror fans, than for the blood thirsty Slasher lovers, pretty much because it isn't a straight forward Slasher. BUT, as far as satires go, it may only be a notch or two below a film such as ""Shaun of the Dead"". What I mean by that comparison is that, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" displays one of the only instances that show a successful horror flick, which audiences can laugh with and not laugh at.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

misleading reviews,"After reading several reviews and very high ratings, I rented this on demand for $4. This was nothing short of a ridiculous teen horror flick.

Whatever the case, they were wrong in all cases.My advice is to skip this one unless you enjoy loud silly creatures that are supposed to be scary, or watching less bright people smoke MJ excessively and act like this is actually funny. It's embarrassing just to watch. You can't even fast forward through the bad parts because it seemed like the bad parts occurred more frequently than every 5 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

A decent film but overrated...,"What Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have done here have had nothing on their other productions eg. Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Alien etc.. The film doesn't live upto it's 7.4 rating. The storyline behind the bloody Horror has the typical teenage set-up behind it, with the usual favourites for the characters: the Jock, Blonde, Nerd, Virgin and of course the one that often doesn't care (in this film it's a druggy). When teenagers are often associated the following are often featured too: drugs, alcohol & sex. Of course there has to be a scary set-up (in this case an old cabin in the middle of the woods) as well or it wouldn't be horror. The usage of mirrors is a clever thing that also appears in most well-structured horror's and in this film's case this one too. Death, is symbolised around the Cabin in ways through the painting on the wall and when the eagle dies as the group head towards the Cabin.The film for me goes straight into it a bit to quickly, Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard kill the characters off way to early and with the usual suspects-Zombies. It was predictable from the starting scene what was going to happen. I mean why did that eagle hit the invisible field/shield? It made the later scene with the motor bike jump totally predictable. The acting was OK and despite it's 7.4 rating I wouldn't of personally gave it any higher than a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Judge for yourself.,"""The Cabin in the Woods"" looks to be another of those divisive genre entries that either pleases the viewer or annoys them. It's really not as clever as its filmmakers would seem to think, but it does offer a fresh spin on standard horror formulas for people desperate for something different.To reveal too much would be a mistake; it's best that people go in not knowing a lot. What this review will state is that on the surface this would appear to be an ""Evil Dead"" type of film about five young people journeying to the title location and having to deal with sadistic zombies. But things aren't as they appear. Other eyes are watching as the scenario plays out.The horror doesn't work as well as one might like due to the nature of the script, written by producer Joss Whedon (creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and director Drew Goddard. Still, some genre fans may be pleased to note the level of brutality on display. There ends up being a ton of special effects and spectacle. The ultimate revelation of why this is all necessary is really rather lame, but the audience may still enjoy being taken for the ride and appreciate the way that the story resolves itself.The acting from all concerned is solid, with old pro Richard Jenkins a standout. The five main roles are clichés - including a jock, a stoner, and a virgin - but as we will see the selection of such archetypes is quite deliberate. Fans will enjoy seeing the cameo appearance by a beloved genre superstar.Some genre fans may feel that this film is condescending to them and dislike what seems to be hubris on the part of the filmmakers in terms of their cleverness. Others will like seeing what amounts to an interesting deconstruction of genre staples. It's best left to the individual viewer as to how well this works or not.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They can control the conditions of the environment, and Oscar nominated Richard Jenkins(for The Visitor) is the head of this mysterious experiment in terror. While in the woods, zombies appear, making the boys and girls stay rather unpleasant. The Night of the Living Dead meets The Running Man as more blood thirsty creatures arrive on the scene.

Cube Meets Evil Dead,"People are weary of the same tired formula that's propelled horror movies since the slasher renaissance of the early '80s. With this in mind, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard set out to pen something unique—something that would utterly shock audiences and absolutely lambaste the conventions of the modern horror film. With The Cabin in the Woods, the ably accomplish this task. The otherwise mundane title nicely hides the fact that moviegoers are in for an experience so unorthodox—and, at times, so downright bizarre—that they'll likely stagger out of the theater scratching their heads in an attempt to make sense of what essentially boils down to one hour and thirty-five minutes of unadulterated chaos.The Cabin in the Woods is a tricky little number to review in that I can't really discuss the plot in much dept because of the very great risk of ruining some of the more shocking revelations that define its second half. Still, right from the opening credits the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's trying something new. Viewers are thrust into a sterile setting that finds two lab technicians chattering about trifles that don't mesh with what anyone setting into their seats would expect. This is a good thing, as it sets the tone from the beginning: ""I'm going to be straightforward with you, dear viewer,"" the flick suggests, ""but don't think I won't pull any punches along the way.""After the initial confusion tapers, the standard horror routine plays out: a group of college-age supermodels descends on a rickety cabin in the middle of nowhere. They're primed and ready for a weekend filled with booze, drugs, unprotected sex, so on and so forth. They also exhibit the personas one would expect in just this sort of offering: there's a jock, a slutty vixen, a stoner, a goodie-two shoes who's hesitant to do anything remotely dangerous, etc. The usual hijinks occur for the next several scenes, and then we're catapulted back into the lab environment and given a deeper understanding of what's really happening. From this point on, all hell breaks loose (almost literally).While the charm of the movie's originality is undeniable—and it's penchant for juvenile humor is greatly appreciated—there's something a little forced about the whole thing that (in my mind, at least) doesn't elevate it to the echelons of cinematic gold that movies like Tucker & Dale vs. Evil are able to obtain. As stated earlier, Cabin is meant to vaporize all notions of the modern horror movie, and it mostly succeeds. Surprisingly, the complex nature of the plot eventually begins to backfire. You'll find yourself trying to connect dots that are much too difficult—or, even worse, can't—be connected, and there's the sense that a crucial narrative element is absent.In fact, I'm still trying to pin down what this is, exactly, and this is problematic.This can be forgiven, though, when the comedic-gratuitousness of the third act hits the fan. It's unrestrained brutality, our worst nightmares made tangible in the form of a brew-ha-ha that will leave you speechless. If ever there were a slam-bang ending, what we get with the finale of Cabin is just that.So, in that regard, the movie is a success. Still, there's the sense that it could have been put together just a little more effectively, and that might be what ultimately defines this fine exercise in reworking a genre that's suffered from tedium for far",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you go down in the woods today,"The concept is original but the screenplay fools you into believing you're seeing a remake. During a college break, Curt (Chris Hemsworth), who has practically halved since 'Thor', invites four of his pals to his cousin's cabin for some R&R. They declare the cabin to be 'beautiful'. The audience disagrees. We've seen Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' films. No sooner have they settled in, do strange things occur; things which would make rational people hysterical, but simply make these folk ask the searching question, 'What was that?'Here's the interesting bit: they're being watched. Not by zombies or other nightmarish creatures (although these do appear), but by ordinary people. It's their job. Think of it as a warped variation of 'The Truman Show'. I'll call them the Atrocity Bureau because that's a good name for them.The AB control everything within a several-mile radius of the cabin: the climate, geography, amount of pheromones in the air, undead – everything. The AB watch Curt and co. and then have them killed – by zombies, giant bats and snakes, and a whole manner of other nasties, most of which have been invented for this film. As they've become sanitised to their bestial business, they take bets on who'll die first. Why do they do this? Because it makes the Gods happy, that's why.The Gods were deities who once ruled Earth. They have this modus vivendi with humans which says that they'll remain dormant if the AB, Earth's oldest institution, every once in a while offer them a ritualistic sacrifice: human blood. Sounds like a great deal, if you ask me.The dark humour doesn't work; a straight horror might have been more effective. It's a stalwart first effort by first-time director Drew Goddard, though the tone of his TV associations ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Alias') is inherent throughout. 'Cabin' is TV-grade horror, which means it's horror without the roar.An excellent detail was to make the AB multinational. For once it's not just an American phenomenon. The East/West political subtext adds an interesting dimension. The main rivals are the Japanese, whose 'contestants' outsmart their AB. Instead of succumbing to individualism, they use solidarity as their weapon.I know you shouldn't judge a horror film by its discrepancies, but as no one is here to correct me, let me ask: Why would the Gods, i.e. omniscient, omnipotent beings entertain this unlikely arrangement? Are they Greek? It's preposterous, but that's not to say it isn't entertaining. It's entertaining alright; just full of absurdities and rather flimsy at the finale.www.moseleyb13.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as good as the ratings would suggest.,"I usually enjoy Whedon's work, but this film wasn't that good. I appreciate the point it's making, but the film just feels average. Yes, it does have an element of novelty and creativity. However, it is not quite as clever as it imagines itself to be. The film's main twist is revealed early on, and as a result, I felt disengaged with the story's protagonists. You'll be let down if you're hoping for a suspenseful or terrifying film; instead, the film follows the same tired formulas used in countless other horror movies despite its parodying nature. There's a clever surprise towards the end, but otherwise not much substance. In the end, the meta-aspect of this film isn't explored deeply enough-it comes across like a rip-off of other films that do a better job of delving into the themes this one highlights.Rating: 6.2/10 (Above Average)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Damn funny, original, anti-cliché, but not really scary.","The Cabin In the Woods is a truly humorous movie. Besides, it has so many moments of surprise, but it hardly would frighten you through the whole 135 minutes of movie length. It is creative, because except a few times, it won't give you a single clue of what could happen next, and that is what makes it enjoyable to watch from beginning till the end. Even the ending doesn't follow any Hollywood-sort of clichés that one may expect (which some could find boring and disappointing)Visual effect are just great and in-context. Monsters are funny which serves the line of humor running throughout the movie. The only weak point is probably the main actors' acting . They are not bad, but it feels like that they don't put so much effort in bringing the best out of their characters. I doubt if this was a screenplay problem as Josh Whedon's characters are usually very well defined and understood by audience; something that does not happen here (except for the secondary characters).In conclusion, The Cabin In the Wood is a very entertaining movie that is worth to watch, if you're not looking for something to really get scared with, and it's a good movie to own, as its originality gives you the option of bragging for your friend: ""I have a funny horror movie, do you wanna watch?""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very little scare, but very enjoyable.","Are you an Evil Dead fan? Specifically the movies? This is a love letter to those movies, there are even some scenes that use Raimi's camera techniques to *really* drive that point home.There is no 'Ash' character, but the spirit of the movies is here.

Terrible!,"I did not see the trailer or did not hear anything about this movie. I gave it a chance and was expecting it to be something like The Strangers or something like that.I was disappointed and surprised as to what the plot was.

Not your typical horror/slasher movie. Equal parts comedy and horror made this really fun to watch. I liked it. I say B,"""This we offer in humility and fear, for the blessed peace of your eternal slumber as it ever was."" When five friends plan a weekend getaway to a secluded cabin things start off as planned. While relaxing at night they hear a strange sound, when the go off to investigate all hell breaks loose. One by one the friends begin to get killed off, then things start to get out of control. I have to admit that based off the few previews I saw this was not what I expected. I did enjoy it and it was a fun movie to watch though. The thing that kind of depressed me though is that this type of thing may not be that far away from reality. While there is the clichéd slasher movie aspects in this it is not your typical slasher type movie. This one had equal parts comedy and horror. That combination may turn off a lot of horror fans, but to me that made it a really fun experience. If you are looking for a true horror/slasher like ""Friday the 13th"" this is not it. If you are looking for a good time and a horror you can laugh at then this is what you are looking for. Overall, a very fun experience. A comedy/horror that is worth checking out.

Meta horror movie,"As a horror movie veteran, I found this to be a beautiful experience filled with homage's to other horror movies such as ""Evil Dead"", ""Scarecrows"" etc. Movie criticizes how horror movies have become stale and predictable.

Whatever we say, everybody loves cliches if they are done right and nothing can beat the old ""horny campers and a crazy deformed killer"" routine. Anyway, back to the movie: The cast is great, story even better, movie is full of laughs and one of the 2 main characters is a pothead who looks and acts like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

Almost perfect.,"My ONLY gripe here is that I'd have liked the movie to be just a bit longer, if only to show us more of the monsters. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie.Five 'stereotypical' teens (well, late teens...actually more likely to be in their early twenties) go for a weekend away to the titular cabin in the woods, which was inherited by one of them from their cousin. The perfect, if super cliched, setup for a typical supernatural horror movie. What follows, though, is far from that.We've got a couple of Whedon almost-veterans in Amy Acker and Tom Lenk (of Angel and Buffy respectively), plus a few other recognisable faces, as lab-coat types, and an early (pre-Thor) performance by Chris Hemsworth kind of against-type as a not-especially-muscly jock type, Fran Kranz (another Whedon almost-veteran) as a stoner kinda similar to his Dollhouse character, even if only in temperament, and a few lesser-knowns (to me at least) in Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, and Jesse Williams.To say much at all about the plot would be to spoil the whole thing, so suffice it to say that you've probably NEVER seen anything quite like this outside of certain TV series, and that's kind of a shame.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing take on horror...Or horror/comedy,"What this is, is a refreshing take on the horror genre because of the twist in the movie. You can see the twist sort of in the beginning but you won't entirely know exactly what is going on until it comes close to the end. This takes the very generic aspects of horror slasher flicks and sort of takes jabs at it in a fun way. Even all the college students are very generic to the horror genre. The pop culture horror elements are in this but not so it can head in a very generic slasher flick direction. This has been done before but it doesn't seem outdated at all so far. But it all has purpose, well majority of it. I can't really talk much about this movie cause it can ruin it for the viewers. But what I will did find a bit shocking is how the movie is a bit more humorous than scary. It's not like ""Shaun of the Dead"" funny but some situations are so awkward it gets pretty darn funny. Now I wasn't laughing hysterically throughout this movie but the humor actually blends in pretty well with the horror aspect of it. What first leads to a generic slasher flick with all the generic slasher flick elements leads to much more. I rarely watch slasher flicks more than once but this one I might see again. It's a good thing the trailer didn't give much of anything away which is rare for trailers now a days.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Grand Fusion Of Lovecraft And Clive Barker,"H.P. Lovecraft often referred to in his books about beings called the ""Elder Ones"" which existed before man ever walked the Earth. He also mentioned an entity known as ""Cthulhu"" whose name could not even be mentioned by humans as they did not possess the vocal anatomy needed. By fully canting this entity's name, it would be awoken from its primordial slumber and begin to devour all life.In this film the Elder Ones are called the ""Ancient Ones"", and they have to be appeased from time to time by a ritualistic human sacrifice in order to prevent the destruction of the world.This film has some awesome special effects that has to be seen to be believed. The special effects are by AFX Studios, and close to a 140 people were working on these effects. The special effects really kick in during the last 35 minutes of the film, so if you want to skip to the special effects, just forward an hour of the film.The plot of the film closely resembles Sam Raimi's Evil dead film, but it ends up very differently. College students Dana Polk, Holden McCrea, Marty Mikalski, Jules Louden, and her boyfriend Curt Vaughan go to a remote cabin in the woods for a vacation. During the night, when they are partying, the cellar door unexpectedly opens and they all go in to explore. What happens next is for you to find out!The casting of the film is dubious, but the special effects more than make up for the dull cast. Chris Hemsworth the only notable actor is totally wasted(no pun intended!) in the film.Movies Based On H.P.

The stoner's collapsible bong,"This is clever not so much in the obvious way it is put together - self-aware horror laced with commentary on the process - but in terms of dynamics present in the work. We need to trace that all the way back to the authors in control of the thing.Three-layered structure is pretty ordinary these days. The base layer is a blatant Evil Dead scenario with teenagers spending the weekend in an old cabin in the woods. From their end, until a certain point, they experience around them the typical supernatural horror film, where reality is chaotic and reading out loud the wrong incantation in Latin means things go bump in the dark.The twist; a second level where things going bump are controlled from. This is where the audience gets together to hedge bets before the big screen playing our film, it's also the writers' level where plot and effects are decided, where all the clichés of the previous level are contrived to happen; the slutty behavior, the illogical decisions, the panic, the voices dictating action. There are many stations like ours we come to find, each one supervising its own horror film and similarly attempting control of the outcome. There is talk of another level for the Director. We find out that all the other stations have failed, even the Japanese (!), and it falls on our guys to see through their horror film.A third layer is ancient evil lurking in the bowels of the earth and imminent world destruction, you should know this is all effect.Now this sort of structure where an audience decides upon violence that we have paid to enjoy is so commonplace, last year it was the subject of the latest Hostel installment. There is little fun here.No, all of the fun is watching the thing collapse upon itself. Superficially, it is all about mayhem that comes from loss of narrative control. My ongoing project is a study of film mechanics, in the assumption that every effect and device in the way we imagine stories is semi-consciously modeled after functions of the mind.So it's important to me to get to note why this works the way it does. We'll need to follow this a bit more closely.Now the collapse is the direct result of something really contrived happening which the writers in control of the film either overlooked or could not solve; an ordinary plot point goes awry, the most predictable victim has made it through, and in the most outrageous manner, by single-handedly tearing to pieces an all-powerful redneck zombie.You will note this narrative glitch as an actual glitch in the electronics in the second floor. You will also note the stoner carries with him a bong, a bong that collapses in three layers to become indistinguishable.So this is the stuff that movies are made from, one of those purely cinematic illusions hat hinge their entire effect - a good time - on having you buy the most incredulous action - think Tom Cruise in MI4.And since the deeper drive here is a battle between chaos and order, between instincts and control of them, between a narrative and authorship of it, you should not fail to notice that chaos in the film runs rampant not because the physically impossible was achieved - stoner tears apart redneck zombie - but because the mind responsible for a coherent story lost focus and wandered.So of course the film breaks and all sorts of fragments from monster stories are unleashed. The collapse means a helluva time for the viewer but an end of the world inside the film.",,Anonymous,Horror

1/2 old horror flick +1/2 new treatment = Rodriguez style!,"Are you a guy who likes old school horror movie and want to take out a girl who likes the over-the-top-close-to-comedy horror? Well, if so, you got a date!If at the beginning we're not sure about the mix of old fashion and the «modern-and-digital» touch, the outcome is good enough to support expectations.Somehow in the spirit of reality show (I could not stop myself thinking about Truman show all the movie long), the least we can say is this is in the taste of the day. The old horror elements are well done despite the fact that some of the intense scenes (the fights with the zombies, for instance) are a bit too shaky (read here : we don't see clearly and the sound is in a «patchingwork» use).The last third of the movie takes a surprising turn and the refreshing effect of all of it worth the time if not the patience (I say that because after a while in the wood, you may feel that the movie tramples but what happen next makes you forgot (and forgive) about). And what to say about the orgy (not sexually) of freaky monsters (I don't want to say too much, just in case...).At the risk to repeat what I mentioned in the summary, it is in the Rodriguez style.

What our dreams are from,"Greetings again from the darkness. Well I was not ready for the horror genre to be turned on its ear, but that's exactly what co-writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (also director) have done here. Rest assured that your favorite aspects of horror films will be lampooned, or at least parodied. There are times you will jump and laugh simultaneously, but mostly I found myself checking off the influences/targets of the filmmakers.There is no way to comment on this film without offering up spoilers, and I will not do that. What I can tell you is that you'll be reminded of films such as Scream, Friday the 13th, Bubba Ho-Tep, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Saw, and dare I say, elements of The Twilight Zone ... you know the parts where you know there is more going on than you are seeing, but you can't quite put it all together.The movie starts out with a tongue-in-cheek assembly of generic characters from most horror films: the fun-loving jock (Chris Hemsworth, pre-Thor), the ""bad"" girl (Anna Hutchison), the ""good"" girl (Kristen Connolly), the brainiac (Jesse Williams), and of course the comic relief stoner waxing philosophical (a very effective Fran Kranz). This group piles into a borrowed RV and heads to the cabin. And yes, we get the obligatory stop at the run down gas station manned by the straight-from-Deliverance attendant played by Tim De Zarn.We learn quickly that something odd is going on and our heroes are really playthings in some kind of cosmic game being conducted at an underground lab run by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. That much is shown in the trailer and that's the end of what I can say. After that, the choice is yours ... just like in the basement.I have no idea who to recommend this to because the last 15 minutes are pure mayhem, and you will either be fully onboard with this Disneyland ride gone bad, or you will have wanted to leave for the past hour. The movie was selected for opening night at SXSW and it truly is a twisted, even demented jab at all things horror. Only you can decide what comes next.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's play on the horror genre that probably seemed like a really good idea before someone put proverbial pen to paper.From a curious start with, for me a least, a WTF the moment in Act I that I never really recovered from, the movie winds its way badly between horror, suspense and waves absurdities at us that even Monty Python's team would have felt too silly.But this is no comedy; no black comedy either.It's a film that really doesn't seem to know what it is or why.And that deus ex?

good watchable entertaining movie. But that's all.,"Although this is my first review it's certainly not the best film I saw.I want to write something about this one because I disagree with lots of people en certainly the critics.A week ago I read a critic review here in a Belgian newspaper which stated this could become a cult classic.

So I went to the theater and waited to be surprised. (I might also have to say Horror movie is my favorite genre and I already have seen a lot of them.) So, okay this one should be it, it should crap the *** out of me. So I was very eager to go and see this one.This film started like every teen horror movie I ever saw, full of clichés, as well as decor, characters, sound, music, as the acting itself. Or was this slightly better? Maybe but I didn't really noticed that. I was sitting and watching but merely waiting until something would really happen. And okay at some point something did happen. But nothing we haven't seen before.To say that the changing plot of this movie lifts this movie to an other level, yes OK, but not to the next level of 8/10. So for sure not to a cult level. It just becomes a average slightly good movie. Good entertainment but I never got scared. A good Horror should scare the *** out of you.

Thoroughly disappointing,"Unfortunately folks, it is not good news.

In a way, everybody forgets about the real world when endeavouring to watch a horror movie; to get lost in the experience. The movie starts out as your average teenager-slashing movie does - quite boringly. Quite slow. By the time something happens, the special effects annoyed me. The plot was extremely predictable up until nearing the end, when things became utterly bizarre and downright silly. Again, special effects make you question whether or not you are watching a Looney Tunes episode as opposed to a horror film. As you have probably gathered, I am not a fan of special effects. I take my hat off to every film maker who stages everything manually. Look at The Exorcist - thought of as some of the most creative and effective scenes in film making, even to this day.All in all, I give this film a 2/10. Mediocre acting, silly concepts, awful special effects, a pretty awful ending, a slow start, an underwhelming middle, I struggle to say anything positive about this movie.

It was very disjointed, which made the movie hard to really get into. It had its moments though, and the comedy aspect turned out pretty well, it wasn't too over the top as some movies can easily be.

Not only are there plenty of great scares to appease the horror masses, not to mention enough supernatural spooks to stock your nightmares for the next several years and blood and gore galore, but the entire movie is one epic satire of everything horror.

An innovative horror movie,"I thought Cabin in the Woods was an enjoyable movie with some creative twists on horror movie clichés wrapped around a decent horror movie.First, the movie doesn't just deviate from the clichés but actively mocks them, and this is what really differentiates Cabin in the Woods from its peers. Unfortunately, this is also a weak point in the film because it's hard to play so directly with the clichés without coming off as campy. This leads to some of the most creative parts of the movie coming off as comedic and taking you out of the suspense and horror of the moment.Outside of the twists, Cabin in the Woods is a decent horror movie. It doesn't rely excessively on gore and provides a mix of suspenseful and shock moment that keep you interested. However, there's nothing that really differentiates it from any other movie, and so anyone looking for a pure horror movie would be better off picking another film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The only reason why I gave this movie a higher rating than a 1 is because I give it credit for the sarcastic uses (satire), creativity and it's mockery for day to day horror films even though I expected horror. If you're expecting a real hard core scary movie, do not waste your time on this film. Unless you're fond of surprises, watch it.Personally, I thought the unicorn scene was extremely ridiculous. Was I supposed to be afraid? Oh of course, it's a sarcastic ""horror"" film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
I agree- Love or hate!,"I personally thought this was brilliant. I love films that have twists and turns and these I could in no way have imagianed.I'm bored by so many genre films trying to do the same thing, so love it when people have the balls to try something different.I won't be for everyone because a lot of people like the same kind of crap over and over again, but i'm Over that, which is why i'm In love with this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The perfect deconstruction of Horror... hilarious, tense, unpredictable, and entertaining!","I had been anticipating The Cabin in the Woods for more than a month. Why? Well, I only heard about it last month, and thank god I wasn't waiting for it for months or even a year like many others. I read the script as well, so I did know what I was going into. But I had to know the joy of watching this on the big screen. Boy, did it live up to my extremely high expectations.The film's opening immediately reminds me of a recent, but equally magnificent horror/comedy, and that is Drag Me To Hell. But whereas that film derived it's comedy from more gags and cartoonish moments, this one starts off with brilliantly written dialogue. From the start we see two guys dealing with some sort of task, and they must accomplish this task or else... well, I'll stop there. I do want to say that although this film is very funny, it also is pretty tense. The cinematography and the music especially drive the scarier scenes well, and they both do a great job of maintaining it's witty but also seriously-driven tone. People have said that this film makes fun of these types of films. In a way yes, but it's important to note that both Goddard and Whedon were able to come up with this because they love horror so much. Their love for the genre is apparent in all of the turns the story takes, but it's not a spoof. This film is meant to be taken seriously as a horror film. It isn't just here to ""make fun"" of the genre as much as it is here to reinvent the genre and to make it that much more exciting. It's a blast to see this much love for the genre oozing through the screen.Since everyone has already talked endlessly about the satire and about the expectations the film toys with, I want to talk about the characters. When looking at what happens, it's surprising to see just how much we do care for them. Not just the main 5, but also the ones behind the ""experiment"". Bradley Whitford in particular stands out, with many different traits that make him the most likable of the bunch. His comedic timing, as well as his sense of regret and sadness at times, is brilliant. When it comes to the doomed 5, they all stand out in their own ways. Kristen Connoly is beautiful, with the sort of angelic face that stems from a more pure form of Uma Thurman. All of the deaths here are well done and quite brutal. The character that surprisingly has stayed with me the most was the first that got the axe, and I think that the first attack/death is quite effective in it's execution. You aren't just watching how ""cool"" the deaths look, but in this case especially, it makes you desperately sad for that character. The acting from this actor in his/her first death is quite effective and haunting, and quite sad.The ending is spectacular, and as a whole was able to have a balance between witty and funny but also serious. The cameo is brilliant, and the final scene with the discussion is fantastic. People shouldn't be ready for a twist, because what the film does very well is hint at several clues throughout the film. There's never any real ""revelation"" or twist, but instead the viewer is strapped to more and more information about what is really going on. The final minutes are again, rather sad. I was surprised by how much emotion the film allows the viewer to have, and in these final moments of the film is when that is more evident. Again, the film works perfectly for what it's trying to be, but despite that it still works on ""feelings"" and to me that's what was most surprising coming out of it. I had read the script, but what I hadn't counted on was the amount of care and thought put into these characters and situations, despite how ludicrous and how extreme they were.All in all, definitely what I was hoping for really. I have not stopped thinking about the film, and to me it's pretty much the perfect horror film. I'm sure it'll remain among my favorites of the year, just like that little Sam Raimi flick in 2009 did. I never had any anticipation for The Avengers, but hey, bring it on!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good for a horror fan, bad for the non-horror fan","Saw ""Cabin In The Woods"" yesterday. Good horror flick, funny, gory, but not scary and not like Hostel and Saw. Highly recommend to the horror fan but not to the other fan, they will think it's dumb. Go see it if you like zombie monster flicks, don't go if you don't like those movies. They show way too much in the trailer, ruins the surprises and twists. I think the writers should have had more faith in the audience, especially today's movie fans. They will spread the movie's need to see like crazy if it's that good and this was that good. I would have had more fun if I didn't see the trailer, that's all.

Must watch for horror fans,"This film has it all, from an incredible cast to scares to an unexpected twist. For those who love a good slasher with fun and unexpected deaths, you will not be disappointed.The set up for this film leads you to believe that it is another regular horror slasher film of a group of unexpected young adults who will end up getting hunted by an unknown killer. To then be picked of one by one. BUT, without trying to spoil anything, you realise something isn't quite right.The script for this film is amazing, from the pacing to the lovable characters, which is also helped by the actors. Even with following some classic horror tropes it doesn't feel old or boring.This film is a stand alone classic that every horror fan should watch. You will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent comedy-horror flick with good build-up but disappointing ending,"""The Cabin in the Woods"" does start out with its requisite combination of campiness and mystery, but then a twist is quickly revealed and then you are hooked.

However, even with all the special effects and high action at the end, the plot development falls flat and does not really provide a satisfactory backstory to the twists.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

So, it satirises a few genres of horror films and does so within a greater plan, but the satire is not very clever.

Watch w/ NO pre-conceived thoughts & accept everything. It'll be fun!,"I'll try to make this short and sweet, with NO SPOILERS. ""A Cabin In The Woods"" is complete fantasy, with absolutely ZERO reality to any aspect of the top-level plot and circumstances contained therein. The fantasy story is told by way of horror, with lots of blood, guts, and jump-scares - and oh...one set of boobs. In order for the viewer to feel even the slightest amount of enjoyment while watching the film, s/he must accept the fantastic nature of the story and let go of all rational thought, curiosity, and attempts for explanation. If that can be done, and you are a fan of fairly cookie cutter fantasy & horror elements containing a significant amount of blood (and a bit of gore), then this will be a fun watch. That said - and this is evident after reading many of the negative reviews - if the viewer attempts to compare the film to another, find holes in plot elements, or connect the film to reality in any way, s/he will not enjoy ACITW.Some quick comments about the production:The acting is solid all the way around. While not produced with a super massive mega-hit budget, this is not a 'B-movie,' per se, and contains several big(gish) name actors and character performers. There are even a couple BIG name stars who either star in or make appearances in the film. The acting is what is to be expected from such a cast and is convincing, even if (intentionally) over the top at certain points.The special fx are good, with both live-action and CGI utilized. There are a few places the CGI is not seamless, but in my opinion this (kind of) lends itself to the fantastic nature of the film.Production is solid, on the whole, as the cast is fairly sizeable, the sets are keen, and camera work OK. There are obvious areas for improvement, but honestly, that was not the point behind the film concept.As for content, for those who care, there is good deal of blood and violence, a fair amount of gore, and a small amount of sexual content (ie, the token ""boob shot"").The story is a bit slow in reaching the point of action. It takes about 45 minutes of set-up, all grounded in reality, before the story begins rearing its fantasy and/or horror elements. In all honesty, since the viewer must have ZERO preconceived notions or understanding of what the hell is going on, the first 1/3 of the film could have been shortened. Granted, there must be SOME explanation of who the characters are, what they're doing, and why they're doing it, but there are several scenes that could have easily been cut. That's not to say it drags, as the viewer knows that 5 young adults are going to a cabin where some stuff will happen, but...yeh.It should be noted that I am a huge fantasy nerd - Terry Brooks was my favorite author during my teen years. The inclusion of fantasy elements made this very enjoyable, and adding the horror elements as a means for storytelling simply added to the overall appeal (for me). That said, and reiterating an early mention, in order for the viewer to truly enjoy the movie, s/he must let the movie ""do its thing"" and not try finding explanations and ""whys"" for every little nuance or scene. If that can be done, it should be an enjoyable romp.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A slasher flick with a creative twist and over-the-top climax,"Released in 2012 and directed by Drew Goddard, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a slasher flick with satirical elements about five youths who take a getaway to a, you guessed it, cabin in the woods. Everything's not as it appears, however, and total havoc ensues.Right off the bat, the movie gives away the fact that something is going on behind the scenes with the cabin, as if the kids are being set-up for some diabolical purpose. I liked the cast and the movie was decent, but I was a little turned-off by the set-up angle, which I'll leave for you to discover. I just prefer more straight-forward storytelling. But the ridiculously over-the-top climax won my respect because there's no way I would've predicted what was really going on and the motive thereof. So the movie gets points for creativity.While ""Cabin in the Woods"" is somewhat satirical, it's not a horror comedy. It comes across as one of the Friday the 13th sequels with some Scooby-Doo elements thrown in. Chris Hemsworth plays the alpha male, Anna Hutchison the (too thin) blond hottie, Jesse Williams the studious dude, Fran Kranz the burnout and Kristen Connolly the virginal main protagonist (the true hottie). Amy Acker and Sigourney Weaver have peripheral roles. The filmmakers should've taken advantage of Amy's magnificent presence, but they failed.The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in British Columbia.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good but overrated.,"The Cabin in the Woods (TCW) is basically one giant comical take on the horror movie tropes and clichés.I won't spoil the movie details, but in essence the movie has as main character the typical ""horror movie teenager stereotypes"", plus a secret set of ""scientists"" trying to enact a ritual to kill them through one of the stereotypical horror movie monster.Many monsters (werewolf, evil clown, zombies, Hellreaiser-like demon, robots, aliens, and the list goes on and on) make an appearance, often nothing more than a brief cameo, just to be sure to cram in there every single type of monster from horror movies the writers could recalls.It has clearly references to other horror movies, Evil Dead probably the most prominent one, seen the main setting, and all monsters re inspired by one or more horror movies. | So yes, it's a collection of cliché horror movie tropes, monsters on parades, but with a twist.In a way this movie is a sort of modern ""Young Frankenstein"". Yet while Mel Brooks' movie was a parody of 30's chiller horror movies, especially those produced by Universal, TCW is meant to be not only a sort of parody, but also a ""criticism"", apparently, on how the audiences are like ""the old gods"" in the movie, craving for more and more blood, gore, horror, violence, etc Yet for all it's (pseudo?) intellectual intentions, the movies falls a bit flat. This Horror/Thriller/Mystery (as it is tagged) movie fails at being really good at any of three. The scenes with the scientists that control the monsters break any real tension, so horror (and thrill) goes out the window pretty quickly. Even the deaths and the encounters with the monsters leave something to be desired. There is little suspense. Being that the characters are stereotypes you hardly care for them. Yes they are stereotypes on purpose, true, but it does not help the movie anyway.The comedy is not really present however I think some moments are quite funny or at least very ironic, which I appreciate.The plot, even added the discoveries made during the movie is hardly A-material. More like a good ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" episode, but nothing better than that.Probably, after reading thins you might think I am going to give a bad score to the movie, but I would give it a 7/10. In spite of my strong criticism it STILL is an enjoyable movie.I liked it but it did not live up to the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Admired the concept but the film as a whole fails,"I'm pretty disappointed about this film. The first hour was bland to say the least with only the scenes involving the two geezers in the white shirts making me intrigued. But even then, i felt if the humour had been turned up a little bit to much. When it came to the last third of the film, i began to love it. However, my mood fluctuated once more when it came perfectly clear in the last ten minutes how the film was going to end. The reasoning behind the whole concept of the cabin left a sour taste in my mouth.The actors in the film were annoying. The dude with the Bong was unfunny and wished for him to die first. My decree of death swifted over too the blond girl who spent her time futilely making out with a wolf and dancing around in tiny shorts. Yes, I know the whole reason behind the characters but this doesn't change my opinion. The main lead was boring and the geek was invisible for most parts.Another annoying factor is the use of the wrong killers. When I saw what was available too kill, i frowned and thought ' why the hell did they choose the boring zombies and not the monster with blades around his head.' But being in a Cabin, i suppose Zombies makes perfect sense.If you are expecting a typical horror film, then you will enjoy this and will most certainly become baffled about the amount of jokes being told by geezers inside a control room. Ardent Horror fans will love it as it's basically a homage to all horror films and will appreciate the ending.I can praise the concept and the whole idea but i couldn't help but wish they would take out the humour, make it broodier and darker, and create better characters. But then, i'm surely taking out all the fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Perfect modern horror,This film takes on so many horror cliches and uses them to the films advantage whilst also working as a satire of them.

Truly enjoyable,"If you've ever watched a horror movie, you've seen characters headed for their doom after making an obvious mistake and asked yourself, 'how could they be so stupid?' What if your job depended on that very stupidity? Better yet, what if the world as we knew it depended on that stupidity?Five college students, Dana (played by Kristen Connolly), Curt (played by Thor himself Chris Hemsworth), Jules (played by Anna Hutchison), Marty (played by Fran Kranz) and Holden (played by Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams) are all packed and ready for some much needed rest and relaxation in a remote cabin in the woods (I know, the title was no help in predicting that). Separately, two men in a corporate facility whose nature is not fully explained are gearing up for a series of operations taking place worldwide and one happening domestically that determines the future of their employment. While en route to their secluded cabin, our college students stop for gas and are more than moderately spooked by the station attendant who tells them that tragedies have befallen more than one of the previous owners. Still they press on and the attendant, Mordecai (played by Tim de Zarn) relays that to the two men in the corporate facility (played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) while they laugh at the man's ghoulish demeanor which he maintains long after the collegians depart.There's a good deal more to this story, but to reveal any more would give away too much. What I can tell you is that I enjoyed this movie immensely. The relatively unknown cast members serve their purpose and the more accomplished professionals, namely Whitford, Jenkins, and a largely unseen Sigourney Weaver add an entirely different dimension to a film that might otherwise be cookie-cutter from its inception. If you enjoy horror or enjoy a good parody, you will enjoy The Cabin the Woods.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Must watch for horror fans,"First thing I really liked about this movie are the Taglines. viz. 'If something is chasing you... split up'... 'If an old man warns you not to go there... make fun of him'.They use all the clichés in a movie in this genre and creates a question in the viewers mind. Why would they do that? Thats the last possible thing I would do. This got me really interested in the movie and so I think got others too.Now, the movie has all the stereotypes of a horror movie of this genre. Has the same setup. 5 teenagers go to a deserted cabin to spend their holiday. An old man at a gas station warns them not to go there. They ignore it and start to go there. Then the movie starts taking a different path. Starts showing a bigger conspiracy in the ways things are shaping up. This is what will get the user glued to the movie. They manage to keep this mystery build up till the end. You manage to guess a little but some things still won't make sense till the climax scene where all the big explanation takes place.The movie obviously doesn't have any great acting and no character building, but thats how it was supposed to be. If they put any great actors with lot of back story in it, then the whole point of the movie will vanish. The mockery on the actions of a character in a movie like this wouldn't be there anymore.

A Sledgehammer Of Self-Satisfying Satire,"Overly ambitious Horror homage that is an overkill of ideas and is amazingly not entertaining considering that the Writer was the talent behind the excellent TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Familiar and one of my favorite stories.,"When the horror genre has ceased to please the audience with new villains and plots in different time release of the film pays homage to the recognized classics. Walk through the history of such horror. In 1986 came even three of the film ""Fright Night"" by Tom Holland, ""Re- Animator"" Gordon Stewart and ""Return of the Living Dead"" by Dan O'Bannon. In 1986 ""Fright Night"" won the Saturn as the best horror movie surpassing its competitors. It was filmed as though for fans of Dracula and vampire movies. Complied with all the canons and with a hilarious comedy with cool special effects. ""Re-Animator"" was a modern look at the history of ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is the most controversial film of all three continued the story of ""night"" and Dawn of the Living Dead ""in a humorous style. 1996 was the year of the movie ""Scream"" to use a cliché, ""Halloween"" and the most overrated horror film in the history of the ""Friday the 13th."" He was dedicated to all fans of the genre of slasher and turns of the canons of the genre inside out and this has become so popular in his day .. In 1999, the Department released Robert Rodriguez with the story plot of ""Body Snatchers."" In 1998 ""The Lost Boys"" is also about vampires. In 2010, ""Drag Me to Hell,"" with references to ""Zloveyschim dead,"" but the film was a curse. By the way director Sam Raimi produced remake of the Japanese ""curse."" It turned out bad.""Cabin in the Woods"" pays tribute to the classic ""dead Zloveyschie"" Sam Raimi. One of the coolest horror films for innovative photography and special effects. And Bruce Campbell, tough guy. But in fact, in contrast to the ""Scream"" Wes Craven's here we see very different techniques. The first 20 minutes of the film is an introduction to the style of ""Zloveyschih dead."" Teens go to the forest to the damn cabin. They are talking. Mention of the map and the road, or rather the fact that there is no road map. Just as in «Evil dead». They come back, start to come off in full, then find the basement, there a book that certainly is cursed. As in the movie Raimi one character out of five said that it is not worth reading, the more so in this book and it is written. Characters receive a warning about the dangers and still read! This is so stupid you say, but you would not have done? It's the same as a teenager in the 80's sitting in a movie theater watching ""Halloween"" to say: ""Do not go there, you were waiting for a maniac! Damn well why did you go here! »: Facepalm: In parallel, they are being watched workers underground research center, controlling the situation by pressing any buttons. Their goal to teenagers died and died spectacularly. Yes they are, and they are also an Image. Center employee laughing, discussing everything that makes teenagers and how they are being killed, and those trying to escape. This is an unusual story, this fact has not been anywhere, in any horror movie. All the colorful characters, dialogues through in many ways I'm sure Joss Whedon is very interesting. In his script characters always look like a family - Avengers, Mission Sererniti, Toy Story. It can create an interesting dialogue between them and then he did a great job.After the entry is a different horror movie, nothing to do with ""Zloveyschimi dead."" Lots of blood, there is nudity, good special effects, even though the computer is not much. There is a scene making fun of clichés of the genre of horror. They are not as many as we would like, but they are very clever and most importantly - the end of the movie, you just will not know how it will end until the inspection up to the galleries. This is the first film for the whole year which is really fun to watch. And I was thinking that ""Battleship"" in no way inferior to the stupidity of ""Pearl Harbor,"" that's all I see this year. Horror genre could again surprise and Joss Whedon to pair with Drew Goddard proved almost as well as Wace Craven 6 years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
From the 12 year old mentality of Joss comes Cliché the Movie,"At this point a condescendingly ironic movie about genres is a cliché in itself. Joss Whedon & company take every cliché you have seen in horror movies & make a loud, unfunny ""wink wink"" to nerds who apparently can't get enough drugs, boobs or blood. Commenting on the mythology, spook stories and slasher clichés does not forgive rehashing it with bad dialogue. The twist *SPOILER* of the movie is nothing new. Night Dreams is a far superior porn movie with the exact same type of questioning of reality that Philip K. Dick novels explore. Cold observers studying people and and recording the results for us in the audience. The Scream movies were at least funny and stuck to one type of horror cliché. They throw everything at the audience with a loud thud to make you jump from surprise not out of any honestly earned horror. It was cute to see a unicorn or merman but the blandness stifled a laugh.

Modern Thriller,"Cabin in the Woods adds a modern twist to the classic 'chase them down' thriller by dabbling with aspects of both horror and comedy. The plotline progresses proportionately and quickly, leaving no time to leave the viewer wondering about what happens next. Although predictable, the movie's plot lays thick and true, backed up by above par performances. The aspect of horror differs from other supernatural elemental horrors by the way of premeditated purpose rather than random misfortune. However much the plot rises throughout the course of the film, it falls drastically towards the climax by giving a much expected conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Cabin in the Woods is a neat and interesting homage, not only to the horror genre, but also to its loyal fans","The Cabin in The Woods is the directorial debut of screenwriter Drew Goddard, responsible for the scripts for the sci-fi Cloverfield (2008), in addition to a dozen episodes of successful series, such as Lost and Alias. Goddard's direction (another infamous reference?) doesn't stand out, but it doesn't compromise either - although it owes a little more style. The main highlight of the production is the efficient script (also by Goddard, in partnership with Joss Whedon, director of The Avengers), loaded with homages and references - clearly at this point the cinematographic baggage of the spectator weighs, after all, recognizing these references is a good part of fun. But even these metalinguistic guidelines of the script aren't all that original; just to illustrate, in addition to the comic series Scary Movie, the concept had already been well explored in at least two moments - in Scream (1996) and Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006).The plot develops on two simultaneous fronts, the first of which is the expected parade of clichés and references: a group of handsome young people looking for sex and fun in a cabin in the middle of nowhere and who end up being attacked by zombies - a kind of mini -Remake of The Devil's Death. On the second front, a team of scientists ""mechanically"" manipulates the unfolding of the first, causing young people to make all sorts of classic horror movie mistakes and consequently end up dead - their ""sacrifice"" should calm the spirits of ancient creatures. And gigantic ones that once dominated the planet. But of course, something doesn't quite go right and the result is a wild death fest as the surviving couple (and their ""persecutors"") meet the scientists. At the moment there is a true revival of characters that have marked the genre, they are all kinds of monsters: vampires, werewolves, undead, Japanese ghosts, killer clowns, giant snakes, cenobites, etc... The CGI of some creatures can even bother the most demanding, but it is something that ends up being overlooked when we understand the fun proposal of the production.The script plays with metalanguage and makes fun of horror conventions. Precisely for this reason, the spectator is the victim of a prank. It feels like you're about to see the same movie you've watched countless times, but little by little we discover that nothing is quite the way we imagined it. The characters are real puppets and are manipulated to give what the audience is used to. Even the nudity, which is always so criticized by the public (and adored by another important part), is the butt of the script's jokes. After starring in a chilling combo with a kiss with a stuffed wolf and a (almost) striptease, the beautiful Anna Hutchison couldn't escape her fate: all it took was the girlfriend of Chris Hemsworth's character to show her breasts to get a beautiful pierced. And don't think it was a good thing. The best scene in The Cabin is the moment when the villains/monsters of so many horror movies show up. Spending a huge amount of blood to live up to the classic Death of the Devil, the survivors find out the worst possible way that the worst is not over yet. The entire sequence is chilling and makes up for the lack of scares.The premise of The Cabin in the Woods exists in several horror films, since it is a very beat-up synopsis. After all, a group of young people who are incommunicado in the middle of nowhere and are hunted by creatures is a very common plot. However, what makes the film so incredible is its metalanguage, as we have here several elements of innovation on the part of its screenwriters. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon managed to make a work that criticizes and, at the same time, pays homage to horror films. By placing typical stereotypes on their characters, we immediately have the idea that we will see more of the same, however, over the minutes we are introduced to new nuances. For example, the athlete and the hottie in the class are smart, the junkie is insightful and knows everything that's going on, the girl's romantic partner is not so silly and the protagonist is not as pure and naive as in all movies of the genre. .Despite starting out as a bad movie, The Cabin in the Woods takes a brutal turn. He plays with the clichés of movies of the genre and at the same time innovates, in a very competent plot. With a very bloody ending, but really bloody, the film gives us one more surprise besides the twists. For things to happen in The Cabin, everything must be manipulated, however, here it is masterfully done by a secret organization.Every time one of the protagonists does something smart, the members of this organization manipulate the situation, making the good guys act stupid through cheating. Chemicals that dumb down the protagonists, pheromones, small shocks on weapons, everything is done in a very subtle way for those who are watching. The way of construction differs a lot from traditional script conveniences that deceive us because of mediocre writers, something that is criticized here. But not only the industry is problematized, because we spectators are also the target. By putting ancient titans who just want blood to flow on the screen with more of the same, The Cabin in the Woods offers constructive criticism to the consumer. We always turn up our noses at new ideas, as we are used to a movie formula. When there is an innovation, we have resistance, because we are not used to new possibilities. Our yearning for the same castrates the creativity of the creators, as it discourages the creation of independent films, bringing hundreds of reboots and sequels to successful works.As the opening had already suggested, suspense is constantly intertwined with comedy in the development of the second act as well. When they arrive at the isolated location and are at the risk of the supernatural, the script embraces parody and works with metalanguage to mock the clichés of the cabin film subgenre in horror cinema: it makes fun of stereotypes in groups of young people to characterize their profiles; criticizes the moralism of punishing the actions of youth, such as sex; and derides stupid decisions made in the face of a threat, such as splitting up rather than keeping everyone together in the same place. As the humor progresses through the story, the role of the office where Sitterson, Hadley and other employees work becomes clear, as well as other jokes that are made when switching from one scenario to another during the montage - contrasts are created by the superposition of images during scenes of sex and great violence and by the succession of plans with similar situations in the two nuclei.The performance of the employees also illustrates the metalanguage brought by Drew Goddard. Each choice and action made by them interferes with the plot progress and the characters' behavior (despite the discourse that young people would be free to decide within a scenario of programmed possibilities), thus referring to the filmmakers themselves who consciously affect the narrative. In addition to the combination of sensations (suspense and comedy) and the manipulation of emotions by the soundtrack and the editing, the external interventions change the style from the most suggestive horror to the explicit horror and gore. Not being appealing because they are justified in the fanciful dramatic proposal, the graphic violence passages also indicate how the film manages to impress tension and present really blunt dangers. Without forgetting, of course, the aggressive effect that this subgenre has with shocking attacks and deaths.The various decisions not only meet and succeed each other to form a cohesive whole, but also define an entertainment proposal. The articulation between horror and comedy is coherent because it follows its own logic in which even the increase in the scale of the threat and its consequences has its exaggerations justified. So the third act elevates the fun to the point of making the absurdity of revelations an extra pastime. The logic is to parody the conventions of the genre through metalanguage, along the lines of what ""Scream"" started in the 1990s, and to show that every choice of a film is the result of the director's interventions to achieve some objective. In the case of ""The Cabin in the Woods"", the audience is entertained.The main cast is well chosen, although little known: Kristen Connolly plays Dana, the straight-laced, virgin protagonist; Anna Hutchinson plays the sexy of the group; Chris Hemsworth (that's right, Thor from The Avengers) embodies the athlete; while Frans Kranz is the fun pothead with above-average intelligence; No comment on the originality of the characters is unnecessary. The outcome still brings a small surprise for fans of the fantastic genre: the participation of the eternal Ten. Ripley, Sigourney Weaver, as the director of the organization that maintains the team of scientists.After an intriguing turn of events, the last half hour of The Cabin in the Woods holds more surprises than anyone can imagine. To the delight of the most sadists, a questionable humor is proposed from liters and liters of fake blood and a veritable carnival of references. With the end of the film, the feeling remains that new directors could be inspired by the ""reinventions"" of the work of Goddard and Whedon and not by the countless clichés that permeate contemporary cinema. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit lazy, especially when compared to the sophistication of the plot; however, it does not tarnish the work as a whole. Anyway, The Cabin in the Woods is a neat and interesting homage, not only to the horror genre, but also to its loyal fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is it funny? Yes. Is it scary? No.,"The Cabin in the Woods is a horror comedy that takes a very strange concept and manages to make it work. Judging from the trailers, one can pick up the basic premise of the movie: Several young adults going to a Cabin in the Woods that is being run by a testing facility that will try to control their decisions to play out horror movie tropes.The interesting thing about The Cabin in the Woods is that it is surprisingly predictable. You pretty much know what's going to happen next. You can tell that certain characters that are fleshed out are going to survive and that the simplistic and ""boring"" characters will die. However, I will say that it is still a very entertaining movie.The nice thing about this movie is that its premise is very outlandish and part of its humor comes from irony and the very ""business"" like aspects of the film. The movie literally reuses classic horror movie tropes and explains that the reason those tropes exist is because it is all run by the same organization that tries to play out specific scenarios.It is hard to review this movie without revealing too much. The Cabin in the Woods is definitely an entertaining movie for horror movie fans and it has some clever ideas. However, the movie isn't ingenious by any means.

finally one of the hyped flicks of 2012 that delivers,"What is it with the year 2012, so many flicks are hyped and most of them I just couldn't care, we had The Hunger Games which I found boring. We had Detention which was okay for the effects but just didn't deliver what I expected from it. So a bit of anger to plug in the next hype. The Cabin In The Woods. Luckily for me this flick did deliver.But I must immediately say that I can understand why people hate it. It is an ode to the horror genre and also they laughed it loud out. Why it is an ode, face it. I see things coming straight out of The Evil Dead (1981) like the zombies being awaken by a book. I see some kind of Box used in Hellraiser (1987). I do see elements of Cube (1997) towards the end and even a bit of Wrong Turn (2003). And there's even so much more like the white masks, or the way the killer zombie looked. When we go to Japan, that also rings a bell. So much of an ode.But it never gave me some jumpscene's. You can see things coming from miles away and on the other hand there are things that you say, wow, what a surprise. And even one actress is here to see as a big surprise. Naturally being filed under horror you do need like in the old school horrors the whore, the dummy, the smart ass and so on. We do have it here, we even had a bit of nudity from Anna Hutchison (Jules). And of course our female heroin.The acting did also give it an upgrade. They all looked believable but be aware that some do exaggerate because it's needed in a comedy/horror like this. On part of the comedy I didn't laughed it out that much, there's one scene with the titties that is funny but that's it for me.The effects are amazing in some scene's and the end, well, that's were people discussing about. You like it or you hate it. All horror creatures ever released are watchable in The Cabin In The Woods. I loved it and finally one hyped flick of 2012 did deliver. Never that gory at all.

A Clever Twist,"""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a refreshing take on the classic horror setup, delivering both genre thrills and a self-aware deconstruction of horror clichés. Directed by Drew Goddard and co-written with Joss Whedon, the film blends humor, suspense, and meta-commentary, making it a unique entry in the horror genre.At first glance, it follows the familiar formula: a group of college friends heads to a remote cabin for a weekend getaway, only to find themselves facing unspeakable horrors. However, as the story unfolds, it quickly becomes clear that there's more at play than just another slasher film. The film cleverly balances its horror elements with satirical and unpredictable twists, keeping the audience engaged throughout.The cast delivers solid performances, with Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz standing out, especially as the film takes a more chaotic and self-referential turn. The practical effects and creature designs are a highlight, adding a fun and grotesque variety to the film's horror sequences.While ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is undeniably entertaining and inventive, some of its humor and meta-narrative may not work for everyone. The film takes risks that, while refreshing, may leave some viewers feeling detached from the horror itself. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable and well-executed film that cleverly plays with genre conventions.For horror fans looking for something that blends traditional scares with a smart, unconventional approach, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is Cabin Fever Worth Catching,"If you are in the unfortunate position of having seen the trailer for this little 'horror' flick, then you may already know too much. Erase it from your memory; stop reading this review and book a ticket, safe in the knowledge that this cabin is full of surprises that defy the clichés. But before you go, be aware that I will reveal nothing of what is in store if you choose to see this film.It all starts with the typical set up familiar from a thousand other horror films. Five college kids head off the grid to find a secluded cabin belonging to a cousin. It's the perfect place for a bit of sex, drugs, swimming in a lake and getting picked off one by one in grisly ways. So far, so Evil Dead, Wrong Turn and Cabin Fever.But right from the opening scene, there's something different about this Cabin in the Woods. Who are the corporate types in the opening scene and where do they come into the plot? Why is there a man on a roof spying on the college kids as they set off on their adventure? And how come these kids aren't quite the usual stereotypes we expect in this kind of film? To say anymore could ruin the experience for readers of this review. But what can be said is that this film is an occasionally hilarious white-knuckle ride. Horror fans will rejoice at the old school set up and the vicious violent deaths while all viewers will enjoy the comedy, the surprises round every corner and the clever subverting of genre conventions.The cast do a good job but it's the mostly smart ideas and the clever writing that really make this stick out. Hemsworth can deliver handsome jock while sleepwalking, while Kristen Connelly and Fran Kranz ably tackle virginal sweet girl and stoner shtick respectively. There might only be the odd surprise in terms of who buys it next and who will make it to the final frames but what will surprise are the regular deviations from the main plot to the sinister activities of the corporate types from the opening scene.And if you don't enjoy the brilliant and hilarious bloodbath finale, you'll need to look long and hard to find something else that can satisfy your horror needs. The final reveal may lack the surprise hoped for from the rest of the smart set up but it's a minor complaint when the ride is this much fun.Verdict: It's fast-paced, fresh, frightening and ridiculously funny! But be warned: be careful what you read/see before you go in. Blessed is s/he that knows next to nothing about what is in store. www.ilovethatfilm.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Dour Cliché Breaking Sci-Fi/Horror Movie,"22 February 2016. A very dark and genre breaking horror/sci fi fusion movie. From Buffy: The Vampire Slayer fame, Josh Whedon, comes this cliché aversion thriller that begins as a college prat party and transforms into a hard science fiction movie devolving into a horror drenched movie into a fusion of sci-fi and horror without the redeeming values of Buffy. The script and plot seem to have been patched together in rather sterile hotel rooms where the creators were allowed to go wild and break the traditional story lines of sci fi and horror. The end result is surprising, twisting, and is swallowed whole like Planet of the Apes (1968).Cabin has fewer elements from Buffy than it's an adult version of Cube Zero (2004) along with the horror elements borrowed from Thir13teen Ghosts (2001) and Cell (2000). Overall, it's a fun but creepy and rather dour film experience. For perhaps an even more elevated sci-fi, horror experience check out:THX-1138 (1971) Brazil (1985) Silent Hill (2006) 1408 (2007) Black Death (2010) The Awakening (2010) The Host (2013)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It went from interesting to ridiculous...,"Are you kidding? This was one of the worst horror movies I have had to sit through.The story is about five people heading out to a remote cabin in the mountains, isolated from the outside world. During the stay in the rundown cabin, a cellar door opens up on its own, and the people go into the cellar to discover what is going on. Here they find a book from which one of them reads aloud some ancient Latin words. With these words read aloud, zombies are unleashed, as is something else entirely...What? Wait, let's back it up here. Can anyone say ""Evil Dead""? This was either tribute to the cult classic or a shameless and utter rip off. It was everything repeated from ""Evil Dead"", but just added with some extra stuff.This movie's plot line and story was such a lame copy that it was an embarrassment to witness and a pain to behold. There wasn't a single scary moment in the entire movie. And when you finally are let in on what is going on, you just sit there is disbelief and shake your head at the ludicrous ridiculousness of it all.The characters in the movie were so stereotypical that it was bordering on being generic characters just copy+pasted into the movie. As in any slasher movie, you have a jock, a nerd, a virgin, party-lover, and a girl with no morals. Could it be any more stereotypical?But it wasn't all bad, there were some good parts to the movie as well. There was some really great creature effects in the last third of the movie. Plus there was zombies - anything with zombies is a notch upward in my book. And the scene when Sigourney Weaver entered, that was just the high point of the movie, the most climatic scene in the entire movie. And finally, as the movie ended, Nine Inch Nails was being played. Oh, and not to forget that in the last 20 minutes or so, there is a great amount of gore and mayhem, which almost, just almost, makes it worth suffering through the entire movie just to watch. That was actually some of the best parts of the movie all together, at least it was what caught my interest.This movie was nothing at all as to what I had expected it to be. And it was actually a rather boring and dull experience to sit through. A very anti-climatic movie, and once you are let in on what is going on there, the movie just goes from being boring to being downright ridiculous. I have nothing but respect and awe for the Great Old Gods, but this was just insulting.If anything then the creature effects would make it worth watching the movie, or the less than 5 minutes that Sigourney Weaver is in it. Or for the fact that you have references to almost every slasher movie throughout the last 30 years stuffed into this movie. The rest of the movie is just a waste of time and effort. I am giving this movie a 4/10 rating; 1 point for Sigourney Weaver, 1 point for the creatures, 1 point for the bloodshed and gore in the last 20 minutes, and finally 1 point as the base minimum score that must be given. Had it not been for those, I would have opted for a 1/10 rating.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A horror fan since Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday and Hellraiser series, I am delighted over the homage, and sometimes parody, over old horror films. Now don't get me wrong. It's NOT Scary movie.

They soon find themselves fighting for their lives as someone or something is desperately trying to kill them.The first half is a typical, average horror movie in which five teens make the same mistakes as in every other film of this type and as a result are forced to fight for their survival. The only difference is that this time, they play the main role in a more complex puppet reality-show (sort of). The second half starts ""elucidating"" the very fantastic plot in which our ""heroes"" are the protagonists. Once again, as expected, everything doesn't go according to plan so another blood bath is unleashed ending careless as if nothing happened or is going to. I have to admit that it had a good premise which undoubtedly reminded me of the series ""Cube"" but as in the latter, they focused much more on the gruesome part, leaving the story predictable, linear and unexploited. I cannot understand why horror movies stubbornly keep following the same over-used stereotype which the only try to improve more or less rather than creating an original idea. In my opinion, this genre isn't going anywhere with this mentality but this isn't my concern.Rounding up, this is yet another average and boring horror movie with the exception that it could have been a lot better if the accent was put where it should have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A rare and unpredictable horror film,"¨They have to choose what happens in the cellar. Yeah, we write the game as much as we have to but in the end, if they don't transgress they can't be punished. ¨ I'm not big on horror films since I generally consider them to be very predictable and cliché. I can't remember what the last horror slasher movie I enjoyed was since the few I do enjoy have to do more with psychological scares. All these movies are the same, but to my surprise it wasn't the case with Cabin in the Woods. I had no idea what direction this movie was moving towards and despite not being a fan of the genre I was able to appreciate Cabin in the Woods thanks to the unpredictability of it and some interesting performances. The less you know about this film before watching it the better. Like the tagline of the movie suggests, this film works as sort of a satire of all the slasher films we've grown up with. ¨If something is chasing yousplit up, ¨ is one of the taglines that is so cliché about these movies and it's addressed in this film as well. There are several elements that are sort of dissected in this movie and analyzed through satire and that's what I enjoyed the most about Cabin in the Woods. I didn't care for the scares (which aren't here) or the gore, what I really liked was that this film was making fun of the genre while at the same time paying homage to it so that fanboys would also enjoy it. It works almost in the same way that Scream did in the late 90's by making fun of the stereotypes of the genre. This film has an ending every fanboy will enjoy. It was a little too much for me since I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I still have to admit I was really surprised by this film. It is definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time.Despite the fact that the trailers give away a lot of the movie I will only give away the basic part. You have the five typical teenagers you see in most horror films decide to go spend a weekend at an old and mysterious cabin in the woods: the jock, Curt (Chris Hemsworth), the slut, Jules (Anna Hutchison), the stoner, Marty (Fran Kranz), the nerd, Holden (Jesse Williams), and the virgin, Dana (Kristen Connolly). The five play characters we are all familiar with in this genre. On their way to the woods they even run into an old gas station with a weird owner named Mordecai (Tim de Zarn) who really only lacks a sign in front of his forehead saying ¨Do not go into the woods if you want to live.¨ Once the teens arrive at the beautiful place they begin to party as they usually do, but later strange things begin to happen and they realize that they might not be alone in that place. You probably have seen this scenario a million times before in these films, but it takes a totally different turn and if you're a fan of the genre you will be in for a treat. Character actors Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford also give some strong secondary performances as they usually do.Cabin in the Woods combines a lot of gore with laughs. I can't say scares because there is hardly any. I like the way the film poked fun of its usual stereotypes and played with them while at the same time paying homage to several classic horror films. This was Drew Goddard's first film as a director and he really delivers. He had the credentials necessary considering he wrote and produced several Buffy, Angel, and Lost episodes as well as Cloverfield. He also co-wrote this brilliant and bizarre script with Joss Whedon, one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood (The Avengers, Toy Story, and Serenity). The script is smart although I must say that it was bizarre as well, but in a good way. Fans will have a terrific time with this movie, and those of us who criticize most slasher films for their predictability will be surprised by the twists taken here. It is a very original film which isn't afraid of taking risks or making fun of itself. The highlight of the film for me was Fran Kranz's performance. Most of the characters in this movie were really likable, as opposed to most horror films where they are hateful and forgettable. Cabin in the Woods is a very interesting and unique film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Same Old Horror Film... or is it?,"Killer unicorns, zombie hillbillies and 20 foot serpent demons are just some of the delights on display for audiences of 'The Cabin In The Woods': the glorious pan-horror genre-exploder produced and co-written by Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy and Firefly) and directed by Drew Goddard in his feature debut.We begin, as we so often do, with five college students heading to the woods for a weekend of partying, drinking and, most importantly, not studying. The posse is made up of a college athlete, his ditzy girlfriend, a sensitive geek, the wholesome girl next door and a drug-addled waster. Getting lost on the way, they meet a creepy gas station attendant who warns: 'Getting there's not the trouble getting back's what you need to worry about'. A cliché premise for sure, but there's a second storyline that's about to rip it apart faster than an attractive teen on Friday the 13th.Cut to a mysterious underground lair where a surveillance team monitor the students as they arrive at their destination. But they're not only watching them, they are controlling them – releasing mood altering gases, spiking their food and playing with trap doors. They're also running a sweepstakes amongst themselves. What are they betting on? How their victims will die, of course, because there's a variety of options.As the cabin inmates get picked off one by one, the survivors slowly become wise to the murderous game they have become a part of: with only their wits and the will to survive, they must escape this nightmare Truman Show and break free from their puppet masters. Beyond that, I'd love to tell you more, but I won't. The second half of the movie has to be seen to be believed, and the less you know about it the more you'll enjoy it.What makes the 'The Cabin In The Woods' such a success is it's brilliant balancing of the two story lines, and the perfect placement of humour throughout. Even though Drew Goddard gets directing credits, this film feels like Whedon through and through. The keen understanding of genre, brilliantly witty dialogue, teen sensibility and wonderful subversion of convention are reminiscent of Buffy The Vampire Slayer at its very best.I'll end by joining the chorus of critics telling you not to read about 'The Cabin In The Woods', but to go out and see it: it's twists and turns need to be experienced first-hand, and with all its spectacle I would suggest catching it on the big screen rather than DVD. And please, stay out of the woods.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com. Follow us on Twitter @DohaFilm.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Mashup of Horror and Science Fiction,"Here comes another hybrid movie, mashing up a couple genres like they did with ""Super 8"". This is a mix of ""Westworld"" and ""Friday the 13th"". As for finding a new wrinkle in the horror genre, the Sci-Fi aspect of this film keeps you interested. There is a long period of time as the film slowly reveals what all the pieces of the puzzle are and what they mean. As the mythology is explained, you are guessing what will transpire in the third act (which must be what the mostly positive reviews are about). Along the way, the horror part of this movie does it's job by having the designated bad guy strike at the most unexpected moment. However, these were very brief and not terribly bloody, along with always being really dark on screen. I really didn't find myself feeling scared that much. So it was up to the third act to win me over. It seems as though the screenwriter might have stumbled upon a new setup for a better horror film while writing this film. But it seems as though the entire film really is a setup for an anticipated sequel (that didn't happen).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Worst Horror movie ever made,"What a waste of time! I suggest people who're planning to watch this movie, Please don't go by the rating it has got. This is such a TRASH MOVIE you will always repent for. I found this movie very boring and amateurish. Maybe small kids will get frightened seeing this but I bet a grown up will find this movie very laughable. Wonder how come people like Joss Whedon ended up producing this trash. You will get to see a lot of zombies and creatures and high amount of gore. But the question is what for? There is no strong story. Completely illogic plot. Unnecessary special effects. Overall a complete let down. Watch it at your own risk. The movie is really gonna test your patience..Big Time!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst movies,"This review is going to be short. This was one of the worst movies I have watched. The transitions from thriller to cheap comedy were so annoying. You start with bloody killings and suddenly you are watching jokes that are not funny and you are lead to scenes that you don't even watch in home made movies. And then the ending was what gave the final strike though. I understand that this was not going for the same old thriller in the woods but where on earth did that come from... Just no... Save your time and money for another one. I just don't understand why there is this high score in IMDb, lots of people are saying that its the best movies they have seen.

Best horror ever (horror = entertainment),"For the people who actually thought this was going to be scary, go and watch Paranormal Activity 4.This movie was flat out entertainment, done with great wit, intellect and originality whilst delivering on the 'horror' front. If you appreciate satire and go in expecting entertainment, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. It is actually more realistic than most other horror movies I've seen.There basically isn't much else to say without spoiling it... Don't watch the trailers (never watch trailers where avoidable), obviously you cannot trust any rating on IMDb, but people either loved this as I did, or hated it and would prefer to watch Paranormal Activity 4 whilst they pack their dacks, if you're someone who is more likely to fall asleep during Paranormal Activity (I haven't seen number 4, just number one, how on earth did it make it to 4?!!) then this film is for you.Probably the best movie I have seen this year.

Original,"After not watching a horror film in over 10 years I decided I would start with this one. It didn't sound too terrifying. I wasn't expecting much but I have to admit the originality of the film did capture me. I was disappointed with the ending and unfortunately it took me a while to understand what was going on for the first hour.For the originality of the film, I gave it a 6. I also have to give credit to the fact it didn't end with the usual happy ending horror films have become accustomed to.It did make me jump (once) at the opening credits, when my kitchen door mysteriously closed on its own (just what I needed!) There were a few parts that made me laugh too. However the blonde character was a rather poor actress. I am glad I watched it, but I wouldn't watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It is all you worth in a horror movie,"Let me start with the punchline and that is ""All you want is here"". I am not joking folks this is the movie where you will find whatever you ever liked in any horror movie.....name out few (evil dead, all zombies movies, silent hill and whatever in your mind). Though the plot is quite simple and if you will go to this movie with light mood you will surely like this one. Special effects are good and acting is fair from these folks. In the beginning you will find out this movie is yet another teen horror flick but wait for the bet (i will not spoil the suspense)and you will get so deep in the plot. But few things poorly executed and i am being fair to say that the trend and intellectualism of today's movie's gore. But the whole idea is very good and suspenseful. Its a mix combination of all scary movies and ghost and haunting which i am sure you already seen here and there and like always in the end you will explore the intensity of story and forget/forgive what director missed out on your movie pallet. Go guys if you need some good light sex, suspense, gore, ghost, zombies, mermaids, cobra, blood sucking huge bats........list is very long. I am giving it 8 out of 10 but i bet you will be entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great film...,"THE CABIN IN THE WOODSWow... this film surprised me. I was expecting it to be a typical slasher film... basically another Evil Dead wannabe... but it was different... and I loved it!The movie is about a bunch of kids who go up to a cabin in the woods for a small vacation (yeah I know... sounds all too similar so far) but then they accidentally bring a group of zombies to life. The difference with this film though, is they are all being watched and it is all part of a set up by a company that is sacrificing them without them knowing.The film is very entertaining and had some great bloody moments. The deaths were very cool.The effects were great and the monsters/zombies were awesome. I loved they way this film didn't follow every other horror film. I also think the ending is brilliant.The acting was OK mostly... there is one guy in the movie (Fran Kranz) that I think could have done better, but his bad performance was funny which added to the movie. He might have even played it bad on purpose for comedy value.Other cast members were Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins & Bradley Whitford.Chris Hemsworth just seems to be in everything these days... he is a good actor, but he has made some bad decisions... he has made some movies that I have not been impressed with. But not this one.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very good movie that was a mixture of Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead and The Cube.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
We must've have been seeing different movies. I HATE this one!,"Horror is my favorite genre. I LOVE good horror, even if it's a bad B-movie. Let me say that first.Rarely do I write one of these, but I felt compelled to give my two cents on this turd. The kills are so-so. The suspense is frequently interrupted by the cut-scenes to the wraparound story, but the humor was pretty funny. I had no intention of seeing this movie today (Friday, the 13th) as I had already been sucked in to seeing a 3D re-release of a classic with my wife. I wish I would have done so. At the last minute, the hype bug bit me and I had to go see this movie. . . Mistake.The most enjoyment I received from this film was the chaos near the end. That was cool seeing everything at once (you'll get what I mean if you see it). Overall, what a turd. Save your $30 and get this out of one of those red boxes in a few months.I gave this 3 stars for it's humor, the use of the token stoner and the somewhat entertaining twist.

Not what I expected at all...,"Judging from the movie's poster, I expected a run-of-the-mill bland monster movie with a few kids in an abandoned cabin, getting chased by the local monster. It starts with a cabin-horror story, yes, but the story builds up from there to bigger things. This movie truly offers everything - from love to sex to horror to sci-fi to humor (!), action, firefights, stunts, drama and suspense, from great acting to a real plot and ethical questions, an ending that isn't predictable and as a cherry on the pie a final appearance from no less than Sigourney Weaver! And the best part - it does ALL of these things right, PLUS blends it all so beautifully! A few minutes in, I could already tell I was in for a treat. Amazing.

Brilliant,"I haven't enjoyed a horror film with some comedy in it this much in years. Maybe the last time was when I first saw... Evil Dead 2? Re-Animator? I don't even remember.I won't say anything about the plot, because it would automatically become a spoiler, and please people, resist your urge to read spoilers about this film before watching it. You'll just ruin your own enjoyment. I'll just say that this is a funny, gory (important in a horror film), clever and original movie. I've read some comments about this being a rip-off of ""Wrong Turn"", ""The Evil Dead"" and such films.Well, those people totally missed the train, the bus, the balloon and other vehicles on this film. Sure, some scenes resemble those films, but on purpose. I cannot say what that purpose is, that might be a spoiler. I actually like the fact that the opinions are split, some people give one star and some give ten, at least it's not mediocre. One more thing: watch this at least 2 times if you can.

"Clowns and zombies and werewolves, oh my!","Two babes (Kristen Connolly and Anna Hutchison); two hunks (Chris Hemsworth and Jesse Williams); one stoner (Fran Kranz); a weekend in a creepy old cabin by a lake: sounds like all the ingredients for a typically gruesome teen horror, doesn't it? Well, that's precisely what Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard want you to think, except that there is absolutely nothing 'typical' about this film.The initial set up will be familiar to most, but with the early introduction of a group of sinister scientists keeping tabs on events at the cabin (via some sophisticated surveillance equipment), it soon becomes apparent that things aren't as they might at first seem. As the film unfolds, Whedon and Goddard seize every opportunity to play with the conventions of the genre and mess with their viewers' expectations; the result is a whole lot of demented fun, something that I can only describe as 'The Evil Dead meets Lost'.To give away anything further about the plot would be to ruin your enjoyment, so I'll keep schtum and leave you to discover the secrets of The Cabin In The Woods by yourself. Suffice to say that the film delivers all of the standard horror movie clichés (a dark cellar full of bizarre objects, sex in the woods, a creepy gas station attendant, etc.,) but what it does with them takes the film into refreshingly new horror territory where the standard rules of the genre simply do not apply.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

New Cult Classic.,"Every once in a while a movie catches your eye and instantly becomes a cult classic, this has happened with other films such as Donnie Darko, Evil Dead and Reservoir Dogs. Seeing the previews for this film I went in expecting an entertaining horror movie and nothing more. And briefly that's what I thought was be presented before me in the theatre then the real story started to come to light and I couldn't have been more thrilled.Since I refuse to give anything away that would ruin the excellent experience of viewing this movie, I will just briefly describe the plot. If you have ever seen any classic horror films like Evil Dead then you already know the setup to the movie. A few college kids go to a deserted cabin in the woods that they inexplicably were able to get for a weekend or so. Explaining any further about the beginning would just be unnecessary repetition of what you should already know. Needless to say after brief enjoyment some evil is unearthed and one by one the kids start to be killed as would happen in any horror movie of this sort. Up to this point I considered this to be the highlight of the movie which would have been been what I expected but what I didn't expect is that this was barely the beginning of what was coming.Joss Whedon who I have respected for years from his amazing television shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and more recently Dollhouse. He also was pitch perfect for directing the Avengers movie that was also released this year. Him along with his long time collaborator Drew Goddard have made a masterpiece of a horror film, if this film even belongs to a specific genre. The young cast is amazing but perhaps the standout of the group would be Fran Kranz who plays ""Marty"", who beyond being the funny stoner of the movie actually does have a really good role and it would seem hard to imagine the movie without him.Unfortunately it's hard to recommend this movie without giving away important plot points, so I'll just end with this, Try and find a way to watch this movie it is spectacular and will become a cult classic that will discussed for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

That being said I wasn't expecting much, but what I got was unlike anything I have ever witnessed on screen in my entire life, a solid, funny and gory masterpiece. So why did I not give it a 10 if it was soooo good? Well, for me the final climax just wasn't long enough, that's it. I wanted more and I wasn't alone.

One of the absolute greatest films of all time!,"This film is perfect beginning to end, if you are a fan of horror film genre and have an IQ above 80 you will LOVE this film.To call this film a spoof is selling it short, this film deconstructs the horror genre, analyzes it, and then builds a master piece film from the ground up. The film is a mix of a lot of things; it pays homage to the old horror films before it, plays at the clichés of the genre in a funny way, and genuinely tells an original, fun, and interesting story.To people who claim the film is terrible, I'd have to say you really missed what this film achieved. I guess if you not a fan of the horror genre and you just go into this film blind it could seem like a standard slasher flick...but trust me it is so much. Everything in this film is a reference to either a horror film, the horror genre, or film making as a whole and that could go over a casual viewers head.The film at it deepest level is a film about film making (meta). Joss' writing is at the same level it always is...perfect; blending humor and horror seamlessly.

An unexpected crazy mix of different concepts in a rather not serious but highly entertaining thriller!,"Thriller / fiction film. A group of young people go on a trip to a remote wooden house in the forest to spend the weekend. Except that the place where they go unsuspectingly, hides a whole set game against them, from behind ... or rather beneath them! For the most part it could be another zombie movie, but in the end then plenty of imagination is added to the end that finalizes it completely. It has some elements of humor and is clearly not horror, but a thriller / fiction adventure, with plenty of action and suspense. The script really had it all in, especially when you see it to the end, but I do not write more so that I avoid spoilers. Quite a crazy script though, in its own style, though I personally would have preferred it to be a more serious movie and more horror and not so much for fun. It can be watched, of course, but be prepared to watch it in a similar mood. Because of the unique, crazy scenario, I put something more on the score, something between 6.5 and 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: The Cabin in the Woods,"One of the best ways to thoroughly enjoy The Cabin in the Woods, is to steer clear of its trailer and go in blind. Don't read any reviews because there are plenty out there who are just plain lazy and in their plot summary hint at what's to come, or tend to reveal too much - heck, if you're that cautious, skip my review altogether, though I promise to tread really carefully. A film that's usually bad gets shelved for months before a release date, and this was delayed for 3 years, though due to its battle to resist being converted to 3D. Thankfully it stayed the way it is rather than to go into yet another senseless depth of field conversion that brings little value to the table, and along the way nothing else got created that resembled its brilliance, keeping it extremely fresh when seen for the first time.Written by Joss Whedon (whose next film The Avengers just can't wait to burst onto the big screens) and Drew Goddard who wrote Cloverfield, and episodes for television series such as Lost, Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the concept for The Cabin in the Woods is so fluid and probably easy to come up with if you're smoking something, working on many levels, and gives us all a reason why horror films play out the way they do. The writing duo takes the quintessential horror film ensemble of characters, and slaps on some fictional yet logical rationale, though keeping it thoroughly entertaining, and with the usual bag of tricks up the sleeves that every horror filmmaker out there would have dipped into from time to time, packing it with plenty of strong irony that drips in every scene.Goddard also takes on directing responsibilities, and his feature film debut demonstrates a keen eye for various genres, all incorporated seamlessly into this film. Laughter and satire are always close by, and I can't fathom another film that's remotely close to its offering of thrills, spills and laughter, not by a mile. There are plenty of moments where you're kept on the edge of your seat, with surprising twists and turns popping up every now and then, even when the film established its own ground rules early on that will probably give you a whiff of what's to come later in the narrative. You may think you have all the answers, but the final act provides clear cut answers, and throws just about everything from the horror genre onto the screen in one giant melting pot.What I really enjoyed about the film is its tongue-in-cheek treatment about competition from around the world, reflecting real life and how we view horror films in general, with each subsequent viewing of a particular film, or a sub-genre, sensitizing us to anything a filmmaker could possibly throw at us, leaving us jaded, and almost always a step ahead of the filmmakers. Here, there's a deliberate flag flying attempt that pokes fun at the return of US horror filmmaking brilliance in a less than subtle sequence, and in what I thought was an overt warning was not to celebrate before the chickens hatch, a reminder to focus on the task at hand until it gets completed rather than to rest on premature laurels.So step into The Cabin in the Woods, and throw all preconceived notions you think may happen along the course of the movie. You'll get some right, but trust me there are a lot more going on here with references so fast and furious that this is firmly set as one of the rare few horror films that begs repeated viewing. Highly recommended, and a shoo-in into the shortlist as one of this year's best!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An entertaining Cabin in some original Woods,"When I finally decided to watch Drew Goddard's 'The Cabin in the Woods' I expected the clichéd tale of a group of youngsters vacationing in the woods only to be hunted by some psychopath or demonic creature. The truth is I was half right and half wrong, and boy was that wrong, really wrong!Chris Hemsworth is the big draw here and although his role was nothing Thor like, he does plays the big jock adequately. The other characters serve their purpose well while conspiracy theorist and stoner, Fran Kranz, is the stand out performer here. Veteran Bradley Whitford has to get a mention too, as you can't help but like his sadistically kooky character.As the end credits role, you may find yourself impressed with how the creators took an old, run down plot and flipped the script before remixing it Diddy style! Then, you'll begin to wonder if there's a sequel in the works as all you want is more!All in all, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have done a fantastic job in seamlessly weaving horror and comedy together and creating a refreshing popcorn flick that will make you chuckle before shrieking in horror!
