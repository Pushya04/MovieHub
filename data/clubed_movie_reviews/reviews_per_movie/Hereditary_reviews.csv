Toni Collette is amazing,"The reason that Hereditary is worth watching is because of Toni Collette. Her performance is so powerful, complex, and nuanced that you practically feel the emotions she is feeling in each scene. That being said, this is not easy to watch. There's a general unpleasantness hovering over the entire film. It made me feel uneasy, and not in a fun horror movie way. I also think that this film is too cerebral for its own good and it will leave you scratching your head in confusion if you don't do some research. I think Hereditary is well made, I just don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I Was Riveted,"First of all, I have to say that Toni Colette is one hell of an actress, She was brilliant in this.I was gripped by this movie, a slow burner , creepy , unnerving , and , for me , very disturbing. I was quite moved in parts , and in others I was terrified . A movie has not affected me like this one for some time, it stayed in my head afterwards. I highly recommend it .Great cast , excellent performances , just a great movie !",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Toni Colette was robbed of an Oscar nod,"This has to be one of the best horror movies ever! Toni Collette gives a performance of a lifetime and I think possibly the best of her career. Just when you think you know what's going on, the movie flips. It's so amazingly written and such a thrill ride. Not for the faint of heart!! I've watched this so many times but still get the same chill every single time. Definitely would recommend to horror fans! Review: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Showcases what horror is capable of when taken seriously,"In many ways, Hereditary is the horror movie I've been restlessly waiting to see for so many years. Despite my avid fandom for the genre, I really feel that modern horror has lost its grasp on how to make a film that's truly unsettling in the way the great classic horror films are. A modern wide-release horror film is often nothing more than a conveyor belt of jump scares strung together with a derivative story which exists purely as a vehicle to deliver those jump scares. They're more carnival rides than they are films, and audiences have been conditioned to view and judge them through that lens. The modern horror fan goes to their local theater and parts with their money on the expectation that their selected horror film will ""deliver the goods"", so to speak: startle them a sufficient number of times (scaling appropriately with the film's runtime, of course) and give them the money shots (blood, gore, graphic murders, well-lit and up-close views of the applicable CGI monster etc.) If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it's scoffed at and falls into the ""worst film I've ever seen"" category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts.Like similarly fantastic and crowd-displeasing horror films of the past few years, The Witch and It Comes At Night, Hereditary is a film that largely deals in atmosphere and emotional horror. The Shining, which happens to be my favorite horror film, is a clear touchstone and I would go as far as saying that this is the first modern horror film I've seen that genuinely captures a similar tone and ethos. Much like that film, it delivers its horror through an intensifying sense of unease and dread that becomes nearly suffocating by its conclusion. Rather than startling you with cheap scares, it offers haunting and upsetting images which are often delivered without any of those overused sonic jolts. Perhaps most importantly, it anchors everything in an emotional core with nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles and grief. And that is absolutely critical to what makes the movie effective and resonant: it works on a metaphorical level, using the supernatural story as a vehicle to explore the very real way in which a family can be absolutely ravaged by tragedy, and furthermore how trauma and mental illness are passed through the generations. I'd be remiss not to mention that Toni Collette gives a mesmerizing performance in this film that is absolutely unhinged and truly difficult to stomach at times.For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn't quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I'm very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could've been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more ""traditional"" horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better.The positives far, far outweigh the negatives here though and Hereditary is ultimately a remarkable debut horror film which showcases what the genre is capable of when it's taken seriously by a talented director. Here's hoping we'll continue to see more like it.Light 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Creepy Beginning and Then It Bogged Down,"I thought the beginning was rather nicely done, creepy in not an overt way. It was all about weird family dynamics and the unseen. I liked that, even though I didn't know where this was going. It was promising. This culminated in one gruesome event. Afterward, the movie devolved (IMO) into a waste of my time. It was too slow and it seemed like the creators didn't know where this was leading to. If the movie had done something with that promising start, my rating would be higher. As such it is, my rating is just 6 our of 10 and the latter part of the movie is definitely worse than 6 stars. Yeah, it's all explainable, but it was not scary anymore, except for that school scene (possession). That was well done. There were too few scenes like this.Watch Rosemary's Baby for a much MUCH better film about sort of similar stuff.The daughter looks really weird and out of place and people would react to her differently than they did in the movie. Examples are the school party and that stuff with the pigeon in the schoolyard. The son and daughter also looked in no way like each other, even though they're supposed to be family. Maybe that's just me. Whatever. It's just a movie and in the end not a classic. The relationship between the father and mother is also crazy and to me looks unrealistic. It had not enough depth.Have fun watching it. It's kind of disturbing. It's messed up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I never want to see this film again,"And I mean this in the best way possible. The spectrum of emotions you go through range from sheer terror to complete hopelessness and sorrow.

What?,"Sorry, but I thought this film was absolutely awful. The storyline made no sense. It was as if there were two movies: a well made drama about a family dealing with significant unresolved issues and 20 minutes of silly, non-sensical horror grafted onto the end.

Where is Toni Collette's Oscar?,"I was alone and browsing for a movie to watch. Stumbled across this one and set out to casually watch a basic scary movie, with no clue of what I was about to experience. I barely moved the entire movie, and sat in stunned silence for 20 minutes after the credits started rolling, and hardly slept that night. I was petrified.The absolute commitment that Toni Collette gave to this role as Annie is beyond description. She grabbed me and held me, and I'm not being hyperbolic. She found the deepest pain and distress inside herself that I've ever seen portrayed on screen. Her beautiful FACE revealed ugly and tragic feelings that words could never. She played mental illness and pain as real and as raw as I've ever seen it. Ever.Hereditary has officially surpassed The Shining and The Exorcist as MY scariest and most disturbing movie of all time. And it's not even close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Toni Collette performance is top notch,"Movies like Heredity remind me that mood trumps jump scares and gore in the horror genre. The mood of this movie goes from a family that has suffered loss of someone that, well, they are better off without to tense, terrible and completely sad story. I don't want to go deep into it but the emotions it evokes are real. This does not mean that the movie does not use manipulations all horror movies use and it is necessary to make the story work.Now lets get to the reason why this movie puts it above so many: The performance of Toni Collette. She played her part with so much raw emotion, pain, terror, sadness and maniacal energy that I do find it hard to believe she did not get accolades for her performance. By the end of the movie I was emotionally exhausted and fully impressed by her.This was a solid watch and I will watch it again to catch subtle things that I have missed on my first watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Almost works better as a drama than a horror,"'Hereditary' is sort of like two films in one. Half of the time it is being what I expected it to be, which is a horror movie. The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode. The film is over 2 hours in length which is extremely long by modern horror movie standards. The reason I believe for this is that it's trying to fit so much in and achieve so much in such a little time. It's a very ambitious film it would have to be said.The entire cast were terrific, but Toni Collette absolutely blew me away. The emotional depth she is able to achieve never ceases to amaze me and she is captivating to watch in any scene she's in. I feel like she is one of the most under-appreciated actresses working today. As mentioned though, everyone is terrific and this is one of the best acted horror movies you are likely to find.I sat in the cinema for a couple of minutes are the credits rolled just trying to work out how I actually felt about the film. I know I liked it, but I also know I didn't love it as much as I had hoped to going in. It certainly surprised me that I was more invested in the real-life drama side of things, and that the horror was almost like an unwanted distraction at times. The horror is almost always about atmosphere and visuals rather than any kind of jump-scare which I always like. What I didn't like though was how casually it jumped from seeming normality to outright suspension of belief. I feel like this could have been bridged a little better. Early on there's a lot of subtlety, then in one scene all of that is thrown out the window at once. I suppose at least the audience knows where they stand from that point onwards.'Hereditary' is a film made with impeccable quality, of that there is no questioning. In fact it's made so well that I would suggest what story you picked to tell almost wouldn't matter because writer/director Ari Aster clearly has the skills to make it work. I can see opinions being very divided on the film (I even had a couple walk out of the cinema at one point in my showing), but I think the majority will like it on some level and for that reason I would recommend giving it a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

He had the audience with him and then...poof, he completely allowed this to veer into absolute ludicrousness. And the ending is one of the all-time dumbest I've ever seen.

Hmmmmm,"I've seen the movie twice. The first time it was sometime preferable to plucking hairs. The second, I saw more into it than the long intervalled borefest previously encountered. I appreciated Toni Colette for the first time ever in 18 movies. The rest, akin to dismal. I see that horror has taken a turn from frights to a disturbing circumstance that may happen in the house next door.I enjoy that. Unfortunately having next to zero plot with so much well done cinematography it stood on one foot, fighting off excitement with ""darkness and anticipation"". The fight being concluded with a shrug, delivered by boredom, and the referee, ""Slapdash Quickplot"", called it quits with a quick ending to an otherwise fruitless film. Toni Collette did well until now was not a fan. On a scale of one to ten I rate it a ""meh"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The most genuinely horrifying movie I have ever seen,"Hereditary is without a doubt one of the most frightening, deeply disturbing, and evocative pieces of horror I have ever seen.Instead of scaring you right away, the film slowly takes its time to build a bone chilling atmosphere and genuinely get under your skin. Hereditary uses its isolating cinematography, tense dialogue, and bloodcurdling soundtrack to quietly whisper to you that something unspeakably horrifying is bound to befall its cast of characters.The characters themselves are all impeccably acted and written to feel like real people. Each of the characters have their own multi-layered fears and traumas that they attempt to deal with throughout the story.The film explores how a family can slowly be driven apart through grief and tragedy as well as the horrific consequences this can have on the lives of each of the family members. These themes are conveyed through palpably uncomfortable dialogue between characters and the raw, visceral acting performances of the film's two leads Toni Colette and Alex Wolff.While Hereditary is slow paced, the unrelenting tension and dread present within the story as well as the mystery behind what exactly is going on are enough to keep you thoroughly invested. The second and third acts of the film are truly terrifying in a way that few films can hope to match. The ghastly imagery and scare sequences are so nightmarish that they are capable of staying in your head for days after watching the film. The characters feel so real that it is as if you are watching real people having their lives being torn apart.Overall Hereditary is not for everyone and isn't an easy movie to watch. It is very clammy, unnerving, and disturbing. But if you are looking for a well written and mature horror story that grounds its terror in human emotion this is the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A genuine nightmare,"This is a bit of an old fashioned horror movie. Something that plays as a dramatic movie first and then slowly becomes something else. Like ""Rosemary"" or ""Exorcist"" but without the high profile clout of those directors. This is two hours of an exploration of family tragedy and grief through characters struggling to cope.To say much of this film is to ruin it, so lashing praise onto certain aspects of it is the best one can do. Not to say this is a film with a big twist, it isn't. Toni Collette is fantastic as is no surprise at this point in her career. All the performances carry their own, including one I was unsure of at first but grew on me throughout -- Alex Wolff. The cinematography, rhythms and pacing, sense of place and space, and sound design are all superb and work in conjunction to create atmosphere and dread -- like a pit in your stomach that continues to grow and grow throughout.It turns into a genuine nightmare that absolutely worked for me. See it blind, see it as a movie first and foremost (not as a horror show with jump scares), but just see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Weak ending,"Really ended the film until the last 10 minutes. Won't spoil it for anyone, it's not without merit, but the conclusion left me thinking 'SERIOUSLY'?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","The first two thirds of 'Hereditary (2018)' are essentially a drama that deal with poignant themes of grief and the accompanying guilt using a horror genre language, which is an interesting move that allows for a unique expression of the severity of these emotions. It is these moments that are the most effective as they tap into a universal fear and experience in a really realistic way that isn't necessarily used to frighten but is used to create emotional attachment to the characters and may perhaps illicit a genuine emotional response. Yet, I can't easily name another movie that falls apart so heavily thanks solely due to its ending, which intends to 'pull the rug out' from under its audience - and does so successfully - but comes at the cost of logic, investment and, most importantly, scariness. Instead of recontextualising the flick as one that embraces its new elements and intended reading in retrospect, it forces in nonsensical and previously unconsidered elements - via clunky exposition, no less - to frustrating, and sometimes unintentionally funny, effect. It honestly changes the entire affair for the worse, dampening the effect of all that came before it until the memory of any success all but fades. It's annoying, too, because the potential was there and I was definitely willing to put the effort in, eager to delve into the experience with an open mind and a watchful eye. I found my willingness to approach the film from an intellectual stand-point, as well as to give it the benefit of the doubt on a number of occasions, not to be rewarded, to say the least. The more I think about the picture, the less I like it. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fear in the family,"Have always had a lot of appreciation for horror, even though it isn't my favourite genre, and 'Hereditary' was a film that immediately held my interest in seeing it with such an arresting concept. Although more polarising with audiences it was very positively received films critically, having more than once seen and heard it described as one of the year's best.Despite reviewing it only now, 'Hereditary' was another film viewed weeks ago but with so many commitments and such a big to watch and review list it's taken a long time to get round to reviewing it. While the polarisation is understandable, count me in as another person who was really impressed by 'Hereditary', very nearly loving it even. Of my recent 2018 viewings, it definitely stands out as one of the better ones and it is not hard to see whether it is considered in as high regard as it is. Can also see why it has been compared to 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining', having just as much the same amount of dread and hellish atmosphere, and also couldn't help thinking of another slow-burn horror from this year that divided opinion but was also critically acclaimed 'A Quiet Place'. Not in concept and they're different films, but in that they're polarising but mostly positively regarded and both films that were very well made, well acted and unnerving.It is hard to know where to begin praising something with so many positives. 'Hereditary' is incredibly well made visually, one of the most audacious and best-looking films in the genre in recent years. The photography is both dream-like and nightmarish, while the film is slickly edited, atmospherically lit and the spacious house, with a mix of the audacious and the ghoulish, is like its own character.The music is haunting and adds to the unnerving atmosphere as does some of the most effective sound editing and design of the year, never being obvious or cheap and providing a lot of eeriness. The writing flows well and never becomes corny or overly-wordy, sometimes even thought-provoking in particularly in what it has to say about grief and trauma.While a deliberate slow-burn for me 'Hereditary' was not dull at all, helped enormously by the atmosphere and the near-perfect balance of family drama, which was often very poignant and packs a powerful emotional wallop, and horror, where there is not any over-reliance on predictable horror tropes and cheap scare tactics and actually was frightening and suspenseful. It always is interesting seeing film debuts and there are some fine ones out there, Ari Astor's directing is remarkably well accomplished with a fine eye for detail and an adeptness for how to pace such an atmosphere.Characterisation-wise, 'Hereditary' is quite compelling and there is a realism to it. The performances are near-perfect, with Gabriel Byrne occasionally slightly under-playing but generally it is one of his best performances in a while. The star here is Toni Collette in a truly marvellous and often moving turn that calls for a mix of grief and terror, Collette grieves with pathos and conveys terror with intensity. Alex Woolf is the other standout for similar reasons though Milly Shapiro is not to be neglected.It is a shame that the ending is rushed and that plausibility loses its way at this point, instead coming over as silly and like the film had run out of steam.Otherwise, a very good film that was very nearly excellent. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I'm still waiting for the disturbing scenes.,"If I have to be absolutely honest I'm a bit disappointed by Hereditary. Just because it's another horror movie that has been overhyped, telling us that people had to leave the theater because it was too much for them, reading reviews it's the scariest and most disturbing horror movie ever etc... Let's just be honest, disturbing movies are A Serbian Movie, Hostel or The Human Centipede for exemple, those are all disturbing movies and hard to watch. Hereditary on the other hand is just a normal horror movie, not a bad one, but certainly not one I will think about in the future when somebody asks me what movie was sickening to watch. I like Toni Collette, she's perfect for her character. Overall the cast was good, the suspense building was maybe a bit too long without anything happening, certainly if you promote this movie like almost unwatchable because of the disturbing horror.

"A new horror classic, tense and terrifying","I rarely write reviews for films on here with the exception of two cases: when a movie is really bad or when a movie needs defending from a vocal minority that trash it. First, I'll review the film like I would any other and then I'm going to try and reason why audiences are reacting negatively to the film. I'm not sure if Hereditary is the greatest horror film ever but I certainly felt like I was watching my generation's Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. The movie borrows heavily from those two films right down to the final scene. Despite this, it feels new and dangerous. I had no idea how the movie was going to play out which is a criticism I have with a lot modern horror/thriller movies. This in large part has to do with the marketing campaign but more on that later. I feel the term slow burn has a negative connotation associated with it and prefer to call this movie tense. It doesn't really on jump scares that plague a lot of modern horror and chooses tension and imagery to scare the audience with slow camera panning and fantastic cinematography, a nervous score, and great performances. Toni Collette gives and incredible performance as a manic mother who is mourning the loss of a parent. The supporting cast is fantastic as well and they all have a time to shine at some point in the movie. The movie is also challenging in its themes with relationships between parents and their children always in the forefront. The human drama of this movie far exceeded my expectations and is worthy viewing in its own right.To try and explain why audiences are trashing the film through some mediums (not as much on IMDb, see CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes for example) I think it is important to understand that we live in an impatient culture. Many horror classics of the past like the two I mention earlier weren't fast paced and instead lingered on images and favored slow paced horror. I think the modern horror audience can get restless when presented with a movie like this. I don't think Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist would review very well with broad audiences if they were released today. Secondly, I think the film has succeeded in making people uncomfortable by questioning parent's feelings for their children and how they are displayed. This movie is complex and has a lot to say. Comparing this film to another fantastic horror movie from this year, A Quiet Place, offers a great juxtaposition of this idea. One is very simple in it's premise that quickly gets to the scares while the other takes it's time to build to a climax that may or may not be worth the wait depending on the viewer. Overall, Hereditary offers plenty of horrific imagery and supernatural scares that work as a deeper examination of familial relationships rather than being a string a horror movie cliches.9/10 - excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Frightening soundtrack and brilliant scenery,"Ari Asters 'Hereditary' did impress me more than any other horror movie in the past 3 to 4 years, but I couldn't really figure out why this movie is so unique and terrifying in his own way.I noticed, watching the movie a second time, that especially the soundtrack and several, selectively used sounds manage to terrify the viewer just by themselves. In combination with the simple but effective scenery the movie creates a haunting and paranoid atmosphere. Several, selectively used sounds (clicking with the tongue) left me paranoid for a long time.The movie takes some time for the exposition. The characters are well acted and therefore are the relationships and the individual character developments concrete to the viewer. The movie is mainly focused on a small family, which gives enough space to get to know the characters.Even though the horror is built up by a supernatural force, the real fear lays in the human reaction to that. The horror of 'Hereditary' is created by the human abysses created out of fear and incomprehension towards the unknown.Moreover, the movie takes place in locations, we already now from other horror movie. A huge, but lonely house in the nowhere that has some secrets about it. But this location is outstanding in comparison to other horror movies like 'It', because of the new and simple style of directing the movie.Allover, the realism of the movie and the simplicity make it so unique.Despite the outstanding performance of the movie, I have to critique the pacing towards the end, which seemed to be very hurried and ends the plot quite unsatisfactory.My rating of the movie 'Hereditary' lands on nine out of ten stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Kinda disappointing,"I didn't have a chance to catch this in theater and I've been putting it off since because I wanted to give it my full attention. I've heard so many positive reviews and I thought it looked great from the first trailer but all I got was disappointment.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I definitely don't feel like I wasted those 2+ hours. The acting was great, the story was engaging enough and it definitely tugged on my heartstrings at moments but it was so predictable.
First act was a good build-up. It got me engaged and interested. Second act was the best part of the entire movie and it made me think maybe this could become my new favorite movie. I also got the feeling that this might be that kinda horror that just sticks with me and gets me paranoid for a week afterwards(which I love) but then as the second act moved to a close and the third came in, I got bored. It became predictable. Some of the effects were great but it didn't hit the way it should've because I'd already called it. I found myself counting down to the ""jump scares"" (that weren't jump scares in the classic sense so kudos for that but still just as predictable) and just waiting for the end, which was very anticlimactic.
It's a solid movie but it definitely won't stick with me in any way, shape or form and that's a shame. A real shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Maybe the best psychological horror film,"People that trash this movie or make fun of it are the ones who are too scared to surrender to fear.

Ari Aster is a genius.,"This film is pure horror, and not just with the odd jumpscare or leaning on creepy music. The ideas, the situations, the dialogue. It's all scarily real and relatable and makes seeing the tension and grief uncomfortable.The first half of the film is a slow burner, where you get to understand the characters and the emotions.The second half has some terrifying moments that have stuck with me since I watched it in 2018. There's two particular scenes that terrify me, and I have been watching horror films since I was little.It may not be an ending you expect, but if you enjoy horror films that don't have the normal generic horror trope, then watch this film, alone and at night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I am worried about the state of horror...,"As a long time horror fan I am worried about the state of horror if ""Hereditary"" is considered to be ""one of the best horror movies in XZY decades"".I am not too hard to please when it comes to horror movies, I enjoy bad horror movies equally as great ones, and when I finally got a chance to see Hereditary I went to see it with an open mind.Movie started well with some really nice scene transition so I had my hopes up. ""These people know what they are doing"" I thought to myself. Turns out, while production looked really nice, with few well directed scenes, screenplay and pace were horrible. We are treated with family drama for about 3/4 of the movie with last half an hour being mash of horror scenes. This could work if pace was better and we didn't have to watch long monologues by a lead actress. She did her part well and she literally carries the entire movie, but after second 10 minutes long monologue where I see nothing but her face, my tolerance for her and her character has dropped significantly.Once the horror actually starts, it does get from bad to worse, but as someone who has watched dozens of horror movies I could easily spot ""homages"" (or if you want to call them ripoffs) of scenes from plenty of other horror movies, mainly Conjuring, Exorcist 3 and The Sentinel.Ending is really messy and looks like it was made on spot. It wants to be intelligent, but once you break down the scene you'll realize that someone watched The Conjuring on Monday, Exorcist 3 on Thursday, and watched The Sentinel on Wednesday.Another problem is pace. Some scenes just drag on and on without real reason. I understand that director wanted to establish some atmosphere, however he isn't good at staging suspense so lot of scenes just drag on. Add in that some of those scenes don't really have strong payoff and you get long badly paced scenes with no real plot progression.Some characters just show up and wonder off the movie. I nearly forgot that one such character is even in the movie until he showed up to be cannon fodder. It was supposed to be emotional and horrifying but since we know so little about him it becomes a bad joke.I really don't know how anyone could by into hype. Did bunch of people just said ""It's great!"" without even seeing it, or bars for horror are so low these days that we consider cinematic mess like Hereditary and Insidious to be called ""greatest of XYZ""?",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary,"Hereditary"" tells the story of a family, which is haunted by disturbing events. ""Hereditary"" is a good movie, but it doesn't please the traditional horror audience, as its construction of the story and characters, due to the great suspense and drama, is extremely prolonged and, consequently, boring, for the main audience. However, the film, when inserted into its true horror, is indeed terrifying and disturbing. Another positive point is its mystery and twists, which is admirable as it is built from the beginning of the film. The admirable work of Ari Aster is remarkable in the film, but even so, if the work had bet a little more on horror, in addition to the drama and suspense presented, it would be an icon for the current decade.This movie is good, RT listed it as the 2nd scariest movie of ""all time"" after The Exorcist. That's a bold statement. I noticed that it ""borrowed"" a few things from The Shining and The Exorcist, filming techniques, soundtrack, creepy vibes. I thought Toni Colette is guilty of overacting, trying to capture a Shelley Duvall/Shining kind of terror. I will give it extra points for general creepiness, it had some very weird scenes. Is it the 2nd scariest of All Time. No.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A gut-wrenching nightmare that's not for everyone,"I really didn't know what to expect going in to see this film. I had seen the trailer and all of the good press for it, I adore Toni Collete, and I generally enjoy horror films. I left the theater with a pit in my stomach and came back the next day to see it again; this is a film that rewards multiple viewings.The film began rather predictably, in my opinion. However, the truly unexpected and disorienting end of the first act grabbed my attention and never let up from there. This film digs its hooks in deep and slowly drags you down into a pit of despair. There is a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel, but it isn't what you think. This is the first film in a while to keep me on my toes throughout its runtime, even if its plot isn't groundbreaking. The amazing performances, sublime cinematography, and outrageously outstanding sound design makes this film a real treat for anyone with a special affection for the medium.I've seen many compare this to The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, and I agree mostly with those comparisons. However, I also see this film as a distant relation to the original 1976 Carrie. Both films put family drama at the forefront and milk every ounce of dread from the truly hideous realities of familial cohabitation for what it's worth. What makes these films so stirring isn't jump scares, special FX, or ""payoffs"" to every tense scene they present; it is instead forefronting the all-to-real human tension and making the audience sit with it as uncomfortably as possible. The scenes that stick with me from Carrie aren't just her supernatural revenge at the prom, but the abuse from her mother and the gut-punching shower scene that opens the film. It's those moments of having to experience the very real ugliness of humanity that stir me and stay on my skin for days after seeing a film.My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece and will certainly be joining my list of all-time favorite horror films. However, it is definitely not for everyone. This is a film that's made to stand out to already-avid film fans with an appreciation for the format; those with short-attention spans and/or those accustomed to the mile-a-minute breakneck pace of most horror films won't enjoy this. I also think (and I'm going out on a limb here) that this is a film most readily accessible to those who have already experienced a major physical or existential loss or crisis in their life or are intimate with the feeling of being manipulated. There a lot of reports of people ""giggling"" during the film; I think some of this can be chalked up to the sheer discomfort this film causes, but I also think it may in some cases come from not being able to grasp the logic and affective phenomenon of grief that this film so accurately and exquisitely captures. This film is a meditation on themes of grief, family, manipulation, and ultimately a lack of control. This isn't a film like The Conjuring (which is also one of my favorites) that gives you more than enough ""cues"" to be scared during certain parts of the film; instead, this film relies on your attention to detail and your willingness to be devoured by its sinister textures.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Overrated but worth a watch,"Before watching Hereditary, I read a number of reviews that called it not only the best horror movie in 2018, but a competitor to The Exorcist. This set my expectations far too high, and it took me a while to get past being miffed and acknowledge the film's good qualities. Prepare yourself for an occasionally engaging but uneven film with a few novel twists, and hopefully you won't experience the same level of disappointment.The film is premised on the audience not truly understanding the nature of the characters. However, neither the characters as presented nor their interactions with each other ring true. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) is an artist who builds miniature worlds, often replicating personal environments such as her mother's sickbed. We're expected to believe that her work is in demand and that she is behind in creating new pieces for a gallery showing, but her art exists only as a conceit, a literal demonstration to the audience of her mental state. Her mismatched husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is the world's worst psychiatrist, alternately enabling and ignoring the disturbing behavior of his wife and children. Their teenage son Peter is a stoner with a crush on the girl who sits in front of him. He is the most authentic of the family members, but the decisions forced upon him by the script - most of them related to Peter's sister Charlie - highlight that he exists only on film.Charlie is the most contrived of the lot, and it's not because of the reasons provided by the movie. Her matted, unwashed bob and cheap, oversized clothing are too shabby for a homeless girl, let alone one from an upper middle class home. It's impossible to believe that she is 13, let alone a girl who would attend (and whose mother would insist she attend) a high school party with drugs and booze. None of the revelations about Charlie fit with the developmentally delayed misfit portrayed.It's difficult to divulge more about the film's shortcomings without including spoilers. The positives are that the pace is relatively quick; there are some enjoyable jump scares; and regardless of its logic, the ending is unpredictable. Paying close attention to the narrative and settings from the outset will make the final discoveries more rewarding.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Brilliant Mix: Mystery and Horror,"Could have been an 8.

The twists, turns and surprises arrive one after the other, and none of it seemed contrived. The worst part was the teenage boy's fear and Fake tears; not just once but several times. I found that I had been rooting for one character and booing for another only to have reverse myself- a sign of a an entertaining 90 minutes. After the finale, the audience can now see the repeated signs foreshadowing the end, but this is only evident at the end. But the audience can still be piecing it together kine brilliantly crafted puzzle with pieces that only now fit perfectly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A gripping, unconventional and an unsettling movie, Hereditary is one of the best horror movies I've seen so far this decade.","I don't know why I decided to watch this gem at 3 in the morning. This is one of the best horror movies so far this decade, it doesn't rely on jumpscares or loud noises like most horror films its more of an unconventional masterpiece. I loved the tension created in this movie and the editing choices were phenomenal and actually unsettled me alot. The acting in this movie is superb especially by the females in particular Toni Collette who actually in my opinion gives the best female performance of the year. The film does not feel claustrophobic but it does feel contained in these particular locations which adds to the horror of this movie. This is Ari Aster's first feature lenght movie as a director and now he's on my radar I can't wait to see what he does next because he has crafted this movie to almost perfection. The ending has to be the best but also the most unnerving endings I've seen. The only flaw I can think of is the exposition which I get it that in such movies characters have to speak out the exposition but I felt this movie would've been better with less vocal exposition like The Shining. In the end, Hereditary is a very gripping, unnerving and unconventional horror film the best infact since The Babadook, it combines the elements of art house and horror very well and its a must watch for all horror fans but viewer discretion is advised because of it's disturbing nature. I give it an ""A+"" and ""9.5/10"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Hellish, Terrifying, Perfect","I don't even know where to begin with this one. When I heard that it was being made by some of the same people who worked on The Witch (which some people didn't like, but I liked it), I had high hope for this film, and boy was I not disappointed. Such a breath of fresh air for the genre in a time where Hollywood has prostituted it and released nothing but garbage. Not only was the film scary as hell, but it also had a lot to say about grief and trauma. The way the film is put together is its strongest part. The pacing, the editing, the cinematography, and the sound design all worked together to create a truly unique and hellish vision of horror. I'm a horror veteran, and rarely actually jump or feel tense, but this film made me feel like a horror virgin again, actually frightening me like no other Hollywood film can.The acting was also superb all around and only adds to the horror being presented on screen. Each character was unique and added their own style to this modern horror masterpiece. I saw many people in the theater jumping and looking away, some being grown men. A couple people even left, and I can't imagine its because they felt it was a bad film, because it was not.

"Not bad, but not the masterpiece the critics make this out to be","""Hereditary"" (2018 release; 120 min.) brings the story of the Graham family. As the movie opens, we get to know Annie and Steve, and their teenage kids Peter and Charlie, as they attend the funeral of Annie's mom Ellen. Annie is surprised at the many people attending the funeral that shoe doesn't know. It's clear that Annie and her mom didn't have the best relationship, and Annie doesn't feel too sad about her mom passing. Meanwhile Peter is wanting to attend a party at a friend's house. Annie agrees but forces him to take along his younger sister, with disastrous consequences... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature-length film of writer-director Ari Aster. He brings us a tale of spiritualism gone horribly awry, and that;s about all I can say without spoiling anything. Let me be upfront: if it weren't for the off-the-charts ratings (currently at 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), I would not have gone to see this. But curiosity got the better of me when I saw this near-universal critical acclaim. What I got was a horror movie that is certainly not bad, but neither is it the masterpiece that the critic makes this out to be, and in fact ""Hereditary"" is not nearly as good as some other recent, far more clever and original, horror movies such as ""Get Out"", ""A Quiet Place, ""or ""It Comes At Night"", just to name those. Kudos to Toni Colette, who is outstanding as Annie, making this movie feel more authentic that it actually is. Last but certainly not least, there is a terrific, one might say classic, score, and imagine my surprise when I saw in the end titles that the score is composed by Colin Stetson, wow! I will need to check out the score for sure.""Hereditary"" opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. In fact, the early box office reports are that the movie did better than expected/projected, grossing $13 mill (against a budget for a mere $10 mill). Bottom line: if you like horror movies, or are simply in the mood for one, I'd say keep your expectations in check as you see this out at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This film deserved a Best Picture nomination, but sadly this genre is always overlooked. And I'm sure Toni Collette was better than any actress nominated that year. Having said all that, this movie is not for everyone. It's just too horrific. However, I will certainly watch every film director Ari Aster creates. This was his first job directing and he's made a boldly terrifying masterpiece, so he's set the bar very high for himself. Its what I would call stunningly confident writing/directing. Bold choices.

"7.1/10 - A Creative, Creepy Portrayal of Repression","""I am not sleepwalking anymore.""Yeah, I mean, it's pretty good. Also, you know, not so long ago I literally couldn't watch horror films, but I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job in overcoming this genre barrier XD The Shining, now this one. Maybe more to come. We'll see.Anyway, Hereditary is a horror film which tells the story of the Grahams, a family with a toxic habit to repress their problems instead of confronting them. After the death of the grandmother of the family (the mother of the family's mom) weird things start to happen to the family members, things that seem to push the already crumbling family over the edge.I don't have many issues with the film, I guess. There's a certain climactic moment with weird score in the background. Like, it doesn't fit it very well and it feels even ridicolous in a way. And, maybe sometimes there are bits of dialogue that feel somewhat artificial (either because of the writing, the delivery or both) but it's not common in the film to be a major issue. And I guess that it does work narrative-wise most of the time, so it's not a big deal.Moving on, I really like how the film handles the whole repression theme in multiple layers. It's simple once you get it, but it's still quite effective. I can't really dive into how the film does that without spoiling it, but I will say that it does so very well. It shows both in the traumas the family had in the past, the thing they're going through now and how they confront it all (they don't). This is the main thing (aside from the plot itself and the mystery etc) that makes this movie work the way it does.The last 20-25 minutes or so of the film are great, too. They're creepy, intense and thrilling. The cinematography of the film is alright+ most of the time, but as we're getting closer to the end the cinematography gets better and better. The camerawork really shines during that part of the film.The acting of the four main characters is very solid as well. All of the actors of the family member bring them to life in a way that fits the characters very well. Great casting, by the way.So, yeah. I don't think that any element of the film is phenomenal, but it accomplishes what it tries to in my opinion. Most aspects of the film are decent overall, and its portrayal of repression is genuinely creative. I'm feeling a 7.1/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cant stop thinking about it,"This movie is a puzzle that you have to put together yourself. Every shot and every sequence has meaning and there is so much to think about after seeing this movie.

Definitely one of the greatest horror films released for some years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary truly is scary. It throws you into a nightmare and understands the simple fear of mental illness,"Having a mental illness is enough to be frightening. When you're in that state in which you have no idea whether your thoughts are your own or a manifestation of the illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar, or even depression. All these can cause sudden changes that are never that of the person's character, but of the cause of a chemical imbalance. Now how about we add a supernatural element into the mix, and you have another layer of mystery. You may notice that a lot of the best ghost stories include people that usually have a mental illness or a secret background. Either elements cleverly add to unbalance of the character, making their situation and our viewpoint as an audience more frightening.Movies like The Haunting, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and The Conjuring feature characters with the previously stated attributes that added to the film's suspenseful tone without going too over-the-top. One notion that's not addressed too often in movies about mental illness is the hereditary aspect. Those of us who've grown up with a family history of that can be scared themselves that destiny will force them with the same problems. Hereditary brilliantly adds many layers to that fear along with a ghost story.A miniature artist Annie Graham (played by Toni Collette) is in the middle of dealing with her mother Ellen's passing. At the funeral, she mentions that she had a shaky relationship with her, who in return, was a private woman. Her family includes husband Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), teenage son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (played by Milly Shaprio). In addition to her daughter being a reclusive oddball, she reveals at a support group that her family has had a history of mental illness. Annie also starts seeing her mother in random spots in the house (even though no one else can see her).Another family tragedy ends up pushing Annie's mental state further until she meets a woman Joan who tells her that the dead can be contacted through a séance. Annie then uses the tricks taught to her to show the family that it's real. Time passes by as more images of the family are heard and seen in ghostly form while the living members each go through their own trials that reveal more about Ellen.Like a lot of horror movies, what's best is what you don't know and Hereditary has those necessary layers. Let's address the most important aspect of it, the characters. Toni Collette proves again that she take the typical ""mom"" trope and give it that extra weight. It helps that along with her family history and the fact she does have a lot on her belt, she still has the motivation to dig deeper on what's going on. This makes the story just as interesting to us as it is to her. Peter Wolff, fresh from the recent Jumanji, looks a little old, but he also balances the stress of being a teenager and the dilemma that he's facing. Finally, I have to give a lot of points to Milly Shapiro for playing what has too be one of the more unsettling performances of the movie.Where Hereditary shines is in it's tone and atmosphere. Walking into this movie is like walking into a true nightmare. There aren't any big fantasy-like set pieces or even a gothic house, but it takes the kind of household you might see from an upper class family and make it feel so uncomfortable and unfamiliar that moving forward is like taking a deep breath. It all relies beautifully on the story, which I cannot spoil, but adjusts to the overall mood.Finally, what makes Hereditary such an unforgiving, not pleasant experience is how much it understands the human mind above ghosts. It understands that when we lose someone, we always want to see them one more time, but shudder at the idea of them coming back. It's that genuine feeling of feeling alone in a familiar environment that makes it scary.I'll admit that without spoiling anything, the movie's distinct 2 acts will feel jarring for a mainstream audience expecting one outcome. I really enjoyed this and I think a lot of horror fans will do so too, but I can see this being disliked by people who expect something more straightforward.I'll give this nine miniature rooms out of ten. I really liked Hereditary. We seem to be living in an era where the best original ideas come from the horror genre. This adds to the originality we're capable of. If your up for walking into a nightmare, see Hereditary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Incredibly boring, dull, monotonous, no fear or terror or horror at all, just boredom","If you do like me and read some 'big' critics before embarking on a film, you can end up reading things like this:
""a sensationally scary debut feature by Ari Aster, is unhappy in ways that Tolstoy could never have dreamed"", or
""this horror flick can be so shocking and dismaying, so genuinely upsetting in spasms and spurts, yet at the same time so madly entertaining""Do not be fooled fellow imdbians, with more than two full hours, this film has you yawning for more than 60 full minutes before something happens.

The kind of horror that lasts,"Let me start this off by saying I did not enjoy The Witch. Too slow of a burn for me. Hereditary on the other hand was brilliant. Started off slow which had me worried but this movie was more willing to explore the supernatural element and when they went for it, they really went for it. No cheap scares here, thick tension building atmosphere and bread crumbs of clues lead up to one of the most intense final acts I have seen in awhile. An instant classic in my book, a horror movie that takes it self seriously (as does every actor and actress involved) and demands your respect. Go see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

As there are many horror films and watched most of them, this one hits me differently from the others.The procedure is, the picture goes slowly and the frightening scenes are too creepy to watch they slowly attract the viewer's attention and intensely tease to scare them all around.Dare to watch it at night alone! Kudos to the cast and the team for giving this masterpiece nightmare.I am giving a rating of 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A nightmare brought to life,"Hereditary is not just your average horror movie. It's a nightmare brought to life on the big screen. From the very start, it lays the groundwork for a chilling and unsettling atmosphere that never lets up. If you're a fan of jump scares, then prepare to spend most of this film jumping out of your seat in terror.The film follows the story of a family who after the matriarch dies, are plagued by a series of disturbing and deadly occurrences that seem to be linked to their ancestral past. As the movie progresses, the audience is taken on a journey into the very depths of madness and despair. The creepiness factor is cranked up to maximum as the tension builds and the stakes become higher and higher.The cinematography is breathtaking. The way the camera glides from one scene to another, creating a sense of disorientation that is both scary and impressive. The lighting always seems to be just right, adding to the overall eerie tone of the movie. The sound design is likewise terrifying, with a bone-chilling score that gives the entire film a sense of dread.The acting is superb, with Toni Collette delivering an outstanding performance as the grief-stricken mother who is slowly unraveling before our eyes. Her terror is palpable, and the pain she feels is almost too much to bear. The entire cast provides excellent support, making the film a complete and cohesive unit.In conclusion, if you're in the mood for a truly scary horror movie, then Hereditary is a must-see. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, heart racing, and mind reeling until the very end. Just be prepared for the nightmares that may follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Guess I'll be the one,"I was not impressed by this movie. I see theres only 6 other reviews and they all seem to think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Now I'm not saying it's bad, it isn't, I just didn't think it was anything special. I will give it credit for not relying on jump scares like most horror nowadays does. I saw what they were going for, that dark, high tension, more of a psychological scare, it just didn't get there for me. And then towards the end it seemed to turn into an 80s satanic panic movie which made for great comedy but not horror.The actors were fine but no standouts for me. The only one I knew was Ann Dowd who I loved from The Leftovers. Her character was a bit of a cliche and she played it that way. I think that was on purpose, if so she did it well. If not, well.... sorry Ann, I still love ya. One casting that really bugged me was the guy who played Peter, he's supposed to be in high school but the kid looks 30! In one scene he tells his mom ""we're not even old enough to drink"" and I'm thinking - kid you would have no trouble buying alcohol.Am I glad I saw it? Sure, especially an advanced screening, always fun to see movies before other people. Would I bother to see it again? Nope. I think my suggestion would be to not spend the money to go to the theater. I'm sure it will be on dvd/blu/ondemand soon enough, just rent it. It's worth a rental",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There are so many subtle aspects that blow your mind. And as far as first movies go, it's very impressive.What keeps me from giving it a 10 is the fact Alex Wolff sucks at points. He could look scared, but he couldn't cry. No one else was bad at any point. Not even the little girl! She was actually great! Toni Collette steals the show, though! The computer generated effects were inconsistent. Some looked, some looked pretty good. I also didn't find the movie scary.

"A dark, trippy, bizarre freakout!","What a bizarre, trippy movie. Lots of very dark imagery and themes, and an oddball cast to make it that much more of a standout. First, there's Charlie, the odd looking, awkward pre/early teen with a peanut allergy that results in one of the most starling scenes. Right away, you know something about her just isn't right, but if anyone had doubts then it would be confirmed when she cuts off the head of a bird that splats into her classroom window. The parents are two extremes with mom being some sort of artist who carves very detailed miniature settings. She's very high strung, rambling and reactionary, bursting with angry monologues and panicked pleas. Played by the always intriguing Toni Colette, her performance will raise anyone's blood pressure. The dad is a dullard who doesn't want to hear or do anything out the ordinary and prefers just to think of his wife as nuts. The actor playing the son, Peter, was an odd choice, for sure. He's clearly of Indian descent but he's supposed to be the biological son of these very white parents. And when he gets upset and cries, he sounds ridiculously like a child faking it. Toss all of this into a story about decapitations and demon worship, you get one disturbingly surreal piece of horror.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unraveling the Threads of Terror: A Haunting Dive into 'Hereditary',"In the realm of horror, few films manage to leave an indelible mark on the psyche as Ari Aster's ""Hereditary"" does. It's a film that burrows under the skin, not with cheap thrills or gore, but through a meticulous orchestration of dread that crescendos into a symphony of terror. Aster's command of the medium is evident in every frame, every cut, and every hushed whisper that echoes through the corridors of the Graham family's home.The film opens with a funeral, an event that is often a precursor to the unveiling of family secrets and buried resentments. Toni Collette's portrayal of Annie, a mother grappling with grief and guilt, is a tour de force. Her performance is a high-wire act of emotional vulnerability that anchors the film's supernatural elements in a harrowing reality. The subtlety with which she conveys the fracturing of her character's psyche is nothing short of masterful.Aster's narrative is a slow burn, one that takes its time to immerse the viewer in the Graham family's world. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the tension to simmer and build. The cinematography, with lingering shots that suggest a presence just out of sight, a voyeuristic glimpse into a family's unraveling. The use of miniatures, reflecting Annie's profession as a miniature artist, serves as a clever metaphor for the family's lack of control over their lives, manipulated by unseen hands.The supporting cast is equally compelling. Alex Wolff's portrayal of Peter, a teenager consumed by guilt and confusion, is heartbreakingly authentic. Milly Shapiro gives a chilling performance as Charlie, whose peculiarities and unsettling actions hint at the darkness to come. Gabriel Byrne, as the stoic father trying to keep his family from disintegrating, provides a grounding presence amid the chaos.The film's sound design deserves special mention. The score, by Colin Stetson, is a haunting accompaniment to the visual terror, while the sound effects amplify the sense of unease. The clucking noise that becomes synonymous with impending doom is a testament to the power of auditory cues in horror cinema.The film's reliance on genre conventions in its final act feels at odds with the originality of its preceding narrative. The denouement, while shocking, veers into territory that may leave some viewers feeling disconnected from the emotional journey they've been on. The shift from a nuanced exploration of grief to a more conventional horror climax is jarring and, for some, may undermine the film's otherwise meticulously crafted atmosphere.""Hereditary"" stands as a testament to the potential of horror to not only scare but to also probe the depths of our collective anxieties. It's a film that respects the intelligence of its audience, challenging viewers to confront the hereditary demons that lurk within all of us. While it may stumble in its final moments, the journey there is a masterclass in psychological horror, a haunting tapestry woven from the threads of an all-too-human terror.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THIS WILL SCARE YOU!,In of this genre and I watch all kinds of Horror movies. I have seen so much horror that I have become immune to horror movies now. Ordinary scares do not unnerve me anymore.

"Good Acting, Visually Disturbing, But Makes No Sense","Personally I think Toni Collette should at least be nominated for an Oscar for her performance here. She really nails a mentally unstable person going off the deep end. Unfortunately the movie itself might be better considered for a Razzie. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a movie about the delusions of a crazy person ala BUG or is it about something truly supernatural--or both? I'm betting it's trying to be both but, eh, that just doesn't work because in that case you can't follow anything, nothing makes sense and you can't really get too invested in the characters because you don't know if they're coming out of right or left field. And this film is way too long. At over two hours to be honest, it gets kind of boring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"One of the best, most terryifing horror films I have ever seen - WORTH THE HYPE","Where to even start with this absolute roar of a film. I'll just go ahead and say this - Hereditary is absolutely brilliant. Just brilliant. It is a terrifying film written and directed by first-time director Ari Aster and stars Toni Collette in her finest role yet about the disintegration of a family. To say more about the plot would be too cruel - but, allow me to reiterate, Hereditary is TERRIFYING and one of the best horror films I've ever seen in my life.What I love so much about this film is it takes its time to introduce us to the characters - we get a sense of who the characters are within the first 20 minutes. It sets up the characters and develops them in a way that we don't usually see in horror films. Usually, they cut straight to incessant, annoying jump scares and give no backstory or character development. Hereditary makes you FEEL for the characters, so when you see their lives go awry, you truly feel it - psychologically and emotionally, because you really do care about these characters.The film only has a handful of jumpscares and relies much more on psychological tricks to mess with your mind. The film is incredibly intense and uncomfortable to watch for the first 80 or so minutes, before transitioning into full-blown Lynchian horror in the last 40. It never pulls back - the horror is traumatic, cruel, and relentless. It does not allow you to breathe - once it pulls you in with its cinematic tricks, you're stuck. Pure arthouse magic.It also has a very human side to it. All supernatural occurrences aside, it is at its heart an exploration into grief, and how grief is almost like a ghost, haunting the entire family. It is also a film about how grief is dealt with, and what lengths people would go to stop grieving.The score, cinematography and lighting is just brilliant. Ari Aster has set himself up for a talent not to be ignored. The fact that this is his first feature film is INSANE. The film is so well directed, you never would have guessed this is Ari Aster's first film. Brilliant.I will say this though - Hereditary is not a 'fun' horror movie like most, - you can't go in and expect to be thrilled. No, instead, the film is dark, depressing, disturbing, hard to watch and incredibly unbearable with its intensity levels. I did, at some points, especially during the traumatizing finale, want to leave the cinema because it simply became too much to handle for me. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad thing at all though.Overall, HEREDITARY is just terrifying. It grips you and doesn't let you go and just when you think it cannot get more shocking and disturbing, it does. Hereditary is truly a must watch and changes the game for modern, arthouse horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterpiece in Horror,"In an era where horror movies often rely on jump scares and clichéd tropes, this film stands out as a perfect horror masterpiece. From the very beginning, I was captivated by the natural and outstanding performances of the entire cast. The well-thought-out script and exemplary direction created a suspenseful yet unhurried pace that allowed the story to unfold with an organic and engrossing flow.The film's slow build-up masterfully heightened the tension, keeping me glued to the screen all the way through. What truly sets this movie apart is its powerful impact achieved without any over-dramatization. The subtlety and nuance in the storytelling made the presence of evil palpable and all-consuming, proving that true horror lies in the unseen and the psychological.In essence, this movie is a testament to the art of horror filmmaking, demonstrating that evil truly does rule you as you watch.

Hereditary Review.,"After taking a break of around 7 years from watching movies I decided to start collecting horror movies again. This was the first one that I watched after my return, and I was impressed! So many horror movies these days have horrendous plots or just try to scare you with gore and most of the time it just doesn't work. This movie was definitely a slow burner and at times it didn't even feel like I was watching a horror movie, but I think this adds to the suspense. You're always expecting something to happen, but you don't know when. The plot slowly unravels as the film goes on and more and more of it begins to make sense as it goes on. It's creepy. There are some really good horror scenes (without giving anything away) and it will definitely affect a lot of people in the way that a true horror movie should! There are some pretty disturbing scenes, you will love it if you're into this kind of thing. Toni Colette was phenomenal by the way and Gabriel Byrne (from Stigmata) also puts on a good performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The plot of this film was neither boring or dry, it was slow for the first twenty minutes, however that doesn't matter, the rest of the film sent me into a state of shock.

An Unconventional Horror Thrill Ride,"In this age of horror being very much reliant on the gimmicks and unique right hooks to the audience to get them into the seats, it's not entirely common that one sees a good old fashioned spook-house horror film.No gimmicks. No twists. Just a film that does its absolute best to get your skin crawling, nerves tightened, and heart pounding.'Hereditary', as you may imagine, is one of those films.'Hereditary' is about as simple as a horror movie nowadays can come; terrible circumstances befall a seemingly ordinary family, these circumstances lead to discoveries of something terrible in their family tree, and soon enough things come apart rather quickly.What this film excels at is all in the technicals. The performances are all beyond convincing and do the job selling the understated terror this film has to offer. Specifically, Toni Collette delivers in a manner that had even my skin crawling.What is also noticeable when it comes to this film's strengths is the excellent cinematography. While it is perhaps not as flashy and noticeable as 'Upgrade' and its revolutionary camera-work that I raved about, this film accomplishes a more suitable sense of suspense and nerve-wracking tension through it. Whether in-motion or standing completely still, the camera makes itself apparent in this film and works beyond effectively.The only thing of it is, this film is not for you if you prefer a straightforward and conventional horror film. The first act is very much a slow burn, while the rest of the film builds its horror and tension in ways that I do not believe a general audience would appreciate quite as much. It's not abstract, but considering it lacks the conventions of jumpscares and instead relies on atmosphere, mood, and its performances to scare...that perhaps explains a bit why the film is striking the general audience as so polarizing.But, if you can appreciate a slow, creepy, atmospheric film that aims directly to make your skin crawl and make you shuffle in your seat, I think you'll truly enjoy the ride this film takes you on.Unconventional, scary as hell, but perhaps not perfect in what it aspires to do, 'Hereditary' is still a scary time for all the right reasons.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horror is to be scared, horrified, terrified; you talk out of the movies and you watch every step you take, you listen because you expect it to happen to you next. Hereditary was good, it had a 2 good little for newbies scares. It has more SHOCK, WHAT THE HECK just happened scenes than horror. The movie left you wanting to know what was ""F"" was going on. That is why I am writing this. It is not a horror movie and any REAL DIEHARD horror buff/fan will agree with me. If you want to watch a good suspense mystery thriller then watch this movie.

Hope for 21st century horror ? Debatable.,"The movie is pretty good but not incredible.
I watched it with my sister and I guess the average audience member would find it disturbing- though I'm racking my brain as to why.
I appreciated the minimal use of CGI and their use of old school methods for effects- many modern horror films go so far they seem larger than life and unreal, this film didn't strike me that easyI found all of the actors well suited for their roles and the story wasn't a carbon copy of every other supernatural film- specifically those produced in the last 10 years.Unfortunately, I was left unimpressed. It ended with many things unexplained- not in a ""waiting for more"" way, rather a ""this was just something they decided to include but had nothing to do with the progression of the film.""If you're an avid horror fan, this movies good but won't shock you.

The Most Horrifying Film I've Ever Seen,"This movie comes as close to perfect as any horror movie can. What was most surprising about this movie was the comedy. The actors were so skilled that your stomach would be turning with disgust one minute, and then suddenly the entire theatre is laughing at what often felt like a genuinely improvised line. Alex Wolff deserves all the praise he's been afforded so far for this movie, because even though he's a young actor, he stole the film through the second act. Toni Colett was astounding, to say the least. Unlike other reviewers, I actually found the ending surpremely appropriate. Having gone into this movie with no spoilers besides the trailer on a pre-opening viewing, I was one of many audience members in my theatre who literally ended up making commentary as the movie reel rolled, such was our disbelief. Every expectation I had was wrong, in the most disturbing, blood-curdling way possible. I normally hate when people talk in the theatre, but this movie was so disturbing and shocking to fresh viewers that it was a forgone conclusion. This is one of those films that you HAVE to talk about when you witness it. I recommend seeing it without any spoilers revealed, so you can really experience the horror of the storyline unfolding. Even though I'm an adult, I refused to sleep alone once I got home from Hereditary. A movie hasn't rattled me like that since seeing my very first horror movie at the age of 9, the original Friday the 13th. This film will follow you to your car, stay with you as you drive home with white knuckles and paranoia, and rest on your shoulders with a profound sense of unease once you eventually find yourself in the dark. I'm thankful I saw it, but I don't think I could ever take watching it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good acting but the story is less than convincing,"'Hereditary' contains some effective scare scenes but, rather like a lot of modern day horror films, the focus seems to be on maximising the effect of the jump scares rather than constructing a sound and convincing plot. While it's clear that some effort was put into developing the story and characters early on, I thought the storyline was messy, over-the-top and even quite silly towards the end.By far the most impressive aspect of 'Hereditary' is the acting. Toni Collette has always impressed me in the roles I've seen her in previously and she is again excellent in the lead role in this film.

I don't mean that as a criticism, I just simply think it's quite a bonkers film, very in your face and unapologetic about its intentions. Immediately after it was over I declared this this was the David Lynch of horror films. I struggle to think of another film in this genre that was as puzzling and mystifying as this.

WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,"Have never been more disappointed in a movie. I always tell myself not to listen to the hype...and I did...to my own detriment.
Great cast...and started off well, but after first shock (when I was thinking ooooooo! Things are heating up, we're in for a thrill ride!)...it all turned into some kind of long-winded drawn out ball of nothingness...
Wanted to leave...in hindsight - should have left, but thought i'd Better wait to see if there was a pay off in the end...NOPE!

On my top 20 horror movies of all time list.,"This is not a monsters jumping out of darkness going ""boo"" type of horror movie. Don't come into this thinking it's a sensationalist monster-makeup horror movie or a jump-scare horror movie. It's so much more than that. Two things make this movie fantastic. First, it's a meditation on anguish so real and believable that it's really hard to take at times. Toni Collette delivers a scene of overwhelming pain and anguish that could win her an Oscar. So much pain that, to borrow from Col. Walter E. Kurtz, ""I wanted to rip my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do."" It's just a damned good movie about loss and pain, to say nothing of it being a truly creepy horror story. Second, the pacing is phenomenal. It's a slow burn at first, in which the creep-factor slowly builds. By the time you reach the climax...I don't know, I'll just say that my jaw literally dropped open once the climax started.I'm a horror junkie. I love all kinds of horror movies from comedy-horror like Cabin in the Woods to paranoid horror like John Carpenter's The Thing to out-and-out silly horror like Dead Alive to drama horror like Rosemary's Baby. This is something more like Rosemary's Baby. Rosemary's Baby was fantastic not just because it was about a woman giving birth to the anti-Christ, but because it was a claustrophobic vision of the social powerlessness of being a woman in 1960s America. This is like that. It's going to be a horror classic for sure. I can't decide where it fits in my list of all-time favorite horror movies, but it's top 20 at least.It's also a movie you need to see twice. Honestly, though, I'm going to have to give it a minute before I see it again. It's pretty rough (in a good way).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A shocking, disturbing, and genuinely terrifying glimpse into madness and grief","When the crowd starts hailing a new film as a ""masterpiece of horror,"" skeptic heads will turn. I'm a lifelong horror junkie and when I saw the (intentionally misleading) trailer for this movie I knew I had to see it. A24 has made some excellent horror entries in recent years and I expected another unique combination of both real scares and a really good film. I wasn't disappointed.The acting is exceptional. Toni Colette (as Anne Graham) flexes her potential and gives a frightening performance that channels all the anxiety and grief her character experiences. Alex Wolff surpasses expectations, and Gabriel Byrne does a fine job as well. The effect of their great performances is that you are entranced by the horror unfolding within their family - and you yourself are helplessly trapped along for the ride.I don't want to spoil anything and you should see Hereditary as blind as possible. It is truly a film of nightmarish proportions and I found myself nervously giggling like a paranoid child during two or three particular scenes. A large man to my left chuckled a couple of times in the first hour of the film, but was audibly afraid once the terror began to ramp up. At different points I was shocked, horrified, and wrought with anxiety, as director Ari Aster works to build the tension in a dream-like fashion until your nerves are bent to their breaking point.You won't find undeserved jump-scares or cheesy tropes in Hereditary. If you're a fan of psychological horror, supernatural horror, or really just good horror in general, this film will show you what kind of fear 127 minutes of runtime can induce. It is well-paced, craftily shot, and often very subtle in its detailing, and I am sure a re-watch will reveal some thoughtful or scary touches I missed before. And the scenes that are built to shock you will indeed do just that. This is the kind of film that shows you something unbelievably horrifying - and then makes you look at it for just a little too long.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the most disturbing horror movies in years,"A family is torn asunder when the oldest matriarch dies, leaving the living to deal with dark secrets and disturbing and tragic occurrences that follow after her death. THat's the simplest way I can explain the plot without giving away spoilers.I've seen a lot of horror movies, and recently, following movies like A Quiet Place, Get Out, Don't Breath, It, and It follows among others, I've noticed that horror films have come back in a big way. All of the movies I've mentioned above were good films in their own right, showing that horror films are still as strong as ever, but none of those mentioned films disturbed me in the way that Hereditary did.From the very first scene in Hereditary you are uncomfortable, and that feeling only becomes worse as the movie progresses in a slow burn. THere is a creeping dread throughout the film's entire run, which only increases and explodes in some shocking scenes that you might think you're ready for, but you are not. THis film is still on my mind after seeing it days ago, and that is a sure sign of a classic horror film in the making.THe performances are all excellent, so they all stand out in their own ways. I can't say that any one was better than the other. THe actors gave it their awe, and you can't ask for more than that.Some people will wonder why I've given it a 9 instead of a 10, and the reason for that is this movie takes a turn towards the climax which might not fit in this day and age. I understand it, but in an age of electronics it might not work for most people unless they are willing to think back in times when technology didn't exist as it does now. THis movie was a lot like 2017s The Witch, and takes themes from past horror films of the 60s and 70s as well. I'm looking forward to seeing this director do more films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spiraling,"At its best, Hereditary is amazing, some scenes and sequences are beautifully crafted; no, seriously, the way this movie presents itself is perfect and I doubt (but hope) we're going to see another movie this year with as good of presentation. The camera work during some scenes is great, some shots linger on a characters reaction to an event, rather than the event itself, or instead of turning the camera towards a focal point, they instead follow the characters head as they turn towards it, almost teasing you and it works so so so well. I also LOVED the framing and the way they worked certain figures into the shadows, most dumb horror movies slam a black silhouette dead center, but this is so subtle sometimes that I wonder if there were a few that I missed entirely, and the ones that I did catch were very chilling. All of the acting (except Wolff) was exceptional, both Millie Shapiro and Toni Collette really shine and make this movie what it is, their performances could not have been better and I never once questioned them. This film is unique in so many ways and most of the time really manages to stay away from the dumb tropes from other movies in its genre... most of the time. At its worst, Hereditary has some pretty dumb moments, a few of them, and although typically not immersion breaking, they do drag it down slightly and make me wish they had done something (or anything) differently, a few of those moments falling directly into the cliche scenes it was trying to avoid, and felt like a Paranormal Activity movie. I also feel the movie ruined what could have been a 10/10 ending. Had the final 3 minutes of the film not contained a single spoken word, it would have been outstanding. I'm so upset that they took the route of completely over explaining what was happening and it definitely broke all of the immersion that had pulled me in. In conclusion, Hereditary is a riveting and spiraling film that is definitely the very best in its sub-genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overhyped nonsense,"Supernatural horror movie about a disfunctional famiy living in a big house out in the woods. When death comes it reeks havoc. 
To say that this is a slow burn would be an understatement, very little happens horror wise in the first hour. If you're still awake eventually supernatural things start to happen. It could have been really good but it just goes off kilter by having a silly finale, which left me and other viewers scratching their heads. 
There are a few effective shocking moments and young Milly Shapiro does a great job of playing a creepy 13 year old. But the scariest thing for me was the horrible facial contortions of Toni Collette every time she gets angry.

Give Toni Collette an Oscar Please,"Toni Collette, one of the best actresses currently in the business, is giving one of the best performances of the year in this high-strung horror movie.She plays the deeply troubled matriarch of a disintegrating family, struggling against a legacy of possibly inherited mental illness as well as her own unresolved feelings about the death of her mother and her maternal inadequacies. Things are already looking fairly bleak for this family when an unimaginable tragedy occurs, hastening the downward spiral of Collette's character. But she finds solace when she's befriended by a woman who's into spiritualism and who teaches Collette how to commune with the dead. That's when the proverbial poop really hits the fan.""Hereditary"" belongs to that sub-genre of horror movies currently in vogue and that includes films like ""The Babadook,"" ""The Witch,"" and ""It Follows,"" where the scares can all be accepted at face value or viewed as stand ins for bigger emotions and themes. In ""Hereditary,"" the horror that unfolds is as much about grief and the ever-present fear mothers have that they're failing their families in some way as it is about any of the literal things happening on screen. Indeed, as the movie gets closer to its conclusion, and the filmmakers feel more obligated to explain all the mystery, the film gets less scary. No, for me the two scariest moments in the film are monologues delivered by Toni Collette, one to a grief support group in which she elaborates on the history of her family, and the other a confession she makes to a friend about her feelings about her children. Both are bone chilling, and far scarier than the more traditionally scary things that occur later in the film. The unexplored terrain of the human mind will always be more frightening to me than any supernatural oogie boogies.And shout out to Ann Dowd as the spiritualist friend, who's friendly as can be in all of her scenes but nevertheless leaves the impression of having been terrifying.

Uneasy,"HEREDITARY
RATING: 3.7/5They really need a sub category for these kind of so called ""horror"" movies because this is the same thing that happened to ""mother!"" Apparently, HEREDITARY was marketed as the ""scariest movie ever,"" which it is not, by far. There is horror imagery and an uneasy feeling throughout a lot of the film, but there's never anything really scary, and I'm not just talking about the lack of a single jump scare. Guess you could just call this kind of movie ""Horror Lite,"" where they're not really hitting you with jump scares but you're probably not gonna leave the theater feeling happy go lucky either... i guess if ghosts make you uncomfortable, you might find it scary, but that's on you, cause the film definitely ain't trying to make you jump out of your seat.The film is pretty long too, for the amount of story you're getting, it's over 2 hours. They could have tightened up some things and maybe picked up the pace a little. Apparently, the director left 30 scenes on the cutting room floor and the original cut was 3 hours long. 1 hour cut from the film, and a lot of it still felt like setup, setup, setup, so it could then lose its mind in the 3rd Act the same way ""mother!"" did towards the end. The overall message of the film feels lost. If I had to guess, you could argue that the message is, you can't escape your family's history, even after they die, unless you're willing to completely let them go. Or something along those lines perhaps, but it doesn't feel earned, and that's the problem.On the positive side, the acting is pretty solid. The family does a pretty good job of portraying their grief and dysfunction. They do it so well in fact, that for a little while i forgot that i was technically watching a horror lite film. It's like they stepped into some depressing indie film for a bit, until they were forced to come back to the horror genre. That probably wouldn't have happened if the film was paced better. The music also does a good job of accentuating the uneasiness throughout.The more i think about the film the more it just doesn't hold up to scrutiny as a horror film, and i think that's what's hurting it the most. Hereditary falls under the horror genre but it doesn't feel like it's trying to scare you for the majority of the film, it just wants to make you feel uncomfortable, like really uncomfortable. If they were gonna cut an hour off the original cut, then it needed another two or three passes to work out all the kinks. I'm honestly curious how different the 3 hour cut is, but as it stands now, Hereditary is not a very scary movie despite the horror elements in it. Be warned though, despite it not being very scary, some of the imagery may stick with you because it is a well crafted movie. If you do decide to go see it, just know what you're getting into so you're not blindsided and disappointed by the lack of jump scares.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Devilish secrets take to long here,"""Shorts"" director Ari Aster steps up to the big boys chair, with this somewhat suspenseful thriller about a family plagued with death at every turn, ultimately revealing devilish secrets. Favorite Toni Collette (""United States of Tara"") and staple Gabriel Byrne (""The Unsual Suspects"") are parents to creepy little Milly Shapiro (watch out for this new raising performer) and conflicted young Alex Wolff (""In Treatment""). When grandma passes, and an accident occurs, a visit to grief counseling brings a mysterious friend Joannie (terrific character actress Ann Dowd ""The Handmaid's Tale"") into the family. Aster wears the hat of Writer here, and unfortunately gets in his own way with prolonged sequences between suspense, a haunting score that leads to little, and continued exterior shots of the house location that are supposed to invoke suspense but get old. Kudos, however, to him for the opening ""miniature set"" scene that starts the film, an effect not seen before on the big screen. Across the board, the leads do their best to deal with suspense and uncertainty. However, due to the weak writing, Collette's character is left begging for acceptance, Byrne has little to do, and while the camera loves Shapiro's presence and Wolff's uncertainty, the overall experience is too drawn out and falls flat at the end. Suspense films are at a low this time of year, which can only be the reason ""Hereditary"" is getting so much attention.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Incredible film, disgustingly disturbing.","Hereditary (2018) has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. A24 and director Ari Aster never disappoint in the horror genre, I can always expect something impressive.Unlike many horror movies, Hereditary has no comfort and no false sense of security at the beginning. I feel this is due to the scoring all throughout the film. I decided to watch the movie without any idea on what I was getting into, I knew just about nothing of the plot. And that certainly had me shocked at every turn, just adding to the enjoyment. Expect plot twists upon plot twists!My personal ratings are as follows.Cinematography: 10/10

"Daringly Disturbing, Uncomfortable and Terrifying All in the Right Way","I watched this film with my girlfriend about six months ago, and with almost every Horror movie we've seen since, we usually conclude ""not as bad as Hereditary"" now. While it's not too hard to get a cringe or a jump out of me in such a film, it's rare that I actually feel uncomfortable. This film was different.This movie is super bold, and puts you right in the front seat of it's most disturbing elements! During the first super graphic scene, we had to pause the movie because it actually made us feel ill. This film is sometimes terrifying simply in the way the characters react. With that, all the acting this film is great, but I think Toni Collette's performance is stellar. Everything from her interactions with the family, to her facial expressions, to her chilling cries and screams, Annie was responsible for at least half of the waves of terror that hit me throughout the film.At first, I didn't know what to think of this film. I was so disturbed by it that I almost regretted watching it, but yet, I was impressed and couldn't stop thinking about it. Sort of like a really good haunted house.Since I'm now comparing this film to how terrifying others are, I can't deny that it's one of the best Horror film I've seen in a long time. I considered rating it higher, but the reason I give it an 8:I think the film is too long. Not just the general runtime, but I feel like it could have had about 5-10 minutes less of long shots, especially with sustained emphasis on the disturbing imagery. I understand the film is supposed to be shocking and detailed, but sometimes it was just a little much for me personally.Sorry, but I didn't like the ending. I get it, it was just a let down to me.I think I would only ever watch this film again to see a reaction from someone else who hasn't yet. ;)Any fan of Horror films that hasn't seen Hereditary yet definitely should.

The other side of this film's coin can be considered to be some of the finest American horror that has ever been put to screen.

"Well made, acted and fairly unnerving, but a tough one to get your head around","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAnnie (Toni Collette) has recently lost her mother, a cold, distant woman who seemed to have something to hide. After attending a session for those struggling with loss, she reveals a long history of tragedy that has plagued her family line, only to then suffer one of the worst tragedies imaginable. After becoming friends with a lady at the sessions, Annie becomes obsessed with channelling the after-life, leading to husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) to question her sanity. But something much more creepy and sinister is at play...Horror is a genre that's become pretty generic and production line, a less demanding modern audience drip fed an endless succession of jump scare laden, soulless pap that pretty much matches their senses. It's much rarer nowadays to get something that aims to get under the skin and psychologically unnerve you and wear you out. So, if nothing else, it's kudos to director Ari Lester, here making his feature length debut, that he has at least attempted to produce something that is unconventional and at least tries to go somewhere new. But, sadly, Hereditary is something that doesn't pull it all off swimmingly. At least, not on the first viewing.It's certainly received loads of really great reviews, from professional film critics and other IMDb users, although there's been a fraction of that who have shared less praise-worthy ones, so it's nice not to feel like you're the one stupid one who 'just didn't get it.' What works about it is really great, as it successfully creates a genuinely unnerving, unsettling atmosphere, with it's drained camera style, and long, lingering camera lenses, that create a desperately solitary effect. Lead star Collette's performance is also amazing, as a woman whose life has been one long storybook of misery, perfectly conveying scenes of horror, grief, anguish and anger, although Byrne as her husband feels a little underdeveloped. The problem is, it all feels cobbled together in a sloppy, messy way, an already unclear and ambiguous story that ends up suffering from pacing issues as a result.Fans of the film Don't Look Now might find appeal in this one, a film where your own imagination's conclusion of events is as accurate as what's actually happened. It has too much going for it not to work, but it's one you may have to watch twice in order to get it and really pick everything up.

First time I've logged into IMDB in 10 years just to review this....2nd review ever.,"Quick preface, yes I do love horror movies - anything from zombies to slasher films to your supernatural and all-too-human and real thriller types etc etc. I always have and I've seen more than I could even begin to count. You could say I have a bit of an affinity for horror movies, sure, but that doesn't cloud my mind when it comes to identifying a turd vs a masterpiece.Hereditary is as close to a masterpiece as I have seen though I wouldn't brand it as a masterpiece for the simple fact that it's a bit too akin to ""perfect"" and nothing is perfect. There is not a single jump scare, not a single loud burst noise meant to startle you, nothing purposeful and obvious anyway (or at all). It's just a pure, unadulterated creepfest. Eerie, disturbing, uncomfortable, unsettling - all words I would absolutely use to describe this movie in the best way possible.Many horror movies and thrillers like A Quiet Place (also a great film) have some very suspenseful scenes. But those are just scenes. Temporary settings in which the director can build up suspense to some fun climax. All I will say about that aspect of Hereditary is at a certain point, the entirety of the movie put me in a long, sustained state of suspense. Nearly literal edge-of-my-seat kind of thing except that I was too comfortable leaning back.I don't even see it necessary to get into any sort of specifics with this film. Read the synopsis and reviews, etc etc. Just know that it is so much more than any words can truly describe. Do yourself a favor and see it. For me, an avid moviegoer especially concerning horror movies, this thing is a gem. Wonderfully acted, the soundscape and landscape is just so damn perfect. Off-screen noises coupled with a very appropriate visual just fills you with a sense of dread at times for what is happening on screen. I absolutely loved this movie. It affected me more than any other movie in recent memory, maybe ever.I truly, truly do not understand even in the slightest how this movie is getting anything less than a 7 or an 8. These clowns bashing it and giving it a 1 are off their rocker. I don't know what they were watching but it wasn't Hereditary. My only guess is they were expecting some obvious jumpy typical Hollywood scary movie that didn't present them with obvious, orthodox scares. I was so stunned to see ANY 1s at all much less several. Ignore them entirely. Just see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It'll leave you haunted well after you leave the theater,"You may have heard that this is the scariest movie since The Exorcist or that certain images are upsetting or that it will haunt you for an uncomfortably long time. None of that is hyperbole. 
It's all true.Hereditary builds slowly, patiently. It starts as a family drama circled by an aura of mystery about what has been passed down through their lineage. At first it seems to be movie about mental illness, then the movie is gradually revealed to be something else. And that something else is most horrifying movie in many, many years.The grandmother of a family has just died. Her adult daughter (Toni Collette), son-in-law and two grandchildren have varying reactions to her death. Grandma was a manipulative, mettlesome and disturbed woman, who had been largely estranged from the family. The only family member close to her was her granddaughter.After the grandmother's passing, strange occurrences take place. The grieving daughter's sleepwalking returns. The granddaughter has dark visions. So does the grandson. Then something tragic happens, and then everything escalates. The second half of the movie is pure nightmare fuel.I won't go into any further detail because the mystery and uncertainty of the plot is integral to the rising eerie vibe that engulfs this movie. The audience learns as the characters do, peeling back layers to uncover disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface.I can't say enough good things about the acting. Toni Collette deserves an Oscar nomination, Milly Shapiro hits a homerun in her film debut and Alex Wolff does laudable work as well.Director Ari Aster is a master at capturing emotion of the characters and enforcing those emotions on the audience. We don't just see their confusion and fear-we feel it.He brilliant constructs frames that leave something shadowy, possibly sinister, lurking in the corner. We think we see it but aren't certain. That uncertainty is unnerving. I imagine most of us will find ourselves checking the corners of our own homes for some time after witnessing this film. It imprints a haunting feeling that's tough to shake.Aster's willingness to let scenes linger allows his performers to reach the proper emotional levels. Collette and Shapiro are incredible at this. They emote so much with mere facial expressions. In many instances, their reactions are as chilling as the images themselves.This is a horror movie with very few jump scares. Instead, it builds skin-crawling discomfort through eerie music, creepy and ambiguous images, and devastating scares delivered at our most vulnerable moments.If you scare easily, do NOT watch this movie. It will haunt your dreams and waking hours for quite a while. If you like scary movies, this is an absolute must see. Just know that you're in for something disturbing. You've been warned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
what a masterpiece!!!,"A fantastic movie that is like nothing i have seen before. Horror movies got really bad and simple in the last years...the scary moments are cheap and predictible because we have seen them all. But this movie is different.

Super confusing and somewhat boring,"This was an interesting film. A realistic take on demons. It was violent , disturbing...everything that a good horror movie has. But it was extremely confusing. And really only the last half hour was somewhat entertaining. The first hour and a half was just the mother going to therapy and Joan's apartment for therapy and yelling at her son. The ending made no sense, I couldn't tell what was happening, why they kept cutting between random rooms and the miniature rooms. I couldn't tell what the significance the miniature models had in the story.There were creepy moments, a few jump scares, but that's about it.This was the first film by Ari Aster I've ever seen, but now I'm skeptical about watching Midsommer since this one wasn't great.This was really just about how confusing it was and how the ending made no sense. I might have to watch it again to see if I can understand it. 5/10. It could've been worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A modern classic that will terrify generations,"I rank this as the best horror movie I've seen. It's such a delicately made movie, where psychological terror is used in a smart manner.

Everyone in the cinema sat on the edge of their seats every second - you rarely felt safe, as you can during daytime in other, sloppy horror flicks.The acting is superb, especially Toni Collette, who performs her lifetime role as a mother coping with tragic loss.

Hereditary,"Hereditary is a slow barn dark tale with nods to Rosemary's Baby.Life is not going great for Annie Graham (Toni Collette) an artist who makes miniature models.Her mother has died, Annie was never close to her. Annie's daughter Charlie is behaving odd and later has an allergic reaction when out to a party with her older brother Peter.It leads to a tragic accident where Annie resents her son for Charlie's death. She acts increasingly withdrawn. Her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) tries to keep the family together.After meeting Joan (Ann Dowd) who herself has been bereaved, Annie finds someone she can relate to. Afterwards with the behest of Joan. Anne holds a seance in order to get through to Charlie.Only a lot of weirdness starts to happen. Peter acts strangely like he is possessed by some demonic force.Hereditary has an interesting horror story. It takes a while to get going as it initially comes across as moody more than scary.It ramps up at the end as some the pieces fall together. It also gets too hysterical and confusing. At least for the horror genre, this is a thoughtful film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hail Hereditary!,"This is quite possibly one of the most unsettling experiences I've ever had in a movie theater before, and that's definitely a good thing, because such emotional investment in cinema is not something that comes easily to someone as jaded as I. Hereditary, directed by NYC native Ari Aster and distributed by the now infamous A24 pictures, also responsible for modern cult horror flicks like 2015's, ""The Witch"" and 2017's ""It Comes at Night"". It's quite easy to see this film being compared to movies like The Witch and even classic horror like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, as there are MANY similar thematic elements of familial bonds estrangement, mental illness, and the occult. I won't spoil it for you, but trust me, if you watch this film expecting a typical run of the mill horror film like ""Happy Death Day"" or ""Truth or Dare"" kindly look elsewhere, because this is completely different territory which can truly be called a horror movie for adults instead of teenagers.

Was tough to watch,"As a parent, and someone who has experienced grief from losing loved ones, this was a hard film to watch. I expected it to be the typical evil little girl type of scary movie, but it was unlike any scary movie I've seen.The drama is so heavy, so well done. The acting was too good to not feel for the characters, and this made what happens to them literally painful for me. Add to that some very disturbing, graphic scenes, and it just leaves you sad and disturbed at the end.I came away from this movie feeling very heavy hearted, without any happiness left in me. It was very well done. I almost regreted watching.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"In a way it's overrated, but still a great movie.","Prior to seeing this, I heard from countless people saying how scary and horrifying and amazing the movie is. It's not scary, like at all.

Does the job. Better than most. One of the scariest movies ever.,"This film is incredibly well done and holds your interest all the way through. I found myself telling my date and myself that it is not real because I did not want her disturbed and thinking I was a weirdo for liking it. The family element is painful but realistic, the plot twists and turns, arriving at a grandiose place that could have been more fleshed out (figuratively, of course, the film gets shockingly graphic). That could have led to a longer play time to an already 2 hour movie. But Wolff's portrayal of the son character really wows in the film's second half, and Collette is basically Oscar-worthy, as unlikely as that eventuality playing out may be. Byrne grounds the insanity, providing levity in a movie that actually has plenty of it. I agree with Argento comparisons as the film gets crazy in true horror fashion, but the good script and the stellar acting makes the violence and thrills that much better and more disturbing. I would watch this again, I recommend you take a fellow weirdo. I'd also like a second look at the fantastical places the plot goes because by the end you are half in shock by this piece of art. And when you think about it, most of the violence is scarcely worse than primetime TV. The cinematography and execution make it unforgettable (tlock).",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I was more frightened by The Muppets Christmas Carol.,"Well, I suppose it's happened to us all at some time. Believing the hype.

The first hour dragged, the effects weren't up to much. , and I can only assume Gabriel Byrne need a big payday to buy a boat to appear in this un-scary drivel.

Slow paced film takes too long to get going,"Horror is my favourite genre and I rarely give in to any hype surrounding films that are supposedly the best yet in their own.

The film only starts to get interesting after an hour or so. Some inconclusive scenes have their answers revealed in subsequent ones through character interactions. This adds to the somewhat mysterious storyline and is designed to keep you focused but I found it to be a bit puzzling at times.The performances are really good, but as a drama more than anything elseThe films climax is hinted at late on in the film but it feels unsatisfying.

A Disturbing Exploration of Grief and Horror,"Ari Aster's 2018 horror masterpiece ""Hereditary"" has left a profound impact on viewers, much like yourself, evoking feelings of both terror and discomfort. The film's unique ability to shake one's emotional equilibrium speaks to its remarkable storytelling and skillful execution, even though deciding whether you truly enjoyed it can be challenging in light of its unsettling nature.""Hereditary"" is a tour de force that ventures into the darker realms of grief and supernatural horror. The story revolves around a family grappling with tragedy, and as they traverse their emotional landscape, the lines between the real and the supernatural begin to blur. Aster's mastery lies in his skillful manipulation of atmosphere, tension, and imagery, effectively planting the seeds of fear in the audience's psyche.The film's deliberate pacing and meticulous attention to detail immerse viewers in the eerie ambiance, setting the stage for escalating dread. The cinematography and direction capitalize on the uncanny, creating visuals that linger long after the credits roll. The slow burn nature of the narrative can be both a strength and a challenge, as it demands patience while ratcheting up the intensity.Toni Collette's performance as the mother struggling with her emotions adds a layer of authenticity to the proceedings. Her portrayal of grief, denial, and the slow descent into paranoia is both haunting and captivating. The emotional weight she brings to her character serves as a conduit for the audience's own emotional roller coaster.What sets ""Hereditary"" apart is its willingness to delve into themes that transcend mere jump scares. The film examines generational trauma, the fragility of familial bonds, and the desperation that accompanies loss. The supernatural elements act as metaphors for the uncontrollable forces that can consume individuals in times of intense pain.In retrospect, it's understandable that ""Hereditary"" leaves you in a state of emotional turmoil. The film's visceral impact testifies to its success in generating genuine fear and discomfort, but it also prompts reflection on the blurred line between horror and psychological drama. The unease you feel is a testament to the film's power to resonate deeply with its audience.""Hereditary"" is a haunting exploration of the human psyche, a disquieting reminder that grief and horror can intertwine in terrifying ways. While it might be difficult to definitively say whether you enjoyed the experience, its ability to leave a lasting impression and spark discussions about the intersection of horror and emotional turmoil is undeniable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An exceptional, chilling masterpiece","Trailers were altogether enigmatic, suggesting strange goings-on but divulging nothing concrete even in terms of a premise. I missed out on this for so long, but I love Ari Aster's follow-up 'Midsommar,' and I trust A24 to consistently release excellent movies. The broad high regard is no mistake - 'Hereditary' is truly outstanding, and one of the very best horror films of recent years.The feature decidedly eschews total clarity at any time, to the point that there were absolutely times where my confidence wavered. Yet this is only so the viewer has to also put in work to attain the utmost value, and just as the title would seem to start rather slowly - once the jolting moment comes when the narrative really kicks into motion, everything slowly gels into a tremendous, exhilarating crescendo and climax. All the while, we're treated to an incredible original score courtesy of Colin Stetson, harsh and dynamic ambient themes that lend terrifically to the atmosphere of deep unease throughout the film. We're treated to a stellar performance from Toni Collette - surely one of her best, a powerhouse display of acting that far exceeds any notion of genre convention. (That's certainly not to count out her co-stars, who are similarly fantastic.) And we're treated to an increasing assault of arresting and genuinely disturbing imagery; my commendations to everyone working behind the scenes in production design, art direction, and otherwise to realize the blood, gore, hair and makeup work, effects, stunts, and all else. The visual presentation in 'Hereditary' is excellent, and I dare say exemplary among horror features.Even as terrible happenings transpire with building frequency, it's safe to the picture aims for subtlety in its storytelling. Up until nearly the very end it's impossible to tell what may be a nightmare, hallucination, or illusion, or actual in-universe reality. We're happily kept in the dark until the psychological moment, thereby allowing tension and suspense to flourish. These are aided by Aster's flawless direction, as well as the sharp editing of Jennifer Lame and Lucian Johnston, and Pawel Pogorzelski's impeccable, vivid cinematography. The careful arrangement of nigh every shot and scene is fundamental to feeding the growing dread, and in both writing and execution, the result is exquisite. For however unremarkable 'Hereditary' may have seemed in the first act, our patience is greatly rewarded and the pay-off is a gift.This comes across to me as the type of horror feature that would have haunted me for years had it been around for me to see when I was much younger. Between the plot, the acting, and not least of all the imagery, I can easily imagine this making a lasting impression just like the flying monkeys did in 'The wizard of Oz,' or the clown doll in 'Poltergeist.' The reputation this has garnered speaks for itself; Aster has created what is almost without a doubt an instant classic that will be talked about for a long time to come. 'Hereditary' strikes hard and deep with scenes of a family floundering in its grief, then twists that emotional connection into something far more delicious. I'm guessing I'm among those few that have taken so long to ever watch it in the first place, but suffice to say that if you enjoy the genre and haven't yet watched 'Hereditary,' you need to make it a top priority.

"A deep, twisted experience to dissect and go insane over","Hereditary is a slow-burn descent into madness and hell all weaved around the structure of this dark family drama. It begins with the funeral of Anne Graham's estranged mother Ellen. And the word ""estranged"" is a light way to describe the relationship between Anne and Ellen. Due to mental illness being a common trait in Anne's family history, Anne continually felt her mother trying to control her life. It even led to the point where had Anne had to keep Ellen away from her first-born son Peter. Eventually Anne ""gave"" her second child and daughter, Charlie, to Ellen when she was living in her house before her death. Hereditary does have haunted houses and demonic possession elements but the draw of this masterpiece is seeing how this seemingly ordinary sane family discovers the horrifying reality they are in.Ari Aster shows superb amount of craft for a horror story that could have been handled ok or mediocrely. Aster never lets the horror be something that is front and centre. He shows very little jump-scares and relies on very little explanation of the supernatural until the third act. While the horror is lurking off-screen which makes it even more effective, the attention is made towards the dysfunctional relationship within the Graham family. By exploring the idea of family-based mental illnesses, Aster makes us question if this family truly has control over their horrible choices or if they have inherited something that denies them choice at all. As the film goes deeper into the mentality of the Graham's, psychosis and supernatural blur to challenge what is real or not. When supernatural horror kicks in, you already start to feel your sanity slipping away.If Hereditary deserves any recognition other then Ari Aster's skills as a talented filmmaker, it's Toni Collette's Oscar-deserving performance as Anne. Collette creates an emotionally complex character from her performance. Collette can go from showing complete denial to breaking down into complete despair after discovering something horrible. And then she will lash out with the fury of hell in a particular dinner scene that will not be forgotten. Once you see Anne's psyche break, Collette convinces you her turn from being a sceptic to suddenly believing in the supernatural thanks to the desperation she expresses on her face.The build-up of the tension is helped by Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography. The film now and then shows Anne making life-like miniature replicas of her house. Every room in her artwork matches to detail the real-life house. And thanks to the way Pogorzelski frames the camera, the negative space makes you feel like the characters are unknowingly living inside one of these miniatures. The camera's perspective makes feel like some higher power is watching their behaviour like someone looking at fish inside an aquarium.Hereditary won't be for those expecting a quick scare for entertainment sake. Hereditary fits more in the mold of A24's other artistic horror films like The Witch and It Comes At Night. It's a deep psychological analysis of a family loosing their minds with otherworldly forces playing a part. Hereditary is very unique creepy experience that is worth dissecting once you have seen the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Psychological and occult terror which builds and culminates at the very end,"Most of the top IMDb Hereditary reviews are sheer extravagance - reading them might leave you feeling disappointed at the end of the movie
------------What kind of movie is Hereditary? It's a movie where almost everything that happens serves as material for the final culmination. There are no particularly scary scenes until the very end; they tend to put you in a state of discomfort rather than scaring you in a classical sense. As the movie approaches final culmination you can already feel tired of being disturbed by frenzy you've seen so far.Who's going to 'enjoy' this movie? Probably everyone who's 'enjoyed' The Witch (A24 production as well) and Sinister (starring Ethan Hawke; stay away from the second part) both of which I recommend. Hereditary can even be described as a combination of the two: it has soundtrack and violence similar to Sinister and psychological terror peculiar to The Witch. As a result, Hereditary delivers both psychological terror and occult terror which don't stand separated but are interlaced. This fact is very important in creating such a sorrowful atmosphere.To be frank, there are some boring instances here and there, but I don't think they are without meaning. Critics gave this movie high rating for a reason and I think the reason is different aspects and sources of the terror being cleverly put together by those very scenes which do break the dynamic but give you reasons to think about the movie afterwards.Combination of which elements and to what proportions lead to all the tragedy and sorrow this family struggled against? The way Hereditary puts forward this question is what ultimately makes it a good movie.

"Unlike mother! (2017), Hereditary uses allegory to its advantage and is genuinely terrifying.","Hereditary feels like it was conceived as a response to horror films like the Paranormal Activity films, in that horror films have never been jump-scare dependent fests; and that they can be scary in how uneasy they make you feel as you watch the story unfold on-screen. I could see influences of The Omen, The Exorcist, and mother! (for better or worse). It's got its fair-share of uneasy scares and subtle beat-driven scares and shocks.I can see why some people didn't take too kindly to this movie, and that's fine. My thoughts on the matter though: this film succeeds in telling a story bigger and scarier than any jump-scare fest. Hereditary is a must-see horror movie. And it's a must-see for the 2010s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A great technical achievement, not a masterpiece","Hereditary is a great technical achievement in filmmaking...but a great film itself I'm not so sure. Everything is right here - it's the type of film that you might turn in for your final project of film school. Of course, it's infinitely more polished than that, but the sentiment holds. Its cinematography is wonderful, the shots are picked beautifully, and the pacing is just right for the genre. My technical qualms with the film are minor. Firstly, the dialogue is sometimes a bit unbelievable, especially what some of the teenagers say. We were all teenagers once, I don't understand how hard it is to write teenage dialogue. Secondly, although the characters are largely logical, some of the decisions made were not the best (even out of a horror film situation).I'll be honest and say that I think the horror genre in filmmaking is quite weak. This is usually because it is hard to suspend disbelief when characters are illogical (which so many horror films rely on). Hereditary makes the type of scary that makes you uncomfortable but doesn't try to do anything more than that. It doesn't explore human nature or try to touch on what primally scares all humans It's not The Shining or some other art film. Hereditary is the best version of the cheaper kind of horror - and it's pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Overrated, natch","There was something around the hype of this movie that seemed fake, and you knew the critics would fall in line, scared to be wrong. There are so many useless film critics out there, it's predictable. This is not a terrible movie, it's just very flawed and shamefully undercooked.The good: The special effects scares are great, the daughter is great but underused, the story has potential and is somewhat interesting.The bad: The director threw in everything but the kitchen sink as far as plot, the film needs editing (not just cuts, but an entire re-edit), the son is totally miscast and his physical differences from the rest of the family take you further out of the movie, some mediocre acting by son and father that brings the film down. The whole film needed tightening up.

Uniquely Gorgeous Depiction of Grief & Loss,"First, let me say: What a beautiful film! There are so many tiny (no pun intended) camera tricks and little details all over the place, sometimes your subconscious thinks it sees something that isn't actually there; making you question your own eyes.The incorporation of miniatures, as a type of framing device, allows the viewer to see multiple scenes, not only in a different (and very unique) way, but from the perspective of Toni Colette's character, Annie.The masterful use of dolly-shots, by panning across rooms in a very wide-and-straight manner, give us the feeling of looking at all of these real-life rooms in the home as if they were tiny, inside a dollhouse.The most insignificant details (such as thicker-than-normal trims on doors, and taller-than-normal wainscoting on walls) also give us the impression that the home and people we are watching are somehow smaller than us.The acting is terrific: There are some very raw, brutal emotions that our characters go through, and at one point I even felt a burning heat in my chest as I watched another character endure a crushing weight of grief.That's why I love movies: I want to feel something.Certainly, there are moments when it all becomes rather draining for us, and that will turn people away. However, this is a movie that is very much intending for you to feel uncomfortable! Empathy, quite frankly, is a skill that we learn in life, and, like anything else, empathy requires practice.There are some shots that, I felt, lingered a bit too long, almost as if the director was concerned that the audience wouldn't notice what was on-screen. I thought those should have been trimmed up. Some scenes (though very few) can drag a little too long.Towards the end, there were some over-the-top bits of more, I suppose, ""conventional"" horror tropes and behaviours, which were a bit silly. There are moments where I laughed out loud (such as when a character throws himself through a window, à la the Friday the 13th films). So, yes, some moments are silly.My advice? Laugh at the silly bits!Those will be your ONLY chances to relax and breathe in this film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great movie with poor elements.,"I've been hearing amazing things about hereditary since it was realised. Because of this I purposefully avoided watching it until now as I knew my expectations would be too high. And they were. There are great things about hereditary and some really great moments, but I have a fair amount of issues with it that few people seem to acknowledge. Even with the problems I have I still think hereditary is a good movie and a fantastic directorial debut.My biggest problem is Alex Wolff' character as a whole. He just changes when the story needs him to, at one point he's a stereotypical rebellious teen and next he's calling his mum mama and acting like a young child If there is a reason for this please let me know. The dialogue written for Peter and the other teenagers is laughable, nobody talks the way Ari Aster thinks teens do. Alex Wolff' performance is also pretty bad, it's not helped by the awful dialogue but even if the writing was better it still wouldn't be good. Each time he tried to show any emotion it just ended up being unintentionally funny.Every performance except for Wolff' was actually great, even Milly Shapiro, the child. None of the other performances even compare to Toni Collette's though, her character and her performance were the best out of the bunch. Her dealing with grief was pretty convincing and sad. Oddly enough I thought her character and her dialogue was really well written, especially compared to Alex Wolff' dialogue and character. Having a poor performance and a great one in this film only made me appreciate Toni Collette's performance more.I have just a few more points to make that I don't want to talk about extensively. The CGI looked really bad, there are a few moments where different insects are shown, that's when the CG looks worst. The ending felt really goofy and I couldn't take it seriously. It is very well shot, use of slightly longer than average takes made for some tense moments. And the miniatures were so amazing and used really intelligently.Hereditary is a great movie with some really poor elements. It is clear that Ari Aster is a talented filmmaker only confirmed by midsommar, but he still has a lot to work on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Solid horror but slightly overrated,"This is a good, solid horror but not as good as some are making out on here. No jump scares, more of a slow burning psychological horror albeit a little too slow paced at times, with a good twist. But, as in most modern horror movies, the director seems to run out of ideas of how to end the movie! The ending is certainly underwhelming to say the least.A solid 7 for me - Overall very well acted and good direction for the most but a few unnecessary ""arty"" camera shots do nothing for the movie, Well worth watching but don't expect to be blown away.

Horror as it should be. Weird. Unnerving and shocking.,"You can count on multiple hands the number of horror films from the last decade that prance around the same tropes of spirituality and jump scares. When something works, like the conjuring saga, studios capitalize on them and make them a profit machine. It takes outliers like Hereditary to remind us what horror really is. Horror is subjective, just like comedy. What one person finds funny another might find offensive. What scares the be-Jesus out of a 5 year old might make a grown adult giggle. The idea of horror is to allow the director to take you by the hand and guide you down the winding road that is their mind. In this case, it's a twisted and dark path. Hereditary is well pieced together horror movie that preys upon the viewers genuine curiosity and belief systems. Set amidst gorgeous scenery in Utah, the landscape offers a touching reminder that even when we love where we live and even when we feel safe at home, sometimes the four walls that hold us are the ones that will eventually keep us from escaping. I suggest watching with the lights on and a curious attitude as part of the genius in the story is the questioning of not only your own sanity, but the sanity of those around you. Although the movie is a slow burn I highly suggest sticking it out and using that time to theorize or question the direction of the film. Then sit back for the final 20 minutes as no movie to date has ever taken a turn as shocking as this one.Acting: 7.4

"The most unsettling movie I have seen, and one of the best horror movies EVER ...","Man, after so many years and all of the hype, I finally goy on the Hereditary train. It seems there are 2 groups of people, who have watched it - the ones that absolutely love it and the ones that hate the guts of it. I'm in the first category, obviously. I dunno if i can go and say - this is the best horror movie ever. There are a lot of equally amazing horror films, all different, and I have not seen all of the great stuff, I am sure and I am a huuuge fan of the genre. But if they put a pistol on my head and i got to say what is THE BEST horror movie that I have watched, i guess i will say Hereditary.This movie was everything I wanted to see from a horror movie, after loving the genre for almost two decades. There are no jump scares (at least not the traditional ones). Hereditary was disturbing, filled with an atmosphere of dread, uneasyness, tension, feeling that something is very, very wrong. There was not a moment in the film that I relaxed and felt comfortable. The sounds used are chilling, the music was terrifying, I loved it very much. The cinematography was great, but the stars of the film were the director - Ari Aster and the actress Toni Colette. The first one just blew all of the competition in his style of filmmaking, his great ideas and twists (just watch the trailer and see how misleading it is). His style is original and the guy surely knows what he is doing, because till this moment (almost a month, after watching Hereditary) I am still creeped and unsettled by it. As far as Toni Colette goes - man, she just gave it all in this one. Her acting is maybe the best acting I have seen in a horror movie, and one of the best female acting EVER. She was absolutely amazing in this.With its disturbing images, pumping soundtrack, terrifying sounds, effective scares, amazing writing and directing, devastating, dark and sad atmosphere, terrific acting (not only from Colette, but from everybody involved), Hereditary stands as one of the best of the genre, and maybe even THE best. There were scenes that I will never, EVER forget in my life, that I still think of till this day.If I have to say something negative - the ending was a little bit too ""out of nowhere"", and just pulls you out of the realism of it. But compared to everything else, I can forgive that. Everything else was just BRILLIANT.I will recommend this masterpiece to absolutely everybody, who is a fan of the slow horror (the true horror, imo).

As the Graham Crackers Crumble,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite fine acting and direction, pretension undoes tension in this far-fetched and ultimately disappointing supernatural thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: Beware the artsy independent horror film! Usually adored by critics and well-crafted by its filmmakers, this genre begins intriguingly, builds its tension well, only to lose all reason by its third act. You have seen this all before, with movies like The Witch, It Follows, The Blair Witch Project, The Strangers, and mother!...all of the spooky parts that never make a rational whole.We now have to add writer / director Ari Aster's Hereditary to the mix. This is not to say that the movie is not impressive: it is very effective in its imagery and acting. But it just has such an unsatisfying and loopy ending which diminishes all the chills and thrills that come before.The story involves Annie Graham (Toni Collette), a visual artist who creates miniature environments with painstaking detailed accuracy. Her precision and skill, however, only seem apparent in her art. As a passionate mother and wife, she is far from perfect. Hereditary begins with the death of Annie's mother, also a fractured force in her unusual upbringing. We meet the other family members at the funeral: her stoic husband, Steve (Gabriel Bryne), her creepy introverted daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and her unloved drug-laden son Peter (Alex Wolff).From the start, everyone has abnormal tendencies. All exist within their own traumatic universe, with no one in authority questioning this family's unhealthy choices. Their behavior, to say the least, is relentlessly odd and overtly weird. Yes, there are bizarre dysfunctional families...and then there are The Grahams. When the film's central characters relish in their eccentricities and erratic ways, there is no norm in this new normal. Everything gets all the more curiouser and very bewildering.Where the film is its most effective is in its domestic family drama storyline, that is, before it veers into the supernatural realm. Strange and unexplainable things begin to happen and the filmmakers create the right tone for this horror film's initial set-up. This is Mr. Aster's directorial debut and it signals the making of a talented director. He fills the screen with surreal images (ants crawling on a severed head, black flies buzzing away in an attic, flames suddenly combusting for no reason, a child's rubber ball bouncing out of the shadows, etc.). The director also populates his story with engrossing characters and many pivotal dramatic scenes.(Kudos to cinematographer Pawel Pogorelski who captures the claustrophobic feel of Grace Yun's strong production design and he photographs the home with low angle shots to reinforce the eerie dollhouse theme with stark lighting and shadow for the necessary eerie haunted house effect.But the screenplay piles high its contrived plot devices and interesting twists that feed on circumstances which are illogical and never fully thought out. Complicating the build-up of incredulous happenings are inexplicable acts of violence that would trigger the immediate appearances of law enforcement, school, or medical authorities who never seem to intercede. As the film progresses, the moviegoer has to suspend belief to make sense of it all, and some of low budget CGI do not help matters. Just saying that there are supernatural forces at play does not justify the action of some characters and their whereabouts while their motives remain murky at best.The acting is top notch. Mr. Bryne and Ms. Shapiro are very fine in their roles but it is the conflict between mother and son that anchors the film. Mr. Wolff plays the troubled teen with aching despair. He plies his character with angst, guilt, and a tender quality of sadness. He is the emotional counterbalance to Ms. Collette's shrew mother figure. Partly deranged confessor, partly loving and cruel Mommie Dearest, the actress excels with an unparalleled emotional range. It is worthy of Oscar contention. Also giving yeomanlike support is the reliable Anne Dowd as Annie's new friend, Joanie, from her group therapy session.Hereditary is a powerful directing showcase for a new creative talent like Mr. Asher. His film may be disturbing and intense, but it is also pretentious and absurd due to his wonky script. Yes, there is more here that meets the eye, even if the mind is not fully convinced about all of those bumps in the night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy Images Are Never Enough On Their Own,"One thing I've learned about horror/suspense flicks over the years is that creepy images alone are not enough to base the entire experience around. Sure, you can load a film with jump-scares and grisly images, but if there isn't an interesting or coherent plot to back it up, the entire experience will be transient (at best) and utterly forgettable (at worst). Unfortunately, the latter is very close to my feelings about ""Hereditary"".For a basic plot summary, this film begins with a family that is reeling from the death of the grandmother matriarch. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) doesn't quite know how to process her emotions, husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) just seems distant, while siblings Charlie (Milly Shapiro) & Peter (Alex Wolff) start displaying signs of odd behavior. When another tragedy rocks the family, the oddness quotient increases, leading Annie to take drastic measures to get to the bottom of what is actually transpiring.It's actually pretty easy for me to pinpoint exactly why I disliked this film so much: About halfway in, I knew it would ""all come down to the ending"", so to speak. Because not much time is devoted to really digging deep into the characters, this quickly turns into the type of movie that will be defined by what twist it can pull out of the bag before the credits roll. Sadly, that ends up being the weakest part of the film, essentially dooming the entire experience.I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, but I will just say this: you won't expect what happens in the end, but that doesn't turn out to be a good thing. It really feels like ""Hereditary"" had some forward momentum, and then only was able to tack on a mumbo-jumbo sort of ending to all of it. For 3/4 of the film, it teases viewers into thinking that ""all the clues are there...you just have to put them together"". That is most definitely NOT the case, as the ending is instead pulled so far out of left field that it might as well not even be in the ballpark.To be sure, there are some creepy images and jump-scares in ""Hereditary"", and that is the only reason I can even give it three stars here (it does put in some semblance of effort). Without a strong plot, and sunk by an even worse concept ending, though, it doesn't make a mark in any significant way.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

My Favorite Movie,"TL; DR:If you don't mind strong content and love family drama with your horror, you may just love Hereditary.Personal anecdote to preface this review:I recently re-watched Hereditary in honor of Beau is Afraid's release right around the corner and as I have grown as a critic, my criticisms have heightened. It may be closer to a 6 or an 8 instead of a 10. But due to its sentiment, I am going to keep the score. I highly anticipate Beau and however I feel about the film, I will still be proud of my favorite filmmaker Mr. Ari Aster.Review:Before seeing the film, my intuition somehow told me that Hereditary would be the film to open me up to a whole new world. Spoiler alert: it did. This is the movie that opened my door to cinema. Ari Aster, thank you for your art. It has changed my life and the lives of many others. I am an aspiring screenwriter and director myself and this film speaks my language.Hereditary (2018), is Ari Aster's feature length directorial debut, a psychological horror film effortlessly intertwined with family drama. The writing and directing are both incredible. The score was created, written, and used perfectly. Its pronounced wind, chimes, and brass, are all appropriately placed and well-informed and performed. The neutral color scheme and cinematography complement the drab tone. Every performance feels so authentic, it's scary. Toni Collette was snubbed of a Best Actress Oscar for her role as Annie Graham and Ari Aster deserved a nomination at the very least for Best Original Screenplay. Gabriel Byrne was a phenomenal supporting actor as Steven Graham. His performance is often overlooked as Steve is a subtle character, but Byrne was perfect. Alex Wolff offered an incredible, vulnerable performance and endured pain while filming and still never gave up. He is also an amazing human being and I am proud to be a supporter and I, again, have Hereditary to thank. Milly Shapiro effortlessly portrayed Charlie's oddities. Ann Dowd was eerie as Joan and added to the unusual. Hereditary is a surprisingly layered film that handles clichés as if it's created them. I've seen this film only four times, but it seems as though there is always something new to the experience. It keeps you focused and searching for answers, whether you do or don't know what's coming. It is shocking, grotesque, boundary crossing, unique, uncomfortable, and honest. Hereditary is a beautiful nightmare; heavenly hellish.Hereditary is a timeless work of art. I will never stop talking about how it has changed my world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Alex Wolffe gives an equally phenomenal performance as Annie's son Peter, an adolescent racked with guilt and uncomfortable revelations about his place in the family. In addition, Miley Shapiro delivers one of the best child performances I've seen in years as Charlie, the emotionally cold and distant daughter of Annie.Using these spectacular acting preformances along with a remarkably well written script, the film tells a gripping and harrowing story. The story is rich with deep symbolism regarding the stages of grief, and parental neglect. These themes are deeply relatable for many viewers and this allows the viewer to easily sympathize with the immense plight of the characters.The film superbly utilizes cinematography, sound design, and genuinely shocking imagery to create an unbelievably freaky viewing experience. The numerous wide shots combined with the dark and shadowy lighting allow the suspense to build to near unbearable levels. There are many long, sustained sequences of terror throughout the film that can be so incredibly unsettling that they are almost unwatchable.Morover, the nightmarish imagery throughout the film will chill you to the bone. Severed heads. Satanic rituals, and swarms of insects are just some of the skin crawling sights you may see in Hereditary.The horrific scare sequences are also made even creepier through Hereditary's blood curdling sound design. The chilling musical score along with the numerous terrifying screams heard all through the film will undoubtedly leave most viewers petrified.Overall, watching Hereditary for the first time is an experience you will never forget. The amazing characters, astonishingly inventive scares, and incredibly poignant story make it a film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in psychological horror stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The Most Frightening Horror Films, Are The Ones That Feel Disturbingly Real",Hereditary is one of the most unsettling films I've ever seen. It's been a while since a horror movie has gotten this much under my skin. Look out for Ari Aster. He might just become the next household name in the world of cinema.

Crazy Ass Movie,"Truly a Scary movie, not like anything I've seen before. it does start off a bit slow but around the 30 or 40 minute mark it makes up for all that build up. It's an incline from there.... listen to me! if you like scary movies you have to watch this film. I don't do IMDB Reviews but this movie was so good I had too... It will have you talking about it afterwards!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horrifyingly Awful,"Reading all these reviews about what a ""Masterpiece"" this movie is makes me wonder if I missed something or if I'm just stupid. If you're someone who's raving about how creative and revolutionary this movie is, you're either just trying to fit in as a horror movie snob or saw a completely different movie.Seriously, I sat there through the first hour of the movie and wondered if I somehow walked into the wrong theater and was seeing a different movie. The pacing is incredibly slow, and I understand that the first half of a slow burning horror film like this one is supposed to build suspense, but unlike other horror flicks this film keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting for absolutely nothing.The only positive thing about this movie is the acting. The movie does have good performances from Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette, although I don't feel her acting is ""Oscar worthy"" like people are saying. It just makes me wonder how desperate these two great actors must have been for a paycheck.This movie was marketed as something that would make people rethink what horror movies are all about. In the end, there's nothing to spoil about this movie because nothing happens. The plot develops extremely slowly as a poorly written family drama. Then in the last 20-30 minutes the director must have remembered that he was supposed to be making a horror movie and just slapped together an ending full of countless scary movie cliches that left everyone in the theater scratching their heads. Someone at my showing actually said out loud when the credits began to roll ""wtf was that movie"" and everyone laughed.I get that cinematography wise this movie is supposed to be brilliant, because it does look pretty good. But good visuals aren't enough to save a boring movie with a poorly put together plot in my opinion. I've seen a few other reviewers on here mention how people in the audience were laughing out loud during the ""scary"" parts of this movie, and I can say that most of the theater I was in, including myself, was filled with people laughing and loudly cracking jokes at how cliche and confusing the ending of this movie is.DO NOT waste your money on this movie. Stay home. Spend time with your family. Read a book. Spend 2 hours of your life doing literally anything except for watching Hereditary.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
'Hereditary' is the best horror movie I've seen in theaters in years!,"'Hereditary' is one of the most unsettling and viscerally horrifying movies I've seen in years and I absolutely loved every single moment of it.2018 has been a less than satisfying year when it comes to the horror genre. While films like 'Insidious: The Last Key' and 'Winchester' failed to live up to expectations, 'Hereditary' blew them away. It features a brilliant cast that manages to dig their nails deeply into the roles that director/writer Ari Aster creates for them. He proves to be an absolutely brilliant creative mind with a keen eye for detail and masterful understanding of dread.At its core, 'Hereditary' is a movie about family and the secrets we keep from them. At the center of it is Toni Collette who plays a mother who recently lost her own. The two were estranged towards the end, so she's struggling to feel much of anything after the passing. During the grieving period though a mystery starts to unravel that proves her own mother was a very different person than she thought and lived a secret life that is threatening to undo her own family in the wake of her death.The cast is absolutely incredible, especially Collette who has a face made for horror films. I mean that has the highest possible compliment and am referring to the expressions of terror, shock and gut-wrenching grief she experiences throughout it. In short, Collette has absolutely epic crazy eyes that are almost as nerve-racking as the actual horror elements of the film. In the film, her character does her best to protect her own family from her own grieving process, not wanting to put any more stress on them. Her stoicism though leads to her mask of sanity slowly slipping as the film goes on. She's not the only member of the family that is suffering the loss of her mother though.Her own daughter, played by newcomer Milly Shapiro, has a hard enough time dealing with people and things deteriorate rapidly after she loses her grandmother. Shapiro is unbelievably creepy from the moment she appears on screen. So much so, that I had to update my own list of the Creepiest Kids from Movies. Her off-putting performance invokes a sense of anxiety that lingers throughout the film and she is a sharp contrast to the rest of her family. While everyone has their issues in 'Hereditary', there is something clearly wrong with the young daughter of the family.Director Ari Aster embraces a number of creepy thematic elements that all continuously add up in little ways. Collette's character works with miniatures that unnervingly accurate recreations of everyday scenes in her life. They are so accurate in fact that there are times in the film where it isn't clear if shots are of miniatures or of actual scenes. Shapiro's character follows in her mother's creative footsteps with her drawings and unsetting dolls that she makes from items she finds laying around. Together the two show that they have a need to escape from reality, but it's questionable whether their hobbies are healthy or not. These are just small examples though, but most of the details in the film are small. Things that would be upsetting just on their own, but combined together create a visceral reaction in the audience. At times it's almost hard to watch 'Hereditary', but it definitely pays off if you can keep your eyes open until the end.In typical horror fashion, 'Hereditary' embraces the fact that white people do the dumbest things when it comes to the supernatural. Collette's character becomes obsessed with unraveling the secrets of her mother, especially after the family experiences more tragedy. While the family is splintering apart from the events of the film, she starts an investigation into the paranormal to find answers and soon finds herself out of her depth. The results of her meddling where she doesn't belong are absolutely terrifying. Aster though doesn't focus on jump scares or a lot of blood splatter to tell this tale of horror. Instead, his approach is all about tone and pacing. 'Hereditary' is a completely engulfing experience that you can not only see and hear but also feel. Don't let that fool you though, there are still plenty of moments in the film that are hard to watch.'Hereditary' is a hardcore horror film. A far departure from what we have gotten in theaters lately. The characters and story connect with the audience early on and because of the emotional bond, it is able to manipulate our feelings all the more easily. It's not a film for the faint of heart or those prone to nightmares, because the unsettling feeling of anxiety it creates will linger with you long after the credits. The person I saw the film with commented that they did not feel safe after watching 'Hereditary', while I personally felt emotionally exhausted. For me, the fact that it was able to invoke such feelings proves that it is a more than successful entry into the genre. Those who want a real horror movie will not be disappointed in 'Hereditary'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Wait for it...,"I know a horror film is good when I can't seem to get it out of my head for a few days afterward, and that's been the case with this film. When I go to bed at night, I keep imagining someone hovering on the ceiling in the corner, watching over me. Lol. The majority of this film seemed a bit slow at times, but it was nonetheless intriguing, and the last 20 minutes or so of the film is where everything suddenly explodes into pure unimaginable chaos, and you're left wondering what the ___ you just experienced. The acting was great in the film, and it's important to pay attention to every scene and every bit of dialogue because little ""Easter Eggs"" are scattered throughout the film and some scenes explain a few things that are otherwise not directly explained but allow certain elements in the plot to make more sense later. The title of my review is ""Wait for it..."" because it's a reference to the ending. Much of the film is a bit tame, in terms of horror films, but then it's like everything is condensed into the last 20 minutes or so when ""all hell breaks loose."" Watch this only if you don't mind feeling disturbed.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unsettling,"This film is very well done. The cinemotography was done exquisitely, as every shot is well composed and very pleasing to look at. The acting, especially from Alex Wolff, Toni Collette, and Milly Shapiro are all fantastic. For a directorial debut, the film knocks it out of the park. I would consider the majority of this film to play out like a psychological thriller, as most of it is suspense being built up. Near the end of the third act is when things truly get scary. There are a lot of memorable and unsettling scenes throughout the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it right up until the ending. I won't spoil it for you, as I feel you should go into this film knowing as little as possible, but it felt like the entire movie was original and different right up until the end when it turned into something I felt like I had seen before. Regardless, this is a very well done and captivating movie that I urge you to go see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I've never been so stressed out while watching a movie before,"I didn't grow up in a dysfunctional household, but after watching this movie it felt like I did; I wanted to call my therapist after this movie, and I don't even have a therapist.This movie was incredible. Part family drama about grief and loss, part supernatural horror film, ""Hereditary"" is a movie that I am most likely never going to forget, and after watching it you won't either. There are images shown in this movie that I've gotten nightmares about. The thematic elements are more disturbing than I thought I would ever see in a movie released in this day and age. The people sitting next to me in the movie must've thought that I was having a mini seizure because there were so many points where I was grabbing my head, clutching my chest, jumping in my seat, and going ""oh God no."" This movie isn't necessarily scary, but it had me so stressed out that there were many points where I thought about leaving the theatre to just calm down for a second. When the movie ended, the biggest sense of relief washed over me, not because the movie was over per se, but simply because I could finally relax.I won't give any explicit spoilers for this film, so don't worry. What I will say is that this movie is gorgeous. The direction, the cinematography, the lighting, every frame, every shot, everything is delicious to look at. The acting is also immaculate. Everyone in this movie acts to perfection and if Toni Collette doesn't get nominated for an Oscar then she will have been robbed. The top-notch acting and direction enhances this movie so much. While some people may be bored by the slow-burn feel of this movie, I was constantly riveted because of the acting and gorgeous visuals. That being said, this movie is divisive.My audience hated this film. The didn't take this movie seriously, and laughed at literally everything. One older woman said ""That was stupid!"" as soon as the movie ended and I felt personally offended, so offended that I said ""You're stupid!"" and then ran out of the theatre like a child. But you know what? I can see where they were coming from. You see, the ending of this movie, specifically the last 20 or so minutes, will be incredibly polarizing. But for me, I was already so invested by that point that the climax of the movie didn't bother me a bit.So what I'm trying to say is, give this movie a shot. You may love it, you may think it's one of the stupidest movies you'll ever see. But the story, the direction, and the acting are all so immersive that for me, this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Like a bunch of movies I had already seen in the theater I have a lot of catching up to do plus my first time seeing this was very bizarre and rubbed me the wrong way. This movie is perfect maybe I am crazy for owning such a vibrating emotion filled terrifying experience; it is worth it though.I wanna own everything by Ari Aster at the same time I wanna ask if he is ok, his films are extremely disturbing and definitely unsettling! In a good way though don't get me wrong I mean Toni seriously should've been nominated for so many awards! Also I wanna point out there is so much art and incredible shots in this and Midsommer.

"Compelling Filmmaking and Storytelling, Lacks the Horror Punch. Weak Scare Elements","Hereditary stands out for its incredible artistry, marked by excellent symbolism and foreshadowing expertly presented throughout. The directing, particularly the precision of camera cuts, is impressive. The lighting and colour palette is masterclass and creates an ambiance that flatters the acting and complements the theme of the movie. The slow build-up to peaks of insanity is masterfully executed, captivating viewers in the mystery surrounding the unfortunate and chilling events.The choice of music is spot on and helps the creation of an eerie ambiance for the most part. Either that or to match the surrealistic parts of the film.One of the film's strengths lies in its remarkable consistency, maintaining a high standard from start to finish. The recurring house metaphor adds an extra layer of intrigue, while the symbolism associated with it shows the movie's quality. Notably, the striking similarity between the plans of the opening and closing scenes is an indicator to the film's meticulous craftsmanship.Some scenes feel repetitive as the characters seem trapped in a loop. It can be argued that this aspect of the movie is an extension of the ""house"" metaphor. Still it definitely limits the spatial variety and horror-factor of the film.The acting in ""Hereditary"" is top-notch, with characters displaying a range of reactions to intense and emotional moments, heightening the tension within each scene. Director Ari Aster's signature exploration of the human body in its less attractive forms is evident, with body deformities and unsettling appearances present in the movie. In addition to the use of old people and their nudity to remind the viewer of the inevitable and unpleasant reality that awaits us Hereditary employs uncommon facial features to conjure up an uncanny feeling.One of the biggest undermining factors of Hereditary is that it explores an unconventional territory of horror films. While it excels in generating unease and discomfort, relying heavily on symbolism, disfigurement, deformity, and psychological thrills, scare factor is definitely lacking. The source of the unfortunate events is relevant to the plot however not scary. It may be more subjective of a comment but the reason behind the mystery that causes all these events is not impressive. It simply does not add to the horror-factor. The film aims to unsettle and even disgust the audience, enveloping them in a snare of growing sense of doom rather than being directly scary. There are just better ways to tense up the viewer psychologically in horror genre.Nevertheless, every plot point contributes to the escalating desperation of the characters, a trademark for good quality horror films. Despite the ineffective and miscalculated scare tactics ""Hereditary"" maintains a unique atmosphere and narrative depth served by excellent directing. Great symbolism.Overall, more of a psychological and allegorical thriller than horror. A very good artsistic movie that is just not so great in its presented genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
For those who like Horror movies with an actual storyline!,"This one really had it all, but as an avid horror movie watcher, I wouldn't recommend going into this one thinking you're about to see another Saw flick, etc. The acting? Superb. The plot? Fantastic, Hereditary leaves you with lots to talk about after the film. As far as the ""horror"" part of things, I would say there are many scenes where horrific things happen which affect you and leave you shocked, and pull you into the movie and characters even more, but aren't necessarily ""scary"". I recommend this film to all. Horror fanatics, and even the average movie goer that thinks they don't like horror films. This is one that might just change your mind",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid horror film,"Solid throughout and I really appreciated the fact that it was a horror film with intelligence. This family has a ton of baggage and some of the best (and most horrifying) scenes are of them just trying to work through their emotions. Tony Colette is outstanding, and Milly Shapiro as the daughter has the perfect look for the film. Somehow though it didn't quite stick the landing, which just seemed simplistic and a bit of a letdown, especially based on the film's hype. Loved some of the visual touches, e.g. the camera descending vertically beneath the ground when a casket is lowered. I just wish it all could have tied together a little differently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Horrifying, but a must see","Ok so this movie might not function as a classic jump scare horror movie, but overall it is HORRIFYING! The whole theme of the movie is incredibly dark and the final scene leaves the audience feeling very bleak. Other people have complained that the pace is slow and plot boring, but I think it works well for the storyline. If this movie didn't build up, I don't think the final 30ish min would be as effective in terms of shock. Overall I think this is possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen, because it doesn't just deal with ghosts, but the idea that you never truly know who people are, and their intentions. I honestly hope I never see it again, I was too scared and nervous the first time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Totally Let Down By The Final 20 Minutes,"I love horror and I had read so many good things about Hereditary, but tend to watch more obscure titles, so I hadn't got round to it. Today, I thought I would give it a go. I usually really like Toni Collette as an actress but I thought her performance in this was over the top at the end. As for the film itself, the first 2/3rds is superb, about a family falling apart and in mourning, with very creepy undertones. It builds a huge amount of suspense, is very odd in places and I was looking for a good payoff...that just didn't happen. It turned in a woefully bad ending and the final few scenes actually made me laugh. What a shame that something that spends 1 hr 45 mins doing so much right just falls apart at the seams for the sort of schlock ending that you can see in most 3rd rate, low budget, teen horrors. It felt very much like the writers and Director just didn't know what to do at the end and opted for the ridiculous. I am a low scorer in general if you are wondering why it gets a 5, and it only gets that because of the first 2/3rds. I was well on the way to giving this a 8, which is a really good score from me, but the last 20 mins totally throws it down the drain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Supernatural melodrama has you thinking way after the ending,"This is not a scary film.It is a dreadful film in the full sense of the word. You are more disturbed and on edge hours after the film has ended then while watching (Ok until the third act)This is because at first viewing it is not entirely clear what you just watched. Then you put the puzzle pieces together just like Annie building one of her dioramas. When the scales fall from your eyes and the enormity of the evil - real lust for power - at the cost of all, that you really see what just happened.This is a supernatural melodrama and both ends of the rope burn ever so slowly but with extreme intensity.Aster has made as assured debut as you can as both writer and director. This is no pastiche as he charts an extremely particular vision. Aster makes the house, the lighting, the camera - malevolent bystanders to the growing comprehension of horror. Think about how many horror films you see where you actually don't care who gets killed or not. This is the antithesis of that.How is this a cast for your first film - Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne and Ann Dowd..and they are stood up by the incredible children. The haunting debutante Milly Shapiro and the star in waiting Alex Wolff.The real horror of Hereditary is that you could remove all the supernatural content and it would still be extremely disturbing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Two Hours of Anxiety!,"I don't think I've watched another film as anxiety-inducing as Hereditary. From the opening scene there is a feeling of wrongness... and that feeling continues to grow as the film goes on. If you're paying attention to the surroundings as well as to the actors (who are brilliant!!), you see things that raise your hackles; sometimes you need to do a double-take... just to make sure you saw correctly. It'll mess with your mind. And just when you think you've figured it out, the film throws something else at you, completely shattering that belief.A lot of people say the ending makes no sense. But everything that happens in the film, from the very beginning, adds up. It's supernatural; it's mental health; it's family, and loss, and grief. I thought the ending was pretty much perfect. It was almost calming, in a strange way (no spoilers though... you'll either know what I mean, or you'll think I'm a weirdo). When the credits roll, you breathe a sigh of relief, then immediately want to talk about it with someone! It's in no way forgettable, and that feeling of anxiety takes a good while to leave you. I think that's what makes a horror movie - any movie really - truly great.
 
It's not a film made to gross you out, or make you jump (though you might once or twice), which I suppose is what a lot of people were expecting, thus they hated it. It's a simmering horror. It's two hours of anxiety and tension and darkness. It'll leave you feeling pretty damn fragile (I know I needed a hug after watching it!).I can't wait to see what Ari Aster comes up with next!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An urban legend attached to this supremely creepy movie.,"Before I get to my review of this one, I must address that, allegedly, a trailer for this graphic horror film was shown to a theatre full of small kids, gathered to see a kid's movie, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to all present, as compensation. Curiously, in 2007, a similar event occurred, when The Hills Have Eyes Part II was allegedly shown to a theatre full of small kids, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to all present, as compensation. ( Source: moviefone.com/2007/04/06/theater-accidentally-shows-hills-have-eyes-2-to-little-kids/ ) Even more curious, is another cinema allegedly showed one of the recent Saw sequels to a theatre full of small kids, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to those present, as compensation. Sound familiar?Several other times in recent years, a graphic horror film was allegedly shown to a group of small kids, who had gathered to watch a kids' movie, and the theatre owners gave them all free passes as compensation. These stories were widely reported by reputable sources at the time, and every year or two, when a really graphic horror film is released, it allegedly happens again, reported by all the news outlets.It is nothing more than an urban legend. It's not real. No matter where you hear it reported, the exact same story goes around every year or two, the details are always, always, always the same, only the film titles vary: graphic horror shown to a group of kids, they are understandably terrified, theatre owners offer free movie passes as compensation. Don't be fooled into believing this urban legend.Now, on to the movie review, and ..... Wow! It's rare that a movie genuinely disturbs me, due to its unsettling tone, but this film did that, several times over. I went into this one after having only seen one trailer for it a couple of weeks ago, not really even sure what the plot was about, and I think that is the best way to go into this, as cold as possible. Its deliberately slow pacing draws one in to its bizarre story of a crumbling family following the death of their less than loveable grandmother, and the sudden, accidental death of the young daughter ( in one of the most horrifying scenes in recent memory, one which will be stuck in my mind for all time. This film had two such scenes which are likely burnt into my mind forever. ) From then on, we're not sure if the mother, with her history of violence and mental instability, is slowly going crazy, or if it's the teenage son slowly going crazy, both from the death of his sister, and his mother's mentally fractured behaviour, or if there is some other force at work.Very well acted by its trio of main leads, filled with low, ominous sounds, a complete lack of cheap jump scares, and an overall feeling of dread make this nearly unbearably, unwatchably tense, as does a complete lack of humour. There is not one single moment of levity in this entire film. Also, a completely self-contained plot, with zero references to other films drew me into the plot even more.This is a rare horror movie which, while very good, it disturbed me to the point that I don't think I could ever watch it again. It's too unsettling. Highly recommended, just be prepared for a very quiet, unsettling, genuinely frightening plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Toni Collette Shines in This Horror Tale,"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat - Toni Collette is brilliant and could even make a staged reading from a phone book worthwhile. In Hereditary, she gets probably her best role to date as the struggling matriarch of a very cursed family.Besides Collette, Hereditary has one big thing going for it - unpredictability. Just try to figure out how things are going to play out from the trailer or the first 20 minutes of the movie. I dare you. I can't tell you how refreshing that is in this day and age when one can pretty much gather the beginning, middle, and end of any movie from it's overlong trailer.Hereditary is one of those movies that works better when you go into it with no expectations and no knowledge of what's to come, so I'll keep its many surprises under wraps. Just expect to be disturbed and surprised and horrified.You better get used to it, because Hereditary will stay with you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unsettlingly gripping, Hereditary is a perfect example of a horror movie done right.","It's not the abrupt scares that should creep the audience out, but rather the concepts of the movie that should scare the audience. Hereditary does this perfectly. After a family's grandmother dies, the family, especially the mother begins to deal with many unsettling occurrences that may or may not be linked to said grandmother's death.This is a very investing horror drama movie. It uses both genres really well, with the first half acting as the drama portion and the second half acting as the horror portion with sprinkles of horror elements in the beginning. It acts as slow build up to the movie's ending, and it's not quite prominent until the final fifteen minutes since it uses show, don't tell rather than mountains of exposition. The majority of the movie uses show don't tell very effectively in general. There are many quiet scenes that bring up many mysteries such as a light coming from the treehouse, which are very thought provoking.In the beginning, the grandmother was stated to be very secretive and often kept things hidden from even her own daughter. This puts her in a suspicious light when we gradually find out about some of the actions that her family has been put through. I gotta admit, it's both interesting and unsettling as to how they unravel the mystery.And yes this movie was unsettling, especially during the third act. I was on the edge by the final 30 minutes and was quite terrified by the actions performed against the family. Again, it's the concepts portrayed in the movie that scare me. There were little to no cheesy jumpscares; if the movie was filled with jumpscares, it'd get old, but thankfully there were none. There were moments where I was really uncomfortable in the theater because of what was happening. The acting was also really well done, especially from Alex Wolff, who plays the teenage son. As the main character, he was incredible. He was not just convincing in this role, but it felt like he lived and breathed the role as he ended up being the one who suffered the most throughout the movie.I overall loved Hereditary, even though it's not something I see myself watching again. I loved the acting, the suspense, the shift in mood and the unsettling vibe of the movie. This movie, I think will please any true horror enthusiast.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Lots of promises, no pay off...","While the camera work, the sound engineering and most notably some of the acting is top notch, this does not make a great movie. Story and pacing is a serious problem and while the build up is quite good, the pay off falls short. Halfway through it's runtime the movie goes in a very familliar and dare I say: tropy direction and sadly it doesn't redeem itself again.Tony Collette has some very strong moments in the movie but she goes over the top - allmost cringeworthy so - in some other parts (you'll know it when you see it), so I don't think that Oscar is going to happen.At some of it's best moments this movie has hints of and nods to classics like The Shining, The Exorsist and even Susperia but it lacks the hart, soul and most important the consistency of those great movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days!,"'HEREDITARY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed horror flick about a family that begins to experience supernatural hauntings, after the death of their estranged grandmother. The film was written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Ari Aster, and it stars Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Milly Shapiro and Ann Dowd. The movie is a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics. I absolutely loved it!After the death of their reclusive grandmother, the Graham family begins having disturbing (and quite terrifying) experiences. They also learn more about their mysterious ancestry, as depression sets more and more in for some. Severe mental illness also begins to cause havoc for the Graham family, especially for the mother, Annie Graham (Collette). The shocking death of yet another family member soon leaves Annie at a mental breaking point too, and the rest of the family begins feeling haunted as well.The film is one of those hauntingly memorable horror flicks, that's so well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days after you leave the theater (at least if you're someone that's sensitive like me). I love horror films, and I really respect a movie that can make me feel this way. The climax and the ending of the film are so classic, and masterfully effective, that I ultimately had to give the movie the highest rating possible as well. Collette also gives one of the best performances of the year so far too. The film truly is a must see for any die-hard horror fan, or just a movie lover in general as well!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Where is the 3 hour Director's Cut? Ghastly, profane, unrealized with existing cut.","Very gross film. The kind of horror movie that should be sealed in cement or burnt in a fireplace......On the other hand, as a horror film that takes you by surprise---for it's complexity, not traditional scares--- it needs the 3hour director's cut, to be fully fleshed out.The acting is extraordinary, the film's technical style is excellent. The abbreviated resolution of the film is going to fail for most viewers because of the scenes clearly cut out of a longer, more detailed version.This film makes me wonder about the Motives for telling this nightmare story. Very cultish, scary, dark and disturbing. Do they hold secret rituals in real life?Creeped out and profane, but left to much backstory unrealized in 2 hours and 7 minutes. So bring on a Durevtor's cut.Toni Colette is good in everything and here she goes full tilt bonkers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mediocre Thriller Overhyped by the Critics,"This is a solid entry level thriller by Ari Aster with tasteful nods to the quintessentials such as Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.The story opens with Mom (Toni Collette), Dad (Gabriel Byrne), high school son (Alex Wolff), and 13-year-old daughter (Milly Chapiro) dealing with the death of Mom's mother, a domineering woman with a penchant for spellbooks whose absence is generally not missed. After a tragedy befalls this family, supernatural chaos ensues, mostly inside the family home, which of course is in an isolated wooded location.The problem is that it's too slow of a burn, as Aster takes 80% of the movie to build up the suspense and then fails to deliver the anticipated thrills, shock, and awe in the last 20%. Very similar pacing and cliche haunted house tropes (doors opening and closing, candles blowing out, seances, etc.) as the awful Paranormal Activity series.The gem of this film is unquestionably Collette. Her performance of a woman who transitions from anxious grieving daughter, to frenzied matriarch, to utter hysterical terror by the end of the movie, would be the only reason I would ever watch this again (but probably won't). A dinner scene where she releases 16 years of pent up verbal rage upon her family (and the way Wolff's character internalizes the painful things she says) is, admittedly, a very well shot and executed 5 minutes of cinema.Sadly, that's where the good ends. The movie's score is nearly nonexistent and overdoes it with the moments of drawn out silence. Byne is wasted in this film as the secular skeptic, detached father who witnesses the supernatural phenomena firsthand, yet still refuses to believe his wife's assertions that some kind of apparitions are pursuing them with malcontent (due to her convenient history of mental illness). It's also not believable in the slightest how Wolff's character processes the tragedy, receives no therapy whatsoever after the tragedy occurs, or that any of the family members being victimized in the home never think to leave the home.Giving this movie an R rating was a stretch. Giving it a 93% RT rating was an unforgivable overhype. Watch it once for Collette's performance and move on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well, that was scary","I rate on the type of movie and what I expected. This was supposed to be a scary movie with Toni Collette, so I wasn't expecting much - I was wrong.Hereditary wasn't just a scary jump out of my seat movie, it was a disturbing lingering chill. I probably wouldn't have watched it, had I known it would be this way - I don't like to be scarred. I remember seeing The Birds on television, in like 1967 or 68, when I was very young. It scarred me and I have never gotten it out of my mind. The other was The House That Jack Built which I wish I had never seen. I'll probably never forget Hereditary.Don't believe these people who don't think it's a scary movie, please.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Vapid, noisy, hysterical and irritating. The James Corden of horror movies.","I was looking forward to this movie. Someone who had seen it in the States said that it was 'grim'. Another said that it 'stayed with you long after you've finished watching it'.Having watched the movie I can now say that it is grim. But not in a good way. It's the most pretensious, overly dramatic and ultimately vapid film I think I've ever seen.In fact it reminds me of when I was at university studying film analysis. There was a drama department within the arts faculty. You just knew that the small minority of quiet and introspective drama students would go far whilst you got the feeling that those who were loud, strutting and attention seeking weren't interested in acting at all but only in being centre stage. At the end of the year the drama students had to write and stage their own production which they would also act in.Hereditary felt like the kind of end of year production that one of the extroverted dramatists would have produced if it had then been picked up by a film production company and allowed to pollute cinema screens worldwide. Hysterics are ramped up to the max whilst tension and depth, y'know the things that good horror should hinge on are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only tension I experienced were by a couple near me who insisted on talking during the film. And they left halfway through. I was gutted and felt like running after them to try to persuade them to come back in.With Hereditary the film also seems to throw so many ideas into the pot that it really is a case of 'Let's throw all these ideas at the wall. Some are bound to stick!' It didn't work. In this age of remakes, sequels and reboots, especially within the horror genre, original and new ideas are paramount. It can still be done. Some critics and reviewers think this film might be the start of such a renaissance. It isn't and I pity them.I'm now going to watch Muriel's Wedding- a genuine masterpiece that doesn't squander Toni Collette's considerable acting chops.Hereditary is loud, hysterical, hyperactive and desperate for your attention. It's clearly the James Corden of horror films.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An Absolute Masterpiece, Horror Refined.","The Good: What can even be said about Hereditary that hasn't already? This is the film most people think of when you say ""elevated horror,"" or ""horror taken seriously."" Ari Aster has such a knack for transforming dark family drama quite seamlessly into horror and I think that's what people mean when they say that. This feels, first and foremost, like an exploration of the human condition, family dynamics, grief, and whether we are doomed to our fates. In the twisted world of Hereditary, the answer is a resounding yes.None of this would be possible with unbelievable filmmaking. The cinematography, editing, lighting, set and sound design are just expert tier here. It's hard to believe this is Aster's first full length film, it's honestly so impressive. The world created here through such attention to detail feels oppressive and unsettling; something that many films try to do, but never really accomplish. There's a coldness to Hereditary's world; not just in how the world is presented, but how the characters speak to one another, that makes what happens in the film so much more believable.Toni Collette's Oscars snub for this film should be remember the way The Dark Knight was snubbed for Best Picture. (I mean, I think this should've been nominated as well). To say she disappears into her character is an understatement, and this without the use of make up or prosthetics. She just feels like the exasperated, broken, desperate person she appears to be; so human that you feel like you've met her in real life. Natt Wolf is also amazing here, a big surprise when I first saw it. His vulnerable performance and his generally unlikable, yet sympathetic character, are really effective at emphasizing the sheer cruelty of this film's plot.Oh, the PLOT. Hereditary is intricately written, so layered in meaning and hidden clues and entendres. Watching this film after knowing what happens is truly a different experience; everything is re-contextualized. And that the sets and sounds work to add visual and auditory components to these clues and callbacks is a masterwork in film. If you can't tell, I love this movie.The Bad: Hereditary is one of those rare movies that I kind of wish was longer; we could've learned a bit more about the family dynamic (although, I completely understand the reason to hold back). But I suspect I'm only writing that because even as dark and depressing and cold as Hereditary is, I'm still fascinated by this family and their dysfunction. I wanted to see even more.There are also some things that I don't think make a ton of sense, little logistical moments that I'm sure could be explained away with the supernatural stuff that happens, but nevertheless, bugged me over the years. (What is the deal with Annie at the end and how is she getting where she gets? Why is she seemingly everywhere? That's what I'm talking about)The Ugly: I've seen literally hundreds of horror movies in my lifetime. Only a handful make me feel unsettled, prompt me to look over my shoulder, or switch one all the lights that night. Very few are able to do this after a rewatch. Yet, even after seeing Hereditary at least 4 times, I still feel this way when I watch it. It is so head and shoulders above so much of the horror we get, it's not even funny. It's one of the best horror movies of all time. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Biggest disappointment of 2018,"Wow what can I say? I've been anticipating this film since hearing about it from Sundance. The problem with critics and the buzz surrounding this film was that it was way too hyped to the point where I was expecting the holy grail of terror. What me and my audience got was a decent and compelling start that crash lands into a comedy of errors. The film was just not terrifying nor was it goosebump inducing. I just stared blankly at the screen feeling muted and emotionless. I love slow burn horror and films that are filled with dread.This had a very good compelling premise but somehow the director decided to go artsy fartsy surreal pretentious in the final minutes of the film and boy did my audience groan and laugh. Trust me it was not nervous laughter but the kind you hear at a Farrelly brothers movie. Wait wasn't this suppose to be a horror film? How did it suddenly transform into a lame campy Mommie Dearest meets Rosemary's Baby unintentional comedy? Everyone booed and hissed on the way out of the theater. Literally the worst ending to a genre movie in ages. I was waiting for Natalie Portman to come out in black swan smeared kabuki make up and make some kind of cameo. This generations Exorcist? These critics are seriously deluded.Word-of-mouth from paying moviegoers will not be kind. Avoid unless you are a film student or love movies with godawful endings. I can see this being a Rocky Horror type of flick where audiences mouth click throughout the film and yell howlers at the screen like ""Don't you ever raise your voice at me, I am your mother!!!""",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A New Paradigm In Horror,"Hereditary: Tolstoy wrote: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" In this film each member of the Graham family is unhappy in their own way. Annie (Toni Collette), the mother, grieves for her own recently deceased mother. But she was estranged from that difficult, domineering woman for years only reconciling towards the end. Her father starved himself to death, her brother committed committed suicide. All of that trauma seems to have driven Annie over the edge.Charlie (Milly Shapiro), the daughter, is unhappy in herself, gorges on chocolate, sketches continuously, cuts the heads off dead birds, sleeps in a treehouse. Peter (Alex Wolff), the son, is a pothead, he feels unloved by his mother, as the film unfolds he develops a crippling guilt over an accident he feels responsible for. Steve (Gabriel Byrne), the paterfamilias, has a countenance as dour and world weary as we've come to expect from Stephen Rea. He carries out the mundane tasks of cooking and trying to keep the family together. A counterpoint to the craziness of Annie.One of the most shocking scenes in the film has no explicit supernatural cause but it left me gasping. There are plenty of shocks provoked by strange entities though and none of seem forced. Spirits possess Seance participants, messages are written on chalkboards by invisible hands. Murderous spirits are summoned up. Levitation and Spontaneous Human Combustion All of this is somehow related to secrets kept by Annie's deceased mother.Annie builds dolls house's, meticulously detailed, she is even working on a model of the hospice where her mother died. This is used by director Ari Aster to frame many shots as the action moves seamlessly from model to the real house and back again. The Graham's residence has the appearance of a dolls house, the furniture layout, shots along corridors. While Aster is at the helm and delivers a witty but scare inducing screenplay, cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski, editing by Lucian Johnston and Jennifer Lame, production design by Grace Yun and set decoration by Brian Lives all contribute to success of this unique Horror Film. I see elements of A Dark Song, Kill List, The Exorcist and even Rosemary's Baby but this is very much it's own film. Pacing is perfect. A new paradigm in Horror. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary (2018),"Everyone's favorite production company (A24), comes back with a much anticipated horror film. I liked the trailer for this, despite feeling like it didn't reveal a whole lot. Also the film seemed to get a lot of early hype, and I'm not just talking about the parents and kids panicking when they accidentally showed this trailer at a screening of Peter Rabbit. The film earned high praise early on but of course I had to see this for myself. I've let the viewing sink in and I know that I really like this film despite it being full of questions.The film follows a family after the death of the grandma. The family initially seems to be at odds with one another. We soon find out that the daughter of the family, Charlie, was close with her grandmother. Charlie is the type who is quiet and has odd mannerisms including a clucking sound. Without saying much more, the family experiences tragedy and find out that things aren't what they seem as they feel like they are being haunted by an evil presence.It is so hard to talk about the plot without revealing something crazy. Just watch this film. Its not a conventional horror film, the film is almost entirely devoid of jump scares and does not really and scaring you in the moment. The film is more cerebral; its a psychological film that is engorging from beginning to end. Its shot extremely well, and is detail oriented. Ari Aster absolutely knocks it out of the park in his film debut. There are things and moments in this film that I still question, and I feel like the director leaves many clues and easter eggs throughout. This film demands a second watch.I don't see Toni Colette in many films but my god she is amazing in this. Absolutely portrays every emotion perfectly. You see the rage, depression, fear, and absolute terror all emoted on her face. Such great praise for her and Alex Wolff who was also excellent. Lets not forget Ann Dowd as well, she's always solid in everything she's in and does not disappoint here either. The performances really add to the aura of what you are seeing on screen.This film has some really memorable scenes. I don't get scared by horror films but this one really has scenes that are brilliant. I was even laughing hysterically at some parts and finding myself surprised by what transpires. I think everyone should try to see this and unpack what this film offers. I will say though, I thought the ending could have been better and feel like there are things in the film that demanded explanation. Its fine though, this is one of the best films of the year so far.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

drama horror,"Ari Aster considers his ""Hereditary"" more of a family drama than a horror movie. I can see that. It does focus more on grief than on jump scares. It's no comparison to ""The Shining"" in creating terror (but what movie is?).There were certainly a few scenes that shocked me. The downsides are the uneven performances and a few things that look kind of silly. But that dollhouse and a couple of tricks that rival Hitchcock in using non-verbal ways to tell the story make for one fine movie. I hope that Aster makes more movies like this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Do Not Believe The Hype!,"Do I live in the Twilight Zone or something? I'm completely baffled if this is what people consider:""A modern day horror masterpiece."" (USA Today)The reviewers of this movie are either delusional, been paid off, or Ari Aster himself because there is absolutely NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE. No destination. A soulless automaton disguised as a profound mediation on:""An unsettling look at the demons we have inherited from our parents."" (Vanity Fair)Wow, what a great one liner right? The things a talented filmmaker could've done with this simple seed of an idea, an idea that permeates, connects, and could've been a genre defining masterpiece but instead I was given:Paper thin characters. A plot that had no trajectory. Laughable performances from the whole cast. Horror imagery that served no purpose other than, this looks scary! Style over substance.Toni Colette, you've disappointed me dearly. Thought I was in for an Oscar Award Winning performance and what I was left with was a comedic rendition of what it truly means to be an artist. You talked about giving your soul into this character and all I saw was a performance with no intention.This is the same company (A24) that released ""It Comes At Night"" and ""The Witch,"" two other mediocre horror movies billed to be the scariest films of all time when they were released.It was one of the worst experiences I had in a theater and in film in general. People were in uproarious fits of laughter throughout the 2 HOUR RUNTIME for what was supposed to be:""Terrifying."" (Indiewire) and ""Bone-chilling"" (The Hollywood Reporter)Clearly Ari needs help with his storytelling skills. He has technical finesse, but technicality is nothing when compared to a story with nuance and insight, something that is emotionally compelling and moving.

Needlessly slow - it's just a stupid horror movie,"The film is well shot. The climax is well made and unnerving. However, the movie wastes your time with the beginning half in which nothing happens. This criticism is unfortunately often misused in films where little action takes place to establish and deepen themes, or analyze characters. However, this movie is not intelligent or creative enough to make use of these periods of slow pacing. It does not contribute to any themes, it does not develop characters - the movie really just starts and ends with the concept of ""don't stick your in crazy"". Being slow paced and lacking jump scares is not substance in itself.Comparing this movie to other slower A24 titles like ""It Comes At Night"", or ""The Witch"" is incredibly misleading because while those movies were also slow paced, they used that downtime to flesh out themes, to build the tension, and to analyze characters and their motivations. ""Hereditary"" does none of these things - it just wastes your time in an incredibly stupid manner because I feel as if this movie assumes its viewers are stupid and can't tell the difference anyway. It is incredibly insulting to have someone compare stretches of stupid indulgent trash with more thought out works.However, I am rating this movie a 6/10 because the climax was well done and unnerving, it's just not particularly subtle or intelligent. The ending was obvious, I saw the twist coming from a mile away. In the end, it's just an okay horror movie brought down by immense pretention with lack of talent to back it up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow build up then BAM!,"This movie was triiiiiiipy. I went into this movie totally blind--I didn't know what it was about, who was in it, or even the genre. I don't want to say I was confused, but I did have questions about where the movie was going in the beginning.The movie begins with Annie (Toni Collette) quasi-grieving the loss of her mother. It's clear they didn't have the best relationship and it's clear that her mother had some skeletons in the closet. Annie's husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), is a supportive good husband. Her son, Peter (Alex Wolff), seems OK except he likes to get stoned. Her daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), is truly the odd duck. It's enough for her to be considered strange that she's thirteen and looks like she just lost her front tooth and she likes to cluck like a hen; except it doesn't end with that.For the first hour of the movie all you know is that something is not right with the family. In that first hour a few key things occur--important and shocking enough to keep you in-tuned but still not informational enough to let you know what's coming next. Then, in the last hour is when I was at the edge of my seat, then gripping the armrests, then mentally preparing myself to be spooked to death. The last hour was a rollercoaster.

"Disturbing and unsettling, Hereditary is a genuine classic","No doubts about it, whatever experience you think you're going to get from Hereditary or whatever you think Hereditary is, it's probably not, but where there are no doubt's is in the fact that Ari Aster's scarily good debut film is a modern day horror classic.A deeply disturbing and unsettling film, that crafts an ominous and dread filled environment from its opening frames until its unforgettable finale, Hereditary isn't your typical jump scare filled horror event, more so an incendiary, mentally mind melting offering that will crawl under your skin and stay there for days and weeks afterwards.Focusing on the Graham family who are mourning (or celebrating?) the recent passing of their secretive grandmother Ellen, Aster's film introduces us to Toni Collette's miniature making mother Annie, Gabriel Bryne's kind-hearted therapist father Steve and Nat Wolff and Milly Shapiro's teenage children Peter and Charlie, as the slightly dysfunctional crew begin to find their lives taking some (lets we say odd) turns in the aftermath of Ellen's death.With this peculiar collection of souls, Aster has established a horror film family for the ages, that's impressively played by all performers, with Australia's own Toni Collette delivering a career best and award's worthy turn as the mentally unhinged Annie, whose life has been anything but ordinary.With Collette's Annie and Shapiro's downright unnerving Charlie at the forefront, Aster builds a narrative that is slow burning in nature but utterly gripping from start to finish and it's the type of experience that is best watched as blind as possible to allow the viewer to absorb, and in many ways handle, the goings on.You know and understand from very early on that not all is as it seems in Aster's tale and it's a sustained feeling that pulls the rug out from under you on more than a few occasions, making you quickly understand that anything is possible in this unique and powerful creation.Combined with Pawel Pogorzelski brilliant cinematography and Colin Stetson's goose bump inducing score, Aster's debut is two hours of pure unadulterated tension and brilliance and it really can't be overstated just how impressive Aster's effort is here as a first-time director, marking him down instantly as one of the industry's brightest new talents.Final Say -There's so much that can be said about this stunning and hauntingly horrific tale and while arguably not for all tastes, for those that fall under Hereditary's spell, this is a cinematic experience not to be missed, with Aster's film one that is set to be talked about and picked a part for year's yet to come.5 chocolate cakes out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very Well-Acted but Slightly Erratic Horror Film,"With its outstanding reviews, strong buzz, and creepily powerful marketing, ""Hereditary"" has come to theaters with far more buzz than the typical independent horror film. This can be chalked up at least in part to the outstanding track record and marketing efforts of indie distributor A24, whose other films tend to be of great quality. While not quite as great as last year's horror film ""It Comes At Night"" from them, this is a solid film that has much to commend on its own merits.It would practically be a crime to spoil this movie for the uninitiated, but all I will say is that the film tells the grim tale of a family struggling with the death of the matriarch (Toni Colette)'s mother. Things start to spiral out of control from there, in ways both expected and unexpected. Right from the first frames, talented first-time director Ari Aster grabs you with an intense and almost oppressive sense of psychological dread and never lets go until the finale. The ability to create such a feeling of dread and doom in a realistic--rather than cheesy or ludicrous--manner is truly commendable. The film's simple music and score is its greatest instrument (no pun intended) in creating such a visceral personal feeling of deep unease. Unfortunately, such score also feels quite repetitive at times which occasionally can dilute its prospective impact late in the film--but it still generally works well. In particular, attempts to create emotional power with the score during the film's more dramatic moments could have been improved. The film's performances are very strong throughout, with a particular emphasis on Toni Colette. Colette nails the role of Annie, an artistic and grieving mother of two, with skillful precision. From her facial expressions to her visceral processing of grief, her performance feels wholly authentic and impactful. The film does feel consistently intense and scary throughout, and credit must be given to Aster for not emphasizing the ultimate tired and lazy horror cliché--the jump scene. (There is only one real jump scene, but it is properly timed to be truly unexpected and quite well-done.)Despite is positive qualities, ""Hereditary"" does have some flaws as well. The film's pacing can be a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, I truly appreciate Aster's intention to frame the film within the context of a slow-burn, tense family drama to promote the establishment of thoughtful character development and associated thinking. On the other hand, this pacing means that the horror elements often feel a bit rushed near the end. In particular, the film's last ten minutes feel like they are paced outrageously fast--which may, to some degree, reduce the psychological impact of such scenes. Also, while the film contains many original elements, its frantic finale also deploys some rather common and predictable motifs in the horror genre without creating a spin on such elements to differentiate them from other common representations within horror movies. That said, this is a well-made film that fans of the genre will likely appreciate--although it remains to be seen whether mainstream audiences will, as the film may be too slow for much of its runtime for many of them. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nope.,"I'm a horror fan. I enjoy horror movies. But I did not like this one. There are three things that I expect in a solid horror movie- reasonable gore, good storyline, and originality. For that last one, this movie definitely meets the mark- it's certainly original. But for the other two, it fails miserably. Now if you're a huge gore fan, you probably won't mind. But if you're like me- you don't mind some gore, but you hate it when gore is so extreme that it overtakes the movie, you probably want to pass on this one. Finally, the storyline- it sucked. It was super convoluted, tried way too hard to be deep, and seemed so intent on being original and avoiding common tropes that it just became boring. It's like if a toddler came up with a movie idea and was given tons of money and blind encouragement. Overall, I would not watch it again.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A truly exceptional and jarring horror film that leaves quite the impression.,"I was under the impression that I could no longer be truly frightened by a horror film. Especially those with supernatural themes. The last one I saw in the theater featuring demon-possession, Annabelle: Creation, was entertaining and exceeded my expectations, for sure. I was never really scared while watching it, though. It was fun but there was nothing...believable about that kind of horror to me.Walking into Hereditary, I was in a completely empty theater auditorium, and I had no clue what to expect. I'd heard a glowing review of the film from one of my favorite authors, Bret Easton Ellis, who insisted in an episode of his podcast that this was a horror film unlike the usual ones we get these days. It had really had an effect on him, and he had so much praise for it, so I knew I had to see it while it was still in theaters. I had very high hopes that I would finally be genuinely frightened by a horror film again, much like I was the first time I had seen Paranormal Activity in the theater as a teenager.Did Hereditary ever deliver.Thirty minutes into the film, I became tense; there was no telling where this film was going to go anymore. I felt uneasy, and realized my teeth were firmly clenched together. My anxiety was through the roof. I wanted to see what would happen next and I also hoped for a moment to relax and feel safe. The stunning cinematography and brilliant acting performances from the entire cast had me absolutely immersed in this horror story.Without giving away too much information - because you should absolutely see this film knowing little about it in order to experience its many surprises - this horror film is not typical in any way. Much like The Babadook, it draws parallels between supernatural events and the experience of mental illness and grief on a family. I feel that Hereditary surpasses The Babadook, however, in its much more effective storytelling and thrilling imagery. One thing you should know before seeing Hereditary is that there are many subtle, yet extremely important, pieces of information that make the conclusion a lot more comprehensible if you pick up on them. Paying close attention to detail is vital when viewing this film, and I very much look forward to viewing it a second time and noticing even more details that I possibly missed. I'm sure there were a few.I commend Ari Aster's artistry that went into creating one of the best horror films I have ever seen. He truly understands the horror genre and how to do it brilliantly. This being his first full-length film, I am highly anticipating his future work and I'll definitely be purchasing Hereditary when it is released on 4k Ultra HD. I imagine it will be a film I revisit many times, despite how utterly shaken I was after my first viewing. I highly recommend this film to fans of psychological horror; you will not be disappointed.Film Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hereditary: Peculiar little film,"I wasn't expecting much from Hereditary, Hollywood has lost their way when it comes to horror to such an extent I'm not sure I've enjoyed one since Orphan (2009).Starring Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne it's an odd little tale and very hard to explain without spoiling anything.It's certainly interesting, has some genuine shocks and is in no way predictible like these things usually are but alas it does still fall into many of the usual Hollywood pitfalls.A highly over convoluted plot that does leave you scratching your head, I'm happy to say it does for the most part explain everything it just goes around the houses in doing so.Performances are on point, visually it looks solid and again it's not the cliched mess you expect to come out of Hollywood, but it's still not all that good.I cannot get my head around how it has such an incredibly high rating. 7.4 at time of writing, a movie only needs 8.0 to get into the top 250 movies!

The greatest horror movie?,"Horror movies have always had oddly low scores on IMDB, and watching this movie with the rating in mind, I finally figured out why. Horror movies are either good and don't have any horror tropes that many horror fans come for, or they are bad and have a ton of those tropes. There's nothing really in between. Hereditary falls into the former camp. This is a movie that deserves a better rating, but many horror fans won't enjoy its lack of tropes and cliches.There aren't many of those here, but there is some of the most unsettling and depressing atmosphere of any movie I've ever seen. For a long time Hereditary is largely an exploration of the fear and grief of its characters, though its punctuated regularly enough with bizarre scenes and mysterious plot developments to keep you curious. By the time this movie reaches its final act, you will be very unsettled, and the final act is when hereditary finally delivers its horror scenes. And they hit really hard at that point.I will say that while I liked this movie, I'm not sure I enjoyed watching it that much. The suffering two of the characters go through, and the insanely good acting, was really hard to watch.Rating: 8/10

Disturbing as hell!,"In how many ways can I describe how disturbing this film was? This horror film is not unsettling because of gore or other typical horror elements, it is difficult to watch due to the mental and psychological implications. The acting is so incredible that you actually feel the pain with the characters (and I'm again not referring to physical pain). Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro and Alex Wolff were so good, it felt like watching real life unfold in front of your very eyes. Alex Wolff in particular was astonishingly good after the unexpected car accident that shocked me so intensely that I literally froze, and paused the film to contemplate what just happened. Gabriel Byrne is a brilliant actor, but he wasn't really given much to do in this film, as he was the only one trying to keep it (and the family) together. He was very reserved, but still played a vital role. His character was in direct contrast to the rest of his family.The film is very, very well made and very realistic.

Critics are a bunch of grredy Suckers writing only for money. I think I have much more respect for W*****,"I saw this because it was proclaimed by critics (probably the same who overhype the marvel movies) that this movie was the best a horror movie can offer. they said that it was so disturbing that some of them had a hard time forgetting the movie after it had ended. All a bunch of non sense.This movie has a great atmosphere and splendid cast, but the script and moreover the narration lets it down. I seriously waited for one truly scary terrifying moment (there are actually some of these, but not many) that would maybe make it different from the norm (Conjuring) these days but was disappointed. It builds up slowly into something that appears to be great but ends up being not even mediocre. The sequence of event that happen in the movie make no sense and are not explained to complete satisfaction. that is the main flaw of the movie. The end not only disappoints but makes u cringe abt why did u even bother.I re-iterate",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fine direction, good acting and yet...","Ari Aster, who debuts as director, has done a very fine job of keeping the spectator riveted without using conventional music or scary sound effects. In fact, the scariest moment in the movie comes from young daughter's swallowing in her saliva. Toward the end, one hears what appears to be a yoga mantra, and never has any mantra sounded more terrifying.The claustrophobic atmosphere is appropriate and well exploited but the moment Joanie comes in with her supernatural contacts, the film begins to go over the top. There is far too much gore in a film that actually tries to be subtle most of the time. And Peter's coronation as Paimon in the end struck me as a damp squib, after all the shenanigans and cruel killings.Finally, Gabriel Byrne is simply wasted as Steve, a husband who apparently just misses the plot altogether and has no authority at all within the family. What about sleepwalker Collette and all her miniature furniture and people? Couldn't see the point of it.Admittedly, this is not my type of movie, but I cannot honestly give it more than 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
GENRE DEFINING,"After her mother passes away, Annie and the rest of the family are grief-stricken. Soon, strange things start occurring and the horrifying truth about Annie's ancestry begins to come to light.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This family is uniquely unhappy. 65+%,"Having heard good things about this film on Australian ABC radio (across multiple programmes or segments), I thought I'd watch this. Since I don't really watch commercial TV, I haven't seen any ads for this film, so I'll keep my description of what happens rather vague, so as to not to divulge any spoilers for you.The plot involves the aftermath of the death of the mother of Annie Graham (Toni Collette). As Annie says in her eulogy at the funeral service for her mum, Ellen was a ""secretive"" woman. There are a lot of interesting titbits about Ellen for the rest of the film, as well as for Annie's fraught relationship with her own family (husband Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne, nearly adult teenage son Peter, played by Alex Wolff and their 13-year-old daughter Charlie, played by Milly Shapiro).There are hints of the supernatural in this film and it made me wonder how the rest of the film would unspool...would it be a supernatural horror film or psychological thriller? In either case, the film chooses to reach its conclusion at a funereal pace, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but may not appeal to those who cleave to the fast and easy thrills of Hollywood fare. Some films which ""Hereditary"" brought to mind in terms of pace, characterisation or visuals included ""Rosemary's baby"", ""Pan's labyrinth"" and the rather good if obscure Australian film ""Summerfield"". The first and the last film could be considered good companion pieces to ""Hereditary"", although I wasn't that keen on ""Rosemary's baby"" but did quite like ""Summerfield"". Those other films aren't fresh in my memory and I don't mean to suggest that they are very similar to ""Hereditary""...I just find that there's a certain ""family resemblance"" to them...cousins, so to speak. If you don't mind films which unfold at a measured pace, there is value in viewing each of them. Oh...just remembered...the original ""The wicker man"" is worth mentioning as a ""cousin"" of these films.That being said, there are a couple of gruesome scenes in ""Hereditary"", so the film isn't devoid of some shock value for the unwary. It should also be noted that there is some artifice in ""Hereditary"". For instance, the Graham family is introduced to us via a cinematic device, which did make me wonder what implications that had for what we were about to see. Similarly, there is a scene with a very odd camera angle when showing Annie in a hallway. Maybe you could view that cinematic device as ""Hitchcockian""...and maybe you could also say that it alluded to a later scene with Annie at her home.I also liked the narrative titbits in this film which made me wish that I could rewind the film at the cinema to listen again to some comment or to pause a scene so that I could try and recognise certain symbols or strange objects. Speaking of which, there is also a novel visual cinematic device in this film to bring to the viewer's attention something uncanny occurring.No spoiler here, but as for the ending, my initial impression was that it had a mystifying conviction, which, in retrospect, I no longer think is accurate. Tongue-in-cheek, you could perhaps say that the ending of the film follows naturally on from the mystifying psychedelic end-sequence of ""2001: A space odyssey"".Not really a criticism, but I did wonder how the events of the film all cohered to bring you the resolution that is revealed. Were the events leading up to it inevitable? I.e. was the fate of the key character at the end of the film ""ordained"" from the outset, so to speak? This kind of question is what made ""Summerfield"" such a good film, in my view (I've reviewed that title here, as I have ""Rosemary's baby"" and ""Pan's labyrinth"" (which I see that I gave a score of 10/10 to. ""Summerfield"" got 8/10 from me and ""Rosemary's baby"" got 6/10 from me).Still on the ending...I'm wondering how scary that outcome was, considering the domestic nature of much of the preceding drama. I would tend to think that maybe the resolution wasn't as scary at it was (perhaps) intended to be, assuming the ending was intended to be interpreted literally...which it may or may not have been, in any case!Random observations:* The actors playing the children aren't your typical Hollywood film teenagers, visually. Peter didn't even seem to have a family resemblance to Annie and Steve, in which case the casting is a bit odd in that respect...or is it? I dunno!* Maybe there could have been a bit more chills immediately following the wake for Annie's mum, relating to her, before the themes of Annie's loss and grief unspool.* What was that stuff about the black dots or whatever it was which Annie had on her finger? Or the bit where she touches her mum's corpse at the wake? Hmm.* On one film review segment on ABC local radio the reviewer did mention that he thought that Toni Collette could (would?) win an Academy Award for her performance. Toni Collette does get to display scenes of extreme grief, so that may catch the eye of the voters, perhaps.* An interesting reaction from Peter following a shocking event. In a way it was unbelievable and in another way, it was entirely believable.P.S. I'm a big fan of ""The exorcist"", which is another film which does a great job in building tension and not rushing into its shocks. 10/10 from me and also reviewed at this site by me.P.P.S. ...and now I'm wondering how the film's title fits into its meaning...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Laughably disappointing,"Boring regurgitation of every horror movie that came before it. I watched in stunned disbelief, hoping it would be saved by the third act.

Ari Aster pens a fresh modern horror with his first movie and Toni Collette is terrifyingly good,"Hereditary doesn't have many negatives at all. It is a refreshingly good horror in a genre that relies on too may of the same old jump-scares and basic plot devices.Written and Directed by Ari Aster, his first movie, Hereditary is a fantastic opener for the American. One of the main takeaways for a horror is to leave the viewer talking about and remembering the scares. Hereditary certainly achieves that. The plot feels different, certainly in how it builds and some of the scenes are certainly memorable. I am looking forward to Aster's second movie Midsommar later this year featuring the excellent Will Poulter.Speaking of the cast, Toni Collette is simply outstanding in this movie. So much so, that she is in for Oscar contention. Her expressions in many scenes are simply terrifying on their own. The great thing about this movie is that this performance doesn't even need to carry the movie, the supporting cast is also good. Alex Wolff as the son, is also outstanding and he is involved in all of the major and scary scenes in the movie. Milly Shapiro plays a character that is particularly well written and she pulls off the creepy sibling with ease. Gabriel Byrne who plays the most sane character in the movie also is his typically solid self.I need to mention the cinematography also, some of the scenes are really well shot. The house in particular, which reminded me of some of the hotel rooms and lobby in The Shining, was a very good choice. The open plan living area just added to the tension in one major scene with Collette, Byrne and the fire.Overall, this is a very enjoyable watch for any horror fan and Ari Aster is definitely one to watch as a writer and director in this genre. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Beautifully-filmed horror with a musical score that pulsates with intensity,"Beautifully filmed and realized, credit should be given to the musical score for staying out the way when needed and bringing the thrills at the most opportune times. Today's accompanying music is usually too loud, not particularly matching what is going on the screen and just plain bad. This is the exception. The score almost makes the movie.That's not to say the rest is not almost equally as fine. The pace may be slow but percolates with tension. The director is adept at showing us just what we need to see and hinting at more to come.It's not all perfect, however: the son, who is supposed to be a young teen but looks closer to 40, elicited embarrassed laughter from the theatre audience on at least two of the most intense scenes when his crying is so fake you have to snicker. Likewise, Toni Collette does a wonderful job here but her accelerating hysteria begins to take away some of the power of her performance. The ending is somewhat anticlimactic and doesn't match the intensity of the rest of the movie.But that's griping. This is a horror movie that avoids most clichés while giving us thrills, chills and plenty to talk about afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

DON'T DO ANY INVESTIGATING,"I know it's hard in this day and age not to want to find out ever little secret and spoiler of a movie before you see it- but I went into this film pretty much blind, other than watching the trailer- and it was a good move. I was SO shocked at points, all because I didn't do any research and the trailer is literally just a SNIPPET of the full story- seriously, if you think you know the story off of the trailer, plot twist, you seriously don't.
I think what's great about this film is that it left me with questions, with intrigue and with genuine engagement- I just want to see it again so badly, and I only saw it last night! 
It is 100% scary, at some points terrifying. However I'd say it's more shocking and disturbing that 'terrifying'- however the INCREDIBLE score really makes it hard for this film not to get under your skin, honestly the music in this movie is a 10/10 followed also by the cinematography. Most importantly however, the acting is superb- I was really impressed by Alex Wolff and Toni Collette especially, I think she truly deserves an Oscar nom' for this role.

Nice effort !,"For a first movie, it's a really nice one. The cast is amazing, some scenes are really heartbreaking (in the first third of the picture) and there are many good ideas (the first shot is just... wow !).
I didn't know what to expect because i meticulously avoided every article, review or trailer, just knew it was sort of a Rosemary's Baby/The Exorcist/The Witch kinda flick (which are quite différent, but let's say it's not a Saw or a Freddy Krueger). And it was supposed to be the movie that finally gave you some real terror on screen.
Unfortunately, the movie, even though it doesn't use all the easy tropes that we are common to these days (like cheap jump scares and such) takes too long to get into the fantasy-horror element. Or let's say, you can consider the movie just being a family drama up to some point (with again one heartbreaking moment you never want to live as a human being). And that shift point came too late in the movie for me. So late I wasn't part of the audience anymore. I was just someone sitting there, waiting for something to happen, as someone who's watched tens of thousand of movies before. The magic was gone when it finally started to come together.
I find it sad because there are a lot of good things. I mean a LOT, from plot development to an ambiance that reminded me of the best creepy feelings I had watching the first season of True Detective. Also, the director/screenwriter's intentions are really interesting (I won't spoil it, you can find a good article diving into everything on the /Film website). 
Finally and again, some shots are really creepy on paper and and make for memorable big screen moments (again, no spoil, just check the movie out). 
But alas, I wasn't in there any more. I was still interested in how that would end (in contract to what i felt watching ""The killing of a sacred deer"" for exemple), but I felt like someone was just telling me what was happening, instead of being engulfed in it.
I'm really interested with what's coming next in Ari Aster future because there's so much to dig in here (screeplay, narrative, story building and directing wise), and I'm really happy I took some time to go and watch this in theaters. 
Just sad it didn't have more of an impact on me. But I have to confess, The Exorcist never had that grip on me everybody is talking about. So maybe if the Friedkin flick scared you to death, don't forget to check this one out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Amazing technical achievement by Ari Aster,"This is a first feature film from director Ari Aster. The technique was amazingly well done, setting new boundaries for the genre, while using the best aspects of the classics. The director showed that he really knows his craft. 
The film is very atmospheric, with a quiet pace and psychological tension that held my attention from the beginning. The technique and precision of image and sound are astonishing, and separates it from the other horror movies that we're used to watching. It settle the family drama really well, and it knew when to reveal and withhold information.
The supernatural aspects of the story contributed to the scary moments in the film, and although they were too over the top, the unpredictability of every scene and the technique used to build up the sensations that made us feel fear during those scenes actually overshadowed the story. 
By the end, I was taken a little off the characters due to the over-exposition of the story background, but throughout the whole movie I could connect with them emotionally. They were really well acted, and had dramatic nuances that made them human and multi-dimensional.
A very good film overall, that made me feel fear through my spine in several scenes, a psychological kind of fear the doesn't make me feel manipulated. I can't say it is exactly original, because it takes so many things from other films of the genre, specially the Shining and the Exorcist, but it is really well made, and the way it mixes art-house cinema with mainstream is what makes it emotional and entertaining both as a drama and a horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So much more than just horror,"Hereditary is hands down the most surprising, upsetting, and well-crafted movie I've seen this year. What makes this movie stand out is that it spends a lot more time than you'd expect setting the stage for a family drama to unfold before transitioning into a full on horror film. That makes you far more sympathetic to the characters and more invested in the final outcome than many other horror movies. Also, the storytelling in this movie needs to be applauded. The audience is never spoon fed answers about what is happening, but just given subtle clues one piece at a time, until the ending where you finally walk away with a complete picture. Also for people who are seeing this movie only for the horror element, it won't be what you are expecting but it also won't disappoint. The director exercised incredible restraint. When watching it you begin to think you sense a jump scare coming that any other movie would have, but instead, the scene fully plays out without one. What this does is build tension through the whole movie, making the ending that much more horrifying because the director finally lets loose. Lastly, I need to mention the acting in this film. Toni Colette and Alex Wolf in particular deliver powerhouse performances that elicit the full range of emotions. Hopefully once Oscar season rolls around, these two won't be forgotten, because their performances are truly worthy of nomination. Over all, if you are a horror fan, film enthusiast, or just want to see a good movie, Hereditary is the movie for you to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Going in Cold,"Do as I did: If you haven't seen this, stop now, rent/buy this movie and watch it as cold as possible. Can't ask for a much better movie-going experience.Well, and then, come back and enjoy my review. :-)Yep, one of my favorite ways to go into a movie is: COMPLETELY COLD. Not hearing anything, not who stars in the movie, the basic plot, hell, not even the subgenre, if it's divided. Someone recommended this to me months ago and now that it's available for home viewing, I finally got to see it.These past few months haven't been easy to live in the dark surrounding the movie because...people like to talk. What they don't see as a spoiler is darn well a spoiler for someone like me that doesn't ever want to see trailers because, again, I like to go in stone cold and just on a recommendation from someone.Whew! I severely digress. Back to the movie. Since I already gave the disclaimer up front, I can freely talk about the movie. Though, with as little revealed as possible.As the title suggests, things are passed on in this overly melancholy family. In the beginning, the grandmother dies and leaves the Mom/Dad, Daughter/Son family the main focus, and actually two more than others. But, bam! Just when you thought it was safe to go down the path of normal horror, the tides shift and more misery emerges.Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this movie for the majority of it. I thought the performances were too over the top, the family was obscenely creepy and the drama was thick enough to cut with a knife. And then...Things began to open my eyes and more and more revealed to drop my jaw. And sadly, it's only then that you realize that they've given you so many clues in this supposedly slow-burn mystery that you almost feel stupid for not picking up on everything. And then we have the climax.I loved it and it tied in everything so joyfully, this is definitely one of my favorite horror movies in a while and probably for 2018 for sure. It demands repeat viewings and I sure as HELL can't wait to see it again.IF you took my warning up front seriously and managed to avoid the hype, the spoilers, the reviews including this one, and watched and enjoyed it, bravo. I hope you had such an incredible experience as I did and wish they made more horror movies like this and not the cookie-cutter-conjuring ghost stories of late.

As a person expecting the best, I was left wanting.""Hereditary"" is the much-loved and much-talked-about supernatural domestic horror film by writer-director Ari Aster that at times feels like a refined version of a 70s supernatural thriller, while at other times is a familial drama about grief. It got glowing reviews calling it a modern classic. I saw it long after the hype had died down and was left wondering what exactly it was that made this movie stand out so much.As we open to the funeral of the family matriarch Ellen Leigh, her daughter Annie (Toni Collette) delivers a eulogy riddled with hints as to the troubled nature of this family. Annie is a miniatures artist who seems to use her art to tell her own personal (disturbing) trauma. Annie's 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is especially devastated as she had a deep relationship with her grandmother, to the point of feeling like Annie wasn't capable of raising her at all. Their older child Peter (Alex Wolff) was kept away from Ellen due to Ellen and Annie's fraught relationship, and spends his days doing drugs. Oh, and Annie's husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is, um, around? Seriously Steve is barely a factor in this movie.The family is clearly messed up in many ways. Annie lies to her husband about going to the movies in order to go to a bereavement group where she reveals that most of her family suffered from severe mental disorders and fears she'll suffer from them too. Peter just wants to party and get high while avoiding everyone. Charlie cuts the head off a dead bird and sticks it in her pocket as she crafts figures using the dismembered animal part, and draws disturbing images as she's tormented by some sort of light on her walls. Steve, um, exists.That's about as far as I'll take the plot as the rest would instantly spoil most of what drives this movie forward. Needless to say, it goes into dark territory.First and foremost, ""Hereditary"" would be nothing without Toni Collette. Collette gives this movie everything she has, and it's impossible to think about ""Hereditary"" without her. She brings Annie to life, and her descent into madness is both organic and riveting. She starts off as a frustrated and tired mother, but ends off in this manic ""you've got to believe me even though I sound crazy"" tone that propels this story from beginning to end as she slowly unravels the events occurring around her. The rest of the cast are secondary to Annie, and all scenes without her are pretty much just filler in my books.Part of the absolute focus on Annie being the emotional linchpin of ""Hereditary"" is that all the other characters suffer from a lack of screen time. Peter's scenes where he's supposed to be terrified have no weight because we don't really get to know him at all beyond his dealings with the supernatural, and I just never managed to feel invested in his character at all. Charlie's an interesting mystery but that's about it - her disturbed state is permanent and unchanging. Steve is just there to fill the realists' role and honestly Gabriel Byrne looks like he wants to be anywhere else than in this movie. When other characters outside the family show up they are either completely flat or ""they are obviously evil why is no one in the family seeing this"" territory.Performances are just one part of the layers of fear here - ""Hereditary"" is a master class on visual oppression. There is rarely a shot in this movie that isn't trying to unsettle you in some way. The lighting, camera, and even the color choices are all meant to make you feel like something is off. Aster loves the long, slow shot that makes you get drawn into the frame only to wish you could be anywhere else. To go along with this the soundtrack also at times is overbearing in its attempts to get under your skin, especially in the first act. Ari Aster knows how to manipulate the audience without saying a word, and to some that will be enough.Now, I know I just said that this was an incredibly unsettling movie, but it also feels forced at times. There isn't a moment that is allowed to be, well, natural. Everything about ""Hereditary"" is harsh. I personally find it too much and takes away from the moments that are supposed to be shocking. Aster never sets the dial below an 8 for this entire movie, so when the climax ramps it up to 10 it just doesn't leave the impact I think that it should have. It's also about 15-minutes too long; the long buildup to the climax loses some oomph. It's in those final moments that the leaky plot starts to sink under the weight of its own mythos as the pieces get slapped together rather than falling into place. I just feel that if it had instead gone for a level more akin to Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" it might have been more successful in what it was trying to do, at least for me.The thing that left me most intrigued with ""Hereditary"" was not the actual horror aspects of it, but rather the fact that Aster made a family/parenthood drama that just so happened to coincide with supernatural events. The supernatural forces at times are like adding Swiss Cheese on an already delicious hamburger. Her relationship with her children is disastrous to say the least, and reflects on how horrid she feels her mother treated her - the fact that evil forces surrounds them is barely relevant to the drama. No matter who you are, some part of you can relate to the people in this family. Well, other than Steve, unless you relate to someone not wanting to be there. These different elements however create some odd tonal shifts when flipping between the supernatural and the familial, but by grounding the story in a frame most people can relate to Aster did at least cement his movie as being timeless.""Hereditary"" is not for everyone and can easily disappoint those looking for a film in the vein of what usually passes for horror these days. It's an old-school horror movie that's built on dread and tone rather than jump scares and gore. Ari Aster spends almost as much time in supernatural suspense as he does on family drama. It also got hyped so much that I honestly felt like the critics ruined the movie watching experience; hyperbolic statements saying ""Hereditary"" is this generation's ""The Exorcist"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"" didn't help much either (I'm looking in your direction too, ""The Babadook"").While I admit that there are a lot of good things about ""Hereditary"", I was just left wanting. It's a better version of a lot of movies that came before it - specifically a lot of 70s and 80s low-budget horror movies - but it's supernatural story is a bit too familiar at times. I know some claim it's the best horror movie of a generation; I was left wishing it had more to set it apart.""Hereditary"" easily is among the better made horror movies of the decade, but I just felt like it lacked the identity that it needed to make it stand among the greats. In terms of other recent horror flicks I'd rank it under the likes of ""The Witch"" or ""It Follows"" - movies that had their own uniqueness to them - though ""Hereditary"" is miles above ""The Babadook"" (seriously, I hate that movie). If it wasn't for Toni Collette ""Hereditary"" would be easily forgotten, but her dedication elevates the product to places its run-of-the-mill setup would languish in. If you want to see a good, somewhat familiar horror movie then ""Hereditary"" is an easy recommendation; those wanting something more will be left wanting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
well crafted and unsettling movie,"This movie is very well crafted and has extremely good acting from both Toni Colette and young Milly Shapiro. First half of the movie has incredible emotional depth and also some very disturbing imagery. But when the plot starts to unravel, it becomes conventional horror movie and it loses much of the tension that made first half so good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hell yeah!!,"Hereditary came out a few months back and follows a family of four who since the death of the family matriarch has gone down hill -- that being due to the demonic curse put on the family. The film stars Toni Colette who is absolutely astonishing in her role and possibly her best. The film is highly creepy and at times uses creepy imagery which always works especially in films like Black Swan and The Shining. In a quick review, go see Hereditary because its one of the best horrors out there and possibly the best of the year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An almost perfect horror movie that ends up kicking itself in the nuts,"Superbly dark performances, a creeping tension that builds to crescendo, gasp inducing thrills and spills - literally.All the ingredients of a masterful psychological horror. All undone by a dopey reveal.Great first half with one of the most shocking moments in cinema history. Second half has more energy but ultimately too schlocky. It's like they are too different films.A wasted opportunity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary utilises visceral imagery from generational horror classics to create a modern interpretation.,"This, was my most anticipated of the year. The colossal praise, intense trailer and positive buzz made me subconsciously more excited as its release day loomed. Does it live up to self-obtained titles such as ""this generation's 'The Exorcist'""? Unfortunately not. I've had time to ponder, and as much as I wanted to give it a perfect rating...I just couldn't. A family start to become haunted following the death of their matriarchal grandmother. I'm saying nothing else, go into this knowing nothing and you'll come out feeling confused, uneasy and breathless. This is emotional horror at its finest, substituting cheap jump scares for terrifying imagery where the dialogue and characters create the scares. Evoking themes of grief and loss, implementing them into a personal story where a motherly bond between her children is tested during a heightened state of mind. It's an audacious directorial debut from Aster, who manages to craft a bone-chilling drama subtly through slow camera movements and narrative tension. Toni Collette simply gives a career best performance. A scene involving an intense confrontation with her son showcases her commanding presence and emotional vulnerability. Wolff and Shapiro were also enigmatic. Cinematography was gorgeous, plenty of mentally scarring scenes and an abundance of skin crawling moments. For me, I was not keen on certain plot aspects and do believe there were a few misdirections, particularly towards its conclusion. Considering the intense first two acts, its finale came across as uninspired as it settles for a more supernaturally basic plot, leaving you wondering ""what the heck just happened?"". Keeping in mind the slow pace that these A24 horror films are known for, a 127 minute runtime was too long with certain sections experiencing dipped pacing, thus negating the built up tension. It is clear that this film is not for everyone, its arthouse aesthetic appeal will be too slow for many. However, it's a bleak horror film that is sure to leave its own legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horrific Movie that should be unmade,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life , don't waste your time on this trash .

"Good, but not great.","Is the writing sloppy? Yes. Are there a fair share of plot holes? Yes. Is it at all realistic or relatable ? No way. However, it was still fairly enjoyable and a very interesting watch at that. I really appreciated the sound design of this movie; it really sets the tone and I would argue that it's the ""scariest"" part of the movie. The acting has its moments, for better and for worst. At times it's very intense and uncomfortable, other times I was cracking jokes with my friends and couldn't stop laughing; I would say the cheap shock-value moments amplified that to an extent at times.Give it a watch, you definitely won't forget it. At the very least I can say that I won't forget it and that it made me feel things. Not great, but definitely unique.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unnerving, Horrifying, and Impactful","Hereditary is a masterful horror movie. It uses subtilty in a sinister way and hits hard when it needs to. Reminiscent of horror films of old such as The Shining, you won't see a lot of jump scares or spooks here. If you are looking for something to ""scare"" you, this may not be the right fit. Heredity does something else - perhaps something more. This movie hits emotionally and psychologically and truly horrifies and torments you. It is painfully uncomfortable at times in the most deliberate and artfully crafted ways. This movie lingers with you after you leave. It is horror in its truest form. True lovers of the genre should not miss this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerIt should be noted that this film is incredibly disturbing. I am not a person that is easily scared and I am usually not impressed with horror films. This film thoroughly impressed me with the amount of quality scared and the eerie atmosphere.The story starts off very fast and builds the tense very well. All the characters are believable and relatable in a way. The story creates a very mysterious tone but keeps a very scary feeling throughout. The plot gets extremely disturbing very quickly and keeps the disturbing imagery flowing smoothly and gracefully. The use of silence makes your stomach turn as you anticipate a scare, sometimes the scare come but other times it leaves you waiting.The acting is extraordinary. Toni Collette delivers a stunning and frightening performance. She is truly an amazing actress. Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro also give amazing performances. Gabriel Byrne performs very well and is my favorite character in this film.The pacing is perfect. The first half hour of the film was scare free but the remaining runtime left me tense and scared.This is one of the most effective horror films to date. The ending left he disturbed and I had chills running down my spine as the credits rolled. I left the theatre frightened and had that feeling of maybe I shouldn't have watched that.Spoiler BelowI thought the father's death was a little weak and that the plot twist that Joan was friends with the grandmother was telegraphed. Either way, the film stilled held onto its power of disturbing the mind.Spoiler OverPros: Disturbing and dark story, great use of silence, music, and the building of tension, perfect pacing, very disturbing imagery, amazing acting, Toni Collette's stunning performance, and an ending that will leave you scared and hopelessCons: Read the Spoiler section if you want to know the consOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. This is one of the best films of 2018. I would not recommend this film to people who are easily scared. This film only had about two jump scares but this film will leave your disturbed and wishing you hadn't watched it. If you want a less scary witch's tale, I would recommend The Witch: A New England Folk Tale",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"This starts well, but eventually disappoints","""If you ever want to sleep again, then stay away,"" said a review of this movie. Perfect for someone who likes horror movies like me, I thought.
The film starts well, with the cast crew perfect. The film's depiction of a serious dysfunctional family is good and scary enough. The action deals more about what is not said and done, than what we actually see. And here I think the movie works well the first hour. When the angle is then pulled into the occult, with scenes and sounds, it also works well in the beginning. But then I dropped off. The last part of the film turns out to be crazy for me, with effects that we are familiar with from horror movies, but I think the film takes a direction that I see was unable to cope with. I experienced that there were more people who went from the show and, even though I sat down, I did not get involved anymore. And I actually began to feel bored and disapointed.Unlike A Quiet Place who managed to keep the excitement and suspense all the way to the end, Hereditary becomes a movie that I think traces from a psychological and exciting start to an end where the crashing effects are in line and the solutions become too banal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Can't Understand The Hate,"This is a great film. Top ten of the decade for me easily. I think because it's also a horror film it's getting trashed by people who were expecting a great genre movie. This is just a great movie period, it doesn't fit the horror mold, which thank God, 95% of horror movies are utter garbage. The director/writer is a true auteur and this movie will definitely be held on a pedestal for a long time. I will be lining up to see his next movie for sure.If you are looking for jump scares and action, this might not be for you. If you enjoy an intense thrilling movie with lots to sink your teeth into and think about for a long time after, then check this movie out. This will be on a lot of recommendation lists for a long time by people that know what they are talking about. 
Don't let all the hate on here dissuade you from checking this out. I honestly barely heard anything about this and watched it yesterday and I'm shocked by all the low reviews, just doing my best to counteract them because again, I love this movie. 3000 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ultra Creepy with a Powerhouse Performance by Toni Collette,"Very very good acting by toni collette in this! So strong that her grief made me Feel it and sent shivers down my spine...Not often can an actor do this ,at least to me in anything ive watched since i can remember..This movie is ULTRA creepy, with very impressively done Visual cinematography, lighting and Sound that adds immensely to making your skin crawl...This type of movie is genuinely scarey, as opposed to the usual slasher ,blood and gore horror..this gets Under your skin and Into your psyche....so be warned! You may ask if i have such praise for this movie why did i rate it a 7? well, i wont say what it is but the ending fell flat for me and the whole movie itself is dark,depressing,tragic, its something thats so heavy that it may make some people wish they Didnt watch it.....there is a rosemarys baby vibe here at least for me...That movie Definitely qualifies as Ultra creepy as well...anyway, i recommend this one for people who like to get creeped the heck out!

The perfect horror film. If you like horror at all. Just watch it,This is the best horror film I would say in past few years but I really enjoyed the ritual on Netflix and if you count a quiet place I loved that too.But this movie is really perfectly paced. Some may complain it's slow in the first half but if the first half didn't set the eerie tone and give the characters depth you would not feel the emotion for them as strongly. The mothers performance is Oscar worthy. I mean she's incredibly talented in this movie. Charlie is the perfect creepy kid. I hope this movie blows up and gets shared for everyone to see as me finding it was a freak accident. I had never even heard of it or seen previews. Don't even watch previews.

Could've been great,"Okay I like Ari Asters work so far, all his movies have a unique feel to them, especially in terms of cinematography, his use of imagery, and he knows how to pace his films well and build tension. I had heard great thing about Hereditary before viewing it. Some hailing it as ""The Greatest Horror Film of the Modern Era"". So I was really excited going in. And I really enjoyed it. For the most part.The film had such a great story and great characters that just reeled you in. And yes, I too will jump on the Toni Collette bandwagon, because she did a phenomenal job, as did everyone really.So I was going through the motions of watching this film I was getting so caught up in the tension that was being built, I was getting excited from what could possibly be around the corner in every scene. Right up until... the jump (I'll leave it at that for those that haven't seen it). Then it all came crashing down. I felt let down. I felt the film was just breaching into the climax when it just suddenly stops. And that ending... sigh.All in all, obviously people look at it from different perspectives but for me I felt it had so much potential, but didn't quite execute",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Be warned this is not an easy film to watch,"Like most viewers I thought I had an idea about what this film was about, but, I was side swiped, this film is more akin to the brilliant ""Race with the Devil"" with touches of the rosemary's baby and The Devil's Rain thrown in for good measure
But comparing it to these classic horror films is only an attempt to give you an idea of the kind of horror that permeates throughout this movie.
Too often these days we are left disappointed with so called horror films, but please be in no doubt Hereditary is the real deal, it is macabre, suspenseful and very very disturbing.
In truth I cannot say I enjoyed the film, but that is subjective and no reflection on the movie, it does what it set out to do, to scare and disturb the audience and it does this in good measure
If I have any criticisms then I would say it is a little too long and some of the incidents are not properly explained but then that just adds to the mystery and suspense.
The ending seemed a little off kilter, and left me a few questions which I am still mulling over
On that note- I watched this film over a week ago and I am still thinking about it, so be warned this movie will disturb even the hardiest horror fans, little girls blouse - sinister or Annabel this is not!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Very good movie, but a biiiit on the overrated side...","...But the only reason I say it's overrated is because people refer to it as though it's the greatest horror film ever made. It really is a great movie, infinitely better than the mainstream, jump-scare-a-thon, no story having horror schlock they put out every year, BUT I just don't think it's the perfect, penultimate movie that some make it out to be.Having said that, it definitely is a cool, slow burn film. It makes excellent use of the tension as soon as IT happens (anyone who's seen it will know to what I'm referring) and really doesn't let up til the climax... which is an intensely crazy and creative climax, at that (ala The Shining).The first time I saw it, I was in a halfway house with about 15 or so of the other guys all watching. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have NEVER heard so much complaining in my entire life. Maybe it's the fact that people born as far back as the 80s just get bored when movies have actual stories that make you think...Like try to get someone in their 20s or 30s to sit down and watch a Hitchcock film or a 40s film noir, and they'll be playing on their phone, bored to tears within 15 mins. It's sad because I grew up with an appreciation for the classics, and therefore, movies with substance, depth, and a STORY. Everyone wants stupid slapstick comedy where Will Farrell once again plays a complete oblivious, buffoon with a heart of gold, or a horror movie where the ghost/demon/killer appears BEHIND the protagonist where they can't see it for about 75 minutes before the anticlimactic climax where it tries to finally kill them the last 10 mins (I never understood that... what exactly is the ghost accomplishing by staring or walking past ALWAYS from behind? These directors need to put some thought into it).But I digress... very good movie. Not perfect, but very good. Very good acting as well. When Toni Collette is wigging out at the end and spouting all this insane, obnoxious sounding stuff at Gabriel Byrne as he stands there with that ""my wife has finally gone off the deep end"" expression on his face, I totally started hating her. After all, so much of it was her fault and her extremely unattractive face which she contorts like playdough the whole time makes it so much easier to hate her. Great score, cinematography, and lighting as well... really adds so much to the atmosphere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Deserves the acclaim.,"Closer to the legendary horror films of the 60s and 70s than the modern jump-scare type flicks that are popular these days. Toni Collette is outstanding, as are all the actors, but the film's scope gives them the room to perform to their best.Interestingly, this is a film with very mixed reviews here. I guess that just goes to show why Hollywood is too afraid to experiment with anything new. I do think you need to have some life experience, and a little maturity to appreciate why some of the events are truly horrific.For example, if you think that something a character does is unrealistic, and there's a particular scene that a lot of people seen to feel this way about, then perhaps as you experience more of life you'll understand why they acted that way. That particular scene I am alluding to, I think I might have done exactly the same thing.Also, it is set up like a nightmare, so some things don't quite make sense. You don't really know what is real, what is part of mental illness, what is a dream. If you need your films to lay everything out in the broad daylight and not expect you to think, then you should probably avoid this.But, please don't avoid it. Go into it with an open mind, which is the advice given in the film. Don't see it as an accurate, truthful representation of real people, but a horror film at the nexus of reality, myth, and madness. I'm not bagging the shock horror jump scare type horror films, they have a place, but this is a different sort of horror film, and if you aren't used to that type of film it might take a little more effort on your part to really appreciate, but I thoroughly encourage you to make that effort.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hypnotic.,"Horror and comedy have one undeniable connection. They are the most subjective genrs. When you go into a horror film there is always going to be the chance that the scares won't get to you. But for a movie like this, it's worth the chance if not just to see some very creative cinematography and meaningful shot composition. A lot of thought has been woven into each frame in order to help you piece the puzzle together...or misdirect you.The plot is simple, and the characters are real enough but not very complex, but they don't have to be. Many horror writers have proven that a good way to throw the audience off is to abandon the three act structure and drive the story with an intriguing idea or theme, that the plot and characters simply frame. Hereditary is a great example of this. Pacing issues have been the most prevalent criticism, but I don't think it's too serious. It wouldn't hurt to cut a few minutes, especially in the middle, however I didn't think it was dragging. It's a movie worth being patient for.You really should see this spoiler free, which means there's only so much detail I can give, so I'll sum it up here.

Not that you have to know that to enjoy=be scared by it.Now you should be warned going in that crazy and illogical behavior and a sullen grieving family are hard to ""warm"" up to, but thanks to good performances, I and I think, you'll stay with it and much will be explained if you are patient enough to go along for the scary crazy ride that follows.Yes maybe it goes on a little too long but it does build well and though at times it could go off the rails and become silly it stays just this side to remain horror.An audience helps it, as I saw it with a pretty full house of people who were definitely into the movie reacting nervously and in dread in the right spots.This doesn't transcend the genre, I would stop short of saying the film has much to say outside the usual, but unusually effective, supernatural playing field the film remains within.There are however some mother, child, tensions that resonate--if also test reality. The son character in particular could get silly but works thanks to acting and atmosphere.Certainly a significant horror film because it know how to play by the rules and make them work--lessons many pretender horror films fail to do.Effective music and ironic use of a semi famous ballad for the end credits help a lot. Two lead females characters hold it all together along with the photography and direction. Does get gorey at times--nothing wrong with that CGI elements are well done when they need to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
No need to explian,"This film has every component. Strong acting, great lighting, sound design and set are top notch. That being said, I would have preferred the explanation be left to the viewer. So many times, directors feel the need to give the audience some kind of reason. This movie didn't need it. The fear that existed in these people's lives was so rich and deep, so wrought with sadness and tragedy, psychosis and complexity, I didn't care why. I only cared about the possibility. Showing me that ruined it. Made it less. That being said, if you like a really solid movie with a visual authenticity (save the flies) and a few jump scares definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Satisfies the craving,"I went in to this with low expectations, the other A24 films I saw with high hopes disappointed the crap outta me (the Witch, Ex Machina..), and while Hereditary is predictable, it delivers. The horror is subtle, the turmoil within the characters provides this uneasy, uncomfortable feeling which is what you want, it's great. This only executes because the acting is excellent. Every scene with Alex Wolfe (the son) was made awesome just from his fantastic acting and the way he portrays the feeling. At the end, where it usually flops and depreciates the cool scary scenes the film might've had, Hereditary gives you a badass, intense conclusion which leaves you happy with the flim. Very glad I went and saw it, I hold it as a horror movie that got the job done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
clever storytelling for a horror film,"Greetings again from the darkness. I will forever carry this flame of hope for quality horror films since they were such a part of my childhood movie watching. It's such an odd genre because the really good ones are quite rare, but the category in general is quite profitable. We enjoy being frightened and stressed ... in the safety of a dark movie theatre with a few dozen fellow movie goers. This debut feature film from writer/director Ari Aster is filled with foreboding and dread - key elements to a successful horror film.The clever filmmaker spends the first portion of the movie tricking/manipulating us into thinking this is going to be a ""normal"" ghost story - one we've seen before, albeit with a stronger than usual cast. Time and again I found myself thinking ""this poor family"". Toni Collette plays Annie, mother of son Peter (Alex Wolff, brother to Nat and son of Polly Draper) and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and wife of Steve (Gabriel Byrne). Some scenes are loaded with realistic family banter - the kind that's a bit passive-aggressive and judgmental in tone. This adds to the unsettling mood of dread that cloaks most of the characters and most every scene.Annie is an artist who creates miniature settings, and once she unloads her family history on an unsuspecting group therapy session, we are provided a big clue, as well as confirmation that the bad times aren't over. When tragedy strikes again, the family seems beyond repair, as do the individuals. Peter is a seemingly normal teenage boy who likes to smoke weed, and dutifully lets his little (and slightly disturbed) sister Charlie tag along to a party since his mother asked. Ms. Shapiro is a revolution in the role - somehow simultaneously both creepy and sympathetic. Father and husband Steve is very patient, a trait that rarely pays off in horror films.The family house makes for a terrific setting, especially considering the impressive treehouse that seems to always require a space heater. Ms. Collette fully commits to the role with all its grief and terror. It's really her performance combined with a creative story that harkens back to THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY, that allow the film to click. By the end, this family only wishes they were in a ""normal"" ghost story. And as a reminder, if you are born into a family where one member has a sleep-walking incident similar to what's described here, you have every right to lock your door before going to sleep - that is, assuming you could ever sleep again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I like it but it could have been more.,"In the first half of the movie it seems more like a deep family drama with some creepy aspects. It played on emotion and drama so well and actually made the characters worth investing in so that when the terrible things happen it's that more impactful and shocking (which is something that usually gets left behind in horror, which is so refreshing). As the movie draws closer to the end though, that mood seems to get completely thrown out the window in favor of the typical horror cliches. The end feels hastily thrown together leaving one confused and unsatisfied when the movie ends. The story had these great characters but just didn't seem to know what to do with them or where it was even going. It was incredibly frustrating for how emotionally involved I was for these characters to not have any closure but even without closure it has made a lasting impression on me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good summer scare especially if you see your family in the proceedings.,"SPOILER: Newbie director Ari Aster has your attention: his Hereditary (which he also wrote), is a mash up of horror tropes that go from the creepy teen-age daughter to the creepy grandma, with immolations and beheadings to keep things interesting. Such a stew is a necessary plan of action because the focus of the plot is not apparent until the last 30 minutes or so, and those last minutes are burdened with too much exposition that should have been in the rest of the film.That ending takes the occult events since grandma's death and the accompanying horrors and gives them context. It is the most satisfactory part of the film, barely justified by the disparate set pieces before it, which could have fit in any other horror film and made as much sense. However, Hereditary still is chock full of skin crawling family shenanigans that should keep the genre fans engaged.The real horror here is the feeling that biological inheritance is a lock, and if the family is as weird as the Grahams, few of them if any will escape the consequences of the family's sins, from grandma on down. No one is more distraught than mother Annie (Toni Collette), who sees her 13 year old daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), get caught in the family atrocity mode, as well as her son, Peter (Alex Wolff), stronger than almost everyone else but growingly more vulnerable to the ghostly rumblings, even when he is in class. 
Mother Annie (Toni Collette) seems to carry all the guilt laid down by grandma. While Collette goes over the top, Essie Davis as the distraught mom Amelia in the Babadook is a model of restraint by comparison. Both moms are part of a growing body of horror films that reveal the anguish of being a mom with problematic children.Hereditary, as in the case of other A 24 productions like It Comes at Night and The Witch, is less about horror gore and more about the psychological terror of family caught in its biological fun house. Just seeing an incident or two of wacked-out action is enough to set the audience into fear mode of what more family bashing is in store.The Graham family lives in an impressively spacious modern home in the Pacific Northwest (filmed in Utah), with one of the large rooms the workshop of artist mom, who creates miniature dioramas, some scarily depicting their own home and horrible occurrences in family history. Aster and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski craft a not-so-much jump scare atmosphere as a slow-burning fear based mostly on the interior madness of the family.Hereditary is a good, if not great, summer scare to remind us that when it comes to family, we can offer just as much insanity as the best movie family.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow Burner but Enjoyable if Prepared,"I liked Hereditary for what it was. It's a bit 'arty' - the cinematography is great, exceptional in places. Acting is very good. The story is a bit of a slow burner, so if you listened to the hype of it being one of the most scary horrors made, you might be disappointed.Having said that, it is a different type of horror to the norm. It attempts to suck you in slowly with sweeping cameras and a slow but unrelenting tensity, aided by a subtle but menacing soundtrack. I liked that, it was different but for some, they might find it boring.It doesn't rely on your traditional jumps and sudden rise in audio that many other horrors do. If you want that, you'll probably not like this film too much.With that in mind, give it a go. Let it take you in and on its journey. It'll not be a particularly fast one, but it'll be different.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Unoriginal idea, yet unique delivery","This movie presents nothing new in terms of plot. Supernatural entity taking over a family. Nothing new here. However, the way this movie was executed was unlike anything I've ever seen before. I felt uneasy from the start. Even though the ""horror"" did not pick up until a ways into the movie, I felt the tension from the start. This movie provided a feeling of uncomfort throughout the whole thing, even during the non scary parts. I think the family tension plays a huge role in that. Not just terror with the supernatural, but tension within the family. 
This movie made me do something I never do: my jaw dropped and stayed dropped for like 2 minutes straight at one point.
There is also a part of this movie that I think filled me with the most suspense and anxiety I have ever felt watching a movie. 
It's quite refreshing to see a movie rely on actual terror and creepiness to provide the ""horror"" instead of meaningless jump-scares, and that's what sets this movie apart from the rest of the movies like it.I would give it more than 8 stars, but there were points in which I was either wishing it moved at a slightly faster pace or holding back laughter at a couple of the ""scary parts.""

A new horror classic?,"This movie stuck with me. It did not become one of my favorite horror films, but it absolutely left an impression. Both this movie and Midsommar somehow managed to make me feel as terrible as if something bad happened to a loved one. The emotions these movies stirred in me were so strong that I couldn't watch them back for long periods of time. Granted, I might be more empathetic than the average viewer, but so few movies can generate any actual emotion that I have to acknowledge Hereditary for being able to evoke something so visceral. I was less interested in the actual narrative, which I thought would have been better if it was a little more linear. Nevertheless, this was way better than average for its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary is fully part of the intelligent horror cinema genre,"""If you think horror movies are nothing more than gore, gratuitous violence, slashers slashing, and supernatural creatures wreaking havoc, think again; intelligent horror movies demonstrate that smart horror exists - and is really good to boot."" (Ranker.com) 
Hereditary shall not soon be forget by his viewers. It has everything an horror movie needs to conquer horror amateurs: gore; intense (and for most people unbearable) scenes of violence, disturbing corruption of man's artistic taste; scenes in which spectators are confronted to the view of dead animals, putrefied bodies and, moreover, naked rotten bodies. 
In addition to this masterly served-on-a-silver-tray violence, viewers get the chance to catch shivers when it comes to the part of spiritism experiences and the thrilling cult which practices those satanic rituals. With this many details wisely put through the entire film, it really felt like the movie was about a cult that had existed in real life. A24 added to Hereditary an artistic twist by making the mother (Toni Collette) a miniature artist, which fits really well the movie. In fact, those miniature rooms that the mother patiently builds and paints are meant to represent events of the movie or metaphorical, allegorical events that complete the sinister family history. 
During the first half of the movie, a teenage girl (Milly Shapiro) is always seen eating sugary treats, such as candies or chocolate bars. It may seem to be so because she is nervous about the lost of her grandmother, but with a further analysis, and by the end of the movie, it would be adequate to say that her thirst for sugar has a darker meaning... It looks like she was the incarnation of King Paimon, one of the Lords of Lucifer. It was mentioned in the movie that she never cried, even at her birth, and that her grandmother, who was an influent member of a spiritism cult, cared very much for her and was always looking upon her. It is a demonology fact that demons love sugar, so it would explain why she always eat sweets. An other explanation for her love of treats would be that she is, indeed, feeling nervous and anxious because of her grandma's death. This and her allergy to nuts would also give a promisingly purpose for her anaphylactic shock caused by her ingestion of a chocolate cake that contained macadamia nuts. 
The second half of the movie has more of a ""pestilential"" taste. It is the part of the movie when the spectators can get a close view of dead bodies, but also of bleeding and burned ones. 
All in all, the present movie features an altogether thrilling and sinister story that filthily evolves through his sinister scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the best horror films in years,"""Get Out"" made horror films respectable again, or at least Oscar-friendly again, in a way they hadn't been since ""The Exorcist"". I've seen Ari Aster's terrific feature debut ""Hereditary"" compared to ""The Exorcist"" or at least mentioned in the same sentence. Possession, of a kind, and a grieving mother are the only tenuous links I could make out but like ""The Exorcist"" I can see ""Hereditary"" picking up a slew of Oscar nominations next year; Toni Collette is virtually a shoo-in for her magnificent performance as the beleagured mother and it's actually the better film.Indeed for the first hour or so I wouldn't have called ""Hereditary"" a 'horror' film at all but a serious and deeply disquieting study of a woman cut off from her family by grief. When it does change midway through the jolt is sudden and hardly subtle but the effect is considerable. If, in the end, this is 'just' another horror film it's still pretty damn scary with the emphasis on jump-in-your-seat scares and a real sense of dread rather than guts and gore. I'm sure there must have been horror films as effective as this or more so since that Exorcist guy did what he had to do to get the devil out of Regan but this is still a superior frightener, very well written and directed by novice Aster and beautifully played by everyone with Collette and Ann Dowd outstanding.Fans of the genre will find much to savour here though personally I think I would have been happier if the film had stuck to its original path and jettisoned any hint of the supernatural. I enjoyed it hugely; I just didn't take it very seriously nor will I ever listen to Joni Mitchell's song 'Both Sides Now' quite in the same light again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Heads Will Roll,"Aster literally turns the horror genre ""on its head"" with Hereditary. The intricately woven plot, the stunning visual and visceral body elements, and sublime performances (Collete especially heartbreaking and real) all add up to the best horror/dysfunctional-family drama/mystery of the year. On top of all that, Aster crafts what is possibly the most disturbing image caught on film in the last decade or so (and not because of gore or anything like that) - without spoiling, the way he creates this rising tension with the car scene, when it finally culminates, we don't even see the gruesome image - it's all told through Wolfe's eyes and the eerily tranquil silence of the aftermath. Simply brilliant filmmaking. Then, it really amps up the horror quality in the last act, as truly frightening, nightmare inducing images begin to populate the screen. Plus the actual ending is so cool, it will leave you with your jaw hanging open for a long while. Such a gorgeous movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Entertaining, visually satisfying and perfectly acted. But...","Aster deserves an eleven out of ten: I'm so proud to see such a debut from a director of my generation. Thirty-somethings are coming, Hollywood. This new wave will bring back some euro-style deepness without fear of the audience, and the audience will reward them with warmth.In Hereditary, there's a house above a house full of houses. There are puppets, masters of puppets and puppets that are masters of the masters of puppets. There are bonds, links, ugliness, motherhood, madness, gendericity, love, adolescence, pain, Satan. And Jesus? No, God never comes into play even if in the end Jesus is somehow mocked and, as a consequence, invoked. Actually, God and God's ministers and symbols are removed/replaced from the beginning of the movie: there is no hope, there is no way out of the hell for the characters.Unfortunately, the viewer is constantly kept safe in his chair, far from the painful mess he witnesses. Why? Because of the gondry-esque, faerie production design and because of a little naïveté in the plot: for example, a couple of Wolff/Peter and Byrne/Steve reactions really break the suspension of disbelief, and you know who Dowd/Joan really is the exact second she appears. Furthermore, Dowd always phagocytize her characters in the name of an impeccable but tangible acting. Shapiro/Charlie is a pleasant surprise, and Collette/Annie is just perfect: a more jonze-esque than gondry-esque production design, a little more writing malice and a Kathy Bates in the role of Joan would have condemned the viewer to vulnerability, turning this fantastic effort into a masterpiece.Heredity is entertaining, visually satisfying and perfectly acted. But... But I was not disturbed, I was not threatened, I was not surprised. Hereditary is a perfect exercise: I'm sure Aster will soon give us a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective But Derivative,"Younger people may find the film slow, as pace is secondary to mood, here. And mood can best be described as bleakAF. Every frame is filled with dread. So much so that the film lacks a sense of the flowing nature of normal life. The characters aren't people you'd want to have over to dinner, and although the acting is top notch, it's a family of folks at the bottom rungs of their family (attic) ladder. And it's super yucky to drop into their world for 2 hours.Although creating a relentlessly grim & grimy tone which infuses the film with a near sleep-walking texture of story telling, Aster does a nice job of inserting a few shocker moments and tense dramatic confrontations along the way, keeping the narrative interesting, and the music is effective, so his film is never less than compelling to watch.But in the end, that's not really enough, and it's a reach for me to give this movie a 6 (I seriously considered 5), mostly because there's very little here that's original. The ending borrows heavily from films like Rosemary's Baby, Wicker Man and (more recently) Kill List, and middle parts conjure up Insidious meets The Conjuring. Even the mother's miniature house models are an idea snatched from Beetlejuice.It's a nice little mash up of horror tales of yesteryear by Ari Aster, but horror and mystery are uniquely effective only when they are original, and originality is hard to come by. You won't find it here.PS Someone needs to tell these new-fab creators of modern horror that its perfectly ok for horror film characters, and their viewing audiences, to laugh once in a while, you know, in between all the incantations and severed heads.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Slow burn that was worth it in the end.,"Well executed, atmospheric slow burn horror film with superb acting. I think it will go down as a classic with some memorable scenes I'm still thinking about.

2. The marketing for the film was misleading to cater to the jump-scare teen crowd.
3.

Toni Collette should've won an Oscar.,"This is only the second time I've watched this movie and I watched this back in 2018. Now that I've rewatched this movie, I can say that this is easily among one of the best A24 movies of all time.Positives for Hereditary (2018):
First off, Ari Aster's directing in this movie is absolutely masterful and the fact that this was his feature film directorial debut is amazing. There are so many amazing sequences throughout the runtime where he does these things with the camera and I am just amazed by how he was able to achieve these moments. Toni Collette as Annie Graham is easily one of the greatest acting performances I've seen in any movie in my life and the fact that she wasn't even nominated for an Oscar is absolutely criminal. For me, her best acted scene in this movie is at the dinner table when she is yelling at Alex Wolff for what happened to Milly Shapiro. But she isn't the only person with a spectacular performance in this movie because I can also say the same for Gabriel Byrne as Steve, Alex Wolff as Peter and Milly Shapiro as Charlie. I will also point out that this is one of the best slow burn movies I've seen and there wasn't a point where I was getting bored with the movie.

Horror and Despair,"This film is simply wonderful. This is the kind of horror I missed. This film doesn't rely on jump-scare, which is great.

"I can sit through the worst on TV, but this one scarred","Hereditary is what it intends to do as a horror movie, scare. But the ""scariness"" comes from the disturbing nature of the movie.

The plot was sturdy and made sense, unlike a lot of modern horror movies these days, but hereditary impressed its audience and did what many others cannot: Scare.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So close to being a classic,"There is so much to love about ""Hereditary."" The acting, particularly Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, is raw and real. The glacial pacing adds to the skin-crawling creepiness. The soundtrack drags you into the depths of dread. And the subtle visual effects are probably the highlight, teasing and toying with the viewer's sense of reality, offering real frights, not just momentary shocks.That said, without giving anything away, where ""Hereditary"" misses the mark for me is by explaining too much. The best psychological horror films, in my opinion, succeed by carefully treading that line between what's real and what's a figment of the imagination-and to be fair, ""Hereditary"" does succeed in treading this line for a good part of the film-however, when it comes to wrapping it up, the ambiguity is either left open, as in ""The Haunting,"" ""Cache,"" or ""The Babadook,"" or answered with a plausible truth, as in ""Les Diaboliques,"" ""The Innocents,"" ""Psycho,"" or ""The Wicker Man."" Personally, I felt the ending was neither here nor there. There's a Netflix show called ""Requiem"" that plays with similar themes, with a more satisfying conclusion.Still, I think this film is entertaining and will satisfy most horror film fans. I'd be extremely suspect of the 1-star reviews, as this is a solidly crafted film with excellent production values, superb acting and insightful writing.

Solid horror,"It is a nasty little film, quite hellish in fact. It looks at a family slowly falling apart, torn apart by evil, i was drawn in to that dark place the characters here inhabit.It has its shocking moments and those are very well executed. The reason the family are falling apart i will leave for you to find out in watching the movie yourself. But those involve Rosemary's Baby type elements shall we say.I was just reading through the reviews and yes there are quite a few turned off or hating this movie.But for me whilst some of it seemed rather strained in the what the hell is going on here then department( especially the ending) i did think the movie deserves credit for an eerie atmosphere that i used to vibe on with the movies of yesteryear.In other words less reliance on gore and jump scares, i liked that.Toni Collete is excellent , her angst is totally believable and powerfully conveyed through out the movie. The actors playing the daughter and son are excellent too.Gabrielle Byrne is fine but his character is a rather dead eyed, one dimensional character for the most part i felt. All though to be fair his character has a lot to contend with and is trying to keep things together.A solid horror that works up ( with the aid of a super eerie soundtrack) some excellent atmospherics, the imagery of which have stayed with me( always a good sign)

"Slow burn beginning, firey end.","I had to come and add another review to the thousand or so already here. I guess Heriditary is not for everyone. I watched it and midway through I caught myself pondering why, when I already have so many nightmares, I'd watch a film that was giving me genuine chills.Its not perfect by any means, at two hours I think it could definitely have used a little trimming, while wonderfully put together there are some long slow shots in the first hour that just draw the pacing out unnecessarily. That said, I also considered that perhaps it was to provide a counter point to the drama that really begins to make the movie unfold at about the 35 minute mark. The spark to the touch paper of this film left me with a physical sense of chill.Then I begun to get bored again, and I was considering turning it off. Then thought to myself, its a shame that we've got so used to having quick pay offs that we can't admire the detail. A bit like drawing a dot on a tiny model laptop to signify the camera? There is some lovely direction here, even if it does sometimes feel prolonged. From the hour mark onward, I was treated to a rare (in modern horror) and palpable sense of growing dread.It was nice to see new actors and some less familiar, but still known ones, playing unusual roles and doing so well. Perhaps in this sense giving the characters more of a feeling of genuineness, as you were seeing a character not just ""such and such"" playing.One thing that I would preferred would have been a little more depth behind the inheritance. Some removal of character exposition earlier in the film could easily have made way for a little more explanation to exactly what happened at the end.

A horror movie that respects the viewer,"I've all but stopped watching horror movies because most of them rely on screamers and jump scares.

It's not pleasant, and for some reason even properly atmospheric horror movies with brooding tension and interesting plot just can't avoid using this approach.Not Hereditary though. And I almost regret sharing this information, as I've spent a good portion of the movie expecting to get startled. It's scary in the best possible way: through creating terrifying situations and slowly peeling the layers of what's going on to reveal the horror that the characters are experiencing.And the characters - especially the lead in Toni Collette - do a fantastic job in displaying their fear and desperation. It takes confidence in one's ability to create horror through plot and direction alone to avoid throwing things in the viewers' faces to make them jump in their seats.Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Toni Collette gives a stunning performance as Annie, an artist who struggles with grief, guilt and mental illness. Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro play her children, Peter and Charlie, who have their own share of secrets and traumas. Gabriel Byrne plays Steve, Annie's husband, who tries to keep the family together amid the chaos.The film is full of shocking twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Aster creates a tense and atmospheric mood with his use of sound, cinematography and symbolism. The film explores themes such as family dynamics, grief, mental health and cults. It also features some of the most disturbing scenes in recent horror history.Hereditary is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. It is a dark and twisted tale that will haunt you long after it ends. If you are looking for a horror film that will challenge you intellectually and emotionally, then Hereditary is for you.

It has some jumpy moments but not too many, the film is like a horrifying downward spiral which is quite uncomfortable to watch but it keeps you there, keeping you engrossed like a good well made scary movie should.
The criticism is that it doesn't know if it's a horror or a supernatural drama. So the later stages of the film seem that it is written by someone different to the first part and leaves you wanting.

It was all going so well...,"The tone is set here within the opening camera track, a slow pan across an attic room with elaborate plans pinned to the wall and an epic diorama style model house. As the camera closes in and locks into one rooms of the house, there's a knock at the door an Gabriel Byrne walks in. This is gonna be good. Add Toni Collette and a clearly offbeat family attending a funeral and things are set to get pretty strange. I'm gonna cut to the chase, I loved this... sort of. Creepy characters, completely relatable moving through scenes of their lives that make your blood run cold and hold your hands to your head in moments of unfathomable discomfort. The supernatural occurrences would in other less considered films annoy me, but here their little subtle interventions work beautifully (to begin with), heightening the tensions and the pain of tragic loss. Byrne is the anchor, the normal in the descending chaos. His togetherness though allows Collette free reign to let loose, she's ferociously brilliant. Yes there are a few tropes and you could say it follows some familiar thriller territory, but for much of the film it's fun. Sadly the final act, perhaps predictably just crosses the line and it goes from interesting supernatural thriller to surreal twoddle. Bloody shame really as it was doing so well. Still, there's some entertaining stuff here and if you can see your way to forgiving the last half hour, it really is quite a good watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best horror film of the decade,"A phenomenally good horror film. After the death of her mother, Annie (Toni Collette) and her family go through grief, trauma and increasingly unsettling and unexplainable goings-on. Hereditary is a slow burn that gets deep into its characters and spends time lingering on the uncomfortable moments of pain in the families spiralling drama. The acting is absolutely superb and the actors have a huge amount to do. Director Ari Aster really stands out for the unusual but hugely effective choices he makes with what to show and what not to show during the most dramatic and intense moments of the film; you never get what you expect but it works exceptionally well. Aster also meticulously constructs the world and mythology that supports the story and it feels like a film that has been many many years in the making.

"""Hereditary"" is a unique film. An ingenious, metaphorical work, with a chilling ending and an unusual proposal","Do you know that movie that bothers you? Hereditary is that movie. Not because it's bad or anything like that, but because it bets on a different kind of discomfort. It's not a movie full of jump scares, predictability and empty characters. It's the kind of thing where you watch and feel the bad atmosphere, even when there's absolutely nothing happening in the scene. We are all the time accompanying a family, however, you feel that there is a bad atmosphere among these people. And this is one of the highlights of the film, since, in addition to the supernatural, this story explores the troubled relationship of these people. It is not a happy family, but a family with barriers, density and guilt.Heredity's screenplay, written by director Ari Aster, vertiginously plays with the inexplicable, something that many horror works competently do. If there are ghosts or demons-or even aliens-there is also the genesis of fear. It is not known what such creatures are capable of, since they are not human and yet possess intelligence (according to what is told in literature and cinema). There is, therefore, a bit of genius in the use of what is not explained in works that are outside the genre. In addition to being a genuine horror, Hereditary is not content to bring in objects of fear as elements. Aster, a feature newcomer, includes fear in the way he conducts the film. If, at the beginning, the public is already introduced to the death of their reclusive grandmother, it is at the same beginning that they are introduced to that family's house through an unusual zoom in: One sees the miniatures made by Annie (Toni Collette with a performance worthy of many awards) and, without much delay, the approach transforms a room of one of the miniatures into Peter's (Alex Wolff) room, soon invaded by his father (Gabriel Byrne).Without any explanation within reality for how this introduction works, the film takes on dark airs. Another source of human fear, the illogical, enhances the perception of facts and ends up splashing the viewer with a loss of sanity that, fatally, rhymes with another type of death: the death of what you are while you are still bodily present. Obviously, the public does not enter into any state of collective madness, but it is enough to sediment distrust - even if unconscious - about everything that continues from there. Ari Aster uses all possible and imaginable tools to create a dense, dramatic and terrifying atmosphere, in the story of an unsuspecting family that loses its matriarch and becomes ""haunted"" by visions, sensations and experiences that are absolutely out of the ordinary. Hereditary begins a twisted journey through consciousness and also through unconsciousness, building a sensory chain that has the power to affect whoever lets itself be immersed. In this way, there are reasons for repulsion, to be sick, to laugh, to cry and to fear. At the same time, for those who are adept at the dozens of jump scares (those scares caused by the suddenly strong sound of the soundtrack) of the more generic horror and don't get carried away by the proposed atmosphere, the little more than two hours can be difficult and tiring . And it is precisely there that one more merit of Hereditary resides: this difficulty in watching it is not for nothing. Aster demonstrates complete control over her story and her power to cause discomfort.Toni Collette (""All I Want"") is Annie, a mother of a family who has lost her own mother, with whom she never really got along, and who works her frustrations and anxieties through the construction of small models. With an already quite dramatic past, she tries to come to terms with the loss of raising her two teenage children. The boy Peter (Alex Wolff, from ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle""), is a typical teenager, who doesn't get along very well with his mother and is in love with the cute girl at school. Miss Charlie, the excellent and surprising actress Milly Shapiro, was basically raised by her late grandmother and feels this loss more intensely. It is through her character that the first evidences that things will not go back to normal after the loss begin to ""swarm"" in the old family house.In its first part, the film's narrative focuses mainly on how the death of Annie's mother reflects on everyone who lived around her. Annie and Charlie being the most affected. Through the dialogues - or the lack of them - we realize that no one talks about the death, there is almost no crying, and when someone feels the need to seek help to face the loss of a loved one, he prefers to lie to the family, saying that goes to the movies, instead of saying that, in reality, he is going to a support group for people who have lost someone. In short, all this part of the narrative makes the viewer believe that the plot is only about family crisis.In its second part, the story gains a new focus with a more than tragic event. At this point, the script starts to receive more drastic and deeper layers than it already had. A turning point occurs that leaves everyone - and I'm not afraid to say this - baffled. With this, the feature film enters a dramatic rise until its apex occurs. Finally, at its close, the film delivers some answers clarifying its theme. Therefore, with regard to the narrative structure, the film chooses not to easily give all the answers, however, it manages to maintain the thread throughout its exhibition without leaving holes, but opening space only for different interpretations.Ari Aster conducts the film superbly. It is possible to see in his direction references to Roman Polanski's cinematography - Rosemary's Baby being the clearest - the director is not afraid to take a new look at a topic that has already been addressed in an absurd amount of films. Hereditary, in addition to having a concise script, pleases for its aesthetic concern. The film does not follow a standardized direction of horror films, but rather creates a different outfit by using, in a certain volume, long shots - with depth in most cases - and daring by constantly using many camera (panoramic) and objective (zoom) movements. -in and zoom-out).Rooted in strangeness, including the unconventional appearance of the Shapiro girl - enhanced with the help of a lot of makeup - the feature does not hide behind conventions and formats, jumping headlong into all the subjects and aspects it wants to deal with. Abortion, everyday anguish, puberty, madness, permissiveness, harassment, family problems, judgment, and a dozen other subjects, are all treated with the same intensity and importance, without affecting the urgency of the work. There is almost no breath, and perhaps this is Aster's main weapon in the composition of his film, along with the director's courage in creating terrifying scenes and situations, without trying to escape the strange and out of place humor they cause in people. Having a miniaturist character and bringing perspectives from the miniatures themselves at various times, it is as if the author created his own puppet theater, with all the absurdities and poetic freedoms that fill it.Whether in the superb, dark and harrowing soundtrack by Colin Stetson (""Lavender""), which literally marks the entire film with a sound that refers to blood circulation, mixed with a stopwatch, screams and horns from hell, or in the sound effects increased and uncomfortable, or in the unbelievable photography of Pawel Pogorzelski (""Boost""), who places his cameras in the most unlikely places and captures the growing anguish, without shying away from showing what happens in the face (or behind!) of the protagonists, technically the movie is perfect. The shape here, however distorted and daring it may be, perfectly matches the plot proposal, creating a really unique sensation. A growing and unimaginable fear, which is so uncomfortable, sometimes it even makes you laugh.Not to say that everything is perfect, there are some exaggerations in schizophrenic outbursts, which however justified they may be - after all, who can measure how crazy madness can be? - cause brief detachments from the plot. Another problem is some strange actions of the characters, which do not fit into their ""realistic"" proposal, giving the feeling that they take these attitudes just to make the scares stand out, such as the irritating mania of walking through a house infested with horrors, always with the lights off. The film strives, by the way, to be a horror movie with a pedigree. For this, it postpones the revelation of the background that goes back to millenary demons, promoting its emergence gradually, but not competently. The triggers are loose, like Charlie's nut allergy that leads to dire consequences as she accompanies her brother to a teen party. Inexplicably, guilt is not properly explored in this tortuous path - in fact, it fades in the face of the need to promptly trigger something on the order of the unfathomable -, nor is the possibility of the heredity of mental illness, which invalidates the previous attempt to create a smokescreen. Potentially efficient. The evil mythology itself is approached timidly, with force only in the last moments. There is no lack of disturbing elements throughout the film, such as children assembling strange models with pigeon heads and human decapitations, which the filmmaker makes a point of showing to shock us.Still, ""Hereditary"" is a unique film. An ingenious, metaphorical work, with a chilling ending and an unusual proposal. It is also an incredible vehicle to prove, once again, how versatile actress Toni Collette is, as the highest emotional ""roller coaster"" of the film falls on her shoulders and she faces it with excellent aplomb. But most of all, it's one more gem in this incredible new crop of really terrifying and intelligent horror movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I Couldn't get to Sleep after Watching This,"This was a good film, I watched it with my family who weren't very keen but I think that it felt quite different to what is usually offered in todays horror films and delivered an interesting if slightly messy plot fairly well.The first 2 acts aren't really scary, foreboding, yes, scary no. They do however set up well for the 3rd act leaving breadcrumbs that come together to reveal the greater elements that have been at play behind the scenes throughout the whole film. While the breadcrumbs have been lay out however this doesn't stop the final act feeling like a fever dream which appealed to me but less so to the people I was watching with.

The cinematography was good but didn't really stand out to me but I did appreciate the editing with there being some great match cuts.I think that Hereditary is a required taste, personally I think it's far scarier than the CGI mess that films like IT can evolve into but I understand that a lot of people disagree and just want to see jump scares every 5 minutes. I'm going to recommend this film but just remember that it's a slow paced film, give it time.P.s.

"It is creepy, suspensful and intelligent family horror story","This film is a successful horror at several levels. The screenplay contains at least two different basic aspects, each of them are intersting on its own, but writer and director Ari Aster is able to fuse it into a powerful but standalone story, using not your average jumpscares but a great suspense-building.
On the surface ""Hereditary"" is rather a family drama than horror, the whole storyline focuses on a members of one family with dark past. Toni Colett does a great acting here, and truly sparks the screen. The film invests a lot in characters, since it's only a handful of them here, so don't expect immediate drive into the ghosts activity or demonic posession. It's a film about dissolution of a one particular famliy, and such process Asters shows with great attention to the details. There's no direct social commentary here, it's rather about personal degeneration and desperation, about the past that still haunts.
Under all this dramatic surface lies great modern horror, made with respect to classical themes and style. As story goes by, transition from family drama to occult horror begins, and Aster manages to procced it smoothly. A lot of traditional horror elements (such as disturbing dreams, bizarre rites, and so on) can be found here, but this film relies more on the of tension and eerie logic of the events than on conventional jumpscares or blood and guts. 
Overall, it's a great slow-burner, made with all respect to genre fans, and luckily escaping most of the cliches - a rare film among contemporary horror films. if you like dark and nervous movies with acting over SFX, put this one on your watch list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

For Horror Film Connoisseurs,"I find it surprising that this film gets so many low marks. The only reason I can possibly fathom is that it's not filled with endless jump scares, standard cliche'd horror movie storylines and/or one-by-one character deaths at the hands of a standard boogeyman. If you like your horror a little deeper then read on.What you get is a fleshed-out story of a deceased grandmother who has influenced her mentally ill family members is the worst way possible. You will not be able to predict where it goes and the surprises in the film come fast and furious. To keep it short and sweet, I'm a fan of recent horror films like Annihilation, Mother!, It Follows, and Beyond the Black Rainbow as well as TV surreal/horror like Twin Peaks and Penny Dreadful. If these films are more your style then check out Hereditary. I was completely blown away and can't stop thinking about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Rosemary's Babadook,"An ungrieving daughter becomes a grieving mother, and her family descends into madness ...Opens on a skilful shot to take us seamlessly inside a doll-house that opens into domestic reality. All about family, and we hit the Babadook vibe from the off, with difficult children in tense confrontation with a difficult mother, as the distress ebbs and flows. At the hour mark we go through the looking glass into horror, with a coven vibe similar to Paranormal Activity (very different style) - or I suppose Rosemary's Baby is the obvious influence.Cinematography is excellent, with an odd effect I haven't seen before, where the sky switches on and off like an electric light. Editing is fairly snappy, so the pace is good, and the score is uneven - very heavy and brooding in the first part, then almost disappears, only to come brooding back at the end. Strong performances all round, with Collette playing a strange and disturbing role.I did have a problem writing the logline for the review, and I don't feel the story is fully integrated. More committed to the supernatural than the Babadook, more explicit than Paranormal Activity - and somehow we end with an odd climax, where the most extreme moment is underplayed, and the set-piece that follows is overplayed. Hmmm.Some of the horror images are great, others very good. And there are some ideas ""floating"" around, but I'm not sure I get them. Why the miniatures and the doll-house? How does the history of psychosis tie in with the supernatural? Does the sky effect suggest a world separated from time? Why isn't the father key to the secret, how did he get on with the grandmother?Overall: Stylish, intense horror, but doesn't hang together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Gotta love movies that remind us horror isn't all about shock.,"This film here isn't all that much about how or even why people die, it's for most of its runtime about the terror deaths inflict on loved ones. It's rather easy to understand the situation the on-screen character is in and the pain he has to live through. It's disturbingly well crafted to touch you and make you feel fear in ways other than shock or surprise.However, no amount of story, acting, cinematography and proper continuity will make you able to fully ignore the absolutely horrendous CGI in this film. Some scenes are a plain 0/10 and nearly all of them are pretty much completely unnecessary. It's so bad, it drags down the entire rating. Every single piece of CGI took me out of the experience and made me hate what I'm seeing for minutes.It's a good piece of horror and probably one you may want to watch with your family, if you're all into it.

"A beautiful, psychologically terrifying film","I was lucky in that I had never read a review or synopsis of this film before viewing. So from the beginning, I had no idea where it was going. I hate to compare it to another film because it is unique on its own, but I am reminded of Rosemary's Baby, where for most of the film you are wondering if you are just watching a masterful character study of madness in a claustrophobic NY apartment. At the end of that film you realize you have watched a film about contemporary satanism. 
Hereditary keeps you on the edge of your seat. It keeps you guessing. It's a slow boil of pychological horror. You also have the sense that you are watching a master filmmaker at work, an auteur to watch. 
I won't give anything away but in the last act of this film, you are exhausted and terrified. You are not exactly sure what you just saw. I will say this. There is no way in the beginning of this film to predict how it will end. There are enough pychological twists and moments of pure horror that it will keep you thinking about it for days after.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best horror movie I have ever seen,This movie got me speechless I have never been that afraid in my entire life,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Instant classic,"Let me say first and foremost that this film will let down many modern or contemporary horror fans. Many fans introduced to the genre since the late 90s into the Millennium might not appreciate this type of scary movie. Movies have conditioned us in recent years that blood and cheap scares are the only effective ways to scare us. The Director does throw in some ""jumpscare"" type moments though. This is not ""Insidious"" or the ""Evil Dead"" remake. Do yourself a favor and skip this and wait for the new ""Purge"" movie if that's what you are after (and I love those types of movies as well just to be clear.) They are fun films and usually leave me filled with ""hell yea"" moments. This film left me with the ""what did I just watch""Toni Collette delivers the performace of her career in this film as ""Annie"" the Mother of thr family. Let me take a moment to brag on Toni. She is by far the most underrated actress in the business right now. She stole my heart with her part in ""Krampus"" as the Mother of that movie as well. She is so raw in this movie it's truly amazing. Toni delivers one of the most gut wrenching performances in movie history with this one. If she is not up for ""best actress"" at this years Oscars I will be so angry.The rest of this very small cast of this movie is phenomenal. Milly Shapiro as the Daughter with a dead stare like a rock will break you mentally in ways you're not accustomed. Gabriel Byrne does a nice job with his character of ""Steve"" the father trying to keep the family together as turmoil unfolds. Alex Wolff steals the show as the stoned teenage son who looks like he hates the world and everything in it. You know normal 16 year old stuff. Be prepared to see the face of Alex Wolff in many films to come.What this movie does so well is what i call the ""roller coaster effect"" the first 30 minutes are the upward climb ""click click click click"". The next 30 minutes is the big drop, you feel your stomach in your throat. And then BAM the last hour is loops and swoops and turns and drops and holy mother of all that is good this movie is a ride! I will say the imagery will leave you breathless in scenes. The score had my hair standing up the whole movie. This film really excels in the cinematography department. Visually unlike anything any viewer has ever scene. Truly original plot. What else can i say? I literally had no negative complaints of this movie other than the ending....but it's a really great ending. It just punched me in the chest and ripped my soul out of my body but no big deal.""Hereditary"" deliver several of the most horrifying and shocking scenes that I have ever witnessed.

A breath of fresh air to the satanic cult genre of horror movie and it works perfectly. The slow pace and build up pays off by the end. Cinematography is on point for this one, too. It helps to create an immense sense of dread which lingers throughout the entire movie. The one stand out feature for this one however, the acting, especially Toni Collette. I couldn't have asked for a better performance and she is definately oscar worthy. Overall, just watch the movie.

This is fairly engaging,"This is fairly engaging but the rather drawn out beginning and first half with its stop/start manner had me thinking I was watching some multi part TV series where the writers were only too aware this was something they needed to spin out. The kids are okay, the mother far too manic and Gabriel Byrne as the laid back and largely irrelevant father, far too lethargic and inexpressive. I was struck, however, having coincidently only seen him in the night before in Miller's Crossing in his prime, he maybe always had the feeling that one expression would probably do. Here he appears more dead than some of the actual dead but perhaps that is intended. All is not overly explained and on IMDb where there are usually one or two questions posed apropos certain films, for Hereditary there are dozens. Someone has gone to a lot of trouble dealing with them all but surely the film itself should take some responsibility for clarity. As it happens, for me, the overlong first half or so was engaging enough but as the 'happenings' began to take place I felt somewhat let down considering how long the build up had been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Chilling, Creeping, Shocking","Growing up as a young kid I was always fascinated and intrigued by the shocking and the horrific.

Very few movies managed to achieve the fear and creeping factor that is necessary for a horror movie to be truly what it needs to be, horrific. Hereditary has managed exactly that! You experience a range of emotions that you rarely experience in a modern horror movie. Many say that the movie is the new modern Exorcist, but I believe that it has more of a 60's feel to it resembling old horror-mysteries such Rosemary's Baby. Moving on to the direction, sound score, sound editing and acting you find yourself encapsulated in a a near-perfect horror picture.

The ultimate in 'slow burning' horror,"I'd heard quite a lot about 'Hereditary' before I actually watched it, most of which stating that, although marketed as a 'horror' movie, it wasn't so straight forward. Now, having sat through it, I can - sort of - see what they mean.When you think of 'horror' you probably imagine monsters, slashers or something similar. Now, although 'Hereditary' definitely has a strong supernatural element running through it (not to mention some pretty disturbing imagery which I would definitely describe as 'horrific!), it's certainly not your average run-of-the-mill horror.When questioned, even the film-makers go to great lengths to describe it as more of a 'family drama' (plus supernatural, etc). It weighs in at just over two hours, which is certainly longer than your average tale about a guy in an ice hockey mask slicing up teenagers. Instead, we have a story about what, on the surface could be described as a 'traditional' family of four (Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne as the mother and father and Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro as their children) and the way they're coming to terms with the recent loss of the grandmother of the household.It's certainly a 'character-focused' piece and all four (or at least three - I did feel that Gabriel Byrne was given the least to do of the four) major characters get their chance to shine and also develop. We see how the death of the 'matriarch' affects them all and their dynamic, plus the problems her loss causes among them. For the most part, what 'horror' is displayed is due to their various mental breakdowns and how they see things (although there is one particularly graphic scene - only for a second or two - which will stay with me forever). Any supernatural threat comes in the final act when the weird stuff really starts going down.It was certainly nice to see a horror movie try to be a little different and I felt compelled to watch it to the end, simply to see where it was going and, perhaps more importantly, what the hell was going on! Yes, it's not completely black and white and the story does make you work for a few answers here and there. I even went as far as to watch a YouTube video on its 'ending explained' just to make sure I had actually understood it (and I'm pleased to say that I had!).If it has a fault (for me, anyway) then it's the film's run-time. Yes, it does do a good job of building tension, however I did feel I'd like to get to the 'meat' of the story a little quicker than I actually did. However, that's just a minor gripe and there were more than enough shocks and surprises that I never saw coming (and I've seen a lot of horror films!) which made the (long) journey worthwhile. If you're in the mood for something long, drawn out and a little different in terms of horror, then it's definitely worth sitting down for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Artfully unnerving, borderline scarring","First of all, if anybody is accusing Hereditary of not being like The Exorcist, KNOCK IT OFF. You can't compare modern horror to a horror, let alone a CLASSIC horror, that was made over 40 years ago. This is a different era for the horror genre, with a completely different audience. And so, while there are a few minor similarities, Hereditary stands alone in its entirety. It's not like The Exorcist, and it never was intended to be. And that's a good thing. But if anybody should be comparing films, I feel the film that most feels like Hereditary is ""The Babadook,"" despite its many and obvious differences. It's also just as enjoyable.Hereditary is about a family coping with a loss, an estranged grandmother with a mysterious background. They struggle to trust one another, and it seems from the start the relationships between them are damaged. There are trust issues, alongside paranoia. On top of it all, the mother starts to uncover a dreadful truth about their deceased matriarch. Things get creepy, and dark, and genuinely scary.There are rave reviews out there, as well as negative, but the rating speaks for itself. How rare to find a modern horror to have above a 6.5 on IMDB, so obviously without having to see it, you should know the film is doing something right. And it is indeed.The whole of it is unnerving. The atmosphere is chilling, much to the help of the score and excellent performances of all the actors. The flow and directing, on top of cinematography all play an effective part in the story, and is unique in its own way. I especially love the plot device of the miniatures, and how the family's home from outside can be debated as real or a model, which invokes doubt of what is real and what is not.Unfortunately, while I give this film high praise, I cannot love it. The director's goal was to ""upset audiences on a very deep level."" He not only succeeded in this, but he may have been too effective. This is NOT a ""fun"" movie. It will be disturbing to many, ESPECIALLY the religious. And do not bring children to it, unless you want a visit from child protective services.On a personal note, it has been many years since I've been tempted to leave the theater during a film, and never before has it been a film that I was currently enjoying. And such it was with me for this film. I found myself emotionally attached, and those emotions were being ripped apart in such a way that I was becoming a tad upset, which hasn't happened in a long time. I was enjoying it, yet at the same time, loathing what it was doing.But everybody's different. Can't say many will share a similar experience. So I still recommend it, highly. But be warned, it gets crazy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"First and second act are excellent, then in the third a totally average disposable horror garbage appeared.","Hereditary, a film that could have been so much and ended up being just fairly good. Let's see, the first and second act are marevellous, taking the viewer through sheer excruciating pain and grief through the eyes of a very emotionally beaten-up family working their way through tragedy and how to deal with their lives after such scarring events. The acting is top-notch, Toni Collette and Alex Wolff absolutely steal the show, they deliver such powerful outstanding performances, definitely award-worthy.I was excited to see this movie, but the actual movie lies in the build-up towards the climax, and not including the climax itself, which it was so ordinary and reminiscent of typical horror nonsense you see nowadays; so utterly disappointing. A family drama with a horror undercurrent that keeps you enthralling with only subtle frightening suggestions; for such a great build up I was waiting for the ending to blow me away, and to my utter disappointment it didn't. It felt like I was watching a completely different movie, that is, a mediocre one. I just couldn't keep my eyes from rolling at such a cheap ending. However, I cannot be unfair with what came before and it definitely felt to me like one of the best horror films of this decade.I sincerely don't know how you are going to feel after watching this movie, like me perhaps, amazed and disillusioned at the same time; I get the feeling that a lot of people felt ripped off, not only by the ending like me considering everything it preceded, but also by the fact that is not a conventional horror movie with plenty of cheap scare jumps and nonsensical plots. Yet, is this unconventionality is what made it great in the first place in my opinion.I gotta hand it to the score, I can't remember such an infectious and unsettling piece of music belonging to a horror movie in recent years that was so attached to the plot, the characters and the overall atmosphere and 
tone of the film. Simply superb. Had me feeling uncomfortable during the entire movie.So there you have it, a film that could have been excellent, but instead decided to crush my high expectations that were built during the course of the film, which is what annoys me the most; the film itself raised the bar and lowered it destroying what was previously built so well. Still, a decent film; I urge you, don't miss out on this one! You may feel different than me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
God Save Ari Aster!,"It's all true. Ari Aster's psychologically brutal and unnerving directorial debut is a supernatural film feat conjured up by a convincing perspective that extracts from spiritism, demonology and necromancy a sufficiently disturbing mythology to perturb your mind with one of the best developed indie horror films of the new century, there are visual and storytelling magic. It's insufficient to say that it gets under your skin as soon as the credits roll, leaving a bad omen and unusual insecurity today in films that only will get away with a sinister tongue-clicking noise. The darkest perversity lurks behind familiar faces.Little known among the mainstream audiovisual world, Aster - New York, 1987 - began to carve out a niche for himself in the field with his meaningful and bizarre short films (""The Strange Thing About The Johnsons""), those that were enough inducements for production company A24 to grant its support to make possible his outstanding, scary debut into the world of celluloid. Credited as the single director and screenwriter - a strangely uncommon guarantee bearing in mind the unbelievable fruits, - this American filmmaker, an absolute new prey for the major studios, consolidates his idea and career with overwhelming solvency, exquisite certainty and necessary tranquility to freak us out; the control he has over the cinematographic tools he possesses is masterful, it's perceptible with every strange, purposeful scene in which the command of camera, script and actors become cardinal handholds to confer tremendous impact on a darkly penetrating family tragedy seen from the outside, but with a sharper review lies an inquisitive and traumatizing story of loss, forgiveness, sanity, family, union and, best of all, human and inhuman demons.The 2018 Sundance Film Festival was the first to build the wings to this psychological horror film to fly high, provoking an uncommon buzz for the genre since Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" premiered in the 2014 edition at midnight. Universal acclaim diffused by an effervescent mouth-to-mouth, critics' reviews or festival attendees' comments that crammed social media; honors geared directly toward the endeavor of two people in particular: Toni Collette and Ari Aster; but that would be a clearly shrink, incorrect avowal minimizing the set of visceral strengths constituting an incredible whole.Broadly speaking, the first big step corresponds to the excellent plot writing. As a good modern-day horror flick, the argumental lifeblood is found when you delve deeper its façade, the treasure about everybody are talking is in the metaphorical content, cloaked by obscurity and restlessness weaving the film. This entails a strong, intrinsic necromantic approach to the spiritual world, in fact, this is the main propeller of the plot; also, besides this fruitful, appealing core theme, a pessimistic and powerful family drama takes place, through which conscientiously walk mental health issues, mourning, pain, family chains, the importance of being part of a group and the responsibility it involves. But as a good modern-day horror flick, it must also work just as well if it's watched from the outside, and here all the elements are in the precise order to a nerve-racking experience for the most unwilling viewer, of course, patience arises as the main requirement. On that subject is where it works at its best. From the beginning, it sets up what kind of atmosphere the filmmaker will handle throughout the film, for example, as tension-builder master David Robert Mitchell did in ""It Follows."" The opening scene with a panning movement alongside Annie's working room, the lead role, urges to plunge into her miniature haunted house, a place where death really means death. This is a resource the film mostly respects, showing it with the importance the spectator requires, because unlike ""It Comes At Night"" by Trey Edward Shults from the same production house, The most hard-to-watch scenes don't end up being a kind of vision or nightmare sooner or later, the story takes them down as a significant and irreversible reality, is the fate of the game, a future marked by King Paymon; once you're selected, you cannot do anything.The film, as a whole, is a frightening and constantly shocking experience, however, being objective and selective, there are about five sequences simply rewarding, frame after frame with a pace and a surprise factor pathetically horrific that leaves you with your mouth wide open for more than an entire minute, you certainly don't understand why that just happened, but once you're sufficiently related to the characters and the mythology, this fantastic state of shock makes sense. In said sequences, the great affection and respect to the big, seldom-remembered horror classics through narrative executions are noticeable, however, ""Annabelle: Creation"" came to my mind at the time when we all literally lose our heads; Edward Shults' psychological horror thriller also got reminiscences obviously; ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" in its natural ability to disturb in no time at all or Robert Eggers' incredible unsettling debut with ""The VVitch: a New-England Folktale,"" and there are a lot of similarities in there.That ending, that ending is as mind-boggling and irrationally powerful as firs-timer Eggers's. An insane, schizophrenic third act prepares the ground for a monumental conclusion, one neatly written, astonishing and exciting splashing drops of horror situation after another. The tension is visceral and well-built, it makes you uncomfortable even when apparently nothing happens on screen; that ending is, without stock, one of the best in a real horror film since 2016. Drawing on grimoires to a tragedy plot is a tricky task and whoever wants to set a film on it should be sufficiently prepared and aware that it must deliver a coherent, cohesive and juicy story, faithful to the difficult supporting material and the hopes of the most loyal moviegoers. It bets on the anger and the search of one of the kings of hell: Paimon, who with 200 legions to govern, an ostentatious crown, a dromedary and an effeminate face, is considered one of the most obedient to Lucifer. If you thoroughly investigate who he is and his purposes, most of the complex narrative will get meaning, well, most of it, for sure; and although it seems that the magic of the film ends here, there is still some metaphorical study material to break down, in which it's necessary to decipher what's true and what's not. Is all this really about a mental illness legacy? family issues? is this just an enraged demon?It's not hyperbole: Toni Collette does deserve an Oscar; if you need proof, just buy a movie ticket, if you need proof, pay special attention to that magnanimous monologue in the grief support group or that ""usual"" family discussion at the table. Conquering with the most risky and sinister role of her career, ""Krampus"" actress delivers one of the best distressed-mother performances of all time, as well as a terrifying interpretation in relation to the nuances and demands of the character, there are dramatic peaks that the Oscar-nominated actress reaches with incredible ease, out-of-rational-control scenes in which this talented woman overflows pure talent. She's not a hackneyed crying-out-loud person, before all that, she's a morally-ambiguous mother possible only due to the traumatized, haunted behavior this brilliant Australian actress endows Annie; she directs most of the story to hand over control to a new and magnificent actor who's a revelation. Collette must remain the face of this unsettling film because this is rightly her moment, her tour-de-force has arrived.The same level of diffuseness and complexity put into the narrative, are in the creepy imagery. One of the best aspects of this bestial family nightmare is the powering, discomforting creativeness bathering every picture. Without hesitation, I ratify that even the minor element on screen has a narrative purpose that will mean a handhold for the next move/twist a few scenes later, and while much of that reinforcement is packed in the script, there are also several shots visually. In the very last minutes of the feature, we already are familiar with that beautifully spooky wooden house, we know the position of each room, where the loft, Annie's work area, the kitchen, the dining room and, of course, that scary tree house are, an amazing achievement possible by the excellent camera work. ""Don't Breathe"" by Fede Alvarez focused on elements that will be key pieces later, similarly this movie insinuates the importance on select utensils and visual tools that will make sense sometime later. Pay extreme attention to find the feats of the artistic field at the narrative level. Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography doesn't accept improvements; the way he alternates colors, shades, radical changes of atmosphere always influenced by an adjacent darkness. Colin Stetson creates dreamlike, nightmarish compositions, having the opportunity to empower the most bizarre scenes in which his meaningful melodies steal the spotlight; it's a warning of what is coming, zero tranquility and one hundred per cent tribulation, a score true to its source that paralyzes your senses.No doubt, ""Hereditary"" by Ari Aster is one of the films of the year due to first-class performances - even bandying about a would-be Academy Award or Golden Globe nomination, - a superb direction for a horror film and a slow-burning story of demons, dark secrets and legacies, a movie with a schizophrenic and psychologically effective pace that advances at full speed under the surface as a bone-crushing beast, willing to damage our dreams, and it has made it. Viscerally unpredictable, visually terrifying and well developed, Ari Aster is this year's Robert Eggers owing to one of the most beautifully unsettling films of the year and the decade.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hereditary,"The film starts out a little slow but ends at the pace of a wrecking train. A very complete horror film that is not only there to cause chills and screams, but it is a story that has everything. Wonderful acting by the cast which also elevated the film to a new status. As the movie progresses, audiences is drawn to the picture waiting how every scene unfolds, to me that is the definition of a great film. Let's just hope we can sleep tonight",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A disturbing mistery,"An amazing horror movie directed perfectly. I loved the first work of Ari Arister.
You'll need a critical thinking to properly appreciate it, but the development is just on point. Lots of reviews compare it to babadook and mother!, but I think this movie has a complete different purpose. While the first two resemble a theatrical drama, this one is less metaphorical but still characterized by the same tension. A superb soundtrack and a mysterious plot merge together to create a must watch movie for horror fans. 
The ending scene is not that hard to understand if you have been detail-oriented.
A good version of the witch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stands out as a movie ; comes close to horror excellence,"This movie comes close to greatness. Its well shot, well edited and stands out visually . But... There are some massive plot holes and story issues. It's just over 2 hours long which in horror terms is quite long. It takes it time and can feel like for long periods. Ticks all the boxes for a horror movie. It's scary, gripping and frightening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I will never see this movie again!!,"I think this is new kind of horror film, and among horror films are shown this year, this film is the best. No ghost, no jump-scare and the most important thing, it has plot, it has meaning.The connection inside this film is started at the beginning of the film, and during the time you watch it, you will watch, you will feel the same feeling, will have the same emotion and you don't know what you're facing to? The grandmother, kind of. The daughter, maybe. And every details in this film have their own meaning, you have to focus, think about them and you'll be explained at the end of this movie.I watched this film alone, with my headphone, i beg that i had trully experienced with the feeling what-i-am-afraid-of.

"First I hated, then I loved it","I've seen Hereditary with low expectations because I knew it was from the same producers of The Witch and Spring Breakers (two movies I hated).
Is a slow burn movie, the viewer should be with the right mood to appreciate it. The cast is great (Toni Collette deserves an Oscar, her interpretation is one of the best I've seen ), the cinematography is good and the plot is interesting.The fact why a lot of people hated was all fault of the marketing, the trailers showed a film with a different vibe directed to the main audiences. For example: I watched with my brother, he was expecting something like The Conjuring or Orphan. But I said to him to don't create high expectations because he was going to see something really different.To be honest, I didn't like Hereditary so much when I left from the theater, I needed to think a lot about what I watched, because there were some shocking, disturbing and disgusting scenes that made me a little uncomfortable. But that is what cinema does, I mean, create emotions on us. Now, I can say, I really liked this movie even if it can be a little boring sometimes.
So, for me Hereditary is a masterpiece, has a good dark story to tell, the things start to get darker during the 2nd act and then there's a lot of intense and terrifying scenes until the weak climax. Yes, I did not like the ending, is a bit stupid and cliché, the director is awesome but he could do a better ending.It's a post-modern classic, I took some time to think about everything I watched, is shocking and really dark, I only would change the ending and add some jump scares just to put the mainstream audience happy.Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't waste your time,"Awful, awful, awful movie. Half ass story line, character development sucked. They apparently had a family dog that appeared for only two scenes and was suppose to have an impact but amounted to nothing more than who the hells dog is that? There were Naked old people zombies randomly appearing at the end. The audience was literally laughing at the ""scary"" scenes and you could hear people cracking jokes all the way through the second half of the movie. The writers and director should be held accountable for false advertising. Don't waste your time with this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
holy hell,"I don't ever get scared by horror movies anymore because I love them so much, but this one HORRIFIED me. It was more than just jump scares; the suspense, the complex plot, the way the movie makes you think and piece things together. It's a very complex movie and I was not expecting that ending at all- I actually wasn't expecting anything that happened in the film to happen. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this film from the cast and crew and it really paid of. Really great movie, I highly recommend seeing it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as scary as the critics say but worth the watch!,"First of all I understand the people who are giving this a 1 star, it was way too overhyped. Critics said that it is the scariest horror movie since The exorcist.Now this movie does not rely a lot on jumpscares, sure there are 1 or 2 but that's all. As a huge fan of horror movie, I liked it. It wasn't as good as the critics said but you wouldn't be disappointed. Just don't expect too much and it was kinda predictable. And secondly, the acting was top notch, especially Toni. One of the best performances i've ever seen. She deserves an Oscar!!!

"A great movie, but not for traditional horror audiences.","""Hereditary"" tells the story of a family, which is haunted by disturbing events.""Hereditary"" is a good movie, but it doesn't please the traditional horror audience, as its construction of the story and characters, due to the great suspense and drama, is extremely prolonged and, consequently, boring, for the main audience. However, the film, when inserted into its true horror, is indeed terrifying and disturbing. Another positive point is its mystery and twists, which is admirable as it is built from the beginning of the film.The admirable work of Ari Aster is remarkable in the film, but even so, if the work had bet a little more on horror, in addition to the drama and suspense presented, it would be an icon for the current decade.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
