I felt the need to just replace the previous ignorant comment,"The Piano is a beautiful film in many different respects. In terms of cinematography, I've seen few like it. It is dark and beautiful and compelling. The story seems, on paper, as a torrid love story without much originality. But the sensuous portrayal of Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter and the complex acting of a young Anna Paquin allow this story to ring true. I was skeptical upon viewing a film so lauded by critics and film snobs, but found myself both moved and connected to the film that holds strangely relevant themes for modern times. It is rare that I love both a film's visual beauty and it's script as well. This is that rare occasion.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
This revisit 30 years on was rewarding,"Isn't it extraordinary how our opinions can change over time ,well mine anyway.
After so many positive comments by people who list this film as one of their all time favourites I thought I should watch The Piano written and directed by New Zealander Jane Campion.
It must be over 30 years ago that I first saw The Piano and It was like seeing it for the first time today .I don't know why I disliked it back then ,there were a lot of changes going on in my life but today I can only praise this film and I'm so glad I was curious enough to revisit it.
There has been so much critical praise heaped on ""The Piano ""I won't add much except to praise the genius of Jane Campion ,the entire cast and technical personnel ,especially the camera people and film editors not only is it the greatest film to be produced in New Zealand but it holds its own with any film anywhere on earth.
The year it was made 1994 The Piano was up against very stiff Hollywood competition with Stephen Spielberg 'S brilliant film ""Schindler's List"" if not for that I suspect I'm not the only one to think ""The Piano "" also would have one Best Picture and Best Director it thoroughly deserved it's 7 nominations and 3 wins.It's a beautiful film to watch of course the breathtakingly beautiful misty forests and sea scapes of New Zealand .
The emotional impact of Holly Hunter's Academy Award winning performance as Ada ( who doesn't have a line of dialogue except subconscious narrative ) and of course Anna Paquin as her precocious adult child daughter Flora are superb .
Anna was only one year older than Tatum O'Neil the youngest Oscar winner and has had a much more impressive film career than Tatum since her win.
The actors Sam Neil as Alisdair ,Ada's patient but ineffectual husband and Harvey Keitel as George Barnes the lonely overseer with a vivid fantasy emotional life are also very impressive in these roles .
I did wonder if the few sexual scenes could be filmed as convincingly in today's ME Too World ? the actors would have to follow much stricter guidelines I suspect.Finally I guess I'm writing this to encourage anyone who feels very strongly about or dislike a much praised movie to keep an open mind and give it another chance as I did the reward was worth it.
Ps the music of course by Michael Nyman adds to the enjoyment but it's Director and writer Jane Campion who has produced a film where even the title ""The Piano."" An inanimate object becomes almost a living character that determines all the main characters fate and destiny.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing Film Making,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  It combines masterful scripting, cinematography, performances, and musical score into a disturbing, erotic, and ultimately uplifting piece.  The movie's heroine, wonderfully portrayed by Holly Hunter, is mute (symbolic of the fact that she has no say in her own life), with her daughter (the astonishing Anna Paquin) and her piano as her personal obsessions.  Her conscripted husband, coldly played by Sam Neill, is trying to win her heart and her desire in all the wrong ways, while his crude tribal neighbor, sensually played by Harvey Keitel, understands her needs and ultimately captures her ... physically, intellectually, and romantically.  The film's message and its delivery are extraordinarily  powerful, the cinematic technique is rich ... the sequence shot with Hunt, Pacquin, Keitel and the piano on the beach is one of the best pieces of work I've ever seen.  Lasting impact.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A sensual and surprising film,"Jane Campion's Oscar-winning movie follows Ada (played by Holly  Hunter), an immigrant to the New Zealand outback and an arranged  marriage, who has not spoken for years and lives her life through the  sound of her piano. Her husband (played by Sam Neill) is a man without  much understanding, who tries to break the connection between his new  wife and her piano; in contrast to him is the wild illiterate Baines  (played by Harvey Keitel), a tattooed loner, who reaches into Ada's  soul and helps her to regain contact with her emotions and ultimately,  her voice too.  The film is visually compelling, with its muted colours and wide open  spaces, and uses the soundtrack by Michael Nyman in such a way so all  the elements fit together. Keitel and Hunter give excellent  performances within a sensitive and sensual screenplay, while Anna  Paquin is impressive as Ada's wise daughter, always watching and always  aware. Campion managed to make the story touching, involving, and sexy,  and it well deserved the plaudits heaped on it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Strong poetic visuals, but love story fails to convince","There's no doubt The Piano is beautiful. The opening scene of the sailors carrying Ada and her beloved instrument onto the beach amidst the crashing waves is stunning; there are many shots like this, that show the awesomeness of the natural world, often as a reflection of the protagonist's emotional state.I found the story to be less compelling however. It's slow, sparse on dialogue and doesn't give much information about the mute protagonist, like what her wants or fears are. I didn't find her particularly likeable.There is also the matter of those awful Scottish accents; Why are American actors so bad at accents?Even less convincing is the love story between Ada (Hunter) and George (Keitel). I felt there was zero chemistry between them; Keitel is such a lump of a man, I don't know why they couldn't have found someone more dashing for the role. His character, George, is so plain and boring, there's nothing about his personality that entices. It seemed silly to me that Ada would allow herself to be persuaded into bed with him, especially when his initial attempts at seduction were so blunt and rape-y. The love scenes left me cold.It was the visuals and the haunting atmosphere that sustained me to the end. I can see why it gets praise from critics, but I can also see why it wasn't hugely successful with the general public. It just doesn't have the emotional power to match the cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
You critics make me laugh.,"A few years too late but I've just watched this. Even to today's standards, it's an amazing movie. Actually, for today's standards even more so. I would have to presume that the plethora of 1/10 ratings come from the type that would rate transformers as an all time epic.I read one review asking how Holly Hunter won an Oscar when she didn't even talk. Really? So you think someone like Jessie eisenberg should have a collection of Oscars? Because that man talks way too much!You don't need to talk to act. Being able to communicate without speech is so much harder and Holly played it flawlessly. In my opinion Anna Paquin was just as amazing, especially considering her age. The part where she has to give something to Harvey Keitel was amazing. I have a young daughter, to be able to act that well on cue... well, she had me bawling!Ignore the negatives. If you have a heart and require more than cgi with no story.... then watch this if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Quietly erotic,"Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with.Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband.The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making.As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Acting with the face,"If one wants to see true acting, just watch Hollie Hunter in this film. She does more with her facial expressions than twenty actors can with a thousand words. Her stature, her presence, her determination are so intense. One could feel sorry for her in places. She has been ripped from her world for reasons we cannot fathom. She has been deemed expendable. When she arrives she expects to be treated properly. Anna Paquin as her daughter settles into the new environment and begins to prosper. But it is not without sacrifice. The piano is the symbol of what was left behind. Her affair with the Maori is partly passion, partly payment. We never know how much of each. The performances are stunning across the board and, this time, worthy of Academy Awards.There are some very sensual scenes and scenes of great danger. There is pain inflicted and selfishness and power. Hollie Hunter rises above it all and makes her way through this quagmire (the rainy muddy jungle in this case), and arises, victorious in her own fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Magnificent, symbolic film masterpiece plays beautifully, like a piano.","There are very few female directors in the film industry that have been given proper acknowledgment or had their works introduced to mainstream filmgoers. Jane Campion is one of these precious few, a director who carefully paces and sculpts her works so that they magnificently flow like a musical interlude. ""The Piano"" is her ultimate masterpiece, a film of such simplicity, described with calm and tense complexity. Holly Hunter received an Oscar for her fascinating performance as Ada, a mute woman who is forced into an arranged marriage with a New Zealand landowner, played convincingly by Sam Neill, a native Australian actor himself. Ada journeys to New Zealand with her young daughter (Anna Paquin, also an Oscar-winner that year), few other possessions, and her treasured piano, a part of her that amplifies her voice that she cannot express through vocal communication.I believe it would be wrong to assume that any of the characters are martyrs in this tragic story, nor would it be right to think Sam Neill's character a villain. You may think this is crazy, but I think the piano itself serves as both a good and bad omen for all that are involved. I would relate it to a ""Pandora's box"" of sorts, a treasure that exposes all the evil and sin in the world, but which also provides hope as well. The piano is Ada's sounding box, a tool that allows her to escape from a world that does not understand her, but that also threatens her moral compass, removing her from marital conventions and forces her to lose herself.The performances in ""The Piano"" are particularly good, especially Holly Hunter's. It is interesting to note that all of Hunter's piano playing in the film is actually Hunter herself performing in front of us. You can visually and aurally feel the mood of Hunter's character through the music she plays. We the audience lose ourselves right along with her, lost upon a sea of music. We see why Keitel becomes enamored by her, and why Neill becomes overcome with jealousy and betrayal. Not many films would allow us to enter the emotions of all three main characters, but this film is truly an exception.Rarely do we witness real beauty captured on film. ""The Piano"" is such a visually stunning film, it's almost intoxicating how its atmosphere sweeps across the screen. This landscape is equaled by the performances, bringing understanding and mystery to this wonder. Sometimes symbolism of this nature can be distracting to an audience. ""The Piano"" dares to follow this symbolic path, and hits a bullseye with full emotional force. Rating: Four stars.",,Anonymous,Music
One of very few films,"The Piano is a different film. Unlike many others. It's not a film that you just watch, you must listen. Listen to not only the words, but the music, the tone of the moods, and the movement from Holly Hunter's character. The entire film feels like it is taking place on stage. The setting is made for our enjoyment. Watch the setting closely as you watch the characters in the film adapt to the surroundings. You must watch very carefully, you may miss the message that the film is trying to make. Watch.......and Listen......closely.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The music of the heart,The Piano is an amazing movie- the cinematography stunning- like the piano on the beach and the sinking piano at the end. There is no praise high enough for Holly Hunter's depiction of Ada. Ana Pacquin and Sam O'Neill also shine.  And Harvey Keitel- having gone native- by marking his body in the native style- gives a truly sympathetic and daring performance. This movie stays with the viewer long after it is over.  At times I actually felt the dampness of the scenery... most of all it explores the regions of the heart- through the innovative music and the body language of Hunter.  A film not to be missed by those who appreciate good story and good filmaking.  Thanks Jane Campion for this classic.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
An Uncomfortable Tale...,"There is so much to be said about The Piano, and besides writing a full essay on it, I won't promise that this review will do it justice. Disclaimer: my rating is as it stands simply because the movie was not necessarily my taste, and I don't believe that it aged incredibly well. That being said, I do think this is a film worth seeing, because of the story it tells. I always want to cheer for characters in films, and found it very hard to do so in this situation; the only one I had complete sympathy for was Anna Paquin's character, and even she was a whiny sort of kid. The performances throughout were incredible, but I did find Harvey Keitel to be stiff; perhaps that was intentional.I also felt that this movie glorified a relationship that blossomed under the pretense of blackmail; it had vague traces of Stockholm Syndrome written in it's DNA. Jane Campion is not a filmmaker that wants you to feel comfortable while watching her work, and one must understand that before taking the plunge.Overall, as I said before, this is a movie worth watching. Campions use of the soggy New Zealand forests and beautiful, as well as dangerous, oceans are a testament to her immense talent as a storyteller. She weaves an unforgettable tale with witty dialogue and shocking encounters scattered throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A tiny, mute, 19th century woman speaking huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion...","I must have been misinformed about ""The Piano"". I've always thought it was going to be one of these insufferably long movies that take the words slow and dim-lit as synonyms of deep and profound, these films where you try to convince your mind that it's genius while you have a hard time sitting through five minutes without checking your phone, or maybe I thought it was a sort of pseudo-feminist movie meant to content the elitist tastes and earn a Golden Palm on that biased bass.But what the hell I know? ""The Piano"" is a straightaway romance, full of heat and passion like you rarely see in movies, and where all the players, no pun intended, cut straight to your heart. A few movies make you feel for their protagonists like ""The Piano"" does and I guess it says a lot about the sensitivity of Jane Campion who wrote and directed a magnificent story of souls lost in the middle of nowhere, trying to live in a pretension of civilization among wilderness, only to discover their own wild desires, triumphing over the hypocritical pretension of 'marriage', and with a piano, of all the matchmakers. Who would have thought that a tiny and mute woman from the 19th century would indirectly speak so many huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion.I was going to praise the modernity of the author who wrote the original novel, expecting a figure à la Jane Austen or Eyre, but then I read that it was an original screenplay. What Campion did was to assemble many familiar topics from these literature classics while infusing them into a personal idea of feminist heroism, and it works because Ada is one hell of a creation by Campion and Holly Hunter. This is a woman who had an illegitimate child, a mini-Ada named Flora (Anna Paquin); only in the edge of the world, a man accepted to marry her, an uptight British landowner (if you can call lands these swampy muddy traps) named Stewart (Sam Neill) who emigrated with his Aunt (Kelly Walker) and her dim-witted servants. He recreated a microcosm of England in the midst of New Zealand's bush, he needs to recreate the illusion of marriage.But from the opening start where we see Ada and Flora being carried by the sailors on the beach to the way their frail bodies literally sink into the mud, we have the signal that this is a very awkward setting and things won't turn out as we expect with this kind of material. You have indeed that texture that belongs to period pieces or Ivory/Merchant productions but in a territory where man can hardly set the mark of progress or civilization. You can't just conquer the land easily, and it is fascinating how Ada embodies that notion. This is a woman who chose to be silent at the age of six until it confined to muteness. She revolted against the patriarchal system, her muteness is part of her character and she's got it more than any 'normal' woman Stewart would have married, but he takes her muteness the wrong way and commits the worst mistake by abandoning her only valuable item: the piano, on the beach, because the Maori natives can't carry it.Stewart misunderstood Ada, he thought Flora was the translator of her feelings, but Flora is a free-spirited angel (almost literally) that doesn't need to be everywhere with her mother, but to understand Ada is to listen to her music and understand her love for the piano. Modern visions of love sometimes put 'understanding' far above love and respect, Stewart respected Ada but the one who understood her could win her heart, and the rival was George Baines, played by Harvey Keitel. George is an adventurer with a face marked by Maori tattoos, and when he hears Ada playing piano for the first time, he understands how he can reach her. He sells a land to Stewart in exchange of the piano and courses from Ada. Ada is reluctant until she sees the extent of the bargain, for each course, she'll get a black key symbolically, when the count is down, she takes her piano back.This is the start of some of the most powerful erotic relationships of recent time, one where you can pinpoint the transfer of power between Baines and Ada. It comes to the moment where he raises the price just to be able to touch her neck, and later, when he gives three keys so she can lift her skirt, she's shocked but then suggest five, they settle at four. Both have the power, the piano is just a decoy, an excuse to let them play with their fantasies. It is the credit to a filmmaker who assumes her feminism to have portrayed a relationship where the man has the upper hand only because the woman gives her blessing. She doesn't see herself as a whore, she simply values Baines' fascinatingly awkward ways to reach her. And like Campion said, sometimes a man's extreme masculinity reveals a woman's extreme femininity. ""The Piano"" is about characters who repressed their feelings for too long until a piano would open their eyes and the rest.""The Piano"" is served by a terrific bittersweet score from Michael Nyman, stellar performances from Hunter and Paquin, who won Oscars, as well as Campion for her thought-provoking script, while her directing was intelligent and sensitive, especially with this attention to such details like Flora acting like a child and not being unrealistically smart or the way the Maori were portrayed, on an equal foot with the Whites, and even showing how hard it was for women to get the simplest things done, like going to the bathroom.""The Piano"" is melancholic, captivating, haunting but inspirational because it's about people who simply learn to become honest and 'eloquent' about their feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
the heart asks pleasure first...,"Can someone explain to me why ""The Piano"" ain't in the IMDb top 250 and, for example, movies like ""Sin City"" or ""Crash"" (!!!!!!!!!!) are?????????????

Still, Jane Campion avoids the unfortunately fashionable arrogant and tutorial directors touch (oscar for best movie, Crash?????? where the hell are we??????) and lets the viewer flow on his own in this huge ocean of naked and oh so true feelings and respects the pain and/or the anger (Sam Neil,probably the only role in his carrier that shows his great talent) of her clearly beloved characters.Landscapes,seashores,humid forests,mud,rain: nature, as well as human nature, are captured by Campion's eyes and heart in the most sensitive and unartificial way. And, of course, Michael Nyman's score,which, once heard, becomes a part of you. Yes, definitely, the heart asks pleasure first.

Powerful communication without words.,"""The Piano"", directed by Jane Campion, is a haunting film about love, passion, betrayal and refusal set in the 19th century. Ada (Holly Hunter), sent to New Zealand on an arranged marriage, arrives with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her precious piano on a stormy gray beach. Her husband Stewart (Sam Neill) leaves her beloved piano on the beach after having decided that it is too heavy to transport it inland. He does not recognize what this means to the mute Ada, who expresses her emotions with the ""voice"" of her piano. Baines (Harvey Keitel), who has taken on Maori ways, is deeply moved by Ada and her ""voice"". He gives Stewart a piece of land in exchange for the piano and offers Ada a deal to earn it back.Repulsed by Baines' crude appearance, Ada reluctantly accepts the deal to play the piano in his hut while he does ""things"". Submerged erotic desires and passion slowly set free between the unlikely pair during the piano sessions. Both Baines and Stewart become obsessed by Ada's powerful, intensely suggestive form of unuttered communication. Completely bewildered, Stewart asks Baines if had ever heard Ada speak a single word to him, claiming that he could hear her voice in his mind.The breathtaking, beautiful imagery as well as its stirring music (Michael Nyman) contribute to the romantic, mystifying atmosphere of the film. ""The Piano"" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Oscars for Best Actress (Holly Hunt), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), and Campion's screenplay. Holly Hunter's outstanding performance conveys impressively a woman's ability to express herself without words. ""The Piano"" is one of the best films I have seen so far.",,Anonymous,Music
Highly overrated,"When I saw how many Oscars did it win and how many nominations did it obtain, as well as titles like ""The best female-director's film"", I expected something great. Critic's reviews were highly positive as well. But what did I eventually get? A masterpiece? Definitely no. Speaking of its Oscars, The Piano hardly deserves them. The one for screenplay was won due to weak rivals, among which all of them wouldn't look obvious and were of the same level. I saw only one of them - Philadelphia, and to my mind, it deserves the Oscar for the best original screenplay more than The Piano. The Oscar for Anna Paquin is more or less deserved, though Emma Thompson was great in In the Name of the Father too. Nonetheless, Anna did a great job for a kid. And the last Oscar - the one for the best actress. Though Holly Hunter played well, her performance is a typical role of disabled person, which, along with playing a real person, is one of the cheating ways of winning an Oscar. They just already have someone to repeat after and need less effort to make everything what's needed from them. Playing a usual person, whether it is a book character or the one from original screenplay is tougher, and it's a shame that the Academy doesn't understand it.Speaking of the film itself, it has two main drawbacks: the story and its color solution. I don't know why did they decide to make the colors so cold and unpleasant, but it didn't do any good. And the story is just shallow and pointless. Everyone tells how deep it is and how it reveals all the passion, but I suspect they just want to seem like critics. Brilliant, modern and tragic love stories are A Star Is Born and Atonement, but not this one. These characters just don't look as they need this affair. Ada looks like a whor, as Harvey Keitel's character described her. His character isn't good either. There's no chemistry and real passion, I just don't believe them. Nothing happens between them except for sx. Thus, I don't recommend to waste your time on this movie. Better watch A Star Is Born or Atonement if you haven't seen them yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie for women by a woman,"This movie is a roadmap to most women's hearts. Men take note. I find it funny some reviewers are shocked by Ada's behaviour, as women aren't sexual beings like men. That's just the point. Women are not just wives and usufull partners, they have their wants and needs and its not a trip to the hairdresser or a new dress; or a piano really. We need a Baines in our lives and a happy husband will get this and will feed the inner wildling that most women have in them. Watch this movie with your wife or girlfriend, serve her a lovely drink and then make love to her. This movie is decades old but still up to date. It's beautiful, so well made in every aspect, fantastic actors and just a sensual feast for all the senses. I invite all men to watch it and try to understand it, it will help you to understand the women in your life.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Quite vivid,"Jane Campion is a director of quiet unease. I was not a big admirer of her ""Angel At My Table"", which had enormous possibilities but was suffocated under the filmmaker's penchant for what I refer to as 'ugly beauty'. Even the beautiful passages in this film are undermined by either something ghastly, something about to become ghastly, or something borne from ghastliness. A New Zealand woman in the 1800s becomes a mail-order bride for an uninterested working man; she's a self-elected mute and communicates through her wizened little daughter (Oscar-winner Anna Pacquin, a bit over-the-top) and through her passion for playing the piano, which becomes a point of contention in her marriage. Engrossing human drama with a torrid undercurrent of sexuality and violence. Many people I've talked to about this film could not get with it, but perhaps that's the fault of watching movies at home. In the theater, this was a slightly-dazed, rapturous and enveloping brew that held me spellbound until the lights went up. Movies like this don't hold the same spell when butchered up by ads for the CBS comedies. Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and, most especially, Harvey Keitel all do terrific work. Hunter deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Well.....nice photography...,"OK....critics seem to have loved this.  It's a fascinating story, beautifully photographed, but directed with all of the subtlety of a small blowtorch.The characters are fascinating, but we are left searching for something to connect the heavy-handed symbolism with the story.  This film has it all, erotism, music, unrequited love, jealousy, bitterness, sadness.....and a totally selfish 'heroine' with a bratty daughter to match.Sam Neill beautifully plays the long-suffering 'husband' of the new bride. She loves everything he can provide, and gives him nothing, not even civility, in return.  She does, however, fall in love with the neighbor (after being carefully manipulated by the delightfully dark character of Harvey Keitel).The problem is: when it all comes to a head, we are asked to believe that the husband, who has never shown ANYTHING other than a kind, gentle and patient side, instantly rebels with an act of unspeakable and unconscionable violence against the wife.  The action was inconsistent with the character, the situation, and ultimately came off as little more than heavy handed propagandizing about the ultimate evil of men.Gave it a 6, as I was feeling generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A glorification of passiveness and weakness,"With Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel, I was expecting to see one of the best movies ever. Each of them, alone, are reasons to see a movie, as they are amazing actors, usually involved with interesting if not thrilling films.This was not the case.The lead Character, Ada, is an annoying, weak creature, with almost no will of her own. Her life is left adrift to the wind, like a feather carried away. She stopped speaking, she had a child, now she is force-wed to a rich man, and none of these was her own choice. Throughout the film, almost nothing she does is her own choice. She can't speak, because she has nothing to say. She is an empty vessel, that happens to be a very good piano player, but by no means she could ever be considered an artist. There is nothing artistic in her lack of personality, her lack of character and her lack of strength. Art is all about the opposite, a triumph of will, expression and attitude, over the meaninglessness of human existence. The only thing that Ada shows is denial and refusal. She wouldn't even give in to Harvey Keitel's desire, but not because she doesn't want to. ""Want"" is an unknown word for her. That is, because all she can do is deny. She is driven to him by instinct, not by conscious decision. She is a weak, pathetic human being, that also stands against all values of female empowerment, and not only should she have drowned with her piano, but not have existed in the first place. Such characters are a disgrace for the human race, and only can be used as stepping stones for the forces of tyranny. On top of all that, she is accompanied by her even-more annoying, obnoxious daughter (although, a great performance by Anna Pacquin).Sam Neill's character makes no sense also. His attitude towards life is equally a submission to the slavery of non-free will. He marries a woman he doesn't know, and believes he is gonna love her, and she will love him back, and even though these could've been customs of those times - this suggestion doesn't make sense, even by neolithic standards. We are humans, and deep inside we all know what love is, no matter what social standards and fads of a certain era may try to force into us.So we're left with our ""hero"" being George Baines, a potential rapist. If I was a woman I'd be even more angry with this sexist, sentimental piece of garbage that tries to glorify victims, weakness and passiveness.Don't fall far this movie. We've grown out of this stuff as a species.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A Piano's Tale,"Jane Campion's 'The Piano' is a beautiful, poetic, sensual and intense story set in New Zealand. Campion has an eye for visuals and not only does New Zealand look haunting and captivating but attention to detail is given in almost every frame. It is a subtle film, not only because of the actors' performances but also the use of sound. With the exception of the piano tracks there is hardly any background music. All the piano tracks are mesmerizing (the soundtrack is a keeper). The love scenes are also wonderfully handled, with a sense of delicacy and art. The cinematography gives life to the quiet landscape. Holly Hunter delivers a riveting performance that is subtle and haunting (and she's hot too). She has already proved be a master in acting and 'The Piano' only supports that. Here she beautifully displays the slow transformation of facial expressions contrasting with the rapid gestures of her fingers. Harvey Keitel is just as terrific. Sam Neill and Anna Paquin are too of note. 'The Piano' is also like a tense mystery. It's haunting and mesmerizing effect has a strong cinematic impact.

She and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) are brought over to New Zealand to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). She communicates with Flora with sign language. Her piano is her prize possession and her voice. However Alisdair deems it too heavy to carry and leaves it on the beach. Then Alisdair sells the piano to his illiterate neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel). George proposes to sell it back to her with one visit for every piano key and she counters with just the black keys.This is romance novel melodrama from director Jane Campion and it is epic. Everything works including the epic landscape. The pounding waves, the lush forest and the isolation becomes part of the story. It is filmed beautifully. The performances are great. Anna Paquin is precocious. Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel are not the natural romantic pair but there is something touching about that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great parts to a fair film.,"This film has some great things about it. Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Sam Neill, and Harvey Keitel are in top form. Director Jane Campion does a remarkable job. The cinematography catches the beauty of New Zealand perfectly. The problem lies in the script. It is slow moving, plodding, and rather predictable. And within its tight confines, the characters don't get a chance to grow. All in all, this film has some interesting and intriguing parts, but the whole is not as good as the parts. 6 of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Clever film that makes you wonder...,"I have seen the movie twice. I liked it the first time because it was refreshingly different, restrained in some parts, erotic to an extent, with some brilliant camerawork of Stuart Drybergh and choreography (beach scene with Holly Hunter, Keitel and Paquin, with the overhead shot and the imaginative designs of footprints in the sand).My second viewing had me reassessing if a viewer can be led to like a film without thinking rationally. Take the example of Paquin carrying the piano key with the written message. She takes one path, retraces it and takes another. This crucial action changes the course of the film. Why did she make that choice? Coincidence? If it was deliberate, the relationship between the child and foster father is not adequately developed. The director persuades us to notice this decision with a high angle shot. We in the audience know that Kietel's character is illiterate--but the message is finally read by someone who could read. And so the story gathers momentum.The ""quiet"" strength of the film is in the character who chooses to remain mute. A finger is chopped off but there is no howl of pain, only blood, only a resignation to fate.Despite a great performance by Hunter and impressive direction by Campion, I begin to have a nagging doubt if the audience is meant to leave their mind behind and merely indulge their senses, what they see and hear...On second viewing, the script seems more manipulative rather than virtuous. In the epilogue, what are we to make of the metal prosthetic finger--that all is healed? Or was it a convenient way to end the film?",7.0,Anonymous,Music

20:20 hindsight,"Almost 10 years after this  critically lauded and popular flick garnered its brace of awards, the votes are in and one can safely assume the always peculiar Campion finally managed to break through and help put Aussie cinema on the map. A bleak, austere, harsh, and very tedious drama which is so lean as to make the salients of love, jealousy, recrimination, guilt, anguish, etc. stand out in bold relief, ""The Piano"" has done better with cinema buffs and film fanatics than the general public. Today is remains a must see for anyone into deep film while the masses may pass it over as it makes the rounds on broadcast.

Decent film!,"This is a decent films. It combines masterful scripting, cinematography, performances, and musical score into a disturbing, erotic, and ultimately uplifting piece. The movie's heroine, wonderfully portrayed by Holly Hunter, is mute (symbolic of the fact that she has no say in her own life), with her daughter (the astonishing Anna Paquin) and her piano as her personal obsessions. Her conscripted husband, coldly played by Sam Neill, is trying to win her heart and her desire in all the wrong ways, while his crude tribal neighbor, sensually played by Harvey Keitel, understands her needs and ultimately captures her ... physically, intellectually, and romantically. The film's message and its delivery are extraordinarily powerful, the cinematic technique is rich ... the sequence shot with Hunt, Pacquin, Keitel and the piano on the beach is one of the best pieces of work I've ever seen.

Unusual and powerful,"The Piano (1993) was written and directed by Dame Jane Campion. It stars Holly Hunter as Ada McGrath, a woman who is mute. She arrives in New Zealand from Scotland, with her ten-year-old daughter, as a mail-order bride. Anna Paquin plays her daughter, Flora. Her husband, Alisdair Stewart, is portrayed by Sam Neill. Harvey Keitel is their neighbor.It's hard to say much about the plot without revealing it, so I'll focus on other aspects of the movie. Just for the record, don't watch the trailer if you intend to see the film. The trailer tells too much about the plot.Dame Jane Campion is a brilliant director, and Holly Hunter is perfect as a strong Victorian woman .Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill are both gifted actors, who give us solid performances.However, Anna Paquin, a (then) amateur actor, steals the show as her mother's interpreter and companion. Paquin--at age 10--won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.This isn't a film for the squeamish or the faint of heart. (Or for people who are offended by nudity.) We saw it on DVD. It would work better in a theater--some of the scenic shots are breathtaking. The Piano has a very strong 7.6 IMDb rating. (Even the top 1,000 raters--who never like any movie--gave it a 7.1.) I think it deserves that rating and more.P.S. Holly Hunter plays the piano herself in the film. It's hard to believe that it wasn't dubbed, because her playing is extraordinary.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Timeless Masterpiece,"Sometimes is hard to express with words the power and influence a film can have over you years after you watched it for the first time. In counted and rare occasions a masterpiece the size of The Piano is born: the original soundtrack composed by Michael Nyman transport you to a different Universe, Holly Hunter's brilliant performance of Ada and Anna Paquin's mature performance of her daughter, which led both of them to win an Oscar for their respective roles in the film, the cinematography and visual beauty literally immerses you in the muddy and dirty environment in New Zeland in the mid-19th century and the brilliant script which narrates one of the saddest and most wonderful stories ever told. Every single detail about the film is genius and Ada's magic will live forever.I still remember the first time I watched The Piano, I was still a kid in the 90s and it was aired on television. I was so absolutely hypnotized by the whole story and specially by the character of Ada, that I had to record it on a VHS video tape because I had to go to bed early to go to school the next morning, so I couldn't finish watching it that night. The next day I couldn't stop thinking about the film and how it would end while I was in class, so when I got back home, I ran directly to see the recording from the VHS tape. I lost count of how many times I have watched this classic masterpiece since then, thanks Jane Campion for this timeless piece of art from the bottom of my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fiercely poetic and well played film with evocative cinematography and a fine musical score.,"In the mid-19th century a mute woman called Ada (Holly Hunter) is sent to New Zealand along with her young daughter (Anna Paquin) and a prized piano for an arranged marriage to a farmer (Sam Neill) , but is soon lusted after by a farm worker (Harvey Keitel). Her husband will refuse to take the beloved piano up from the beach that Ada brought from Scotland, but a neighbor will rescue him and let him use it if he accepts a shady pact. The way she expresses her feelings is by playing her cherished piano, left behind on the beach. Neill proves a cold husband who can't bring himself to touch his wife, while Keitel can't wait to get his hands on her, ex-acting progressive sexual favors in return for her earning back the piano key by key. Soon the duo starts a grand passion leading to a cruelly calculated vengeance.'The Piano' is an unforgettable classic of independent cinema in which a widowed and mute woman arrives in New Zealand with her daughter for an arranged marriage. An unusual drama with some erotic touches , sexually direct with very explicit scenes, and striking visual moments, but rather too little story and dramatic movement. All this is pretty bizarre and only marginally convincing. After a slow beginning, the movie picks up and unreels like a silent drama, producing some colorful images from cameraman Stuart Dryburgh toward the final when the murky Eastman photography process works permits. It's a decent picture, though may be too dark and intense for some. At the time, the film was a critical and public success, winning 3 Oscars: Best Actress for Holly Hunter, who played the piano herself in most of the scenes, Academy Award-winning Hunter is marvellously expressive; best supporting actress for Anna Paquin, which made her one of the youngest actresses in history to win an Oscar, and and also received an Academy Award, the best original script for the director herself. In addition, with El Piano Campion became the first woman to receive the Palme de Gold in Cannes Festival.The powerful cast is one of the film's strong points, starting with the Oscar winners Holly Hunter (Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice ) as the strong-willed but mute Scottish widow; Anna Paquin (True Blood) as her stubborn daughter; following Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs) in a notably romantic character as the construction manager who has gone native and Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) as the nasty landowner. Also very notable is the moving, sensitive soundtrack, composed by Michael Nyman.The motion picture was well directed by Jane Campion. She became the second woman to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, with ¨The piano¨ (1993). The first being Lina Wertmüller for ¨Pascualino Seven Beauties¨ (1975). Campion would later become the first woman to be nominated for Best Director twice, with ¨The power of the Dog¨ (2021). Has directed seven actors in Oscar nominated performances: Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Barbara Hershey, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons. Campion has made films of important artistic value and high quality, obtaining some boxoffice successes and failures too, such as: ¨In the Cut¨, ¨Bright Star¨, ¨The Portrait of a Lady¨, ¨Holy Smoke¨, ¨Sweetie¨,¨ An Angel at My Table¨, among others. ¨The piano¨, rating: 6.5/10. Well worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
love for the piano and her man,"For some reason I never saw this but I knew it was loved and had won awards for Jane Campion and others. Watching it now I realise how unusual the film is. The nineteenth century in New Zealand and out in the bush with Holly Hunter played as a mute and her child as the ten year old Anna Paquin and Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel. Especially with Keitel was a surprise after his Reservoir Dogs, and Bad Lieutenant both in 1992, the previous year. The sea, the beach and the forest are very well covered by the cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh and the reason that the beloved piano has to be least for a time out in the elements as it is so difficult to carry. Of course we are aware that it has to be brought back and Keitel helps but exacts his price. The child assists her mother by translating her words for her who gradually falls in love with Keitel which is a problem with her arranged marriage husband and her love for the piano and her man.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the Best Films of 1993,"A lot of audiences didn't quite know what to make of ""The Piano"" upon its initial release, which I think is a testament to its originality. I really hadn't seen anything quite like this movie and was riveted on my first go around with it.Jane Campion wrote and directed this story about a mute woman arranged to marry a landowner (Sam Neill) in 19th Century New Zealand. She has two loves: her young daughter (played by Anna Paquin) and her piano. She's drawn to a frightening but magnetic worker on the plantation (Harvey Keitel) and begins a torrid affair with him. Things come to a boil when she's found out by her husband.The film is intensely erotic without being gratuitous. The characters are fascinating, and the acting is uniformly stellar. Holly Hunter gives a brave and fierce performance. Not brave because she allows herself to be filmed nude frequently or because she recreates quite graphic sex acts; but rather brave because she allows her character to be complicated and difficult and perhaps to some even unlikable. She never asks for our sympathy, but she does ask for our understanding. Neill and Keitel offer able support, and child actor Paquin amazes and delivers a quite un-childlike performance.Top the whole thing off with vivid cinematography and a lush score from Michael Nyman and you have one of the best films to emerge from 1993.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A brilliantly filmed and performed love story that's a bit different- 86%,"Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists.Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything.You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like ""Training Day"" and ""Monster's Ball"" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in ""The Piano"" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself.It might not be everyone's cup of tea but ""The Piano"" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, ""The Piano"" is just such a film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Kudos to Campion,"In the mid-nineteenth century, in a community in a New Zealand forest, a mute pianist from Scotland (Holly Hunter) and her young daughter (Anna Paquin) live with a settler (Sam Neill) as per an arranged marriage. A nearby neighbour (Harvey Keitel) has his sights on the pianist.Director Jane Campion (also the screenwriter) has created a movie experience that is sensual from beginning to end. She gets to the heart of nature in every scene even making the viewer experience rare feelings. The opening scene of an arrival at a beach is beautiful and provocative; the sight of the giant waves is stunning but also a dangerous and uncontrollable part of nature that acts as a preview of what's to happen with the characters of the story. The sex scenes are also very unique in that they express a passion and warmth that is rare in films of its era as well as those that have followed; particularly in moments where a facial expression shows genuine pleasure from the sense of being touched.Campion gets great work from her actors. Keitel and Neill show a sensuous side that might only be encouraged by a director with a feminine perspective. Paquin gives one of the best child performances in cinema. And Hunter's performance is truly amazing. Her facial and body language say so much. In a shocking, climactic scene, her quiet breakdown rips the heart out. Her character is someone who might seem demanding and annoying at first but it is clear later on that she is one of those souls who seems more attuned to the spirit world than to the mundane details of the physical world.The story may have flaws (as others have pointed out) but it is how it is expressed that makes it stand out. Here, Campion is greatly aided by cinematorgrapher Stuart Dryburgh and the music by Michael Nyman.

Hauntingly beautiful...,"This film is an absolute masterpiece... The cast are superb (no individual dominates, although it must be said Anna Paquin delivers an incredible performance as the playful child desperate for her mothers attention), the narrative captivates and the cinematography is breath-taking - the image of a grand piano against the cliffs of New Zealand is stunning. However, I believe the music contributes most to the film - the symphony used throughout seems to reflect the pain, passion, and urgency all the characters experience.A mention must be given to the sequence in which George reluctantly takes Ada and Flora to the piano. The fact that Ada smiles for the first time in the film conveys her love for her piano and music. Along with the symphony, the image of Flora dancing in the waves and George's face as he gazes at Ada, this scene is hauntingly beautiful.

Wildly over rated,"It looks great, it sounds great, especially the scenes on the beach.  Holly Hunter's acting cannot be faulted. Critics and the public loved it, yet it failed to impress me.

What were those accents? Both wandered from Irish to New Zealand to whatever.The characters are inconsistent - The Anna Paquin character claims she loves her mother but not five minutes later rats her out.  The Sam Neil character attacks Hunter in a fit of rage yet later is the calmest man on the planet. The Holly Hunter character decides to kill herself but a minute later changes her mind.

Mail order bride of the older times.,"In ""The Piano"",Jane Campion has directed some of the best actors working in Hollywood.Imagine a film about music with versatile actors like Harvey Keitel,Holly Hunter,Sam Neil and Anna Paquin.The Piano is a nice musical which speaks through a woman's heart.There is a strong element of evidence that this film succeeds as it has a thin layer of mystery wrapped around its basic plot.The character of mute woman Ada played by Holly Hunter takes her time to make friends with Maori people around her.The strong mother daughter bond also helps the film to move ahead as Ada's daughter Flora,a role nicely played by Anna Paquin,is always there to help her mother.Jane Campion has also portrayed the stern nature of men as both men in Ada's life inflict cruelty on her.The Piano shares certain layers of similarity with ""The Scarlet Letter"" directed by Wim Wenders.In both the films there is a common element of weak women being punished in olden times.It is a good relief that thankfully in our contemporary world we are not living in such outdated times.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
art house trash,"I'm sorry I sat through this awful movie.  The situation is asinine:  Ada, Holly Hunter's character, is a voluntary mute who chooses not to speak. Ever (Care to try that for a month?  A day?).  Not when her finger gets chopped off.  Not when she finally responds to Harvey Keitel's sexual advances. She's the mail order bride to Stewart (Sam Neil), who actually turns out to be a very decent and understanding guy.  But no matter; he's made to fit the formula:  stuffy, uptight Victorian Englishman versus sensuous, sexual native Harvey Keitel.  This is stereotyping of the worst sort; some might call it racist (but this is a feminist film, and feminists CAN'T be racists, can they?) I found myself much more sympathetic with Stewart, as did my wife. And as for child actress Anna Paquin:  hard to believe that this insufferable, puling brat won an Oscar for this thing!  My main reaction to her performance was that I kept wanting to smack her (oops!  How abusive of me!) Oh, yeah, the 'music' Hunter's character plays on her beloved piano: new age minimalist dreck.  You'd think a little Chopin would perhaps be a bit more in keeping with the period in which the action is set.

Sleepy and brilliant.,"There is a scene in The Piano where three women are walking through the woods discussing the bizarre behavior of Ada (Holly Hunter), and her incessant piano playing. Just as I was getting a little irritated that Director Jane Campion would have the sound effect of the woman peeing, a decidedly distasteful sound, the woman peeing says about Ada's piano playing, ""To have a sound creep inside you is not at all pleasant."" And I realize that Campion is thoroughly in charge of every sight and sound in the film, from beginning to end.It's a slow, moody drama, to be sure, and this is probably why it took me so long to get around to watching it again. I remember seeing it with my parents when I was a kid, but I found it to be so boring that I asked if I could go into another auditorium and watch a different movie. I know now why they said yes.Holly Hunter inhabits the silent role of Ada, a mute woman who enters into an arranged, loveless marriage in 1850s New Zealand, incidentally the place where Anna Paquin, who gave the most stunning performance in this movie, grew up. Campion's New Zealand feels like a small, isolated island surrounded by a cold, dreary sea, and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh relishes the opportunities he has for cold, warm, and emotional lighting, literally painting the movie in cold or brilliant colors for us, and the results are fantastic.San Neill and Harvey Keitel play opposing roles, Neill as Alisdair Stewart, Ada's arranged husband who hopes that they will grow to love each other, and Keitel as George Baines, a man with Maori symbols tattooed on his face and who has a relationship with Ada that achieves astonishing change throughout the film. But it is Anna Paquin who steals the show entirely. Her performance is so brilliant and so unexpected that many times I forgot about the rest of the film and just tried to figure out how Jane Campion got that performance out of her. It is one of the best child performances in film history.Incidentally, I had some bizarre Sam Neill coincidences today. First I watched a terrible time travel film this afternoon called A Sound of Thunder, and one of the threads on the IMDb message boards for that movie asked what people's favorite time travel movies were, and many people mentioned The Final Conflict, which stars Sam Neill. Then while I was watching The Piano, out of nowhere I started humming to myself this old Rob Zombie song called Demon Speeding, where the chorus goes like this, ""In the mouth of madness, down in the darkness, no more tomorrow, down in the hollow..."" And I thought, ""Hey, In the Mouth of Madness, I haven't even thought about that movie since high school!"" And then I looked it up on the IMDb and sure enough, Sam Neill stars in it.Sorry, I just thought I'd mention that. But more importantly, The Piano is a stunning accomplishment, another complex and engaging film from Jane Campion, who I don't think has made anything much less in her career.

Deep Passionate Love and the Piano,"This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person.Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end.It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track.Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love.There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring.Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father.For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I Want To Visit New Zealand,"SYNOPSIS: A mute woman and her daughter become the mail order bride for a white settler in turn of the century New Zealand. The woman can only speak through her daughter or by playing her piano.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER Communication. How we express ourselves to others, the true nature of love, and perils that we must go through to find true happiness.PROS AND CONS I would consider this a ""women's"" film. It deals with a woman's search for love and understanding in a harsh land. The central focus is on Holly Hunter who portrays Ada McGarth. She gives a very good performance considering that she does not speak a word in the entire film. She also plays all the musical pieces on the piano. Good enough in fact to win her the Academy Award for best actress.The film is written and directed by Jane Campion who is somewhat of an icon in Australian and New Zealand film making. She specializes in these types of films, which have stunning scenery and intimate character studies. During this viewing of the film I was surprised at what a rather simple and straight forward story it is. The film is more visual than anything else, which is not surprising, since the main character never speaks. But Campion pushes this even furhter, giving turn of the century New Zealand a beautiful, almost surreal quality.Anna Paquin portrays Flora McGrath in the film and won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress as Ada's daughter. This is somewhat puzzling, since she isn't really all that prominent on screen and her acting scenes are nothing more than what the average little girl of 12 would do anywhere else. There are also large gaps in the development of Sam Neil's character, Alisdair Stewart, ( who portrays the mail order husband). He appears frustrated and impotent in the film, but his mindset and issues are never really flushed. out. He is spurned by Ada only because he appears to not see the value in her piano. But he does try and never gives Ada a reason to dislike him.This film is graphic at times and there are scenes that come very close to bordering on the explicit. There is also violence but this is more for effect as opposed to simply showing gore and blood.More than anything else, this film makes me admire the acting abilities of Holly Hunter and also makes me want to visit New Zealand. It also makes me realize that any woman that has to have a piano hauled everywhere she goes is not the sort of woman that would make a good long term relationship.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The rough process of colonisation,"New Zealander director Jane Campion is a renounced visualist as a director but many of her films do not connect with audiences. Her IMDb ratings struggle to get up to a 7.0/10 and whilst she does please critics, audiences find her films uninteresting. But her period drama The Piano is the exception, wining three Oscars, having a 7.5/10 on IMDb, 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and working as an art film.1850s a mute Scotswoman, Ada (Holly Hunter) who is arranged to marry a man she has never met, Alistair (Sam Neill), a man who lives on the frontier of New Zealand. Ada, her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her prized piano move to the forests of South Island in New Zealand. But when Alistair refuses to move the piano his remote home, Ada takes an instant dislike to the shy man. Alistair's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) offers a solution, he buys the piano and ask Ada to teach him to play. But Baines only wants Ada around for sexual arousal and the sexual tension starts to grow.Campion is a certainly bring a rough edge to The Piano and it felt like the period. This remote outpost really felt like the edge of civilisation. You can easily feel the mud, the rain, the wind and the harsh environment and that it was a tough place to survive. This is not a romantic view of the New Zealand landscape like other director but show what would have been like for settlers in a land that has yet to be developed. This bleak and nature visual is enhanced by the art direction and Stuart Dryburgh slightly dark and dim cinematography.Thematically there is a one big ideas is a clash of cultures. Obviously there the clash between British settlers and Maoris, but also between Ada moving from upper class luxury in Scotland to a small colonial outpost with her daughter and that Baines is a rough, tough and a uncultured man. There is a also a big theme of sexual repression, from Alistair to being a man who seems very shy, looking for love and Baines unable to express himself so starts off being a very creepy. There is also idea that love can not grow or be forced, but a spontaneous thing, something that happens from an act of passion.The acting is excellent throughout. From Holly Hunter in a very difficult role as a mute character, so has to express herself through her body language and her face. Neill and Keitel were great male leads, Neill being the man of civilisation and more traditional fellow and Keitel as a more rustic man of the wilderness and looking for an outlet for his sexual desires. Accompanied with the direction Baines comes off as a creepy character, particularly during a scene when he makes Ada lift up her skirt as she plays the piano and gets pleasure from touching a hole in her clothes. Paquin showed that she was a very good child actress, giving a confidence performance as a young acting older then she is but still acts childish at times. And she also gave an excellent Scottish accent.Michael Nyman supplies an excellent simple piano based that fitted the film.At times The Piano is a little slow at times and about ten minutes could have cut. But overall it is a very interesting film that will supply some food for through 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Beautiful and Stoic,"The Piano a 1993 award-winning film was written and directed by Jane Campion and starred Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin. The film tells an intriguing story of a mute woman who, along with her eight-year-old daughter, are shipped by her father to New Zealand to marry a man whom she never met. The story begins with Ada, Flora and Ada's piano landing on a beach having been rowed there to meet her soon-to-be husband. He (Alistair Stewart played by Sam Neill) greets them rather blandly and comments about Ada's small size as if she couldn't hear him. Along with local natives he decided the piano was too difficult to transport so they left it on the beach. The piano was beloved by Ada because she expressed herself through it. Later Alistair decided to trade it for some land owned by George Baines (Keitel). George seemed to understand how important the piano was to Ada so he strikes a deal with her that she can earn it back by giving him piano lessons. He had no intention of learning to play the piano but more interested in Ada herself. Ada made numerous trips to George's meager hut to play the piano, but a romantic relationship ensues. Alistair eventually finds out about the affair and in retaliation chopped off one of Ada's index fingers. At last Alistair dissolves the marriage. The ending contains a bit of a surprise.The extraordinary will of a disabled woman to overcome hardship describes the theme of this film. We see it first as she arrives on the beach after an extremely rough voyage to meet her husband and having been fondled by a bunch of nasty sailors. We also witness her incredible will to get back her piano, her will to maintain her stoicism when her finger was amputated, and her will to live when she accidentally was pulled into the ocean when she finally sacrificed her piano to the sea. We see it again later after George crafted a silver prosthesis for her finger as she taught piano lessons. This film in many ways parallels The Miracle Worker, the story of Helen Keller and her stubbornness and extraordinary will to thrive.The subjective angles of the close-up facial shots in The Piano play a huge role in capturing the theme. Ada so many times expresses herself through her lack of verbal communication simply with her eyes. One can tell her inner-thoughts just by reading the close-ups of her face and interpreting her stoic, Victorian expressions. They are used during the most dramatic moments – as her finger was being amputated and as she fell into the sea, just to name a few.Was this my most favorite movie of all time? Probably not, however from living first-hand with a person with a disability, I marvel every day at the incredible will that disabled persons muster just to be ""normal"" and overcome adversity. This film was a display of just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A girlie romance (that I don't really like), but outstanding","I'm going to do something that I don't usually do and give a ""thumbs up"" to 1993's ""The Piano"" even though I don't particularly like major aspects of the story. Why? Because everything else about the film is exceptional on every level -- the beautiful dense forest cinematography of New Zealand's North Island, the realism of the Maori and the 1850's colony, the beautiful piano score, the great acting, etc.THE PLOT: A mute Scottish woman, Ada (Holly Hunter), and her daughter (Anna Paquin) go to a New Zealand plantation to meet her husband, Stewart (Sam Neill), an arranged marriage. Ada is slowly seduced by a gruff worker on the plantation, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), as she gives him piano lessons.The story is Exhibit A on why arranged marriages aren't a good idea. After all, how can you be ""one flesh"" with someone for the rest of your life if you don't even like him/her or find him/her attractive? This is an adult historical drama with inoffensive, but overt nudity and adult themes, like control, sexual repression, sexual growth and the search for true love. Even though this is a girlie romance movie and I find elements of the drama dreadfully boring -- like Stewart's final confrontation with Baines (where you can barely make out the dialogue) -- the film makes up for it in every other department. It's in the realm of overall atmosphere -- the realistic, awesome, beautiful and harsh ambiance of 1850's New Zealand -- that the movie shines.The film was shot on location in New Zealand and runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Is there something I'm not getting?,"A vaguely pornographic account of a love triangle between three completely repellent people. The woman hasn't spoken in years, but is absolutely obsessed with her piano, seeming to care more about it than about any living person. Her emotions are expressed in either childish outbursts or soft caresses, depending on what point the filmmakers want to make. The husband himself is clearly SUPPOSED to be repellent. We know this because he combs his hair, because he doesn't hold much stock in Aboriginal superstition, and because . . . well, I don't know, just because the movie needs an annoying white guy so it can argue that it's bad to discriminate against people. The love interest, meanwhile, is downright creepy, lying under the piano and looking up the woman's skirt, but he's apparently supposed to be cool and dashing. And don't get me started on the Aborigines, at once held up as trophies of natural living and made ""exotic"" in a manner that mostly involves making them seem stupid. I confess I cannot figure out what anyone could have liked about this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful visuals, Anna Paquin and Holly Hunter are incredible to watch","This has to be one of Jane Campion's best work. I dont believe any of her recent work has come even close to the beauty and sensuality depicted in this film.From the lush backdrop of New Zealand, to the beautiful music, this movie is visually stunning from its opening scenes, right down to its final scenes, and it is a treat to experience. It tells the tale of a mute mother, with a talent and passion for her beloved piano, who along with her daughter are shipped off to New Zealand to be wed to a man she has never met.

Incredibly beautiful and evocative film about desire and desperation,"The music sounds like serious business, quite dark and melancholic. I was very impressed that Holly Hunter was actually playing the piano. It gives the movie an authentic and genuine feel. The cinematography is sublime. I love the way they choose to shoot things, it's very creative and elegant. The attention to detail is exquisite. The film locations are incredibly gorgeous. Loved the shot at the beginning where the men are carrying the women onto shore and the waves are violently crashing behind them. The wide shot of the mountains was breathtaking. This movie almost has like a mystic quality to it, especially with all the mist. The colors in this movie are so beautifully rich. It's also beautifully rich in texture as well. All the intricate time-piece clothing, all the mud, nature and mist.Holly Hunter gives a phenomenal performance. She's so vocal and expressive yet doesn't utter a single word. Anna Paquin is great as well. Even though she's just a kid, she gives a fantastic performance. The scene where George takes Ada back to the piano on the beach and she starts playing, I started to tear up. There's so much emotion in her playing. It's her way of expressing herself and maybe even connecting with her ex-lover. Almost like she's reaching out to him, paying homage and expressing her love and longing she has for him. I wasn't expecting to be so moved by this movie but holy crap did it stir up the emotions.It seems like Alisdair and his group of British friends are supposed to represent the colonizers that existed back in the days. That was way too extreme what Alisdair did to Ada, I was not expecting that at all. Quite shocking really. He showed his true colors and they are that of an extremely jealous psychotic controlling creep. Unfortunately Baines didn't really give Ada the time or day and chose to focus on his business and obtaining more land. He also messed up by not really warming up to her and showing that he cared about her - beginning with the piano. He was kind of a stiff. But at the same time I kind of felt bad for him, he came off as kind of a weak person that didn't know how to express himself.The movie is so tightly written and beautifully told that it goes by in the blink of an eye. There's not a single scene or time wasted. The pacing does feel odd at times, but the movie goes by really quick. It's quite a unique, captivating and peculiar movie. It shows both the pretty and ugly side of human desire and desperation. There's a real rawness, authenticity and sincerity to this movie that puts it in a league of its own. The movie definitely left a lasting impression on me and I'll definitely be watching it again in the future. Highly highly recommended. Raw score: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The piano - One note is worth a thousand words,"Possibly Jane Campion's most acclaimed work, ""The Piano"" is a film that explores plenty of themes. The role of women in 19th century society, prejudice and the value of family are some of them. The most important one, though, is the power of music, expressed through a piano.During the 19th century, a mute woman, Ada, (Holly Hunter) is arranged to be married to Stewart, a farmer (Sam Neill) and sets off for New Zealand with her precocious daughter (Anna Paquin). That daughter is her only means of communicating with the outside world, since he can't speak. Her other way to show her feeling is her piano. She plays it all the time, no matter how she feels, with it she demonstrates her happiness and anger, and above all, her sadness. For, her man shows no love to her, and sells her beloved piano to a neighbour, George (Harvey Keitel). Hope comes when George tells Ada that she can get her instrument back if she gives him piano lessons. At first, their relationship is strained. But Ada finds in him a person with compassion, and real feelings, different from the cold, distant members of Stuart's family. And this will create so much tension, that Ada's piano will become something forbidden for her . The piano is her life, and, if she can't play it, she will die.""The piano"" is a film where language plays no role. Sure, the other characters speak, but Ada, with her gestures and facial expressions, communicates more feelings. The others are restrained from the stereotypes and the norms of a society, in which men are the protectors of the house and women their caretakers. Most of what they say in words is surrounded by a veil of lies, with the men never losing their toughness and the women their elegance and good manners. Ada, on the other hand, has nothing to hide. Because of her impediment, she is treated differently, with a mix of compassion and suspicion. While all other have to play a role all the time, she only needs to do so when Stuart is present, and then she can play the piano, showing how she really feels with no one understanding.The piano is an extension of herself. And its music, composed by Michael Nyman, is her language. Changing with Ada's mood, it culminates when she's exasperated and then silences again. When she knows that she can't do anything to get out of this situation. Her piano is a shelter from a world hostile to her, due to a condition of which the cause is more tragic than one can imagine.The antidote to Ada's depression is her daughter, Flora. With her joy and smartness, she can shed a light of joy to Ada's life. She is her only company, and, as she is her interpreter, the one that can communicate her intricate state of feeling to the outside world. Anna Paquin, with her vivacity, made Flora the most lovable character in the film, a multifaceted person in a house where everyone is either black or white. Either a tragic character, or an oppressing one. Either calm and speechless, or intense, shouting to show their anger.And in all that, the piano, a symbol of Ada's psychic state, her soul, her means of expression. Something that will face threats of destruction, but will also stay untouched in periods of harmony. A piano that, through its black and white keys, will turn out to be the mirror of Ada's soul, from the start of her life in New Zealand, to their common death.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A really nice and different movie...,"""The Piano"" is a movie which has to do with a mute woman with her young daughter who are sent to New Zealand for an arranged marriage with a wealthy landowner but she fell in love with a local worker on the plantation. Before that, the only love for her were her piano and her daughter.I really liked this movie because I have never seen a movie such this one and I found it really nice. I also liked it because of the storyline, the plot and the interpretations of the cast. Holly Hunter who plays as Ada McGrath made a really great interpretation (won the Oscar of Best Actress in a Leading Role), Harvey Keitel made an also great interpretation and Sam Neill too.Finally I have to say that ""The Piano"" shows us the true love between a woman and her piano, and between a woman and a man.

The Score by Michael Nyman never fails to bring me back,"Beautiful score and screenplay, the colours, rain, powerful scenes in mud and without speaking. Not overrated at all. A must see. I was probably in my 20's when I saw this the first time and now, almost two decades later, I still love the storyline and Michael Nyman's score for this movie is phenomenal.A gothic melodrama and an unapologetically feminine narrative, The Piano, has endured time quite well. Released in the summer of 1993, earned writer and director Jane Campion the prestigious honor being the first female director to win the Palme d'Ore at the Cannes Film festival. 30 years later, The Piano remains one of Campion's most recognizable and beloved films, revered for its performances.While The Piano focuses mainly on Ada and her journey, the film also explores the detrimental effects of colonialism on the environment and its indigenous people, although Campion's depiction of the Maori has been criticized for playing into racist stereotypes. However like I said, it has endured time quite well.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The Piano's somber tone,"The Piano is a film that truly stands out in terms of its performance, cinematography, and thematic depth. From my perspective, the acting is exceptional, with each character bringing a profound sense of realism to their roles. The cinematography is beautifully crafted, capturing the stark beauty of the setting and enhancing the film's emotional impact. The themes explored are rich and thought-provoking, offering a deep commentary on human relationships and personal freedom.However, the film's bleak and somber tone can be quite overwhelming at times. The slow pacing requires a great deal of patience, which may not be to everyone's taste. While the slow burn allows for deep character development and a more immersive experience, it can also make the film feel sluggish and drawn-out.All in all, The Piano is a film with impressive performances, striking visuals, and a meaningful exploration of complex themes. Yet, its bleak atmosphere and slow pacing might not appeal to all viewers, requiring a level of patience and emotional resilience that some might find challenging.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting, but not very convincing","""The Piano"" has a lot going for it: a strong cast, a unique premise, great on-site scenery, but somehow the combination left me flat and unmoved.The story follows a young English mute woman (Holly Hunter) who is sent to New Zealand to become a bride for a local settler (Sam Neill). Her passion is her piano which she brings across the ocean, but her new husband has no interest in it. Instead, one of his native workers (a curiously miscast Harvey Keitel, who doesn't look Maori for a moment) is drawn to her, and thus we have our triangle.Some of the scenes showing the interplay of Maori and English cultures were fascinating. The views of New Zealand, both the large-scale and also the smaller-scale views of jungles and mud (there is LOTS of mud!) were very enjoyable. The idea of someone being forced to express herself solely through music, and then finding herself in this wilderness totally devoid of culture, that too was interesting.But this story lives and dies on the basis of its characters, and somehow the main ones (the men especially) were baffling and, worst of all, unsympathetic. Neill's character treats his new wife with coldness and indifference at first, though he does seem to warm to her later on. Keitel's character is even less plausible. He is drawn to her sexually, and realizes he can use the piano as a bargaining tool to achieve his carnal desires. Halfway there, though, he relents. In the meantime, Hunter's character warms up to him, even though he was abusing her. Hunter does the best acting, even though she can't speak any words, still she conveys the frustration and anger and resentment at her predicament very well.More could have been made of the piano as a metaphor for civilization out in the wilderness among the savages, but it wasn't. In fact there was the opposite: the native man feigns interest in the piano, only to ensnare the beautiful woman. One never feels that his interest in the piano was truly musical or artistic.Again, it's hard to explain exactly why, but the combination of characters just did not click very well for me.I found the score hopelessly anachronistic; at no point does the piano play any of the music one would have expected during that period (Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, etc.), but it's still decently pretty. And be warned, there is plenty of male nudity, including the full frontal variety, and a little female as well.It's worth seeing, but I walked away thinking that a very interesting premise was somehow mishandled and left untapped.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Haunting,"The actual plot of The Piano is a very straightforward love triangle, the only difference being that one of the three is mute. To recap it quickly: Harvey Kietel gets naked; Holly Hunter gets horny; Sam Niell gets mad; then Sam Niell gets less mad. What does make The Piano stand out somewhat are the brilliant visuals. The outside action takes place under a web of grey tree branches obscuring the downcast sky. The whole film makes a far more disturbing use of the New Zealand scenery than the over-hyped-but-pretty The Lord Of The Rings.The Piano reminds me quite a lot of Japanese horror film Onibaba. The actual stories of the films are poles apart, but both have a feeling of detachment. Until the very end of the film you could be forgiven for thinking that The Piano is set in an alternate universe, so far away are the characters from any other humans. This love triangle is completely isolated, and from start to finish there is no possibility of any outside forces interrupting or for any of the characters to escape. It is this quality, along with the desolate landscape of the film, that give The Piano it's quality. Plus, the music's great.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Piano lesson about hidden narratives,"After watching 'Girl With a Pearl Earring' the previous day, I bumped into another, by-the-way very well-made, movie with some feminist undercurrents in it. 'The Piano' is not merely feminine, to paraphrase another commenter whose remarks I liked even while not agreeing with them entirely, it is indeed feminist to a degree. Here's how I decode what you find in the movie, without spoilers. This is a story, with some mysteries that you won't be able to fully decipher, that is messy but enjoyable at the same time, and it's kept moving by the layers of hidden narratives that are there for you to explore. So there is a load of other critical stuff in it beside feminism. Think of how 'inappropriately' Ada's little daughter behaves at times! She's annoying, isn't she? But then remember that she's a child who had to move to the end of the world with no option of saying 'no' to the idea. And all those aborigines, they also behave so inappropriately at times! In their case remember that their lands are being bought up for nothing by newcomers of another world, that are intruding their civilization rather inappropriately, one could say. And so on. Getting back to the feminism theme, the piano is the medium that Ada uses to break out of the limitations imposed on her (never having fitted the role of a 'Victorian woman'), she can't use her voice, so she'll rather play the piano scandalously well for a good girl - yeah, that's pretty obvious symbolism alright. The men around her, the characters played by Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel. Well, in my interpretation one is the non-natural man whose rule in society is built on social constructions evident in conventions of the era, while the latter, played by Keitel, is representative of a kind of true, natural manliness. Anyway, I don't want to create the image of being totally self-assured about meanings, for I'm in fact not. And you'll have a lot more questions to ask after the film, I promise. But that's not going to take away the pleasure of watching it, if you're ready to buy into some post-modern, surreal stuff, a really catchy, captivating film score and some truly brilliant cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
That piece of junk caused all this misfortune!,"***SPOILERS*** ""The Piano"" is the story about a piano and all the trouble it caused for everyone in the cast in how crazy they went overboard over it. It all started with the mute but beautiful Ada McGrath, Holly Hunter, who lost both her voice and husband in a thunderstorm back in England when her husband was struck by a lighting bolt out of the blue. Now on her way to the wilds of New Zealand with her 10 year old daughter Flora, Ann Paquin,to get hooked up with a husband , that she never met, Englishman and land surveyor Alisdair Stewart, Sam Neil, Ada insists in sign languages to take her piece of junk piano along with her on the trip.It's in the wilds of New Zealand that Ada settles that are occupied by the uncivilized from western and British culture ""Mud People"" better known as the Maori's. It in that forbidden jungle and mud infested hell hole that the sweet and proper Ada meets and falls in love with former English whaler and now full fledged Maori warrior George Baines, Harvey Keitel. At first not at all interested in the slobbery and tattooed Baines who has a habit of walking around butt naked in her presences Ada soon falls head over heels for him in the animal magnetism that he displays towards her. Something that the educated and highly civilized Alisdaie Stewart, her chosen husband, seems to lack. Trying to bed down his new wife and be a husband to her makes Stewart even more mad in that she just can't get the animal like Baines, who by now has cleaned up his act, out of her mind as well as bed! Baines even goes so far as to ask Ada to give him piano lessons which the only thing he plans to play with is Ada not her piano. He just lays under the piano as Ada is playing it and tries to look up her dress which, in what he sees, he finds far more interesting then her piano or piano playing! It's by then that Stweart finally realized what was going on and went completely berserk that lead to the tragedy at the end of the movie. Not only to Ada but to himself as well in losing it and becoming even far more uncivilized then Baines who by then wanted nothing at all to do with Ada.***SPOILERS*** Acrtress Holly Hunter playing the mute Ada McGrath also played the piano by herself without a double in the movie. As for her nude scenes, with a body that most men would gladly die for, with both Kitle & Neil she seemed to , I'm not quite sure, have done them by herself as well. The tragic ending had Ada on her way home to England have the piano thrown overboard into the Pacific Ocean with Ada, with her foot caught in the netting, hanging on to it for dear life. It was all for the best in that by a miracle she was able to untangle her foot and swim up to the surface and be rescued and go back, without Stewart, to England. Later as the movie was about to end Ada was also able to regain her voice that she lost there due to a thunder storm so many years ago that took her first husbands life.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Layers...,"It's amazing how many layers a movie can have. ""The Piano"" has enough layers for you to watch it ten times and analyze a different element during each viewing. It's also amazing how disturbing a story can be, at the same time it is touching; and how good a person can be, even when he or she is a bit crazy. I came to the conclusion that the three main characters of ""The Piano"" are good hearted people, but with big mental issuesBut that's just one of the layers of the film.Set in the 1850's, the story follows Ada (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin) Flora, as they travel to New Zealand, where Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), an intended husband she hasn't met, is waiting for Ada to begin a life with her. Ada (she explains to us during a narration at the beginning of the film where her mind is speaking) is mute and plays the piano, so when she arrives to the beach, her piano is loaded down but Stewart refuses to take it to the house; so they leave it on the beach.There will be one person who will help her get the piano back, and that's Baines (Harvey Keitel), and that's the development of the film about which I can't say no more. The way Ada looks at the Piano (it is worth putting in capital letters because it's another main character) on the beach when she's on top of the hill as she walks to the house; that's the main element of the contemplation present in Jane Campion's direction.Not only that beautiful shot of the lonely Piano on the beach, but the way she pays attention to the jungle or the houses, when the camera shows empty spaces; in a metaphorical way that really seems to be saying something. That's another magical element: let's call it ""unexplained understanding"". Through Campion's astonishing script is that we also see the layers I'm talking about. She covers a lot in such few words that Holly Hunter's look is enough to understand what's going on.Believe it or not, I'm getting stuck with this review; but because I have many things to say. The intense character study is something from another world. Campion, both in her direction and script, makes sure that every scene has total importance, without differentiating between a main character like Ada or an aboriginal from New Zealand.Every scene is so intense with the focus on the characters that you can't keep your eyes off the screen, even when the film is slow and depressing like no other. Whether it is in the house, on the beach or inside the jungle, each scene takes the action from ten different angles with a big number of different shots. This is Stuart Dryburgh's flawless achievement in cinematography; which includes close-ups so daring and compelling as the ones he uses now, more than ten years later, in films like ""The Painted Veil"".I can't forget about Michael Nyman's score, which is not the best thing in the world, but is perfectly combined with every piece Ada plays in her beloved Piano; in order to give a continuing musicality to the picture. Now, I don't know how much Nyman wrote of these pieces Ada play, butThe moments in which she plays each of them and the way she does it and how the pieces sound; I could assure that they represent Ada's feelings in their most original form. I mean, I don't know much about classical music and that's what I'm saying. However, if those pieces existed and were at least known, their title or (as I said) their form would be incredibly connected to Campion's story.I don't even know how much Campion knows about music, but if she doesn't know anything, it didn't affect this beautiful piece at all. Realize how much I've said about ""The Piano"" and I haven't even mentioned the performances. I shouldn't have to, though: Holly Hunter won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here and it is as simple as it sounds; she doesn't speak a word. Little Anna Paquin, who is know big and talented, was also incredibly talented then with ten years old; and she also got an Oscar for it. She couldn't even watch the film when this happened because she was too young, and apparently she hasn't completely watched it yet.Sam Neil achieves a remarkable job with a character that requires several big changes of mood and decisions; and that angry actor that Harvey Keitel is presents an unexpected gentleness as the troubled Baines. But as I already mentioned; they are all somehow very troubled. And between this troubled and frightening and confusing and violent environment, Ada sits down and speaks, through her Piano; that, as a colleague of mine said, is her own voice.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Touching and beautifully made,"'The Piano' is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It is definitely unusual, set in a marshy New Zealand forest but is still fantastic and so touching. Holly Hunter plays a woman sent to New Zealand to marry a man she has never met (Sam Neill) and there falls in love with a local man(Keitel).The performances by Hunter, Paquin and Keitel were amazing and the first two definitely fully deserved the Oscars that they received. Hunter is brilliant as the mute Scottish woman who comunicates by playing the Piano that she loves(Hunter actually did most of her own playing)and Paquin as her daughter. Considering 'The Piano' was 11 year old New Zealander Anna Paquin's debut and she was playing a 9 year old Scottish girl, her performance was outstanding.'The Piano' is loved by critics and audiences everywhere and will probably always be.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Directing and Acting. Questionable Writing.,"Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" is an astoundingly acted, shot, and composed film that is also incredibly frustrating. It's story of a mute woman caught in a love triangle in the New Zealand forest is at times both passionate and distant, as its physical romance is born out of problematic circumstances.It's not that the relationship between Baines and Ada hasn't aged well, it's that it's wrong from the start. I do not believe that Ada would helplessly fall in love with the man that sexually blackmailed her. I do not see anything above basic carnal desires between these two characters. I don't imagine them running off together and I can't imagine what their life will be like after that.Besides that very present problem, the film is an exquisite period piece with all the proper trimmings. Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin both deserved their Oscars as they each turn in historical performances for their categories. Paquin's performance remains one of the few child performances that I didn't immediately hate and is much better than most of the adults in this movie.Above all else is Michael Nyman's score, specifically his song ""The Hearts Asks Pleasure First"", which I have been playing on repeat for the last week.While it's quite good, I wish I could like ""The Piano"" even more.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I don't even mind ones with an inconsequential plot. Like the one about the old guy riding across two states to see his dying brother on a lawnmower. The old guy's on the mower, not the dying brother. But I could believe it. In it, even.Not this. The 'wealthy landowner' lives in a shoddy timber house in a settlement in the muddiest part of the dankest, jungliest bit of New Zealand and does nothing constructive except chop the odd bit of firewood. He should have stayed in Hampshire and farmed or in Wolverhampton and made chains but nope.This must be a jolly good piano for despite being left on a stormy beach below the high tide level, it doesn't suffer much. And they leave it there. No case of, ""If we have to leave it, why don't we move it up the beach a bit where it's dry?"" And later it's hauled through the jungle and tipped over into the mud, but - well, well - all it needs is a wee bit of tuning.The Ada character is about the most sexually unappetising specimen of femininity imaginable. Not only does she not speak, but she doesn't smile, acknowledge other people or exhibit any of the social graces considered mandatory by any Victorian. When she plays the piano, she plays tedious music in a style that never, ever, ever varies throughout the whole movie until you wish that her new husband would take the damned piano and use it for firewood. Not only that but it is contemporary music. Late 20th century contemporary, that is. It's cheap, tinkly-tinkly-tinkly with the left hand and plink-plonk-plink with the right. 'On-hold' music, really. Clearly, she's too advanced for a bit of Mozart, Handel, Bach or even maybe a bit of Scarlatti.She sells herself implausibly cheap to the rough guy. The husband under-reacts initially then overreacts. What's that all about then? Why does her beloved daughter who's so devoted to her mother dob her in - twice!? Is the kid really that stoopid?Weather! Nowhere - except possibly parts of Wales - could sustain rainfall like this. Remember The Ghostwriter? Just dull overcast all the way through. This has rain, rain and more rain. Is this suppose to add significance? It doesn't.This movie is emperor's new clothes. I think the only reason it was a critical hit was because nobody had the nerve to point out the truth. Perhaps it won because it had a couple of soft-core moments. Some ladies' naughty bits and a flash of man-sausage. And a bit of writhing.Don't be fooled. This movie really, really is utter rubbish. It's pointless, vacuous, joyless and meaningless. Did I mention boring? You will come out of the theatre less than you went in. Only if you are of a preternaturally credulous turn of mind will you believe in this tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Self indulgent, art-for-art sake, critics darling wannabe","The Piano, it's international accolades aside, is an overtly surreal, dreamlike puddle of dross.  I will grant that many of the artisans who lent their names and reputations to this production have scored peripheral success, but the core artistic conception, the film itself, is a murky blur of period costumes mixed with inaccessible concepts and visions.  Perhaps Jane Campion knew what she wanted to say, but with the distributor failing to hand out liner notes at the box office the rest of the world was left to battle with subliminal cartoons, and schizophrenic characters and their mood swings.I desperately wanted to like 'The Piano', and yet, aided by this desperation I still found myself feeling cheated by a Director who was just as desperate to court the critics and, at the same time, carve her signature into her work, all to the detriment of the finished product.Why do I hate this film so?  Well, it's largest crime is that it is boring. The film is boring not because of it's subject matter, but by the way that subject matter is handled.  None of the characters feel like real people, they all, or almost all, deliver lines and performances (performances gravely influenced by direction) that are at right angles to the actions of real people.Ignore it's reputation, see the film, and then ask yourself ""What up with that?"".",,Anonymous,Music

Her silent expressions speak louder than dialogue, making her performance truly unforgettable. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill also add depth to the film's intense relationships, making for a compelling drama.A standout in the film is Anna Paquin, who was absolutely adorable and incredibly talented for her age.

The Piano,"Holly Hunter is on good form here as ""Ada"", a mute who is adept with her piano. Soon to be married to a Kiwi farmer, she sails with her daughter to his remote home where he ""Alisdair"" (Sam Neill) seems to be rather indifferent to her presence. The same cannot be said for their neighbour ""Baines"" (Harvey Keitel) though, and he engineers a land for piano swap with her husband as a prelude to inviting her round to his home to play. After a few meetings they work out a peculiarly unique bartering system that might see both get what they ultimately want from the arrangement. It's at this stage that ""Alisdair"" feels frustratingly cuckolded and things take a turn for the violent and the brutal. It's a beautiful film to look at, the cinematography and the costumes are perfect for the period and despite a fairly sparse dialogue, the performances - especially from Keitel and the young Anna Paquin (""Flora"") are quite compelling to watch. To be honest, Neill adds very little of value and I did get a little fed up with the repetitious refrain of Michael Nyman's theme but as the story develops, we are introduced to some thought-provoking issues of ownership - and not just of the piano. A big screen does this better justice, but it is a good watch on the television too.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Masterpiece, perfectly acted, greatest film of all time","Brilliant, beautiful, you have not lived until you see it. I went and bought the book, which was beautiful, and explained some of the mysteries not dealt with in the movie. As always, Hunter, the absolute best actor, was fantastic. Her role as the mute, Scottish woman Ada Wyston Mcgrath, whose one from of expression and release was her piano, was beautiful. A mute outcast, rejected from society in her home town, merely for being mute, only to be aggravated further by her having an illegitimate daughter Flora McGrath (Anna Paquins very first movie, also a brilliant actor). Flora being the result of a night of passion with her piano tutor. Not a most suitable and acceptable thing to do at the time. Her father, desperate for her to settle down with someone and become a respectable member of society, sends her to New Zealand for an arranged marriage. When she arrives her relationship with her new husband, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), gets off to a rather terrible start. Having to leave her precious piano at the beach, she does everything possible to retrieve it, aggravating Alisdair, who, no matter how hard he tries cannot manage to fathom why the instrument is so important. His friend, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), however sees this, and uses it to his advantage. My personal favourite parts are the voice overs of Adas thoughts at the beginning and end of the movie. There is a silence where hath been no sound/There is a silence where no sound may be/In the cold grave under the deep, deep sea/Or in wide desert where no life is found/Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound/No voice is hushed, no life treads silently/Though clouds and cloudy shadows wander free/That never spoke over idle ground/But in green ruins, in the desolate walls/Of antique palaces, where man hath been/Though the dun fox or wild hyena calls/And owls that flit continually between/Shreik to the echo and the low winds moan/There the true silence is- self conscious and alone -Silence, Thomas Hood (1798-1845)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Scratches the Costume Drama Itch,"THE PIANO (B-) Excellent art direction, costuming, hair styling, and acting transport us to the wilds of 19th century New Zealand where the mute Ada (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin) have found themselves after an arranged marriage. Ada's one joy is her piano which has been laboriously shipped from Scotland, but due to some complications ends up in the hands of Harvey Keitel's planter who taken a liking to Ada and offers her a way to earn the piano back. The story is a tough one for me to get invested in with its romantic triangle and what feels like a bare bones narrative that relies upon a careful viewing and heavy investment in the characters. It works, but only so. Once I got the feel for where the film was heading and how, it never felt like it hit a higher gear.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I have to disagree,"All of my friends think this is a great film, but I find it to be one of the most over-rated films of the 1990's.'The Piano' is completely lacking in subtlety -- normally a quality a filmmaker wants in a film that is attempting (in this case, committing) symbolism.  It hits the audience over the head with its 'meaning'.And what does it mean?  That a man wins a woman's love by treating her horribly and exploiting her mercilessly?  That's exactly what happens in this film.  Furthermore, Ada is a thoroughly inscrutable and unlikeable character.I cheered when she was almost drowned, too bad she was rescued . . but even the beautiful cinematography and good cast can't rescue this over-wrought and over-rated film.Also:  did anyone notice that Baines is repeatedly depicted as uneducated and illiterate, but yet Ada writes to him (on a piano key of all things). And the annoying music Ada plays on the piano (and we hear over and over on the soundtrack) is out of place in a film set in the nineteenth century.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

88 Keys and a Dozen Problems.,"Dark and bleak entry from writer-director Jane Campion (Oscar-winning for the former and Oscar-nominated for the latter) which concerns a mute British woman (electric Oscar-winner Holly Hunter) who moves to newly colonized New Zealand in the mid-19th Century. She has been promised in marriage to Sam Neill by her father. Thus she makes the long trek to the South Island of the small country with little more than her young daughter (surprise Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) and her most prized possession (the titled item). Hunter has refused to speak supposedly since the unfortunate death of her first husband and uses the piano as an outlet to express her feelings and thoughts. Immediately it is realized that Neill is not capable of love and that native Harvey Keitel may be the person that Hunter desperately needs in her life. A forbidden love affair blossoms between Hunter and Keitel, but how will Neill and Paquin react when Hunter's secret disappears? ""The Piano"" thrives on its performances (Hunter and Paquin in particular) and has a soul of its own with its haunting score. However Campion's screenplay is not near as concrete as I would have liked. She seems unsure of where she wants to go with the story and ultimately her direction suffers as well. Honored left and right in 1993, ""The Piano"" pales miserably to ""Schindler's List"" and lacks the overall heart and intensity of ""The Remains of the Day"". Still a good movie, but never quite hit the right notes with me. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Music

"""Piano"" must be Maori for ""self indulgent wankery""","Amidst a storm of publicity and hails as the new ultra-feminist zenith of masterpiece, The Piano hit international cinema like a plague, and suddenly it was ""cool"" to watch the thing, as well as talk everyone else into seeing it, whether the film suited them or not. Contrary to what a previous commentator implies, Anna Paquin deserved her award for this film, and then some, as she acts rings around the adults in the cast. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill play the most utterly despicable men, and given that this is meant to be some post-modern feminist essay, they are also as unidimensional as a piece of paper. Holly Hunter's character could have been at least likable, but the presence of voice-over from what is meant to be her character (but sounds more like Anna's) ruins whatever character she could build through her silence. James Cameron was able to create a character that intimidates the audience despite speaking less than a hundred words in a hundred minutes. Jane Campion as a writer is to James Cameron as a one-cell protozoan is to Professor X.All the elements for a good story are in place. A mute woman is sent to colonial New Zealand for an arranged marriage. Her one treasured possession in the world is a piano, hence the title. The twist is that her new husband's refusal to help her keep her piano results in her having an affair with one of the locals. In the hands of a director like Paul Verhoeven, Tim Burton, or even Christopher Nolan, this could have become a classic. In Jane Campion's hands, it is overlong, paced like a racehorse with three broken legs, and entirely uncompelling. If you don't believe me about Verhoeven's ability to tell this kind of tale better, then you clearly haven't seen Keetje Tippel or Turks Fruit. That aside, the location scout sure earned their money. Campion knows how to make the best use of the countryside and its natural beauty, I will give her that much, but this does not add up to much in light of the myriad of problems. You can make a good art film, you can make a bad art film, but heaven help you if you make a boring art film.Roger Ebert takes a long walk off a minuscule credibility pier when he tells us that Campion ""understands better the eroticism of slowness and restraint"". If you want to see slowness and restraint used well in film, rent Michael Mann's 1995 film Heat. Mann gives the audience enough reason to care about every character that he can include an entire minute of footage that features little more than two of his actors staring into a camera, and keep viewers glued to their seat. Heat is literally one of the most languid films to have emerged from an English-speaking country in the past twenty years, yet it is also one of the most compelling. The Piano tries to use slow and languid to seem artful, but in failing to give us characters we want to follow through to their eventual fates, it simply becomes overlong. You could seriously excise at least thirty minutes from The Piano and nobody would know the difference. Hell, when I write, I look back on what I have written and ask ""does this scene contribute anything to the story?"". I have deleted enough words to make a full-length novel from my writings this way, so that Campion can get this rubbish published unasked is offensive.Of course, people will respond to my previous criticism by telling me that The Piano made money at the box office, and it is true that money speaks a lot louder than artistry. The problem with that defense, however, is that any film film made after 1980 could make a profit on the back of a mere seven million dollar budget. Exactly how Campion was able to enlist such actors as Keitel or Neill and stick to such a budget is a bit of a mystery. Perhaps she was able to convince them, like her audience, that she was making an art film. After seeing both of them in other films, I know they are definitely better actors than Campion deserves or knows what to do with. But to get back to the point, much of The Piano's profit has come as the result of pressure-marketing. The marketeer barks that this is a compulsory film for feminists or art students, and they jump. This is not art or even skillful economics, it is a form of cultural terrorism. The real pity of it is that Campion will have you believe she made a statement, and some will believe her.The one area in which The Piano can be thanked is the introduction of a young actress named Anna Paquin. As I said earlier, she acts rings around the rest of the cast, giving us the only character who has any illusion of being three-dimensional. Unfortunately, much like later films in her career, she is sadly underutilised, and in another display of femininity according to Campion, is only there when Holly Hunter or someone giving Hunter a good serve needs something to bounce their total blankness off. Had the film been entirely about her, or from her perspective, it would have been a lot more watchable. But then, I could watch Anna reading the phone book for two hours, so I might be just a little biased. Such is the quality of her performances that she has made several write-offs (All The Rage comes to mind) eminently more watchable. Ironically, she continues to act in real art films that are far better than this nonsense, yet receives not even half the recognition.For that reason, I gave The Piano a three out of ten. Anna earns all three stars. If you are a fan of Anna like I am, this might be worth the two hours. Otherwise, don't bother.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

You can tell she put a lot of work into being able to show such a range-even in the hand motions with her sign language.

Love for music expressed non-verbally,"This is one of the most original and unusual love stories ever put on film. Holly Hunter is Ada McGrath, a woman of English origin that travels with her daughter to New Zealand in an arranged marriage to a man also of English extraction. Ada is a mute and has a love for playing the piano, one is a component of the personal belongings she brings.
Sam Neill plays Alisdair Stewart, the husband of the marriage and a man with no time for music, all he wants is a wife obedient to his wishes. Alisdair simply leaves the piano on the beach, an act that devastates Ada. Harvey Keitel plays George Baines, a native Maori that warms to Ada and her love for music. He has the piano transported to his residence, giving him the opportunity to be alone with Ada.
At first, Ada resists George's advances, but her love of the piano overwhelms all of her qualms and she becomes sexually intimate with George. This sets up a love triangle where Alisdair acts out the most brutal of what a husband could legally do to his wife. All of the players give superb performances, especially Hunter and Anna Paquin that plays daughter Flora McGrath. Ada's intense love for playing the piano comes through very clear through facial expressions and body language.
The viewer quickly finds themselves empathizing with Ada and antagonistic to Alisdair. There is the hope that somehow Ada and George will become a couple and the movie will end with Ada blissfully playing the piano. Not quite the ending. George's fellow Maori provide a solid supporting role by providing people of Maori culture rather than more transported people of English extraction. This is a great movie, worthy of every award it received.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
From a strange plot came a magnificent film,"The scene is an Australian film production company's office. The time  early 1990s:Film Company Executive: So, Ms Campion, tell me about this idea you have for a movie.Jane Campion: It's a love triangle really, set in the 1850s. The woman is in her 30s, a mute with an illegitimate daughter. Neither she nor anyone else knows why she can't speak. She expresses herself through playing the piano. She travels from Scotland to New Zealand to take part in an arranged marriage with a settler. He's a bit icy and combs his hair before putting on his hat in order to be photographed. The third corner of the triangle is another settler who is on his own and is picking up on Maori ways, painting his face and the like. He likes to dust the piano in the nude. It's all about the development of their relationships.FCE: OK, so we have a woman who can't speak, but plays the piano, her husband who's maybe a couple of cards short of a full deck, and a half Maori nude piano polisher?JC: Well, yes. Oh, and it's set in a swampy rainy forest environment.FCE: Thanks Ms Campion. Don't call us, we'll call you.Fortunately, of course, the company did call and this riveting piece of cinema was made. How did Campion achieve the well-deserved acclaim, given the rather odd material? Simply through obeying the rules about how to make good film. All the elements, photography, music, editing, acting and, above all, direction come together to make this one of the best films of the 1990s.It's claustrophobic atmosphere (apart from the opening and closing sequences, there's hardly a glimpse of the sun and sky, or the world beyond), the persistent rain and the rough living conditions create a haunting but compelling 100 minutes or so of viewing. Not an easy film by any means and, like any intelligent cinema, we must think for ourselves rather than have everything sign-posted in big letters.If there's a fault it's with the hoary old problem of accents. There seems to be a jumble of English (Geordie), Irish and Scottish, but let's assume they were speaking early New Zealandish!It comes as no surprise that this won a string of awards and is deserving of its place in the `Time Out' list of Top 100 films of all time (as voted by directors, critics and others in the business, rather than the general public).",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The landscapes were nice, though.All in all, a model of all that is worst about art cinema and an argument for going to see blockbusters or reading a book or tapping out some hymns on a tinny piano, which is what the Holly Hunter character would have played had this film attempted to connect with reality on any level.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Jane Campion does an excellent work, I always like Jane Campion's movies, I had the opportunity to see ""The piano"" It was a very interesting movie in which the viewer get astounded following this wonderful story about a woman who get married to somebody who loves her, but she doesn't love him at all. She had to marry him because of her silent and necessity. She is a mute person and her only happiness is her beautiful piano and her beautiful daughter who understands her very well even if she can't speak, her daughter is the only one who can understand her through signs and gestures. She fells in love with somebody who took her piano. And she get faced with her husband and her love. She wants to be with her only love even though she will lose her piano and her talent. As her husband knew about this love, he cut her finger off so that she wouldn't play the piano any more, She lost her unique talent. It was really getting to me, I think it was very sad that she lost her finger, Can somebody play the piano without a finger? This movie makes me think a lot. Even though she didn't have a finger I think she's the best pianist in the whole world. Everybody should see this magnificent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Cinematic Perfection,"This film is downright brilliant.  Never before has a film been more mesmerizing, more haunting . . . in fact, the film touched me in such a way that I am almost offended by the stupidity of some of the other user comments.  It's one of very few films I have given a 10/10 rating.  The best thing about this film is it's secrets and the fact that it never needs to reveal them in order to satisfy us.  In fact, it's better that they aren't revealed.  The performances are, needless to say, scintillating.  I have such respect for Holly Hunter for her portrayal in this film . . . she's magnificent.  Anna Paquin is also superb in a very difficult role for a child actor.  They both deserved every inch of their Oscars.  I still can't believe that Steven Spielberg's pretentious Schindler's List beat his film for Best Picture, but then I rarely agree with the Academy's Best Film picks.  The image of Hunter floating above her piano at the end is the most haunting image I've ever seen in a film.  A pure joy to behold, it even inspired me to play the piano!

Brilliant for thinking people,"This movie was so emotionally involving that I literally fainted in cinema during the climax and had to go again to see what happened.The psychology, rather than the action, is what is gripping.

A great movie.,"For me, this is one of the great films of 1993. The story is not pretty, and we could almost call it ""love in times of mud"", not only because of the continuous rain and the amount of mud on the set, but mainly because of the rudeness and brutality of the male characters. However, the film is very good, it's engaging, captivating and really deserves to be brought back these days. Winner of three Oscars (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Screenplay), I believe it just didn't win more due to fierce competition from ""Schindler's List"". The film also won the prestigious Palme d'Or for Jane Campion in Cannes.Set in the mid-19th century, the film begins with the marriage by proxy of Ada, a young, single mother, to a middle-class farmer settled in New Zealand. The British colony was still developing, there is a tense relationship between the whites and the native Maori, and Ada's new husband is trying to buy more land on the island. We never understand what he does or what he intends to use them for, and the film ignores these details and focuses on the couple's relationship. Ada is mute, but she has a special affection for her piano and plays very well. However, the new husband is not happy about it: the piano is large, it is heavy and the journey to his house is long, which is why he leaves the piano on the beach and ends up selling it to George Baines, an illiterate who, in a rather indecent proposal, allows Ada to play it on the condition that they become sexually involved, under the guise of alleged piano lessons. However, they end up falling in love and this will shake up Ada's marriage.This film is really the most beautiful work of Jane Campion, who brilliantly assures the direction and the script. Ada is a character we easily sympathize with, and Flora, her daughter (the name is never mentioned in the film), is endearingly tender and naive. It's the way they hold us that supports the entire film. The melodrama, for me, is like the weakest part of the film: in addition to Ada marrying a brutal and indigestible husband, she ends up falling in love with a man who is equally unpleasant and who starts by taking advantage of a situation to satisfy his own sex needs and an unbelievable passion. Today, I think it would be very difficult for Campion to present a story like that without being shot in the public square by the most wary feminists.The cast deserves an applause. Holly Hunter gives us the performance of her career playing Ada. Moving, suffering and unhappy, the actress managed to give her a strong personality and a great deal of obstinacy. Anna Paquin, still extremely young, is beautiful in her role and the way she plays with Hunter is truly touching. Due to her innocence and innate sense of justice, her character protects her mother, but, at the right moments, condemns her for her untimely and thoughtless attitudes. Sam Neill is effective and very good in the role of Ada's husband. The actor manages to make his character detestable. Harvey Keitel is also very good in the role of Baines, and it was a surprise for me, since I tend to associate him more with action or thriller roles.Technically, the film has an epic, melodramatic feel that instills depth, which was nice to feel. There are certain moments where it feels like the film is doing some self-importance, but I handled that well. The cinematography is truly excellent, and is beautifully shot. The filming locations were well-chosen, and shows us a wild and inhospitable side of New Zealand, a place that, for many of us, is unknown and arouses curiosity. I didn't know, for example, that it was such a rainy place, but that makes sense, considering the location and the mountainous topography. A word of praise, also, for the costumes, very historically accurate. Finally, a word for the grandiose soundtrack, based naturally on piano, and composed by Michael Nyman.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"New Zealander, but there's a hint of Australian here.","Holly Hunter won Best Actress for playing mute Ada McGrath, sent to New Zealand for an arranged marriage to the emotionally vacant Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). After finding a piano abandoned on the beach, she uses it as her only means to talk to lonely George Baines (Harvey Keitel).What I mean about there being a hint of Australian is communication issues. Even though Ada is mute, she can still communicate; Alisdair can talk, but can't communicate. Equally good as Hunter is Anna Paquin as her perceptive daughter Flora. Among other things, ""The Piano"" is an interesting look at New Zealand and even at the Maori culture.

Worst movie I ever paid to see,"Even 24 years later I can recall how bad this movie was. I thought to take my fiancé to this as we are both amateur classical musicians, the title suggested a musical theme, I like Sam Neill, and early reviews had raved. We saw it in a theater just off the Princeton campus, full of date-night couples with the guys sucking up a chick-flick. The music was a catastrophic disappointment. The main character plays the same awful insipid piano tune the entire movie. The tune was anachronistic- clearly written in the late 20th century by a mediocre film composer, and being played in a mid-19th century setting. It was difficult to suspend disbelief every time it was played. Was hoping for some Beethoven Piano sonata music or at least something from the era. To my ear, she might just as well have been playing ""Hey Jude"". The characters engendered no empathy in me. As an example, near the end of the movie the piano is being moved by boat and falls overboard, entangling the Holly Hunter character and dragging her down to the bottom of the ocean. Things look bad for her, and I was delighted. ""Thank God this movie is over!"" As I prepared to get up to leave, the guy jumps overboard, rescues her, and the movie goes on another ten minutes or so. Ugh. When the credits finally started I couldn't help myself, and blurted out sarcastically ""My, that was uplifting."" I think every guy in the theater erupted laughing (and probably ruined their chances for the night given the tough Princeton-feminist crowd). I thought to say that this is the worst ""guy movie"" ever made, but my fiancé, now wife of 20 years, never passes on an opportunity to rant about this horrible film. I'm pretty sure I've always had almost zero respect for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts, but the awards this film received were confirmatory.

Exceptionally Incredible,"The piano (1993) written and directed by Jane Campion, is a drama film about Ada, a mute piano player and her daughter Flora, who are sent, along with her prized piano, to wet, marshy New Zealand. Set in the 1850's, the story circles around the musician's love for playing the piano and her struggle and determination to regain her piano after it is sold.Bordwell and Thomson refer to cinematography as the 'manipulations of the film strip'(2013:239). Film used a range of different modes including sound and visual therefore it's effective in portraying feelings and attitudes and creating particular moods.The type of light 'will clearly effect the saturation and value of its hues and the illusions that it gives' (Rose 2016:79). Therefore, light is a major aspect to producing a desired atmosphere of an image. The use of light filters is made great use of throughout the film, to evoke emotion and give insight into the characters feelings. The blue filter is used predominantly to project the notions of melancholy, solitude and misery, for example in the wedding photo. There is a lack of warmth and delight that usually is present in a wedding photo. The blue cold blue hues reflect the isolation and loathing she has for the situation. However, a rose filter is made use of to reflect feelings of happiness and peace, in contrast to the blue filter. The rose filter is made particular use of when Ada is playing her piano on the beach. Campion allows the audience to see and feel, through this warmer filter, that music is Ada's secret to happiness.Sound, is also a major component within film. Reay (2004) suggests that music within a scene has a considerable effect on its interpretation and significance. Music, in particular piano, is a predominant factor within the movie. The music represents Ada's voice, emotions and attitudes; it is her internal monologue. The repetition of the same song, 'The heart asks pleasure first' through the course of the film helps to show the continuity and determination of her character. However, the song is played in a variety of ways throughout different parts of the film. The different volumes, paces and intensities produce certain atmospheres. In the finger cutting scene, the music is increased in volume and doubles in speed, which portrays to the audience that Ada is feeling threatened and frightened. Contrastingly, in the scene where Ada visits the piano on the beach, the song is played softly and gently. This highlights her inner contentment, as the piano is the only way she can express her feelings.The use of different camera shots is also highly significant within film. Bordwell and Thomson (2013) state that a close up shot puts emphasis on a character's facial expressions, showing their emotional state. The extreme close up of Ada's eye just before she is nearly raped, shows boldness and stamina. This close up is extremely important, as because she is quiet, the viewer must be able to read her emotions from her facial expressions.Personally, I see the film as exceptionally incredible, as it truly moves you, making you almost feel the inner turmoil and heartbreak of the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"A unique, beautiful and powerful film","""The Piano"", is indeed a joy and pleasure to experience. As an art film, it certainly dazzles with it's cinematography, music score, art direction, costumes and makeup, however it's most crucial strengths are it's writing and acting. Writing and acting are the qualities that set apart the merely good films from the excellent films.Set in New Zealand, 1850, and photographed on location, the story is about an arranged marriage and an affair. The storytelling is exceptionally beautiful and original.Producer, writer and director Jane Campion of Australia, does an outstanding job with this film. Campion won the 1993 Palme De' Or award at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, making her the first ever female recipient of this high honor. Campion also won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this film.The director should always receive some credit for an excellent acting performance, as they are providing the inspiration and motivation for the actors to do their best. Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin both give powerful acting performances. Most impressively, this was Anna Paquin's first feature length film, and at the age of 11 was nominated for and won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, making her the second youngest ever recipient of an Academy acting award, after Tatum O"" Neal, age 10, for ""Paper Moon"", 1973.First feature length film role, only 11 years old, first nomination, and win for an Academy Award for Anna Pacquin.

Holly Hunter is grating and aggravating, not convincing. The androphobic tone of the film is truly disconcerting--the overall effect is about as uplifting as a Gloria Steinem tract.

The reality of the body,"Ada doesn't talk. This is important. When young, something happened (which is implied but not revealed) and she just decided to stop talking to people. The opening scenes show us a horse pulling away from the reins symbolising Ada's wilful nature. This sets us up a for a complex story about deep non-verbal human nature. Although there is plenty of symbolism here, (from the horse to George Baine's crippled dog, to the play of Bluebeard) this is a very physical film. Looks and glances tells us a lot as does the music Ada plays. This film contrasts the realities of the body and the mind and goes with the body in a way that will unsettle and upset some. And the music is spectacular adding a whole other dimension to an already deep film. The more you look, the more you will find in this film.

A haunting romance,"Erotic and emotionally powerful, ""The Piano"" tells of a haunting romance that swells on the waves of pride, Victorian prudishness, and passion. The four main characters embody the times and social attitudes. Mute and cold and bargained through an arranged marriage, Ada arrives on the island with her mischievous young daughter and her precious piano. Her new husband Stewart is a socially inhibited and emotionally repressed English settler who has a penchant for mistrusting others. He decides that the piano is to be left on the beach where they disembarked, in the rain and weather because of the trouble it would be to move it piano into the settlement. He fails to see how important the piano is to his bride; how it is her only means of expression. The fourth character, Baines, is another English settler, quiet and isolated, who comes to be the most complex of all.""The Piano"" is gray and dank like the emotions that burden the settlers as they attempt to maintain a semblance of western civilization in a rainy island settlement surrounded by Maori natives who adopt the apparel of their new neighbors, but not their repressed notions of self and society. Only Baines has embraced native ways, and it is he who brings those moments of emerging tenderness and truth.The pace of this film matches the pace of the seduction, beginning with slow caution and rejection, moving carefully through the strangest courtship ever, to its resolution, fraught with loss and sacrifice.""The Piano"" won many awards, including three Oscars; it deserved every one of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A symphony of brilliance.,"Coming across an ocean, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) sits silently with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) beside her and a piano accompanying. They are on their way to New Zealand where Ada's new husband (Sam Neill), whom she's never met, is waiting to be with her. Upon arrival, the two instantly dislike the newest member of their family as he drags them up towards their home and leaves the piano on the dreary beach. The next day, Ada gets George Baines (Harvey Keitel) a tribesman who works for her husband, to bring them back down to the beach to the piano. Ada is mute, but finds poetic beauty in the sounds that she produces through her piano and I have to say that I was quite moved with their beauty as well and so was George. Or rather, he was moved by Ada's beauty.So George brings the piano up to his home and keeps it there; he arranges for Ada to give him lessons to play and in turn she can play her piano at his home. Soon she finds out that his reasoning for having her come there is of a much more erotic nature. They come to an agreement that for every visit she makes to 'teach him to play', she will be one step closer to him giving her the piano. But while she visits and plays, he makes requests of her (such as lifting her skirt up or taking off her dress-coat so that he can see her arms). Quite quickly these requests come to her laying down next to him and eventually them laying nude together. Initially she is stubborn and put back by this man, but soon she begins to feel for him. Soon she falls in love with him. In this love comes my favorite aspect of the film. It's not your typical love story between two incredibly attractive people torn apart by their families or some twist of fate and they fight to get back to one another. These are two very flawed individuals who have nothing stopping them from being in love, except for her caution towards feeling so deeply for someone again. But once they finally accept their passion for one another, they have her new husband to deal with.The Piano is a tragic film with scenes of extreme tension and one of the most wrenching moments I've ever had to witness on screen when husband Alisdair discovers their affair and picks up his axe. However it's also a beautiful picture with some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen and a score that sweeps me away. Two shots in particular had me stunned; one focused solely on the piano in it's crate sitting on the beach as the waves crash on the sand behind it, and another where Flora runs over a series of hills to deliver a message to Alisdair. As I said before, the love story in it is certainly unique and thus it's one of my favorites ever depicted on screen. In order for it to work, the performances had to be flawless and they most certainly are. Holly Hunter is painfully moving without saying a word, Sam Neill is flawed and naive throughout the entire picture until the final act where he is absolutely terrifying and Harvey Keitel makes the audience feel as Ada does; at first he is strange and despicable but we realize that under this creepy exterior is a gentle lover and Keitel perfectly embodies both aspects of this. My only complaint with the film is in the young Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for this role. I personally found her to not only be unbearably annoying, but her scenes near the end felt so forced and ridiculous it almost came to the point of hilarity. If it wasn't for the incredible performances surrounding her and the power of the story, I believe I would have ended up laughing. However when there is such strength and flawlessness encompassing everything, one little thing isn't going to ruin the experience. An absolutely incredible film with such a beautiful ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An emotionally complex woman you will never forget...,"Jane Campion is a director who is not afraid to create challenging films about emotionally complex women (i.e. the haunting ""Sweetie"" and the biography of troubled poet Janet Frame).  In ""The Piano"", she continues this tradition with Ada, the mute Scottish mail-order bride, who is one of the most intriguing characters ever seen on film.  The viewer may not empathize with Ada's situation and may even dislike her as a person but undeniably, she is a character who speaks volumes with her gestures without ever uttering a single word.Holly Hunter gives the performance of her career, portraying Ada with such strength that whenever she ""speaks"" through her piano, she has the ability to silence and/or mesmerize everyone around her, especially her lover Baines (Harvey Keitel).  As Ada's daughter, Anna Paquin is brilliant as the precocious girl who shows that she can match her mother's defiance and unorthodox attitudes in several pivotal scenes.Other than the top-notch acting, the cinematography is lush and breath-taking and Ada's music is sensuous and haunting. I agree with other viewer's comments about the music seeming out of place during this time period (1840's).  However, Ada was unconventional in Victorian society.  She could not play the ""proper"" music of the time as this would have completely stifled her creativity and inner voice.  Her compositions were her life force and without them, she could not survive.I think many Americans did not know what to make of this erotic film when it was released (after garnering high acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival), but it is a true work of art that should not be missed, especially by romantics.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

We didn't see an evolvement of any of them.  They seemed disjointed in personality and very anemic.For example, we see Stewart (Sam Neill), carefully taking a comb to his hair prior to meeting, for the first time, his new bride.  This shows an element of care and tenderness to please her.  Just because of his very practical decision to leave the piano behind on the beach because it was too much for his men to carry doesn't make him a bully.  Her obsession with a piano was not something he fully understood just then.  Then, as the story progresses, he turns into a ""Peeping Tom"" and a few scenes later, performs a very shocking and brutal act that was very unbecoming of what we knew him to be at first.Ada (Holly Hunter) is a rigid, cold-hearted, selfish, unbecoming bride who only knows how to stomp her feet when she doesn't get her way and sell her body for her real true love, the piano.  And how did she become mute?  She never could say.As for the third member of the bizarre triangle, Baines (Harvey Keitel), neighbor to the newly-weds, and a native tribesman would-be-but-not-quite, is an uncouth, ego-centric male who encourages Ada to prostitute herself out to him in return for her piano, key by key, of course.  But she holds her ground by indicating silently, ""only the black keys"".  ...What a bargain! A few scenes later we see him asking her to leave when she comes of her own volition because he only wants her to be with him if she truly cares.  Since when did he become so concerned for her feelings??I couldn't decide whether the scene depicting his school-boy interest in the hole in her black stocking that bore a dime-size portion of her stark-white bare leg was more comical or just plain ridiculous.Flora (Ann Paquin), seemed to take after her mother's disgraceful behavior with her bratty, selfish manifestations.  Seeing far more through the cracks in Baine's hut than she should have, this little girl didn't have much of a role model in her mother.The plot...anything said here may give too much away...that's how little there was to it.The only real depth to this movie was in the ocean, as the most colorful character in the story, the Piano, took it's final plunge (in what seemed more like a suicide after all it had been through) to it's watery grave where it could finally have some peace. ...Now where are those rotten tomatoes?",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Holly Hunter, who won a best actress Oscar for her performance in this film, shows her incredible acting skills with only her facial expressions and movement (except for the two voice overs at the beginning and end of the film, which were great too, of course).Her character has been mute since she was six years old, and this just gives the whole love story between the forcefully wedded woman and the poor Harvey Keitel character, a nice cherry on top. This film has so many powerful scenes and every scene adds to the story and gives us something new to learn about a certain character. Holly Hunter's Character, Ada McGrath has a daughter too, played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a 10 year old, which was probably the best child performance I've ever seen (with Jacob Tremblay for Room) and the scene *SPOILER ALERT* where Sam Nell's character cuts off Ada's Finger to stop her from playing the piano, after she finds out she's been sleeping with Harvey Keitel's character is truly one of my favorite scenes of all time. The pain Ada must be experiencing is extreme, but still no spoken reaction from her yet you can see how broken and physically/mentally hurt she is and the way Hunter portrayed that scene was when I realised that Holly Hunter is one of the best actresses of our time, truly magnificent.The ending is beautiful, yet disturbing, yet very powerful. I watched it over and over again!In the end, The Piano is a must-see movie for anyone who enjoys the art of motion pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A homage to exquisite film making,"We as film enthusiasts,often place to high an expectation on a specific film and almost always end up disappointed. Luckily ""the piano"" met every expectation in the book and than some.Each character in this film felt very tangible,to the point of losing oneself in the characters narrative.HollyHunter created such a presence,that her characters self imposed silence was the films own narrative.Every emotion imaginable manifested it self in Holly Hunters physical form so well,that the film revolved around her. Both Sam Neil and Harvey Kietel's roles provided such a contrast to each other.One was bound by his devotion to his duty as an archtypical husband and provider.The other,bound by his devotion to his instincts and emotions.Kudos to both SamNiel and Harvey Kietel for dilivering perfectly nuanced and complicated performances. Anna Paquin's character provided us with a view of a simple and uncomplicated existance that ultimately acts as a catalyst to films plot. Jane Campion herself showed such sensitivity in her writting and direction.Her astute handling of the films plot and vision provided us with a sence of realism that is both beautiful and ugly at the same time. Micheal Nyman's music score,gave the film its mood.The score moved like an artist brush stroke,leaving an exquisite after taste. This movie is quite simply the finest film made in the 1990's.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An insufferably pretentious movie,"I absolutely hated this movie.  I'm not against art films per se (I loved Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"", for example), but this opus came across to me as pretentious feminist claptrap (and no, I'm not anti-feminist). It is never explained why the Holly Hunter character is mute, so I suppose we're to understand that her muteness is a great big metaphor for the silencing of woman in a patriarchal world.  She expresses herself on the piano, OK.  But the music she plays is New Age treacle; it made me long to hear Rachmaninoff or even Cecile Chaminade (real romantic music, not muzak). The utter brutality of Sam Neill cutting off her finger is totally unprepared for, but in this oh-so-symbolic film we're not supposed to find any sense or coherence on the realistic level, are we? (compare Dante, who works on both levels). By that point in the movie I was so exasperated by Hunter's utterly self-centered character that I wouldn't have cared if Neill had cut off her head!  Harvey Keitel's native character is merely absurd when he makes love to the hole in her stocking.  But after all, he's the ""noble savage"" who is so much more sensitive than the plebeian white exploiter of the natives that Neill represents. Since the native women mock Keitel as ""old dry-balls,"" I suppose he's been saving himself for a truly western-style romance with Hunter, like something out of an 18th-century sentimental novel. At the film's end, when Hunter is tempted to follow her precious piano to the bottom of the sea, I was really hoping she would. But, of course, she has to AFFIRM LIFE and struggle back up to the surface of the water. To quote Fenimore Cooper's Chingachgook, ""Ugh""!",3.0,Anonymous,Music
An astonishing film with perfect performances,"""The Piano"" is certainly the best movie I´ve seen in my whole life. I really recommend it for everybody, and I´ll explain why in the following lines. That´s a movie full of details and it must be seen more than just once. The screenplay is intelligent, stunning and sometimes dark, full of mystery. The direction (Jane Campion) has really contributed to making this movie so good as it is. I really regard her as the best live female director. However, who really makes this film the best one I´ve ever seen is Holly Hunter´s performance. Her role as a mute pianist is amazing. Every time I watch the movie I just don´t believe my eyes. She really made Ada McGrath a live person, with desire, pain, silence. I was so stupefied during the scene she loses her finger. Holly made Ada´s pain beyond tears. ""The Piano"" is a single experience which nobody should leave behind.",,Anonymous,Music

Spectacle of Art; One of the Best Movies of the Decade,"One summer, I watched two movies ostensibly involving pianos. The first was 'The Pianist,' a fine if not extraordinary Holocaust picture that I feel gets a bit more love than it deserves, though it does get far better in the second half. The second movie was this one. It concerns a mute girl whose only voice is her piano, as well as her daughter, played to Oscar gold by a young Anna Paquin.Of these movies, The Pianist gave me about what I expected. If I hadn't seen Schindler's List first, I think I would have liked this movie better. But it is a fine picture that I will say is better than the movie that did win Best Picture, Chicago (though LOTR:TT is better than them both). This movie, on the other hand, gave me what I didn't expect. I don't know what I expected, but an artful, stirringly-shot film with characters that you get invested in that is also quite erotic is not it.Especially the erotic part. It is done well and I liked it alright but it did surprise me. Part of that is because I live in America, a country with no problem showing mass amounts of violence but that hates showing natural sexuality. I could describe this in detail but I see no reason to do so when so many people have done so already.What I will do is take a bit of time to completely destroy the argument that sex and violence in movies can be gratuitous. Bear with me. As a writer, I know that gratuitous means unneeded or unnecessary. But think about that for a second. By that definition, do you know what else is gratuitous? Vacations. Fancy food. And fiction itself. Sex and violence are no more gratuitous than good characters and writing. If you don't like ample portions of sex and violence in fiction, fine. But don't call it gratuitous. Because it's not. Instead, we should judge whether or not it adds something to the tone and desires of the film. More likely than not, it does.Certainly, it does in this movie. I'll try not to spend too long talking about this because there is a lot else that I want to get to. But sex is not glamorized here. There is simply carnal passion between the characters. But it is not simple at all. It addresses it complexly, which it is. All and all, it rings true.And it is as these points above all else that it is clear that this film was directed by a female, one of too few major films that is. I'm not saying that she does a better or worse job at these scenes because of her sex, but it is definitely different. And educational for me. As a male, I do not automatically see things from a woman's perspective. This opened my eyes somewhat, as many good movies tend to do.If you watch these scenes of passion, you see that warm colors dominate. Saturated reds and oranges take center stage, as opposed to the outside scenes, which are shot with cold colors. Those being saturated blues and greens. I am always a fan of this sort of chromatic differentiation when it is done well, a major reason why I love Soderbergh's Traffic. Also notice that whether the colors run hot or cold, they always run distant, a choice that I do believe helps with the cold, intermediary, almost purgatorial feel that the film is going for. It the second best thing about this movie.The best being Anna Paquin's performance. Though only a ten year old girl at the time, Paquin pulls off the best performance of her career and the best performance of the film in general. As well as the most important. Her innocence and naivete adds a certain light to a movie that can at times get dark.There were times when I was about to fade off into the dark blues of the cinematography, but Anna brought be right back. And that's not to say she's only an ingenue. She comes off as a legitimately driven, hopeful, real young girl. To the film's credit, they don't even make her Superman-perfect like they do for so many kid characters. She is the main reason her mute mother, played well by Helen Hunt in an Oscar-winning performance, suffers a catastrophic physical setback that I won't go into for sake of spoilers but that is quite traumatic. This is one of the best performances by a child actor ever. That actor is deserved.Not that the other performances are bad. Other than Helen Hunt, Harvey Keitel is also spectacular. Sam Neill, otherwise known as 'that guy from Jurassic Park', is okay but is the worst performance in the film. That guy just doesn't have any charisma.And I will not forget to mention the soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard. It's like an Avengers soundtrack, made up of some of the best pieces in history, particularly the theme, which I listen to every time I want to get immersed into life.Just like the piano brings out the heart and soul of our mute main, this movie brings out our heart and soul. If I could, I would give myself up to this film. Let it play some music on my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Excedingly powerful contrast statement of time period mores vs lovers,"the true to life, minor explicit love scenes are off set by the power of a solitary decision of George to understand 'his' woman's secret passage. He shows himself as dearly man, by using his sleep shirt to wipe down the piano. he takes the bodice of Ada's dress and smells it---this is a realistic practice in heart matters.the story is based on empathic levels of man and woman on the animal level. the power of biochemical smells (pheromones) are used well in this film. Bains' intent is of a loving, wanting man using a man's mind to barter. The woman understands but is cynical. VERY well done.you see this movie, you are asked to look beneath cultural veils and to focus on the rawness of sincere passion. this is a ""romance"" put in perspective"". just update the tribal cultural into timeless expectation.before i borrowed it from my neighbor, i never even HEARD of THE PIANO.

The most grown-up film without being depressing,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Piano. I believe that there is a movie somewhere out there that suits every person's personality. I found it with the Piano and I believe many others will too.Quiet and hypnotic but at the same time bubbling over with emotion, eroticism and atmosphere, it is as un-Hollywood as a film can get - the plot is insignificant, it only sets up the atmosphere. There is not a hint of Jane Austen in this. It's all Wuthering Heights mixed with Jane Eyre mixed with Lady Chatterfly's Lover on the background of Dances with Wolves.The eroticism in the film is the most frank, mature and realistic I've seen. At the beginning of ""The bargain"", I expected to be disgusted. Instead, I was pulled into elaborate, prolonged foreplay, every moment of which and the outcome is erotic. Makes you think of just how immature Hollywood's approach to sexuality is in comparison.The film is almost perfect. My only criticisms are the violent incident at the end which is utterly out of character both for the film's tone and the character which commits the action. The second is that George's disinterest in Maori women who throw themselves at him just seems a little convenient.While I'm not completely convinced Anna Paquin deserved the Oscar, she was remarkable in this - instead of being cute, she was plucky and brought energy to every scene.",,Anonymous,Music
"Hunter, Dryburgh and Nyman Perfect Campion's Masterpiece","While the over-stylization may make some audience forget that the film is about the silence and the violence that women have had to suffer, Jane Campion orchestrates Holly Hunter's acting, Stuart Dryburgh's filming, and Michael Nyman's scoring (whose post-minimalism style is absolutely impossible to have existed in the 19th century, but who cares) so incredibly, so perfectly and so beautifully that everything else becomes irrelevant.The only defect I want to point out is the brief cartoon, which appears when Hunter's daughter invents the family history.

a difficult and wonderful movie,"I've read the previous comments about ""the piano"" and it seems to me there are a lot of confused and even contradictory ideas about this excellent and difficult movie. Somebody seems to believe that it's an ultra-feminist opus, on the other hand, somebody else wrote that women are here portrayed as animals, without a real will; many people found it disturbing and morbid, others believe that it's just stupid and arty.I'll try to explain here why these ideas are in my opinion erroneous. This movie is about people living in another ""world"", with more strict rules than in today western society (marriage arranged by parents were rather usual), a world where who didn't conform with those rules was an outcast.Ada is clearly a strong person and in many ways she doesn't act as woman in her position was expected to do in this period (she has even got an illegitimate daughter), she's a rebel but she doesn't realize that she's also prisoner of her own rebellion (see her dependence from the piano).I guess she consented to her marriage because she wanted to escape from her previous condition. Unfortunately, her rather wild nature isn't understood by her new husband, a good and moralistic man, who refuses to take her piano to his farm. It's true that her request is unrealistic and that the piano looks so out of place on this seashore ""on the other side of the world"", but the piano is Ada's life (and cage), her main way for communicate.On the other side, Baines, a man that lives as a Maori, is fascinated by Ada, he wants to ""conquer"" her through the piano (no prostitution, no violence! his approach is direct but he cares for her from the beginning). As the ""liaison"" between  them becomes deeper and more and more passionate, all the community gets to know it. Ada's husband, understanding that she really loves the other man, has a violent and wild reaction (but not that strange for that time), but, eventually, he decides to make free his wife.This strong love passion is the cause of the final Ada's ""rebirth"" , in one of the more upsetting scenes she ""gets free""  from the piano: now she's really on the way to be a independent human being.I really hope that everyone try to watch this movie with a more ""open mind"" and try to remember that it's set 100 years ago,  when behaviors and ideas had different standards. It's possible you don't like it but it isn't a dumb movie in any way.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Strikes a wrong chord,"Years ago, when foreign ""art"" films by the likes of Federico Fellini were all the rage, attracting attention even among the general populace, Mad magazine parodied these often difficult to comprehend films, suggesting that the more obscure the plot and the more ambiguous the actions of the characters, the more lavish the critics would be in their praise.  Alfred E. Newman and company also provided tips for their readers who wanted to make their own art film, something that was possible because, at the time, the more amateurish the production, the more authentic it was thought to be. There is nothing amateurish about ""The Piano,"" Jane Campion's film that, if not for ""Schindler's List"" would likely have won the 1993 Best Picture Oscar, and some might argue that it is not foreign since the characters speak English, but otherwise it meets all the requirements set down by Mad magazine for an ""art"" film:  It is obscure, ambiguous, and just plain stupid.The piano of the title is, I reckon, meant to be symbolic, but what does it symbolize?  The sexuality of the lead character, Ada?  Ada is a mute married to a man whose neighbor also has designs on her, but no matter how strong the passion both men feel, Ada's only satisfaction comes through playing that piano.  Her playing would seem to represent masturbation.  Men, of course, are brutes only interested in their own pleasure.  They don't make love.  They only have sex.  If Ada is to experience orgasm, she will, as dozens of women's magazines and TV talk shows will tell you, have to do it herself.Set in an ill-defined period that resembles the 19th century (at least the way it is usually depicted on film), the movie's costumes, cinematography, and set designs are very pleasing to the eye, as is Holly Hunter as Ada and Anna Pacquin as her daughter.  Though neither performance was deserving of an Oscar, both are quite good considering the foolishness of the script. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill as Ada's lovers are okay, too.  Still, like those ""art"" films parodied in Mad magazine, ""The Piano"" is simply nonsense--a ""woman's film"" (egad!) that bashes men as forcefully as Ada hits those keys.  It is as fashionable as ""political correctness,"" just as silly, and just as likely to be laughed at in years to come.",,Anonymous,Music

Hopefully the nadir of antipodean film,"The Piano is the prime, shining example of how a film may win great critical acclaim by combining a politically correct theme with an esoteric subject matter, despite having almost no other redeeming features. With the single exception of the rather beautiful (and genuinely allegorical) opening image of the Piano itself, sitting incongruously on a New Zealand beach, the film has nothing new, challenging or remotely entertaining (heaven forbid!) to offer. Holly Hunter's heroine's silence is a ludicrously contrived conceit, presumedly invented by Campion to force down her unfortunate audience's throats the notion that the most eloquent form of communication in this film is through music; I think we could have worked that out without it being so unsubtly pinpointed. As for the actual plot - well, it creaks and groans with so many improbabilities, anachronisms and eye-rollingly obvious symbolic gestures that this viewer was left puzzling, mouth agape, that even the most sympathetic critic could consider it anything better than embarrassing. I know it won universal acclaim at the time and remains a favourite for many, but the reasons remain entirely beyond me.

Disturbing and brilliant,"""The Piano"" is one of those rare films that reasonably intelligent and feeling adults can discuss at length while disagreeing with each other on whether the film is good or not. My boyfriend, with his British lit upbringing and reading habits, thinks the story doesn't hang together and finds nothing compelling about any of the characters. I, with my poetry and American fiction background, have plenty to think about regarding the wealth of themes and imagery woven into the film.The movie has to be approached thoughtfully. The clues to all of the ""problems"" reviewers complain of are in the film -- everything from why Baines would understand a message written on a piano key to why Stewart lost control when Ada didn't do what he expected. It's all in there, if the viewer can allow the film to emerge. (Reviewers complaining about the ""obvious"" symbolism make me think that they are victims of a rather rigorous and unfeeling literature teacher who has the emotional subtlety of a two-by-four. I want to urge those reviewers to forget the piano and what they think it ""stands for"" and instead start to notice the real images.)The film does us the favor of showing us from the beginning exactly how complex it intends to be -- combining a voice-over about silence and the strength of will, a statement that this woman has been married by her father to a man in New Zealand, a view of her tender care of her daughter and finally of her expressing herself on the piano -- and doesn't let up till the credits roll. Nothing is simple: not the relationship between Ada and Flora, or between Ada and Stewart, and certainly not between Ada and Baines.If you aren't prepared to give yourself over to a film, skip this one. It'll be a waste of your time because it won't fit into any preconceived notions of what constitutes a ""good"" movie.Otherwise, flow with it -- it'll carry you if you let it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Visually Stunning, Thought Provoking, High Emotional","The Piano is my favorite all-time movie. It is visually stunning, and the score is remarkable. People (men mostly)don't like it because it evokes emotions. It's a very intellectual movie and the contrasts are amazing. Ada (Holly) has been married off to an unknown husband in a new world, by her father. Her husband doesn't understand her and lives in a house that destroys the New Zealand nature much like he destroys that which he does not understand. Baines (Harvey Keitel) understands and wants to know Ada for who she is and he sparks her passion after he is sparked by hers. His house fits into the natural surroundings without destroying it. Two viewings are required to absorb all of the subtleties. Holly and Harvey and Anna are at the top of their form! You must be able to think and empathize with someone in Ada's plight--a woman essentially without choices during an era when women were possessions/cattle--to understand and enjoy this movie.  Ada didn't ask to be married to Alisdair.  Would you then call it a marriage? If there is no free will?  If there is no free will, then is it wrong to leave the marriage? For our puritanical society, with its hangups surrounding absolutes, this movie seems sacrilege, as marriage is an institution that is holy unto itself.This movie is so different from you typical Hollywood pabulum, that it shocking to many people.

Agonizing art-house drivel,"If D. H. Lawrence had been on a bad acid trip while writing ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" it might have wound up resembling this film.

All very symbolic, no doubt. Perfect fodder for the cappuccino-sipping, more-snottily-intellectual-than-thou yuppies that patronize such establishments. But did anyone notice how often the camera kept focusing specifically on people's ugly naked butts? With the exception of the little girl, just about everyone in this movie dropped their breeches and flashed their unclothed posteriors at the camera at some point. Possibly this is symbolic of some sort of bizarre anal fetish on the part of the director, but in the end, I felt as though I had been mooned by the entire adult cast of this film.

This remarkable and completely mesmerising tale of mute Ada (Holly Hunter) and her nine year old daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) is absolutely astonishing.

Breaks free from narrative conventions,"This is a captivating and powerful film from New Zealander Jane Campion, who had received rave reviews for An Angel at My Table in 1990. Here she has attracted internationally renowned actors Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel to portray out-of-the-ordinary interpersonal relations and human emotions in alien circumstances: settler New Zealand at the turn of the century. Campion's observations are poignant; how the reserved and apathetically civilized Brits are stripped of their sophistication and become absurdities when they find themselves in a society in which they don't know the norms. And in contrast, how the natives stand as their sensible, uncivilized counterparts. Campion's implicit satire is based on the contrast between how civilized people are expected to behave, and how humans behave instinctively.The lead character, the mute Ada (Holly Hunter), is full of complexities for us to interpret. And her young daughter Flora, played with amazing passion by Anna Paquin, is her complete opposite: uninhibited, expressive and unshaped by society. Her behaviour stirs up emotion, which is taboo in this world.The Piano breaks free from narrative conventions and presents its uncontrived characters and relations with confidence. The most conspicuous among the latter is the erotic relationship between Ada and George Baines (Harvey Keitel). Their peculiar attraction and lust for each other is wonderfully explored. This primitive force will always bring people together, claims Campion. And the same goes for the item in the title, which represents the only other form of expression that Ada realizes is not inhibited by morals and etiquette.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

This is no exception, and I suppose my only grievances, which are very minute to begin with, are inherent to what the movie was going for. The melodrama and the extremes in which characters act. The suddenness and strangeness of the romance, but given the period I guess it's more reasonable. My main praise goes to Holly Hunter and her superbly depicted character, a mute not without such fervor. I also love Harvey Keitel in everything he's been in, and this was no different, however a much subtler role than I expected. Sam Neill was great, too, and I wished he'd been nominated for a supporting role. The cinematography was bleak but not boringly so, and the ending was most poetic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"A remarkable film, though the story wanders a bit","It's a historical romantic drama in remote New Zealand in the mid-19th century. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) and her six-year-old daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), land on the shore in New Zealand, along with Ada's piano. Ada has been mute since age six and communicates through her daughter. Ada has agreed to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill), who is trying to acquire land in New Zealand. He works with the help of local Maori people and a former sailor, George Baines (Harvey Keitel). George is British but has mostly integrated into Maori life.The movie follows the relationships of Ada and Alisdair, Ada and Flora, Ada and the piano, George and the piano, and George and Ada. Ada is obsessed with the piano, an obsession that Alisdair ignores. George is obsessed with Ada through the piano. Flora tries to balance her life between Ada and Alisdair. In the background is a small group of British settlers trying to maintain their culture in this isolated place. These people include Aunt Morag (Kerry Walker), Nessie (Genevieve Lemon), and the Reverend (Ian Mune).""The Piano"" is a remarkable film in many ways, though the story wanders a bit, and the ending is much too facile. The scenery and Campion's direction are artful and beautiful. Hunter, Paquin, Neill, and Keitel are all excellent. The Alisdair Stewart character is remarkably, perhaps unrealistically, restrained until the end. Hunter emoted wonderfully just through her eyes. Although her voice narrates a bit in the film, her character never speaks. Keitel does rough-hewn very well. Paquin provides tremendous energy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie of many passions,"This classic from 1993 was director Jane Campion's big breakthrough, earning her an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, among many other awards. Set in the depths of a primeval forest in New Zealand, the film impresses with outstanding direction, visually very attractive shots and a great cast, in which the two female protagonists stand out.The Piano tells the story of the young pianist Ada, played by Holly Hunter, who has been mute for years after a fatal accident. Her great supports in life are her piano and her beloved daughter Flora, played by a very young Anna Paquin. The chemistry between these two is one of the great revelations of the film. The affection and the unique way they interact they have for each other feel very genuine and the love between the mother and her child is one of the many passions this film communicates. Paquin plays enormously mature for her young age and uses a very authentic Scottish accent in her many dialogues, especially when she translates and speaks for her mother. Sam Neill plays Alisdair Stewart, the man to whom Ada is forced to marry. His loyal companion and business partner George Baines (Harvey Keitel), turns out to become his greatest rival and adversary. Ada is torn between the two men, which leads to wild conflicts and the development of aggressive masculinity.What the film basically tells us is the journey of a seemingly helpless woman trying to fulfil her desires. We explore this desire up close and personal throughout the film thanks to the fantastic Holly Hunter, which makes it a very intimate affair. Largely an erotic romance, The Piano develops into a kind of psychological thriller at the end, showing what a breach of trust can do to you. All this makes this film quite hard to watch at times and it ends rather abruptly, coming out of this emotional chaos. But that doesn't change the many positives, especially the beautiful aesthetics, which definitely prevail in The Piano and make it a film classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fearless and inspiring in its representation of the female gaze, the reticent desire for intimacy, the feel of an inhospitable land and the atmosphere of a distant world","The characters: a ""mute"" woman married against her will, a husband who doesn't understand sign language, an illiterate lover, a daughter who doesn't understand adult language, Maori extras who don't understand the West. The setting: a swampy island where the only way to get around is to put logs in the mud. It's a movie that wouldn't even need a premise to generate tension.In the mid-19th century, Ada (Holly Hunter), a Scottish woman, is sent by her father to New Zealand, where a wealthy man has bought her hand in marriage. At the beginning, we see her arrival on the wild coast of the new homeland accompanied by her most important possessions, her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her piano. Ada has been mute since childhood and no one, not even she, knows the reason for her silence, with the beloved piano becoming her voice, while Flora is the interpreter that allows her to communicate with the world. After a night spent outdoors, Ada and Flora are welcomed there by the pianist's future husband, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill), who, due to the scarcity of men and ignoring the bride's pleas, leaves the piano abandoned on the beach. It doesn't take long before it becomes apparent that to Alisdair his wife is little more than a new possession. One thing is for sure, he doesn't understand her or accept her bizarre nature. Also missing is Baines (Harvey Keitel), another Scottish expatriate who lives with the indigenous Maori, but he is drawn to the mystery. So he buys the piano from Alisdair and convinces Ada to give him lessons, eventually forcing the woman into prostitution if she wants to be in contact with the instrument. Mutual attraction blossoms between the two, as Ada grows increasingly alienated from her husband and even her daughter.The fact is that this impossibility of communication generates powerful narrative possibilities. From the difficulty of expressing feelings and basic needs, to the brilliant scene where the natives attack the play for thinking that the ""bloodied"" women were in danger. Incommunicability that also amplifies the oppression in which Ada finds herself. Sold to her new husband, the frigid figure of Holly Hunter seems like a defense mechanism to arouse only a natural estrangement, adjacent to the fact that no one, not even she, knows why she chose to stop talking. The situation doesn't seem too bad as we realize that there is a certain patience in the actions of the husband, played by Sam Neil, but Campion's framing causes an inherent discomfort.As has become customary in Jane Campion's films, The Piano's main theme is identity. We could, for example, summarize the central conflict as a woman's struggle to preserve the autonomy over her body and voice, which the patriarchs of her life want to control. Look at her trajectory: Ada is sold by her father, bought by a man who sees her as little more than a symbol of her charity with an element of sexual gratification as a bonus, and forced into prostitution by Baines. At least the latter, when he realizes the monstrosity of his attitude, ends up freely giving the piano to Ada, who, in turn, is only able to reciprocate the Scotsman's affections there. In such a world, silence becomes the main weapon that the protagonist has to claim power over her person, even if unconsciously. The piano is the ultimate symbol of her freedom and the object she uses to define her entire identity. Paradoxically, this also creates a situation in which possession of an object represents an almost absolute dominion over Ada.Perhaps one of the questions that most instigates in the script written by Campion herself is this controversial relationship between Ada and Baines. Unlike her husband and even her daughter, who is often her mother's voice, the man is able to understand the soul of the pianist who speaks through the keys of her musical instrument. He is enchanted by her music, in a beautiful scene on the beach, when she plays with him still covered by the crate that brought him, creating different imagery meanings of the open scenario and the instrument stuck, just like how Ada feels there, in that land, suffocated even outdoors.Enchanted by the newly arrived woman, he acquires Alisdair's piano in exchange for a piece of land. In this way, he puts into practice his plan to stay close to Ada, under the guise of her giving him music lessons. Ada accepts because, after a set amount of lessons, George will give her the piano. Gradually, he seduces the woman, and gets from her the sex she never allowed her husband. The film masterfully works the contrast between George and her husband Alisdair. Despite having no education - he can't read - George is sensitive. Therefore, he lives harmoniously with the natives, the Maoris. Above all, it is his sensitivity that conquers Ada. Campion's camera wanders through that room, to the sound of the piano in an extremely sensitive way, giving us the exact feeling of discomfort that is diluted in a complicity that ends up touching when witnessing the meeting of these two souls.The performances are a highlight of the work, starting with the little Anna Paquin who manages to convey truth in her scenes. A child in such an adverse situation that he builds his own emotional confusion between mother, stepfather and that man, who seems intruder. The little actress impresses with the weight of the dramatic load that the character Flora imparts to the story, being a key figure in the direction of the plot. Holly Hunter, on the other hand, without saying a single word on stage, only in voice over, manages to convey all her character's anguish in looks and gestures. The way she plays the piano is also special, we can see that it is not just decorated fingerings of notes, but a genuine expression that gives us different emotions.The central theme is explored through what is not told or exposed to us. In this case, Ada's self-imposed muteness is the mystery that positions the heroine herself as a kind of black hole of information. It's hard not to feel compassion for Ada, and it's truly easy to sympathize and understand her reactions to the injustices that befall her, but we can never say that we understand who Ada really is. Thanks to the wonderful work of Campion and Holly Hunter, Ada is a cipher and a well of contradictions that, even so, never seems like an abstract or a vacuum stylization, but rather an incomprehensible complicated human being of flesh and blood.The director exploits in the compositions by rejecting the politeness that the Victorian era and her flag-bearer dresses suggest. The colors are sucked in, and the absence of heat in the external spaces reminds you of the desolation, and the humidity, of the place. But if what she shoots is abrasive, how Campion connects the shots generates a volatility that makes the narrative unpredictable and magnetic. Editing's manipulation of space (by Veronika Jenet) reflects the tortuous landscape, sometimes hiding the camera behind branches that rhyme with fingers covering the eyes of the film's foreground. When Ada goes to meet her lover (in this case, the piano), she has to go up or down, and the impression is that she is always about to fall.The photography of The Piano, by Stuart Dryburgh, impresses due to the use of strong tonalities that manage to perfectly highlight the beauty of the island where the film is filmed, with intense green tones and a dominating sea that keeps all the inhabitants in a kind of cloister. The costumes manage to evoke the supposed spirit of the 19th century, where the ladies wore dresses with long hems, showing all their shyness and modesty, while the natives of the Maori tribe used body paintings similar to those of the individuals in the film Utu (1983), preserving their idiosyncrasies. Against the arrival of other people to the island. Finally, it can be said that the art direction is excellent, with special care regarding the architecture of the simple huts in the place and the colors used in the scenarios. Michael Nyman's soundtrack manages to convey sentimentality, especially in the brutal scenes, where the combination of classic slow motion and the characters' plaintive expressions enhance this drama even more.The Piano, despite being a small, independent, unpretentious film, received eight Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Directing, Actress, Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Editing, Cinematography and Costume Design. Of these he won three: Best Actress (Holly Hunter), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), and Best Original Screenplay (Jane Campion). All deserved, and in addition to the Oscar, The Piano competed in 1993 at the Cannes Film Festival in five categories, winning two: the award for female interpretation for Holly Hunter, and the Palme d'Or, making Jane Campion the first woman to win such an award.This adult fairy tale, about a woman's personal odyssey in search of mastery over her own identity, voice and destiny, is a voracious predator, always looking for opportunities to tear us apart with its monstrous emotional investment to leave us in awe. In front of the screen. Fearless and inspiring in its representation of the female gaze, the reticent desire for intimacy, the feel of an inhospitable land, the atmosphere of a distant world, this is a film born to break barriers and redefine cinematographic parameters. A film at once so simple and so monumental in its ambitions, themes, history and formal solutions, that we can only leave movie fans a genuine appeal that, if they haven't seen this masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The piano is her voice,"Ada (Holly Hunter) is a single mute woman with a young daughter (Anna Paquin) who is to be sent from her homeland Scotland to the far away New Zealand to marry a man she has never met in her entire life. When she has arrived with her daughter and her precious piano, they are left on the shore. Later on, her newly-wed husband, Alistair Stewart (Sam Neill) sells her piano to a neighbour, George Baines (Harvey Keitel) in order to make a deal about his land. This shatters Ada's heart completely.Baines begins to try making arrangements with Ada- getting her piano back by giving him piano lessons. Ada reluctantly agrees. However, soon she finds out that Baines wants more than this. Their relationship turns into something inexplicable and all parties involved end up in destructive, turbulent consequences.The piano is Ada's voice and her inner passion. She is a victim of a loveless marriage, lust, burning and boiling longing and jealousy. The film explores one woman's desire and sexuality in an achingly romantic way. The colour of the movie is sombre, which fits the story perfectly. For Ada, true love is found in the most unexpected, unconventional situation. The plot is filled with passion and seeking fulfillment. Brilliant directing by Jane Campion and powerful performances by Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin. This is a must see.",,Anonymous,Music

"An exceptional, powerful modern classic","There's a searing, passionate fire underlying the picture, a torrent of terrible human emotion that ever threatens to wholly overtake the proceedings with dark, unseemly, and uncomfortable flavors. Yet even at that: 'The piano' is astonishingly beautiful, and unfailingly spellbinding. Janet Patterson's costume design is wonderfully fetching, alongside superb production design and art direction; with the gorgeous filming locations in tow, the period setting is firmly established. Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is warm, vibrant, and dynamic, even as a certain coolness otherwise pervades the feature in the relationships between characters. It's deeply gratifying to know the efforts that were taken to make the tale as true and real as possible, such as drawing Maori influence into the picture, coaching in dialects and sign language, and having the stars contribute their own playing of the instrument to some degree. And Jane Campion's direction is utterly impeccable, orchestrating shots and scenes, and guiding her cast, with a brilliant polish that makes the lighter moments all the more lovely, and the grimmer moments ever more difficult - elevating the drama at all times to a level exceeding even its inherent gravity.Across the board the performances are outstanding, including even Harvey Keitel, who one is quite used to seeing in roles far gruffer (e.g. 'Bad lieutenant'); it's always a pleasure to see Sam Neill, as reliable as any actor could be, even when he turns as fiercely commanding as he is here. I've been a fan of Anna Paquin ever since her wonderfully strong portrayal in 'Fly away home,' but I was somehow unaware that she not only starred here but won major awards at only 11 years old. It's easy to see why, for though Flora is but a child she is distinctly precocious and smart for her age, and Paquin demonstrates marvelous intelligence and nuance that can't be said of all child actors. And still she is handily surpassed by Holly Hunter, who without one word of spoken dialogue shows immensely powerful yet subtle range and controlled personality that is surely one of the chief highlights of the movie. This is, and should be, one of the primary highlights of her career.And even still, as if it were possible, Campion's screenplay is exactly on par with the tremendous, unswerving excellence, if not rising higher still. It is perfectly balanced in all ways, not least between facets both light and dark. While Ada is unquestionably the protagonist, characters nonetheless receive equal treatment, and all exhibit meaningful depth and complexity; Hunter, as Ada, is given boundless room to emote and express and demonstrate her interpretation of the character, yet never feels so predominant that her costars are substantially downplayed by comparison. Not one word of dialogue is wasted, and everything has import and impact - and the same can be said of the scene writing, precise and carefully crafted yet leaving plentiful room for the cast to inhabit the space as they will and make it their own. And the narrative at large is simply a joy as a viewer, fantastically weaving together a variety of moods and story ideas with clarity, honesty, and purposefulness that lets every last trace of it ring out with greater significance than can be said for too many other pictures. The love scenes, the violence, the more even-keeled interpersonal drama, the beginning and the end are all penned with fastidious, wholehearted attentiveness that makes no part feel any lesser, and the entirety go down every so smoothly.Dare I even say that for all this, Michael Nyman's original score might still be the best part of all? It's really hard to try to claim that any one element of 'The piano' is superior to another, yet there's no denying how inescapably entrancing Nyman's themes are. It's no wonder that the soundtrack has found so much success in and of itself, for the music is integral to capturing the look and feel of the movie, and moreover the spirit of Ada as a character. Nyman is to be roundly congratulated for compositions that stand out so much in an already stellar title; for all the genuinely great film scores that have ever tickled viewers' ears, not many have necessarily had the same bewitching influence that his does. And maybe that's the real core truth of 'The piano' - in bits and pieces the feature can be deconstructed and seen for the fiction that it is, a production with various sundry inclusions that we've seen before and will again, actors and crew members just doing their job. Yet everything is put together at once very meticulously and very naturally with utmost love for storytelling and film-making, and the end result is a viewing experience that is outright captivating no matter how you slice it. Thirty years on 'The piano' feels stronger than ever, standing as tall as or taller than many works that have followed it in all the time since. Frankly, this is just a must-see, an exquisite beacon of cinema that continues to shine brightly. However you need to go about watching, this earns my highest, heartiest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I hate it,"The beginning is poetic and the music beautiful--piano is the way for Ada to express her feelings.   But the poetic feeling is ruined when Ada's passion for music seems lessoned and replaced by the earthly love.  And the writer for the story intentionally make the movie brutal and horrifying. And I can't believe Ada's reaction for her lost finger is just it!! As a musician, I wouldn't know how to live without being able to play the music as I wish any more.  This is a very disturbing movie--the worst movie I have seen this year (I watched a lot of movies, a lot). However, Ada's daughter, who possesses a special personality and lives in her own mystical world, left me a unforgettable impression.Overall, I regret watching this movie.  I wish I can erase it from my head.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful,"Contrary to many other comments, I found the film simply stunning. Yes, Holly Hunter plays a mute, and yes, this, obviously results in her having no dialogue, but I feel that Michael Nyman, the man who composed the score for the film, effectively becomes her voice via 'The Piano'. The music is beautiful, as is the majority of the acting. The violent and love scenes are made that much more poignant by her inability to speak. As a pianist I am probably somewhat biased, but if you appreciate the piano as an instrument at all you will find a depth in the film like no other. The soundtrack contributes hugely, and I found that the film complements the music, rather than the typical vice versa, but the combination is none the less profoundly moving.",,Anonymous,Music
Never Seen Quite Such A Horrible Film,"Well the Oscar nominations and wins are more than perplexing to me. This movie annoyed me almost immediately and continued to test my patience and temper until the absurd, laughable conclusion. None of the performances were particularly deep, interesting or credible. Not even close! Holly Hunter's character has got to be most bland and horrific b***h in cinematic history. She displays no warmth or personality except when she's being extremely cold and selfish. None of her actions made the least bit of sense, but none of the plot did either so in a way it evens out. Anna Paquin overacts to distraction and was a brat needing numerous slaps she never received. She betrays her mother and humps a tree and receives an Oscar. If that doesn't diminish the prestige of the award nothing will. The music was all right but certainly not memorable and doesn't jolt the viewer out of the lethargic tone the movie sets. Even the sex scenes are passionless and silly. Never mind how she came to fall in love with an unwashed simpleton who deceives and tricks her into cheap sexual favors to regain piano keys. I mean seriously, who is gonna fall for that nonsense other than Oscar voters and Jane Campion's immediate family. She has the directing ability of a snake trying to jump hurdles. Not impressed with any of her work, and this further solidified her incompetence. Harvey Keitel botches the worst fake accent you're likely to ever hear, and unfortunately we are treated to his bare butt on more than one stomach churning occasion. A dismal, dreary atmosphere pervades, but that alone is all right and appropriate to the warped theme of this atrocity. But the acting and what little dialogue there is was equally abyssmal. The natives were insultingly portrayed as vulgar moronic imbeciles. Sam Neil was the most confusing character. He apparently found brides in the Sears Roebuck catalog and cheaped out for a mute with no charisma, will, intelligence or beauty. And even though she treats him like dog upchuck he inexplicably falls for her. Uh huh.......that could happen. Nudity has it's place in film when tastefully done, but all the scenes in this movie were rather disturbing in an intangible way. Just made my supper rise, ya know what I mean? Classless. You know all this could have been avoided if he just went back the next day and got her darn piano! No deep message or life lesson, no redemming traits in the entire cast, and one bewildering scenario after another. I don't remember despising this film on previous viewings, but this last time aggravated me to rage. But I guess if The Deer Hunter can win awards why not this chunk of festering uselessness. I give a star for the nature shots, even though the lighting was awful. Whatever filter they were using was just another bad idea in the execution of this As far as all the old ladies that lived in the community, they added nothing to the film in the least.

The Piano Is Off Key,"Wonderful performance by Anna Paquin... but I found myself asking, ""Why?"" What's it all about? This film plods on and never finds it's footing. Just when you think it might get interesting, It starts to plod along again. I also believe that too many times films can get a little too complex for the viewer but in The Piano's case it's just too simple. A woman goes to, where?...Borneo or someplace to live with her new husband. She doesn't speak which lends itself to the non-original, done in film a hundred times ""Is she touched in the head?"" talk around her new home. Her little girl has to interpret. Hunter shows no emotion whatsoever, neither does Sam Neill, her husband. He basically just leaves her alone.

Worst, the director isn't fit to the task : highly (and ugly !) colorization, too much close-ups and not a good eye for the sets !

About the story, it was an unoriginal triangle love story ! I'm not a clairvoyant, but you can easily predict all the movie. About the cast, the Oscar for Paquin and Holly are really unjustified ! If Paquin won it, why not Heather O'Rourke (« Poltergeist »), Culkin (« Home Alone »)!

The main characters are so self absorbed and mostly devoid of any semblance of decency that it is hard to sympathize, empathize, or relate to any of them, even the long-suffering pianist. One scene of abuse (verbal, emotional, or physical) is merely a lead in to another or frequently an even worse situation. New Zealand was no doubt a harsh place in the last century but this movie took it to the point of overkill. Should all movies have a `Brady Bunch' type of feel or ending? NO!! But this movie went to the equally bad extreme on the other end of the scale. The only thing I found myself caring about was for the movie to end. It was a waste of celluloid. 1993 must have been a poor year for Oscars since this received a best picture nomination.

An awful movie,"There is so much that is wrong with this movie. It's atmosphere is grim from beginning to end, for no real purpose. Harvey Keitel, a wonderful actor in certain types of movies, is almost comically miscast here. Holly Hunter, normally a very verbal actress, is called upon to keep her trap shut through the entire movie. Why is she a mute? It seems that Jane Campion is trying to make some sort of feminist point here about the silencing of women--why do feminists feel like they have to make an entire movie in order to bludgeon us with a political cliche? And there is absolutely zero chemistry between Hunter and Keitel, even as they're compelled to grope each other for the cameras.Then there's the music. What period is this supposed to take place in? I would guess 19th century by the costumes, but Hunter's character plays the piano in a style more appropriate to a New Age street performer in Seattle than anything from that century. And it's truly bad music, adding a tinge of schizophrenia to the overall gray mood. Watching this is a truly dreary experience.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

If it wasn't that I'm principally against it, I'd surely fallen asleep watching it.

Great Soundtrack / Bad Acting,"It is amazing how a soundtrack can blind the audience. The first 20-30 times that I saw The Piano, it was from a projection booth with only the clicking of the projector for sound. I could not hear the soundtrack. I quickly realized why Jane Campion (writer/director) fought with her producers to have Holly Hunter removed. Try watching the movie without sound and you will see it also...When Holly wants to portray sadness, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she wants to portray happiness, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she is excited, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she is scared, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. Throughout the film, she doesn't change a single bit. What does change is the soundtrack.After being tortured with this film for a month-long run at the theater, I finally saw it on video and I thought it was OK. The soundtrack makes the film. It makes it appear that Holly Hunter can act.So, all in all, I'd suggest just getting the soundtrack and listening to it. However, you won't get a very brief shot of Harvey Keitel's penis. I was utterly amazed at the number of people who came to the movie just for a few frames of an ugly guy's penis.Side note: One woman told me that she was planning to rent the movie, but she stopped watching art movies after the 'cutting off the finger' scene in Farewell My Concubine. I really wanted to tell her she would love The Piano, but I was nice. I told her to go get a snack when Sam Neill got the axe.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Gives the disgusting message: ""It's okay to abuse women""","""The Piano"" gives the message: it's okay to abuse women because they will end up falling in love with you anyway. There have been famous trials where the keepers of ""sex slaves"" have held their defense as being that their captors fell in love with them, so what they did was justified. This is the same message that is given by ""The Piano"". In the film, we are supposed to believe that a woman is ""forced"" to marry a man that she doesn't care for, as if she had no choice; thus, women are portrayed as animals rather than humans - having no free will. Like the movie ""Radio Flyer"" which had abused children overcome their victimization through fantasy, ""The Piano"" has the woman take out her frustrations by playing her piano. She insists that it be taken to her new home - a remote location. Her will seems to be strong here, even though we are to believe that her will was not there when ""forced"" into marriage. Incidentally, she is mute but obviously not deaf. She further ""escapes"" being with her husband by taking piano lessons from a man that begins molesting her - played by one actor who could pull this off (Harvey Keitel). We are given a very clear message that she cannot stand this - which seems right. But, suddenly, she falls in love with him. He is slimy and sleezy. Her husband finds out, but, surprisingly, he doesn't seem to mind - he hides in the piano to watch their goings on. But then he forbids her to see him. She writes him a brief love-note which her husband intercepts and reacts violently to this. Hmmm...he didn't mind watching them in the act, but when he finds out that she writes him a love note, he goes mad? Strange. I won't give away how the story ends; you are probably sick to your stomach already. No film could paint such a degrading view of women. The film is pro macho man and anti-woman. Its only redeeming value is the beautiful music and symbolism of the piano which seems to be the source of all the evil. (2 out of 10)",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Out of tune,"Holly Hunter, without saying a word, turns in a remarkable performance in The Piano. It's a shame that performance is stuck in such an unremarkable movie. This is a slow, plodding, grim and quite dull movie. Hunter creates a compelling character but the movie really has very little else going for it. The whole thing is rather pretentious. This is a tough movie to get through.The story unfolds in the mid-19th century. Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute Scotswoman who has been sold into an arranged marriage to a New Zealander, Alisdair Stewart. So after a long journey Ada comes ashore in New Zealand. She brings two very important things with her. Her young daughter, Flora. And her piano. Playing the piano is the way this woman who cannot speak expresses herself. She pours her heart into her piano playing. So suffice to say her relationship with Alisdair gets off to quite a rocky start when he decides he can't be bothered transporting the piano to his home and leaves it to rot on the beach. This is not going to be a happy marriage.Alisdair ends up selling the piano, which mind you isn't even his, to his neighbor George Baines. Ada is of course enraged. Further enraged when Alisdair orders her to give George piano lessons. George is a very simple man. He can't read. He has adopted many of the local Maori customs, including tattooing his face. Why does this crude man want to learn how to play the piano? Well he doesn't. He wants Ada. He just wants to watch her play. They come to an arrangement where she can earn her piano back by letting him do things while she plays. And the things George wants to do are not at all innocent. Maybe he'll start by just looking up her skirt. But before long they're naked and in bed. Well, what's a girl to do when she wants her piano back, right? Anyhow, this whole arrangement goes badly because George actually has affection for Ada but she's just using him to get her precious piano. And of course there is the small matter of Ada's marriage to Alisdair. That loveless marriage, with its complete lack of affection, greatly frustrates Alisdair. That frustration will manifest itself in rather terrible ways.This all seems like it could make for an interesting story but for whatever reason the movie just doesn't work. It is not entertaining at all. The whole thing is so bleak, perfectly matching its backwater setting. Hunter does so well to convey so much emotion without even speaking. You always know exactly what Ada is thinking, great credit to Hunter for being able to convey that. The role of Ada's young daughter turns out to be a critical one and Anna Paquin does well with it. Flora is an intelligent, mischievous little schemer and Paquin's performance is very good, very mature. An Academy Award was probably a bit much though. Whereas Hunter and Paquin shine the men in the picture don't come off nearly as well. Admittedly they're not helped by a script which gives them some rather clunky, awkward dialogue. Harvey Keitel plays George and never really seems comfortable in the role. Meanwhile Sam Neill's portrayal of Alisdair falls hopelessly flat. This is a movie largely about passion but it comes across as almost entirely passionless. It's a movie that is badly out of tune.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A weak story with no direction.,"Yes, I only just returned to this planet and saw for the first time 'ThePiano' on video and was hugely disappointed. Not only was theplot weak and unengaging, but the score which I used to love (andplay) became dull and overused. What we have here is the story ofa woman (Ada, played by Holly Hunter) and her daughter (AnnaPaquin) being married off to a New Zealand gent (why she isbeing made to do so and why he accepts her, despite her being amute is unconvincing and largely ignored). She plays around withanother man, her husband finds out and quite frankly, it all ends intears until she leaves him. The actual message that the story isdelivering is unclear; is it simply telling a story of events? - If so itdoes so tediously and without depth. Is it a political exercise in therole of women in that time? If so it does so poorly, as Ada is clearlya poor decision maker and both men are certainly mysogenistic.Ultimately she becomes content with one of them - the one whoinitiates their relationship by selling her piano back to her byrequesting  she let him do things to her that she allows - clearlythere is no female empowerment here. Or is it simply a film aboutsurvival - i.e. the survival of Ada against the brutality  and neardenial of her only passion (the piano)? If so, you could simply havewatched the last ten minutes of the film and got the samemessage.Ada was a flawed character, but these flaws were deliberate andobvious (why didn't she marry her daughter's father?) and alsouninteresting.I don't remember what the other film competition was that year, buthow this one the amount of awards it did is unbelievable.

Whatever,"In order for me to enjoy a character based film like this I must have some reason to like the characters.I loved Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Sam Neill but even though I normally really like Holly Hunter and her acting was good, what is there to possibly like about her character. She is a self absorbed jerk who acts like a spoiled little slut (I hate that word but it is appropriate for description). The way she treated Sam Neill was deplorable. She even tries to kill herself at the end and leave her daughter an orphan. I was hoping everyone would get as fed up with her crap as I did and leave her in the woods! Then we wouldn't get to see anymore of her selfish tantrums. Why is it that we as men are suppose to fall for any woman in any movie as long as she is not half bad looking. No matter how badly women treat men, they get away with anything and men are portrayed as buffoons that are to just put up with it.

"A woman married off to one colonist in 19th-century New Zealand is seduced by another, in a tale that becomes a trite romance novel","Jane Campion's third feature film, THE PIANO is a historical drama that tells of a Scottish woman, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter), who is married off to a colonist in New Zealand that she has never met. Ada is mute, a development that mysteriously came upon her in childhood, but she is a virtuoso pianist and her cherished instrument is one way she communicates her feelings to the world. As Ada and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) land on the shores of New Zealand's South Island sometime in the mid-19th century, her new husband Stewart (Sam Neill) ignores her sign-language entreaties to carry her piano inland along with their other belongings. Feeling no love for this man she has been forced to marry, Ada is drawn into sexual bargaining with another colonist, Baines (Harvey Keitel) who offers to get her the piano back if she does what he wants.The first half of this film is an interesting study in sexual power and the tragedy of a woman's lot during this historical era. Neither Stewart or Baines are admirable men; Stewart is uncaring of Ada's true passion for the piano, but Baines exploits her distress and powerlessness to get what he wants and he doesn't respect consent. Unfortunately, as the film develops, Campion decides to ultimately turn this into a straight-up romance novel, where the heroine willingly gives in to the roguish bad-boy. I realize that Campion might go for the common desire of a woman to feel desired, but that shouldn't come at the expense of glorifying a creep as she does here.To better serve as a foil for Baines, Stewart's squareness is played up, and the two characters are reduced to crude cutouts of a ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". This extends to a critique of 19th-century colonialism and racism: naturally, as the man who audiences are supposed to feel is disgusting and unattractive, Stewart is keen on stealing land from the indigenous Maori people. Baines, on the other hand, as the cool heartthrob, hangs out with the Maori and respects their culture even to the point of learning their language and tattooing his face.Well, even if the actual plot is a ridiculous pulp fantasy, the production values are fine. New Zealand's wild shore and rainforests are memorably captured by cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. The film has a distinctive blue cast that unites the thick cover of the forest and the depths of the sea. While some controversy remains about the depiction of the Maori people here, they are still given a great deal of screen time and the ability to speak their own language on film. The piano-heavy soundtrack by English composer Michael Nyman is deservedly celebrated: deliberately anachronistic, its saccharine, minimalist feel of the 20th century represents Ada's innermost thoughts.There is good acting as well. Anna Paquin, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Flora, and one wouldn't expect such mature composure and convincing emotions from a child of this age. Holly Hunter has to convey everything through gestures and facial expressions and she does this marvelously. One of the delights of Campion's feature debut SWEETIE was Genevieve Lemon, and here in a supporting role she turns in here a mildly comedic performance that adds some levity to the severe sexual drama.Seeing it again some two decades after it came out, THE PIANO feels like a rather slighter film than I remembered it, and it is difficult to understand what drew critics to the time to rave about it. I would really only recommend this to people with a specific interest in New Zealand or Michael Nyman's soundtrack, but I don't see this as an all-time classic.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Could've been good,THE PIANO is a totally bizarre film but doesn't quite click. It could have been a tender and moving masterpiece and I know some people think of it in that way but I don't.

Creepy and Unpleasant,"Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued me—so I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw.Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky start—complicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus""romance"" begins to blossom.You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a ""bad"", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Soft Focus Porn,"Beautifully shot by Jane Campion in a dreamy soft focus The Piano gives the impression of being a better film that it really is. Some mud, some misty woodlands and a few tattooed and grinning Aborigines do not disguise the Mills & Boon plot-line. No matter how hard the viewer tries to get some depth out of the story you come up with nothing. Is this a story of women's lack of voice in the world? No - Ada McGrath is a strong woman who communicates very well, despite not speaking. Is this a story about the desire to create or express ones self? No - the piano is used as currency for sexual favour which Ada McGrath wants as much as George Baines. The seduction scenes are titillating rather than romantic, and the film slowly becomes sordid.

The piano-shaped object,"As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Never trust a child,"Jane Campion likes the grotesque. In most of her movies some characters are distinctively weird in looks and behavior. The Piano is no exception. Main character Ada, played ferociously by Holly Hunter, is a bit of a freak. Stubborn and self-contained she ""decided"" to remain silent from age six and never spoke a word since.She also managed to produce obnoxious child Flora out of wedlock, so her father is packing her of from Scotland to New Zealand, where she will get married to Alisdair. The official story is that she is a widow. These are Victorian times, so there is nothing strange in sending Ada to the antipodes to cover up for her indiscretions.Once in New Zealand, Ada continues to make trouble, starting a reluctant affair with Alisdair's neighbor, George (Keitel, in another naked role). The fact is, Ada loves only her piano (her ""voice"") and Alisdair decided to leave it on the beach where she disembarked, while George decided to have it transported to his hut.Considering miles of uphill trekking on muddy ground, Alisdair's decision does not seem so unreasonable, but Ada dislikes him for this. Sullen and cold, Ada is sending conflicting messages to those around her. First she is shocked by George's fondling, then she is intrigued. Unfortunately, creepy Flora gets jealous, also shifting her alliance, but from Ada to Alisdair. Her action brings the movie to its climax. A sort of puzzling happy ending shows Ada insisting to have the piano dropped in the sea and attempting suicide, for reasons hard to understand.Some beautiful landscapes and hunting music hardly make up for the fact that most of the movie is shot in claustrophobic and dark rain forest and three out of four main characters are creepily weird.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ?

Not the most cheery of tales,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSFirstly I have to say that I'm bemused as to how Holly Hunter received an Oscar for this. She doesn't have any dialogue, therefore you would expect her to at least show off a facial expression or two. But no - she doesn't even have any of those in her locker, and instead maintains the same utterly depressing face throughout the entire two hours. To be honest, the whole story nearly bored me to death. To have the main character in the film as a mute isn't the best start, but we are not even offered any thoughts as to her predicament through the use of voice-over. Only at the beginning and end does her 'mind speak' and in all honesty I expected a lot more of this, particularly with the torment she suffers. Because of this, I couldn't sympathise with her at all as she was as distant to me as she was to the characters.It seems ambiguous as to why she is mute in the first place - the obvious and most intriguing explanation being that she is seeking attention. Indeed she decides at the end of the film that she wants to speak now, as the idea of mutism is simply brushed aside.The most discouraging aspect about this film on the whole is that nothing much happened. The pacing is extremely slow and laboured and in the end there isn't much to take from it. I'm still not sure how it received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture - very strange.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"So close, yet so far","I can think of a number of good things to say about this film. The two main actresses give stunning, fully Oscar-worthy performances. The cinematography is beautiful at times, though lacklustre in others. The piano music which fills the film is wonderful.But all these plus points can't save a film that is, sadly, lacking in so many crucial areas. This is very much a character-driven film, so when the characterization turns out to be so shallow and cliched, it's a crippling blow which the film can never recover from. It's to Hunter and Paquin's eternal credit that their hopelessly underdeveloped characters achieve the kind of life they do - the rest of the cast cannot match up, and leave their ""characters"" as mere cardboard cut-outs copied from any of a hundred other sources.It's a pity, because every once in a while this film does throw up some flashes of brilliance. Some scenes are genuinely, beautifully touching- unfortunately, they're rare gems in an ocean of drab. It's easy to see how this film could have been much, much better than it ultimately is, and that's what makes it all the more infuriating, because it's so close to being great, but ultimately falls far short.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The acting is great!,"The script is vague and rambles from place to place. When you finish watching it, you wonder what was the message was. Holly Hunter (Home for the Holidays) won an Oscar for her part, which she played beautifully, specially considering that she played the piano herself.  Oscar winner, Anna Paquin (Fly Away Home )  lights up the screen with her innocence and beauty. She loves that butterfly wing! The acting is good.  The photography is great! The sex scenes were too graphic for me and my household. But it is over all interesting, but I was unable to discern what the core issue was in the movie. After watching this movie the scenes really stuck to my head, I just cannot forget the graphic scenes. I guess they are traumatic scenes!",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Subject matter I myself cannnot see myself reading,"(1993) The Piano
DRAMAWriter and director did a exceptionally fine job! However, as a guy this is something what females enjoy watching, read from books and novels! Love triangle has mute woman, Ada McGrath (Debra Winger) of one being sent somewhere to an island with her piano and her daughter, Flora McGrath. In which we find out later, Ada was arranged to be marriage to wealthy Alisdair played by Sam Neil only for her to lust for someone else, in this case George Baines played by Harvey Keitel! The interpretation while watching this is that the character portrayed by Debra Winger through the eyes of director Jane Campion is that of superficial and would rather fall for a not so attractive person who can build a rapport than with a much good looking wealthy person such as Sam Neil is what I'm hinting at this simplistic love triangle is something I don't care to see! Well made, but is not for everyone and that includes me.

Average movie with a good cast,"This is a movie about a million year old story in a 19th century New Zealand setting. The plot which is predictable and dull, progresses with a very slow pace and nothing really interesting happens. The dialogs are scarce... well, for the obvious reason. On the positive side, the cast is strong and acting is good. The annoyingly indirect narrative is one of an artsy crowd pleaser with full of symbolism, which pretentiously attempts to cover plot holes of the story turning around 3 unlikable characters and a kid who merely acts as a messenger. In all this travesty, Maori folks are used as a room decoration. Harvey Keitel strikes again baring his butts and genitals for no apparent purpose. This whole mess is certainly a good consumption material for the artsy fartsy crowd who'd go rapturous to tell how much handy-dandy this flick is and decipher its subliminal messages. In reality, it is downright a borefest, although a certain quality cannot be denied owing to the nice scenery.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fine Movie, Excellent Soundtrack!","This is indeed a nice movie, not Jane Campion's best, but a good movie. I think the movie is a nice love story, doesn't deserve the title of 'Best Movie I've Ever Seen', neither the title of 'Worst Movie Ever Made'. It's maybe the biggest incursion of Jane Campion in the mainstream of the movies scene. But a big thing doesn't always means a good thing. For instance, 'Portrait of a Lady' was, for many, best than 'The Piano' but it wasn't mentioned as much as this one (at least not in Portugal...). Holly Hunter makes a good job with her role, but the best thing of her acting is the fact that she is actually playing the piano, and she really has the feeling. Sam Neill also acts very well, maybe better than Holly, but that may just be of his character, that has more feelings (no matter what feelings they are). Anna Paquin has the role of her life, at least because she has an intensive dramatic character, and she can show that on screen (it's not easy, with 9 years old). Harvey Keitel, he's a fabulous actor, needless to say that he has many better roles than this one (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs...many more). And finally, Michael Nyman. This is probably one of the best composers of his time, and maybe of all times. The musical score of this movie is a work of ART. It really is 'The Mood That Passes Through You'. I can hear this album over and over, without getting bored of it. It leaves you in a state of mind that I can't describe, it's amazing. I really recommend everyone that likes piano music to buy this cd, and to everyone that has this cd, buy other things from Michael Nyman, it's fabulous. 5/10 for the musical score.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Can we REALLY talk with our hands?,"Ada, is a very beautiful woman, but she can't talk... her language is the music (great piano in the soundtrack), and her deepest emotions, her whole soul just escapes from her fingers, through the piano chords. Another hands and touch language is brought to our eyes by Harvey Keitel, not on piano keys, but on human flesh! The scenario could be bypassed, music and fingers shows it all. And the landscapes! They are through the story, a perfect representation of Ada's feelings! Beautiful!",,Anonymous,Music

Hauntingly Beautiful,"Well deserved acting Oscars went to Hunter and Paquin and a screenplay Oscar for Campion.

a truly beautiful film.,"The performances in ""the Piano"" are absolutely magnificent.  This is the first Holly Hunter film i've seen, and she truly impressed me a great deal.Hunter is to marry by arrangement, a man she never met before (sam neil) and a man whom she would never learn to love.  She leaves her home, to New Zealand, along with her young daughter (anna paquin) and with her beloved piano, in which she is clung to, and the only thing she really loves. There in New Zealand, she meets Harvy Keitels character.  From there, Keitel understands that she cannot live without her piano, and they fall in love. This romance causes jealousy to Neil.  And so on.Everyone in this film is superb, especially by Hunter and young Paquin. Anna is really adorable, and her acting and accent are flawless, at such a young age!  Holly's performance haunted me. As her role required her to be a mute, and she didn't not say a word (besides her narration), i came to the conclusion that she is one of the best actresses out there, better than most actresses who actually have dialouge in their films.  Harvey proves to me, that he is a virtuoso actor, and he is more capable of more serious roles, not that i didn't enjoy him in BAD LIEUTENANT.  And Sam doesn't surprise me, as his performance was splendid.Everything else in the film was great, including the photography, the dark/bluish scenes, the direction, and especially the music.  Holly's piano playing is astonishing.  I strongly recommend this film!",,Anonymous,Music
Not Everything is Art,"Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited.If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion.Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful, troubling","This is a beautifully shot and composed film by Jane Campion, featuring a brilliant Oscar-winning performance by Holly Hunter. Hunter plays Ada, a woman who refuses to speak and does so only through her piano. She also has a young illegitimate daughter Flora, (Anna Paquin, who also won an Oscar), compromising her marriagibility in their native Scotland. Ada is thus shipped by her father to New Zealand and an arranged marriage to a troubled, sexually frustrated Alisdar (Sam Neill). Alisdar is having money troubles and as collateral to neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel), sells Ada's beloved piano. Baines agrees to sell it back to Ada if she gives him lessons, beginning a torrid relationship that sets off a chain of events that changes everything. Holly Hunter is brilliant as mute Ada, as is the very young Paquin. Keitel and Neill are also very good in their respective roles as the men in Ada's life. The nudity, sex and some themes in this film are unsettling to some, but overall this is a sumptuous, exquisite film about desire and the pursuit of happiness. A must-see.",,Anonymous,Music

beautifully passionate,"After reading some of the disparaging comments about this film, I was struck that those who don't like it managed to miss the intense passion conveyed in this film.  It's not a perfect movie, but Jane Campion was brave to write a film about a woman who refuses to compromise what she loves for any man. I admit I am still a bit confused about why Ada is so attracted to Baines after his initial actions towards her, but I relate completely to her need for her piano as an outlet for her feelings.  Anyone who feels strongly about something, whether it is music, writing, or even another person, should be able to relate to this movie in some way.  This is a film that speaks to those who desire intensity in their lives, who don't settle for anything less than complete satisfaction.",,Anonymous,Music

Sublime Brilliance,"I first watched this movie when I was 15 y/o and became deeply attached to it. It was one of my first 'art' movie, though I digress to refer to it as so. It was more than a wonderful artistic movie; it was a masterpiece.**SLIGHT SPOLIERS**Whenever I watch a movie I would rather NOT recognise the actors because this attitude leads to expectations. This was one of those movies, and their acting was simply brilliant. So was the cinematography. I still can see the moment when Hunter was left at the shores with the piano, looking very small and alone save for her oblivious daughter. The way Hunter sort of recoiled when Keitel touched her for the first time was as abrupt as the music itself... even I was jolted.And who could forget the stark contrast between Paquin's innocent costume and the climactic event that transpired between her mother and his stepfather? Against dark background, in pouring rain, she screamed as her mother reeled around in pain. It seemed to me now that she screamed *for* her mother, not at the terror of seeing her hurt.For those who scorn at this movie, I pity you. You had missed (or rather, ignored) the best 2 hours of your life. This movie is not hard to follow, nor it is plodding. It simply is, just like life.Someone here said that this movie is not to be watched with rationality in mind. I agree. This is not a rational movie at all. Why would Paquin, who all along had been supportive to the Hunter-Keitel relationship, change her mind while taking the key to Keitel? Why wouldn't Hunter say a word? Why didn't Neill shoot Keitel and Hunter while they were in bed, where they would have been the most vulnerable? Why did Hunter fall in love with someone who obviously uses her for sexual gratification? It's because human nature *is* not rational. See it for yourself in The Piano.",,Anonymous,Music
Hunter and Paquin are excellent!,"The Piano is depressing, but brilliant. If you can appreciate excellent acting, then you will love this film. Holly Hunter won an Oscar for her brilliant acting and Anna Paquin is nothing less than astonishing. Paquin is a naturally talented actress, this was just the beginning of an amazing career. The Piano is hard to watch, but wonderful to remember. Hunter and Paquin are superb. And anyone who understands the art of acting will agree. This film won the Oscar for best actress(Hunter), best supporting actress(Paquin), and best screenplay.",,Anonymous,Music

This movie was transforming for my husband and I.,"I am always amazed when I hear either neutral or negative comments about this masterpiece. The visuals, direction, acting, and themes were so powerful that, after viewing this film a number of times, my husband and I re-examined our marriage and we concluded that we loved, respected, and appreciated each other much more than we had realized.  After being together 15 years, we ""honey-mooned"" like we were newly-weds after our experience of this film. Even the relationship between the magnificent Anna Pacquin and her mother reminded us of the adoration and fierce devotion a mother and child can have.  I have always liked Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neil, but after this film, I see everything they make, as well as all the films of Jane Campion. This is by far, her showpiece.  To all of you who don't see the true art when you view this film, all I can say to you is what the main character in American Beauty told his audience in the end... (please excuse any mis-quotes, this is from memory...)  ""You probably think I'm crazy and you have no idea what I'm talking about. But don't worry, you will someday...""",,Anonymous,Music
Flows like a poem,"Ada (Holly Hunter) refuses to speak and loves her piano like nothing else in the world. She travels with her piano to New Zealand for an arranged marriage with Alisdair (Sam Neil) and arrives by boat on a beach. They can't carry her piano so it stays on the beach.Ada has a lil daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and a secret relationship with George (Harvey Keitel). This movie is all about the relationship between those 4. They story is kind of compelling, though it didn't quite move me (apart for several scenes that were quite touching). The acting is marvellous. Both Hunter and Paquin won an Oscar for their performance. I was especially very impressed with 11 year-old Paquin who gave a very convincing and natural performance.Most of all this movie is about its stunning visuals and music though. The movie flows like a poem. Especially the images outside are beautiful and music is some of the most wonderful I've ever heard in a movie. Summit for me of the movie is the beach scene. Hunter is playing the piano which is standing all alone on the beach. The song is absolutely wonderful and the images are poetic. Paquin is dancing as a ballerina to the beat of the music... SO beautiful. I've played the whole sequence about 6 times before I returned my tape. Definitely one of the best scenes I've seen.Of course since I just loved the music I got the soundtrack. Track 4 (The Heart Asks Pleasure First), track 6 (The Promise) and track 15 (The Sacrifice) all feature that wonderful theme (I think track 4 is the very version from the beach scene). One of the most beautiful tunes I've ever heard in a movie.All in all a rare and beautiful movie and one of the best movies of 1993.8.5 / 10",,Anonymous,Music
WATCH WITH YOUR HEART AND EARS,"I thought I would chip into the very mixed debate on this particular film. I must confess, I adore this film. I am not a great devotee of either the director or the cast but their combined effect is greater than the sum of the parts.Visually, it is a stunning piece of work - a succession of film canvases from sweeping landscapes to intimate portraits. Nyman provides fitting support with a score that picks up every sight and emotion.  Written to accommodate Hunter's capacity as a pianist, the score's concerto expansion builds upon solid foundations and is to be recommended. None of this really guides you to why some people rave about this film.This film may be about rampant feminism, Victorian values, the colonial backwaters and sexual repression but I doubt it.  I simply take it as being about love, all-consuming passion -passion expressed in music, in physical love, in longing, sacrifice and in pain.  Over analyse it if you want but I wouldn't dream of scraping the paint from a Turner any more than I would of deconstructing this film.Every time Ada encounters her husband in the woods her eyes open wide and I have fallen into them a hundred times.",,Anonymous,Music
"A good movie, likely for men, but made for women.","I love this picture, but I only watched it one and I haven't yet understand the reasons for several actions, or the reasons for several mute moments. Maybe is because I'm a man and this movie is obviously made for women, but anyhow there is something that goes beyond the words in this film (maybe that's why Ada never talks.)But atmosphere is the most important film, because is made in some old fashion that rarely appears in movies nowadays. Performances which focus on the expression. You can forget about the storyline because is what you are watching that should make you understand what's happening. The erotic scenes between Ada and her husband are 90% visual, his face reveals the desire and hers some sort of...I don't know. Women thing.Flora is great, and she is for some reason my favorite character because she is very believable as a child going through adult things. Watch it if you haven't and if you don't like it, I understand because is not a normal movie, and you have to be one of those persons who like thinking rather that watching only.",,Anonymous,Music

Overlooked film that doesn't deserve to be,This movie is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. By far this is Kietel's best performance.
