An absolutely incredible film!,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The Fellowship of the Ring:  Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension","The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Thank you Mr Jackson,"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow!,"Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"First, And Still The Best Of LOTR","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film,"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Embrace the magic,"It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the greatest films of all time.,"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal.Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done.The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting.I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Part One:  With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement.This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring.This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse.For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization.The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package.The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Masterpiece of visuals, but only visuals","'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is an epic, ambitious film in scope and magnitude, if not in heart. It tells the fantastic story of Frodo, a hobbit (small person) from the Shire in Middle Earth. The Shire is a peaceful place, as close to utopia as one might find. His peace is interrupted when the sorcerer Gandalf rides into town and discovers the secret to Bilbo's ring. Bilbo, also a hobbit, acquired the ring from Gollum - a distorted creature whose life has been elongated, but also deformed, by the mystical ring.When Bilbo leaves for adventure, it is Frodo's job to return the ring to the desolate Mount Doom and cast it into the fire from which it was made. This, you see, is the only way to destroy the ring. As a mere hobbit, Frodo cannot shoulder this burden alone. Along for the journey is his gardener and confidant Samwise, Sam for short. Two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, too immature for their own good, meet up with Frodo and Sam on their way to the magical land of elves.Once there, a ""fellowship"" is formed to destroy the ring. One of them is Aragorn, a ranger with a secretive past. He is the primary focus of 'Lord' other than Frodo and the ring. He is a descendant of the man who held the ring over Mount Doom and could not destroy it. He is in love with the elf Arwen but the backdrop of the times leaves that love affair in jeopardy.Sauron, the dark lord who originally created the ring, has found out its location and seeks out the hobbits, and later the fellowship, to take the ring back. Saruman, the secondary villain in the film, is Sauron's ""puppet,"" but also wants the ring for his own power. He is a sorcerer like Gandalf, but has turned to evil.Also in the fellowship, protecting the ring from Sauron and Saruman, is another man, Boromir. He is from the land of Gondor. Legolas is the lone elf representative in the fellowship. Elves are the fairest of the many creatures of Middle Earth and gifted archers. There is also a dwarf (slightly taller than a hobbit and certainly more robust) named Gimli. Dwarfs reside in mines, great connections of caves in the mountains through which the fellowship must journey in order to complete their task.It is difficult to summarize the plot of 'Lord of the Rings' because of the amount of information that is thrown at you. There are characters and their ancestors; different creatures in the elves, dwarfs, hobbits, and men. In addition to them there are the mysterious orcs, goblins, ringwraiths, uruks, sorcerers, and the creature all onto itself, Gollum. This complexity in setup and the numerous strands of plot to keep under control is the primary problem with 'The Lord of the Rings.' It took me up to three viewings to saturate all of this material and half way understand it.The triumph of Peter Jackson's labor of love is that you want to watch it indefinitely to soak in all of this splendor. The effects and settings are indescribable other than to say nothing this stunning has ever been featured on film before. Visually, the picture has no equal and will forever be understood as altering the way movies are seen. Unfortunately, to tell the story's backdrop, much of the humanity involved in Middle Earth is left on the back burner. In addition to that, there is a serious problem with pacing.The filmmakers seemed more interested in remaining faithful to J.R.R. Tolkien's original creation than they are in attempting to make a workable adaptation into a film. In that regard, there is a large battle sequence that feels very much like the climax of the film, but is then followed with upwards of an hour of more footage! This was the straw that led 'Fellowship' from being a great film into a good film. With that in mind, I am forced to think of 'Fellowship' as split. It is a masterpiece of visual technology and presentation, but married to a story that needs more heart and less intrusion of detail. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Maybe I missed something while searching for something on the floor to slit my wrist!,"I was taken to a midnight showing of the first Lord of the Rings movie. Like having sex for 3 hours with no orgasm I was completely disappointed. The movie was eye candy to behold.  The scenery and the amazing special affects were stunning.  I have not read the books, and frankly, I don't want to now.  I was so bored.  I almost began to cry.  I felt trapped in a movie which went from one foe to the next...to the next....to the next....to the next.....to the next....to the next.....to the next....and on and on and on, so long that when the main character noted ""I wish the ring had never found me,"" I agreed.  As the movie progressed different foes and challenges popped up as though they just magically appeared--Oh look we are stuck in these frigid mountains, no where to go.......it is OH so cold....what do we do? Oh, I know, lets take these mines here that just conveniently randomly appeared!  If you've read the books, you might enjoy the closeness, as I hear it has.  However, if you haven't...don't bother.  It is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long...TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring....and TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO plotless....and all this, for 3 hours and 10 minutes...and then, then THEN!!!  NOTHING!!!!! Wait until you can set aside 9 hours and watch them all at once, then at least it might be slightly rewarding.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great,"It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally.

Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film,"For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears.  The Lord Of The Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages.  NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right.  The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters.  This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"thirteen years on, still one of the greatest fantasy films ever made","Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A truly exceptional film,"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films.

Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10,"While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope.

It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I do not understand why this movie is so loved,The Fellowship of the Ring is praised by most critics and nominated for several Academy awards including Best Picture.  I have no idea why.This movie is visually stunning with great special effects and beautiful scenery but there is few other things worth watching in this movie.  The drama and suspense in this movie is corny and predictable.  I don't pride myself in predicting movies but there were several scenes that followed the stereotypical hollywood action movie routine.  The Fellowship (group of the good guys with the ring) has to get themselves out of several bad situations on their quest. Instead of solving these problems in an unpredictable interesting fashion they just give some of the characters an invincible superhero complex and easily fight their way out. The drama that is in this movie is no different than the predictable formula the rest of the movie follows.  Parts of this movie that are supposed to make me cry just made me laugh. One scene at the end of the movie when one of the characters dies seems to drag on for 20 minutes.Even the cute little joke occasionally thrown in this movie was never funny.  The acting in this movie was ok I guess.  Elijah Wood was good.  I like Ian Mckellan but in the beginning of this movie when he was trying to set up the plot he mumbled a lot and he was hard to understand. I give this movie a 4 out of 10 at best.  This movie was not that good and certainly doesn't deserve to be #2 on IMDB's top 250 list.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Middle Earth comes alive...in breathtaking detail.,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, ""Wow.""  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Oh... the brilliance that is Peter,"The more and more one thinks of it, the more one reads Tolkien and appreciates it, the more and more brilliant this movie becomes.  Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work...  I love this film! Tis Brilliance!A word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy.  Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron.  Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though.  The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two.  As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Visual marvel,"The storyline in the ""Lord of the Rings"" is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done.  But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb.  Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts.  The backdrops are excellent.  There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well.  A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that.  Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy.  In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this.  But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING.  Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind.

Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings,"" one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover.Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done.It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow,"This film is a triumph in almost every aspect.  I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better,"I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Never read the book, but loved the movie!","I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters.  I was not disappointed.  It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.  And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great spectacle, bad script","Tracking all the making of information leading up to the film, it seemed like Jackson was doing a great job. The scenery, props, casting, makeup, and effects all seemed beautifully authentic. And in action, they deliver. But the script (it's always a danger when you see three writers and one of them is the director) spoils the magic.It's more than making Arwen's role more significant (and a completely different character) in a blatant attempt to beef up the roles for women. I didn't like that, but women's roles are admittedly sadly lacking in the original story. It's that Jackson puts his clumsy fingerprints all over Tolkien's themes and tells the story from the perspective of Men. Apparently, modern moviegoers need to identify with their race. (Side note: all the critics who say how the movie has preserved the magic of the books probably haven't read them since college.)The relationship between the four hobbits isn't set up at all in the movie; aside from Frodo the other three hobbits seem thrown into the quest by chance. Rather than being a reluctant, conflicted hero, Frodo is praised by all the other characters but actually does little but squeal, get stabbed, and look on the elves in wonder. Saruman (a lesser character in the fiction who only appears the first book through Gandalf's recollection) takes up far too much time in the movie. And by the end we've seen Sauron's eye so much I wonder there's anything to reveal of the dark lord in the second and third movies. I expected changes, but I fail to see the rationale for many of Jackson's edits--they don't make the story better or the action flow more smoothly.The Lord of the Rings is an elegiac tale of the passing of magic from the world and of the heroic struggles of those races passing from the world to preserve goodness. In Jackson's eyes, history is told from the perspective of the victors, the Men. Hobbits, who drive the action in the books, are along for the ride while Aragorn, Boromir, et al are the real protagonists in the movie.I give Jackson full credit for taking on a task of this scale and achieving an epic feel. If only he'd started with a script as good as his scenery.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I couldn't stay awake,"I guess I just don't get the facination with this movie.  I found it to be far to long, goofy, and boring to stay awake.  I actually dozed off for a bit after struggling to stay awake for the middle hour.  I haven't fallen asleep during a movie since the Robin William's disaster 'Toys.'I was told before the movie that this was one of the greatest movies ever made.  The Academy Award nominations further prompted my belief that this movie would be exceptional.  I must have been expecting much more than I got. What I expected was to be drawn into this magical, legendary J.R.R. Tolkien universe for 3 plus hours.  I had heard of the great special effects, scenery, and characters.  I prepared myself to be amazed.What a dissapointment.  The characters, with the exception of Bilbo Baggins, were all one dimensional and boring.  I found myself unaffected when they were in peril, since I could care less if one of them were to get offed by an inept Ork.  The Orks were scary looking, but when you consider that there were probably 300 of them and they couldn't defeat the 9 in the fellowship, their bark is obviously worse than their bite.  They are as inept as a Star Wars Stormtrooper. The scenery did live up to the hype, but I think it is pretty bad when you consider the surroundings and not the story as the high point of the movie. Special effects?  Maybe I'm a spoiled 'Star Wars' junkie used to the Industrial Light and Magic standard that has been set.  I saw nothing special in the special effects but the fireworks at the beginning of the movie.While it may sound like I hated this movie, I didn't at all.  It was an entertaining film, but I expected much more.  I held this film to a very high standard based on the reviews and feedback from my peers.  I don't know how this film cracked the IMDB's top 10 let alone the top 250.  This wasn't even close to the best movie I've seen this month.  But I will end up with the DVD as my wife loved the film.  I will watch it when I need help falling asleep.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
W.O.W.,"WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always?Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals ""Harry Potter"", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED ""Harry Potter"" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Amazing Achievement,"'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Masterpiece,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A Beautiful Triumph for Peter Jackson,"The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie.About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world.6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world.I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Matter of Visions,"Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The Standard For All Fantasy Films,"Lord of The Rings is, to me, the industry standard for fantasy films. That being said, it doesn't particularly resonate with me personally. Despite the strongly communicated themes of the virtues of bravery and fellowship, the downfall of this film (and book it's based off) is its worldbuilding. LOTR makes use of ""hard world building"", the narrator (or in this case the director) is very explicit in their worldbuilding, you directly see their vision through the inclusion of many details and direct explanations of events, characters, and places. LOTR uses this to great success, sadly it just doesn't resonate that well with me. I prefer the opposite, ""soft worldbuilding"", implicitly building the world leaving more up to interpretation. I don't mean to say that soft worldbuilding is objectively better, it's just my preference. This is why Lord of The Rings isn't really my type of movie, despite this I still think it's objectively good, the cinematics shine through here, the use of wide shots really encapsulates the scope of the world that this story takes place in, something I did really appreciate. The characters are also great, so all in all I do really think this movie set the bar for fantasy films in Hollywood. But again, it just doesn't really appeal to my preferences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A cold, heartless, horror-movie treatment of one of the great epic stories of our time.","I really tried to go into this movie with an open mind.  I knew that much would be left out due to time restrictions.  I was aware through the promotional campaign that the dialog was going to be un-Tolkien, for reasons I wasn't clear about, since they seem to have gone to considerable effort to get pronunciations correct.  I knew that there would be many things about both the story and the treatment of it that would conflict with my own hide-bound (some would say fossilized) ideas.But still I looked forward to it.Then they showed Sauron in the second shot of the movie and somewhere inside, I wailed in despair.   I knew, from that alone, that Peter Jackson didn't get it.What is the one thing in LOTR that is never shown?  The one thing so evil and horrible that it isn't even described?Sauron.  The title character.  The Lord of the Rings himself.There he is, in the second shot of the movie.  Some funny looking big guy whose armourer has either very very bad taste or a sick sense of humor.The whole prologue was very aggravating to me, because as I watched it I knew that both the structure of the story and the slow building of understanding that characterized Tolkien's telling of it were being ignored. Throughout ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (the book, that is) we see the story unfold largely through Frodo's eyes.  We don't know about the conspiracy between Merry, Pippin and Sam because Frodo doesn't.  We don't know who the Black Riders are because Frodo doesn't.  And we don't know the history of the Ring until Gandalf tells Frodo about it.  Putting us in the hobbit's shoes brings us into the story.  The prologue in the movie separates us from it.On a technical level, the cinematography and editing were completely wrong for a story of this type -- other than a few wide sweeping shots of the fellowship walking south from Rivendell, the movie seemed all wide-angle lenses, swish pans, jump cuts, Spike Lee zooms (zooming in while dollying back or vice versa) or gratuitous and excessive special effects.  When Frodo puts the ring on, why does it suddenly get windy?  I rather think Bilbo would have noticed something was odd about the ring if all that had happened when he put it on.  Almost without exception, all the special effects were over-the-top.  From the glow of the fiery letters shining on Frodo's face (which, I will admit, looked kind of cool) to the flaming eye of Sauron.In a word, the film lacked subtlety.  Tolkien would have been hopping mad.And Arwen at the bridge made me mad, too.  In the book, Frodo stands, weak and wounded on the opposite shore from the Nazgul, and yet with his remaining strength defies them.  This is a crucially important moment in his development and our understanding of his character.Though the waves with horses was a nice touch.Speaking of Arwen at the bridge, there are many annoying examples of small changes to the plot done for no apparent reason.  Why was it Frodo who figured out how to open the gates of Moria?  And why wasn't Sam at the mirror of Galadriel?  Why did Aragorn show up before the orcs finished off Boromir (actually, that one's obvious -- so we could waste more time with another damn fight scene, that's why)?  and why was he not present when the black riders attacked the hobbits at Weathertop?It is possible to transfer a book successfully to screen faithfully.  For example, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" does an admirable job.  I gave the movie a seven out of ten and full marks for keeping within both the letter and the spirit of the book.  It left some things out, but you could tell that the filmmakers respected the book, the author, and the book's legion of readers.Several key dynamics from LOTR were thrown out in the movie.  The whole business of the mysterious disappearance of Gandalf is left out, and replaced with one of the most bone-jarringly stupid scenes in the film: I call it Gandalf vs. Saruman in the temple of Doom.  Was that silliness necessary?  The Wizards in the film may have been quick to anger, but subtle they most decidedly were not.The Legolas-Gimli relationship was likewise ignored, as well as the process of Aragorn gaining the hobbits' trust (especially Sam's).   But this simply underscores the greatest weakness in the movie -- it doesn't build the characters, it takes them for granted.And what of poor Barliman?  He was given such short shrift.  Not to mention Tom Bombadil.  I read a viewer comment in this forum defending his omission which said (quoting here): `a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age'.  That's exactly the point:  LOTR is not about this day and age.By and large, the casting was fine, with the following exceptions:Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"" as Elrond. For God's sake, Weaving even slipped in and out of the ""Agent Smith"" voice.Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn.  He was capable of playing the fighter, but either wasn't capable or given the opportunity to reveal the historian, linguist, lore-learned Aragorn.The interchangeable actors as Merry and Pippin.  Except for their accents, they weren't easy to tell apart.It's easy to say that even at three hours, the film was too short to cover all the ground in the book (and I will certainly not argue this -- I estimate a faithful, yet watchable treatment at about 24 hours -- but Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" was almost that long, wasn't it?), but far too much of that precious time was spent in the action and fight scenes.  The Chamber of Mazarbul scene (the fight with the troll) was one of the better action scenes, and handled very skillfully, but I would have traded most of it for a better treatment of the Council of Elrond (like, why the heck is Boromir there?  Who is Gimli, and why is he at Rivendell? Why wasn't Bilbo there? His offer to take the Ring was most revealing in the book).  And, of course, the whole prologue should have been moved into Frodo's sitting room, where Professor Tolkien wisely put it.It comes down to this.  They didn't trust the book.  The darned thing sold fifty MILLION copies.  That's a BILLION dollars worth of books.  And has a legion of admirers dwarfing Harry Potter's.  But they didn't trust it.One of the things I truly admired about the late Robert Shaw (I sing in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus) was that he never tried to put his own `stamp' on a piece of music.  His purpose was always to get at the heart of the music, to serve the composer and the composer's intentions.In a way, a film treatment of a book is a `performance' of that book.  And the better the book, the more beloved by the reading public, the more incumbent it is upon the performer to strive for the heart and soul of the book.  Peter Jackson got much that was superficially right, but missed the life at the center.  The film is cold, frightening, and utterly unlike The Lord of the Rings.Finally, the most disappointing thing:  because any Lord of the Rings film would have to be a production of epic scale, this version may have to stand as the only real attempt at a  film adaptation for many years, perhaps forever.  There have been dozens of ""Hamlet's, and even a bunch of ""Tarzan""s.  And that's one thing that kept running through my mind:  ""This is IT.  This is the treatment that LOTR will get in the cinema. Damn.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The greatest fantasy film of all-time,"An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath.

One ring and three movies to rule them all.,"It took me 14 years and a subscription to HBO Max to get around to watching this movie, and I can certainly say it was worth every bit of hype it gets. The Fellowship of the Ring was an epic start and one of the best fantasy adventure films I've ever seen. These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
RPG Game: The Movie,"I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The epic of our time...,"Once every so often in the long history of film, a movie will be made that breaks all boundaries of excellence. In no small way, it captures the eyes, hearts, and imaginations of millions of people around the world, and becomes one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of it's time.Such movies can never be replicated. There is no way you could remake 'Gone With the Wind' and hope to measure it with it's predecessor. There is no way you can retell the first, great 'Star Wars' trilogy and hope to capture the same magic and amazement created all those years ago. (Despite George Lucas's constant efforts to try and make them better... *coughs*)And in the end, there is certainly no way that anyone, in any period of time henceforth, could take J.R.R. Tolkein's classic 'Lord of the Rings' novels and create movies that would dare to rival Peter Jackson's complete cinematic masterpiece.This, my friends, IS the great cinematic masterpiece of our time. There is no replicating. There is no retelling. To call the film perfect is by no means true, but you would definitely have to *reach* perfection if you even dared to capture the brilliance that Jackson has created in his epic trilogy.The landscapes and sets are, to put it shortly, absolutely breath-taking... especially when added to the emotionally stirring score by Howard Shore. The cast is superlative, with each actor completely embodying the characters so perfectly, you'd swear they were born to play them.'The Fellowship of the Ring', when all is said and done, is arguably the greatest telling of a classic story in movie history. It stirs, it inspires, it saddens, and it overjoys. But most of all, it lingers with you... far longer than you believed it capable of doing.And that, in the end, is what makes it the epic it aspires to be.A masterpiece of its time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Big budget... but then?,"First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that.Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place.And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is.If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring.The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about.Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details.But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
But it could have been so much more...,"If I had been given the means and opportunity to make a Tolkien movie:1.  I would have made the Hobbit first.  Why in the world did this book not get made first?2.  I would have made each Lord of the Rings movie alone, and broken the books up into more manageable chunks (look at the three trilogies of the Star Wars series, for example).  Part I of Book One could be one movie of its own.3.  I would have been more faithful to the books; having less material to cover per movie would have allowed this.The Fellowship of the Ring suffers for having to cover too much material. And for all of its attention to detail, some of the most interesting parts of the book are skipped over, while silly additions like the ""wizard wrestling"" scene and the ""all-seeing eye everywhere"" and Arwen and Aragorn's romance are allowed in.I cannot claim fanatical fan status; I'm very familiar with the Hobbit but only just now I'm finishing the Fellowship of the Ring.  But for all the amazement and wonder I'm finding in the book, I'm more amazed to find so little that is wonderful about the movie.A great book deserved better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Worthy Heir To Tolkien's Masterpiece,"Adapting a novel for the big screen is never easy, as the printed-word format is often quite expansive and not easily pared down to suit the necessities of the big screen. Now, try that transition with perhaps the most well-known fantasy novel of all-time. That was the task director Peter Jackson faced while creating ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Not only does he succeed, but he does so on perhaps the highest possible level. ""Fellowship"" is truly one of the greatest book-to-film transitions ever attempted.For a very basic overview, this films establishes the legacy of the One Ring of Power and the fellowship put together to protect/destroy it. The ring, initially possessed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), is passed down to nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) who begins his trek to destroy it by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was created. Joining Frodo on his journey are...-Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen)
-Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom)
-Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies)
-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Bolomir (Sean Bean) of the Realm of Men
-Fellow Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), & Pippin (Billy Boyd)The scale of this endeavor--even just this first installment--is perhaps unmatched in the entirety of cinema. Unlike some high-aiming adaptations that might pull punches or cut corners, this is an ""all-in"" effort from the get-go. From costuming to music, location, acting, and special effects, you'll hardly feel like you're watching a movie. Instead, you will essentially be living within it. That is how expertly Jackson captures the realms of Middle Earth.Obviously, J.R.R. Tolkien (original writer of the novel trilogy) crafted a story in LOTR that will be passed down through the generations. But Jackson accomplishes just as monumental a feat. While cutting and trimming here and there to make the long tomes work in a cinematic setting, there is very little lost in the change-over. The books I was utterly captivated by as an adolescent are--rather improbably--equaled here.As such, I consider ""Fellowship"" an extraordinary film to kick off the LOTR trilogy on the big screen. In hindsight, if the trilogy can be evaluated as standalone efforts, it is probably the best of the bunch. As the closing credits roll and the promise of further adventure beckons, you are almost guaranteed to feel two things: an intense desire to dive into ""The Two Towers"", and the overwhelming knowledge that an incredible book has been miraculously transformed into a never-to-be-outdone film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Brilliant, my third favorite film ever.","I have seen ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why.

Embrace the power of the Ring...,"I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad...That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called ""theatrical versions""): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others.As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the N°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time.An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay).One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Glorious Vision of Middle Earth,"The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Even a little Tolkien goes a long way,"As a die-hard aficionado of the trilogy, I subconsciously geared myself for some disappointments on my way to see this film. Some reviewers evidently feel they're breaking new critical ground in saying that the film was compromised, here, there and everywhere, finally excusing and extolling the film on the ground that what's left is so good, the flaws don't really matter much. Well, I can't help but agree, and even at nearly three hours, Jackson and his crew couldn't help but nip and tuck, and so the fact that much was missing, in terms of plot, character development, etc., is not especially mystifying. No, what I wondered--while I stood in line and bought a ticket for three shows hence--was not, ""Gee, did they cut something out?"" but, ""Hmmm. Almost three hours. I wonder how they managed, with so little time."" And they managed just fine, offering concessions and reconciliations equally satisfying, for those who have read the works as well as those who haven't. I do agree that more attention should have been paid to narrative regarding the Council of Elrond--here the plot point reaches a real pitch that was much missed in the film. I don't agree, however, that modern audiences are too cynical to swallow Bombadil. (That's like saying that imagination always needs a reality check.) And I did enjoy the expanded role of Arwen--it fit like a glove, and Tyler's performance, in my opinion, was superb (I had heard rumors that there were some misgivings when she was cast). But in the long run, the source work is so good that there's a heck of lot of choose from. Not only was serious thought given to the adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece, the team's keen eye was clearly focused on the sensibilities (and intelligence) of the audience. Thus this is among the best three hours in film thus far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

WHAT A JOKE!,"That this movie could be #1 on IMDB's list only shows that there are major problems with how that list is generated.  I dislike critics as much as anyone, but there needs to be some safeguard against droves of mindless fans exulting a movie that has little more going for it than hype and special effects.  To be fair, the acting was very good, but I can't say more for it because the utter lack of character development in the film ruined any chance for great performances.Others have already pointed out how cliche most of the scenarios and action was and how long the film dragged on for, so I'll just mention my major complaint - the complete lack of continuity, in any respect.  A perfect microcosm was the horse chase where Arwen is at one moment surrounded by the dark riders, who seem to ride at twice her speed to catch up, while in the next cut she has somehow opened up a thirty foot lead - pretty typical of bad action movies, but not of the best movie of all time!Poor portrayal action is only a minor complaint, but continuity is lacking on a much grander scale in this film.  Characters just don't have any consistent qualities - is Sam really very close to Frodo? or is that just how hobbits are? How could the great Gandalf have been so mistaken about his mentor?  The groups decisions while treking through middle earth are asinine - they are halfway across a mountain range and then decide to head back and go through a hellish cavern where they are sure to die.  All this because Frodo gave the ok, but who would expect reason from a group that decided to bring along three extra bumbling fools, as if defeating the supreme evil power wasn't challenge enough.I could go on and on, but this movie isn't worth the webspace.

Now, I have never picked up a Tolkien book, and the only story I ever knew was the Hobbit, and that was from the animated movie.Now, let me make my observations of some of the reviews listed here, and I must say that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and here is mine.  If you don't like this movie, pronouncing it as boring and too long, then you obviously don't have the patience to watch a great movie, more like you love the hacked off 88 min movie that has no real script to speak of, and only took 2 months to film.  Which is fine, because I like those movies as well,but also I personally love a movie that took a lot of work, and is also very spectacular as a result.  Titanic comes to mind, for one.  I want substance in a movie, and LotR delivers.  It is a true work of art, unlike (someone mentioned ""Fight Club"" ???? A classic?! I think not).  If you only thought of it as boring, then you were only looking for action and no story, in which case the latest Van Damme movie would have fulfilled your expectations.What I truly loved about this movie wasn't just the scenery, but the acting as well.  Each part was brought to life perfectly, and the actors had great chemistry together.  I especially loved Ian as Gandalf, and I must also give a great nod to Christopher Lee, who has always made a great villain.  The action was well placed and suspenseful, and everything looked as I would expect a fantasy world to look like.Overall a very well made movie.  If you hate it, then maybe it's over your head.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Late to the game, but what an epic epoch!","I watched the extended version of a meager 3.5 hours. Having seen snippets of the movie when it came out on DVD and friends were watching it, I couldn't be bothered. I had read so many fantasy books over the years, and generally I tended to be disappointed by any novel that was made into a movie, for instance most of the adapted masterpieces written by Stephen King are mediocre at best; Only later I was able to enjoy adaptations, first one that comes to mind is Birdy with Nicholas Cage.Back to Fantasy, I had given Tolkien a try when I was too young, collapsing under its' volume. Later I reread it and loved it, so given the effort I put into it, I didnt wat it to be tainted by a sub par undertaking. And yes the raving reviews were pretty much in my face, but when time goes on, well, you know... That.So now, in 2022 I took the time to watch it, be it in parts as I don't have 3.5 hours to spare anymore unfortunately, and it was overwhelmingly beautiful! It is so long and there is so much to tell, that it borders on tedious at times, but the investment is so big you have to finish, you can't let it go! And the payoff is massive, and I have to say the most human among the fellowship, the human played by Sean Bean, brought tears to my eyes. I even had to gasp for air, what a performance! Amazingly well done.Over 20 years later, and the movie is still rock solid, nothing waned, not the visual effects, not the vision of all the different worlds, nothing looks out of whack, but spot on and suspending disbelief is not a thing at all, throughout the entire length of the movie. You are there, with them.I have to tip my hat to Peter Jackson, and curse him at the same time. If the other two parts are as well done, I'm afraid I will have a massive sleep deprivation issue once done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Excellent Movie Choice!,"I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excusable flaws don't detract.,"There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it.It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye.And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now.The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect.Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long.And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister!There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved.That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience.Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo.All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time.And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere.Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here.BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good.There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again.The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Peter Jackson pulled it off big time, surpassed my expectations. He takes my favorite book and brings it to live on the screen and sucks me so right into it that I was feeling shellshocked afterwards. It was definately the best movie of the year and it's wonderfull beyond belief. When I walked out I just wanted to go back in and see it again.

THE best fantasy epic of all time,"I hate Star Wars. Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box.The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best.Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought ""FOTR"" after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short.I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING!The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, ""You'd get the next bite next year."" The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once.And to anyone who wonders why ""FOTR"" is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times.All hail ""The Lord of the Rings"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The start of something epic,"The word 'epic' probable gets used too much these days to describe films. However, in this case it's definitely right. For those two people out there who don't know, 'The Lord of the Rings' is (primarily, excluding various 'spin-off' books) a trilogy of long books set in a fiction world called 'Middle Earth' which is filled with everything from wizards to dragons (yes, think 'Game of Thrones,' but with less nudity.It had long been considered that J. R. R. Tolkien's books were 'unfilmable' due to no screen adaptation being able to bring his lavish world to life (properly). There was an animated attempt (which wasn't as bad as people made out), but due to budgetary reasons, it was left unfinished (a concept which left me particularly confused when I watched it as a child). However, now the source material has finally been given the big screen treatment it deserved and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the start of the trilogy's life in mainstream cinema.Despite the long backstory (shown in a brief montage/history lesson at the beginning of the film) all you need to know is that the spirit of a 'dark lord' wants his magic ring back in order to become whole again and generally take over the land. However, by luck the piece of jewellery in question is in the hands of a gentle race of little creatures known as 'hobbits.' They, together with an assortment of men, wizards, dwarfs and elves, vow to prevent the dark lord Sauron from getting his property back and set off on a quest to destroy it in the fires of the volcano where it was once forged.I suppose you could call the cast an 'ensemble.' With a story that requires so many characters, quite a few familiar faces will pop up. Primarily you have Sir Ian McKellen as the iconic wizard, Gandalf the Grey, but he's backed up by everyone from Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee to Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen. In fact it's more a case of the more 'famous' Hollywood actors are secondary to the two hobbits who are at the centre of the tale, Frodo and Sam, plays by Elijah Wood and Sean Aston respectively. They're possibly less well-known that the affore-mentioned actors and yet rise to the challenge and prove that they're more than capable of having a major cinematic franchise rest on their (miniature!) shoulders.The cast is perfectly surrounded by some of the best sets, scenery and special effects ever to be committed to the big screen at the time (yes, you can - sort of - see a bit of 'green screen' work these days, but they still hold up!). Some say that the whole trilogy is one giant advert for the New Zealand tourist board, as it makes use of all the country's different landscapes to great effect.Of course seeing as 'Fellowship' is the first in a trilogy, there a certain amount of 'set up' contained where some story threads are mentioned but never expanded on - yet. However, this never really stops anyone from understanding what's going on and I'm sure once you watch this installment you'll want to know where it all goes!I know that the real 'Tolkien purists' will argue about which bits from the book have either been left out, or slightly changed, like making an Elf maiden an outright warrior in the film. I've read the books and, due to their length, it would probably be impossible to commit every last page to screen (unless you make every film about six hours!) and what they've done is taken all the most important points and used them to great effect to make the story as accessible to as many people as possible.I think it was writer/director Kevin Smith who said in 'Clerks II' that the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was just basically 'people walking.' Okay, so funny as that may be (and - technically - true) there's so much more to the film that just that. The best part about 'Fellowship' (and indeed the whole trilogy) is that it can be enjoyed by most people, not just fans of the book or the genre, but also appreciated by (nearly) everyone with an eye for good cinema due to its achievements in world-building and sheer scale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The most over-hyped movie of all-time.,"All right I might be wrong... considering I haven't and wouldn't dare waste my time watching the 2 sequels. Now before you start email bombing me let me give a chance to explain myself a little. I'm not gonna sit here and say this movie was horrible. That's going too far. A lot of time and effort obviously went into the making of this film. The production values are great, the scenery is sometimes beautiful, the special effects are decent, and the directing could have been a lot worse. You see, I'm not gonna be some idiot who posts ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS COMPLETE CRAP"" and rates it a 1. I actually rated this movie a 3. That being said... the acting is far from impressive. The story certainly didn't grab be nearly enough to be interested in wasting another 3+ plus hours a piece on a sequel. The whole thing basically screamed blah to me. A movie that at best could be considered decent. The fact that this movie (along with the 2 sequels) sits comfortably on the top 10 movies OF ALL TIME is really scary to me. Do people grasp the concept ""of all time"". We're not talking about the best film of the year here. There have been tens of thousands of movies made since the invention of cinema... do you people really believe that the 3 LOTR movies surpass all of those movies? Wow, what a one in a billion coincidence that would be. It makes me think most of the people who rated this movie have only seen about 5-10 movies in their life. Do people forget such cinematic achievements as Taxi Driver, Rashomon, A Clockwork Orange, and Reservoir Dogs, just to name a few. I take some solace at the fact that 55% of the people who rated this movie gave it a 10, proving that most of these people are either fanatical or just trying to drive this movie up the IMDB ladder of all-time greats.

Stunningly Excellent!,"I was born in 1999. This trilogy came out in 2001, 2002, & 2003.I had older brothers who saw these in theaters (jealous)!

And how to do combat.From what I remember, there are hardly any differences between book and film. And those that are, are understandable.Jackson did Tolkien justice. If anyone tries to recreate this trilogy, I WILL riot.I'm going to devote a whole paragraph to the music. Howard Shore was a gamble considering he'd never done anything like this before. But did Jackson win big with that gamble!The music is one of THE most memorable film scores out there! You hear it and you know it. That's the sign of a talented musician. Even my mom knows the music and can even respect the material. And she doesn't like fantasy.I adore all the detail put into these cinematic masterpieces that still don't look dated.

Richly deserving of its acclaim,"Reading through the various posts, I see that the overriding theme amongst the movie's few detractors was that it was ""overly long"" and ""boring"", even prompting one poster to rename the movie ""Bored of the Rings.""Well, these people clearly haven't read the books and thus are not Tolkien fans.  J.R.R. Tokien's books are VERY long and descriptive, and even the hard core fan has to wade through certain elements.  However, the books are thrilling, sweeping epics, microcosms of the age-old struggles between good and evil.  In this context, Tolkien has created a complete alternate world, populated by humans and similarly-evolved races such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, and mixes courage, determination, love and magic to create ""Middle Earth"".Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring accomplishes what no film maker dared attempt in the 47 years.  It encapsulates the first book of the trilogy in jaw-dropping fashion onto film.  And that bears repeating:  the movie is so amazing, so awe-inspiring, so wondrous that through much of the movie, I felt my jaw literally dropping open.  It's THAT good.The cast is nearly perfect:  Ian McKellan *is* perfect as Gandalf the Grey. The standoff at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum will go down with the alien's tail slowly encircling Lambert in ""Alien"", the initial emergence of the creature from the black lagoon and other horror/fantasy epic moments as one of the all-time great scenes in cinematic history.  Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the remarkable ensemble cast give the performances of their careers.  The special effects, despite some that claim otherwise, leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.  And the good news is that since the movie has grossed over $800 million world-wide to date, the second and third installments of the trilogy will benefit with post-production special effects improvements.If you haven't seen this movie, you've missed out, big time, unless you can find it still playing somewhere.

An impossible task,"A wonderful book, it was always going to be difficult to recreate it on the big screen. Whilst there is no denying the quality of the recreation of Middle Earth, this film is not without its bad points.Firstly, incidental music. Why so much? Can two characters not have an interaction without an orchestra dithering along in the background. Can actors not generate emotion without having to rely on music? I have never heard such an abundance of unnecessary music, at times it was reminiscent of a cheap Australian soap opera.Secondly, the acting. Whilst it is commendable to not select well known actors for every role, some of the actors, were simply not up to scratch and were unable to muster any sense of empathy in this disgruntled reviewers stoney heart.Thirdly, the love-interest *sighs*. Why must a mainstream film always shoe-horn in a wholly redundant love interest? Yes, it was in the book, but it was over-egged here.Fourth, Sam - please lord no!

Not sure why so many loved this movie.,"This movie was over-hyped, and the only thing about it that I found fabulous were the special effects.

I was bored and just wanted the movie to finish, which is rare for me. Less focus on special effects and more attention to good acting and a story that builds suspense would have made for a better movie. Perhaps a little more background into the character's lives, for example, would have added a lot to the overall presentation.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Best of the Trilogy,"Without sounding pompous, Fellowship (cinematically) is the best of the three films. Many right-brain fans will deem the latter two as they involve more 'action' so to speak, but unfortunately deter from the lore of Tolkien's' masterpiece.Not only do I believe this is the best of the three, I believe Fellowship is one of the best films ever produced. It fulfills in my mind what a '10' movie merits: Perfect Cast, beautiful Cinematography , amazing Dialogue, Remarkable Soundtrack, and overall excellent direction from Peter Jackson where he paces the film perfectly, taking time with introductions but never boring the viewer.Gandalfs scene with the aesthetically CGI Balrog (which still holds up) stands alone as the best scene of the entire Trilogy--Ian McKellon's performance truly shines. Enjoy Frodo at his best before we are dealt with a not so heroic and quite annoying counterpart dealt to us in the sequels.To all fans: many older fans (50+) agree this is the best of the Trilogy. AFI selected Fellowship (and only Fellowship) in their 100 Years...100 Movies and in a half-hearted appeal to cast authority, Elijah Wood believes this is the best. ""Best"" was the focus of this review, not to dampen the brilliance of the latter two, but rather highlight the beauty this film holds.I have the Trilogy from best to not so best: 1, 3, 2 with scores 10, 9, and 8 respectively.-J.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"an amazing movie, great story and beauty","the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring is probably the most beautiful movie i have ever seen.  Every scene is breathtaking, it is truly an amazing job jackson did.  If you have ever read the lord of the rings or the hobbit, you know what i mean when i say its almost exactly what you would imagine middle earth to look like.Sure, they changed some things from the book, but i think they did a better job than most movies taken from novels.

Brilliant and Intelligent,"For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Epic, sweeping film-making at it's very best","The Fellowship of the RingWhen one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term ""quality"", in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere.It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score.Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time.Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Tiresome computer game,"This film moves nothing. It's Hollywood humdrum done hundreds of times before. A little more computer graphics in this one - and so!?? You get every cliché not one time, not two times but 200 times. What a bargain! Why do I feel the action scenes are trite and tiresome? You have the big strong fearless bad guys coming in by the dozens and they are slaughtered like swatting flies. When they finally get one of our heroes, he doesn't even have the grace of dying in an orderly fashion. He takes blow after blow still standing and then linger on in I don't know how many last words and tear-jerking remarks. Yawn!! Heroes everywhere, please have the courtesy of dying before the audience is killed from boredom.The plot is easy: heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies, heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies (repeat and count for yourselves during 3 hours). This is a glorified computer game, jump-kill, jump-kill, kick-kill, jump-kill ... ad nauseam.And the romance, oh we musn't forget the romance must we? Vision the clever producer with a bit cigar leaning back in the chair getting the original brilliant idea: ""we gotta have a broad in there, she gotta look gorgeous but what's she gonna do? Ahh, hell, doesn't matter ..."" And when you have heard the characters ""I-do-declare"" for half an hour that's enough. The rest is tiresome.

Great Beginning!,It is incredibly difficult to really adapt most books into movies and still stay very true to the soul of the book. This movie does that in a very big way and really sets the mode for the following two movies. It is the hook and bait that is irresistible and even those that don't care for fantasy movies find themselves reeled into one of the greatest epic fantasy's ever told. Entering a world filled with new discoveries and incredible adventures is something that every child hopes for and thats exactly what sparked the creation of this epic. Watching this movie really brought me back to a time when life was magical and my imagination was all I needed to enjoy each day.

This is Tolkiens novel, and the world of Middle-Earth, the characters of Middle-Earth and the events of Middle-Earth! I love this film.This is the kind of film that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation. It is THAT good.There are three wizards: Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Peter Jackson, the director. The breathtaking detail Jackson has put into this is incredible. Lets start with the acting.This is a star studded cast, with Elijah Wood in the main role as Frodo, McKellen as mentioned, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler . .. the list goes on and on and on. Each has put 101% into this masterpiece, and it really shows.The sets are incredible. One can believe they are in Khazad-Dum, or in Bree, or in Hobbiton, or Rivendell particuarly. It will take your breath away, some of the incredible locations. We know each is not real, but there is a hint of realism in there.This is a special effects bananza, used only when needed. In Khazad-Dum and Isengard particuarly you can almost feel the power given off by the magic in this film.The costumes are perfect. The score (designed by Howard Shore) is breathtakingly beautiful. And throughout this, Jackson maintains a sense of calm and reality in the film, and it is this inner flare and outer cool that makes him and the entire cast and crew the magicians that they are.

I was not in the target audience,"I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A nightmare for a Tolkien fan who read the book in the '60s,"I am assuredly in the minority when I state Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is some of the worst film making I have ever seen. It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981.Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small. But they come out of very carefully crafted relationships and a deep well of subtext.I don't quarrel with the New Zealand locations, I do quarrel with the dumpy looking sets that were haphazardly glossed over with computer grafx fixes. I don't quarrel with the casting except Frodo, and yet I found the direction so superficial, and often perplexing, if not simply muddled (Galadriel as an English Vamp?!).A clue to my dissatisfaction can be found in the omission of Tom Bombadil, the only character in the original not affected by the Ring. His eccentric wisdom and unexplained powers ground the plot because there is something, someone who is outside the Dark Lord's power. There is in the Tolkien universe a power unimaginable which Sauron cannot touch. And that is essential to the fabric which holds Middle Earth together. Which Tolkien in his craft and his wisdom knew he had to give expression to. And Jackson in his foolhardiness ignored.Why didn't Jackson's team follow the books with more trust? The master had already worked it out perfectly. Well, almost. The Trilogy wasn't long enough, which Tolkien realized after its completion. Nevertheless, the project would have been immensely improved had Jackson and his team laid out a six episode franchise to match the six books of the Trilogy, taken more time to film it in their excellent locations of choice, and above all, truly paid homage to its original creator by following his work faithfully.These films are a mish-mash which titillated the masses for a brief time. And that is tragic, because it will be long, long before someone will be able to do them justice.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A very solid start to a great trilogy,"J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A sight to behold,"Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes.  But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care.  Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad.  He became really excited.  But still, I didn't care.  Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV.  I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie.  I had never read the books.  My dad took me and my family to see the movie.  I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story.I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self.  The minute the movie began, I was drawn in.  The special effects were terrific.  I felt like I was there.  I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true.I was very impressed with the casting.  I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever.  Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played.  The make-up was incredible.  The orcs creeped me out.  The Elves entranced me.  The Hobbits brought a smile to my face.  Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo.  I could go on and on, but I won't.I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene.  I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that.  I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal.I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it.  He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen.  I eagerly await ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"".

Praise for LOTR,"I personally love The Fellowship of the Ring.  I think that it is a fabulous movie and a wonderful adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece.  For all of you that were bored by LOTR or thought that the movie was too slow, you missed half the movie.  The story is not just about the journey from the Shire to Mordor.  The characters, their relationships, the battle of good vs. evil - these things are the heart of the work and fill those supposedly ""slow"" times.  If you read LOTR before you saw the movie then you understood all of these things.  If not, then you have missed out.  The relationship between Frodo and Sam, Aragorn and the whole fellowship, Legolas and Gimli - they are part of why I love the book and movie.  The strength of their friendships are more powerful than anything else in the novel/movie.Do JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson justice (and yourself a favor), read The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers before you see Two Towers in December.  PJ made the movie for those of us who love LOTR not for those who love movies.   If you read Two Towers before you see the movie, not only will you understand the story better b/c there are going to be a lot of new characters, but you will appreciate the movie more.  You will love the characters and better appreciate their individual struggles if you read the book first.I have one more thing to say, I love every single one of the actors and actresses in Fellowship of the Ring.  They seem to step perfectly into the characters that Tolkien created.  Hats off to Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, all the other actors/actresses, and to all those who worked behind the scenes to make Tolkien's books come alive for us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Full of Sound and Fury; signifying ????- The Fellowship of the RIng,"I found the book more interesting than the film. The essence of the book, in my opinion, is not the fierce warriors or the battle scenes, but the buildup of the characters of the most helpless of all the participants in this drama, the Hobbit. Although having great music and cinematography, the film lacks soul. It is visually stunning, and the actors do a great job with the roles they are given, but the real problem is that many adults will just not believe the content. That is why the Hobbit is so important to both the novel and the film; it provides soul to an otherwise souless existence.Part of the problem may have been that the producers decided to take the easy way out and create a film for the senses rather than the mind or the soul. And this works well, once again, with younger audiences. Adults want more than just bells and whistles.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""it has some interesting elements""","A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A amazing start to one of the best trilogies ever,"I have to say Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job at translating this into film. He got everything down to a tee. The sweeping cinematography captures the enormousness of Middle Earth as well as provides for some beautiful eye candy. The combination of practical and special effects allow for some extraordinarily detailed scenes that really bring Tolkien's world to life. The casting is absolutely perfect. Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas?, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Christopher Lee as Saruman? You simply cannot do better than that, and I applaud whoever did the casting. All these things come together to form a masterpiece of a film that is the start to one of the best trilogies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
OUTSTANDING IN EVERY RESPECT!,"I don't care what many might think about this, Lord of the Rings rocked me to the ""Beyond"" and back.Powerful visions of the past, epic battles since films like Braveheart, Gladiator and Brotherhood of the Wolf. It packed plenty of punches than a dozen Mike Tyson's put together.Although I hadn't read the books it didn't dissuade me in any way whatsoever to watch this film.Hats off to actors Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee and of course the lovely Sean Bean and Cate Blanchett.Forget Titanic, this by far is more than just a technical accomplishment or creative input. I really do hope that it sweeps the Academy Awards which it will no doubt do.Birds, beasts, demons this film also very much reminded me of gothic visions of other directors like Dario Argento and the late great Lucio Fulci with there dark brooding imaginations featured in their body of works..  .For example the scene where Gandalf confronts the gigantic demon was without a doubt the single most spectacular scene that really does shake the very grounds of the film's sequence.I know I might sound like a real boot kissing art fag for liking this film a little too much, but on the other hand the visuals are most definately the single biggest advantage besides the acting as well. I know I also that not reading the book I might sound biased too, but then again it's personal opinions that really matter.I just hope that the follow up (Two Towers) also lives up to what Fellowship of the Rings offered us.Instant classic 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Part 1 of The Rings Trilogy is brilliant,"Well what can I say? Without sounding like a broken record, this is, quite frankly, a masterpiece.The first of three films about a young Hobbit's quest to return an evil ring, titled 'The Fellowship of the Ring', this picture is brilliant in every sense of the word.The lush New Zealand scenery portrays a bold and beautiful Middle Earth, while the superb casting of the main cast (including Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler) are perfectly picked for their intriguing and detailed characters.I cannot praise this movie enough. Everything about it - the special FX, the score, the scenery, the plot, the cast - is all fantastic, and for the 3 hours the film runs, it manages to grab you and take you on a spellbinding journey into the imaginary world in which they inhabit... something 'Harry Potter' could never do. 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Breathtaking!,"Reading the other reviews here, it seems that people either loved this movie or they hated it.  It also seems that those who say they hated it don't give any concrete reasons other than they don't seem to ""get the point.""  The same is true of the books that this series is based on: some people think them to be the best works of fiction of all time, while others think they are nonsense.  Well, you can count me firmly in the ""loved it"" camp!Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies. (My other hope is that someone would take on the project of making quality film versions of Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy,"" but that's a different story!)  The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking!  Never mind the minor differences between the film and the books, this has got to be the best adaptation of book to cinema that I have ever seen.  I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen.Why?  If you are one of those who ""don't get it,"" I can't offer anything to convince you.  Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series.   The action is gripping.  The visual effects are stunning.  There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair.  The acting is flawless.   And through the entire experience, there is the constant theme of pure good versus pure evil; and staying true to one's friends and commitments regardless of how bad things get.  And it does it without being preachy about it:  it is totally free of the absurd political correctness that infects so many other films.This movie hits on all cylinders.  The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed.  Nobody got up during its three hour length.  There was no whispering or other signs of inattention.  When it was over and the lights came on, there was a continued hush that was almost reverent.  When people started to get up, I heard comments like ""It's going to be a long year.""  (Meaning, of course, it will be a long wait until the second installment is released this December.)The only flaw I can find is that it was too fast-paced in some places, resulting in some parts of the story being a blur for those who aren't already familiar with the books.  Even so, the three hours go by very quickly and leave you wanting to see more of the story.  That will have to wait until the end of this year!For those who haven't yet seen it, I would strongly recommend reading the books (or at least read The Fellowship of the Ring) and then rent or buy the dvd when it is released this August.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Peter Jackson, I salute you....","First things first - I've read LOTR probably 3/4 times. & the Silmarillion and bits of the Unfinished Tales and yadda yadda yadda....I however have grown up enough to know that LOTR (the book) is for many a great novel because it relates to when they first read it...it is great within it's context but not the greatest book ever or any of that tosh...IMHO all lists are bunkum anyway.So having got that off my chest, here is another confession....I was worried, very, very worried about LOTR on the big screen. Would it be a 'Krull', a 'Willow', a 'Beastmaster', a.........urgh,,,Dungeons & Dragons? You know what I mean...fantasy is damn hard to do. The Tolkien imitators that plague the bookshelves prove this as do the whole stackfull of cheesy, hammy fantasy movies with cheesy, hammy names chasing after magical McWidgets to save the nation / planet / galaxy / universe from eternal damnation. I had prepared a crushing hex for Peter Jackson if he inflicted this fate upon LOTR.But there was a sign of hope, like Glamdring's pale fire in the smoke and flames of the Balrog (er, enough of that) - 3 films. Not 1 mish-mashed jampacked farce-fest. No, 3 full-length films giving the book's epic scale a chance to work it's wonder on the filmgoers.Well Peter Jackson pulled it off - by resolutely avoiding the 'big-name' actors, by insisting on New Zealand for filming, by used WETA for effects, by nipping & tucking the story where required (I suspect even Jackson could not have kept Tom Bombadil from looking like total clown), by expanding where needed (another writer is very correct that Arwen's importance is only clear in the book during the Appendix).If you don't like fantasy one little bit...which makes me wonder where exactly your imagination resides....then even with this appalling handicap LOTR 'Fellowship of the Ring' can still enthrall you. If you love the book, the film still does the trick. If you just like being contrary for the sake of it then I guess you won't like this film. But then I doubt you like much else in life either.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Beautiful, but still a sorely missed opportunity","I saw this film on sunday morning in a pre-screening organised for regular customers of a big department store. Don't ask me why, my mother has a card for the place and we got tickets.The film was directed by New Zealand director, Peter Jackson, who previously made Braindead, Bad Taste and Heavenly Creatures.The first impression of the film is that Jackson did a good job visually, but in his enthousiasm and personal interpretation screwed up the story. Anyone who has not read the book will probably be overwhelmed by this fantasy film and the amazing special effects in it. To one who knows the book, the film will be a missed opportunity to bring the story and especially the character development in Tolkien's work to the big screen.I will elaborate somewhat on all of these points. Visually, the film is overwhelming. From the cute homeliness of the Shire to the architecturals of Lothlorien to the tower of Orthanc in Isengard. From the hobbit 'look' to the Uruk-Hai, from Sauron's burning lidless eye to Galadriel's temptation, it looks stunning and the computer generated effects merge with the acting like few films have done before.The problem is mainly that the visual stuff receives too much attention. Jackson's roots in horror (even 'funny horror') are pretty obvious in this film. This is most evident in Bilbo's flash of rage when he cannot have the ring back in Rivendell. Very textbook horror film stuff. In the book, the mountain troll in the chamber of Mazarbul receives a wound in the foot and makes his exit after two lines. In the film, the Company fights it for five long minutes. The Watcher at the Hollin Gate does not come out of the water in the book. Silliest of all, the Balrog of Moria is a typical huge horned demon in the film and its arrival is announced in a very pompous fashion.The leads to the film's main flaws. First of all are the plot changes. Some of these are done in the interest of film length, such as cutting out the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil and most of the chase through the shire. The expanded role of Arwen is politically correcting but not of great consequence. Other things seriously screw up the story:In the film, Saruman is enslaved by Sauron and the whole process of the transformation of Isengard to a mimic of the Dark Tower and the creation of the Uruk Hai is broadly displayed. In the book, Saruman is out for power of his own and just mentioning that Saruman mixed the vile race of orcs with those of man is evidence enough that he is up to no good. Nor is there a telekinetic battle in the book in which Saruman captures Gandalf. Jackson appears to want one single evil in charge and does not use the corrupting temptations of power by itself. Herein a human dimension of the book is lost.Reversely, in the film Isildur is tempted by the promise of power when he takes the ring, thereby causing the Numenoreans to fall from grace. In the book, the ring is much more subtle and Isildur keeps it as a token for his fallen brother and father. In the film this results in Boromir blatantly coveting the ring even at the council of Elrond and portraying him like a fool when he does not know Aragorn. Worst of all, Aragorn is changed into part fighting machine (fighting off the five Nazgul at Weathertop singlehandedly) and part angelic Messiah (not being tempted by the ring and sending Frodo off to Mordor alone with a sorrowful smile).The third case is that in the film Saruman and Gandalf know of the Balrog of Moria, which is not in the book, nor does Gimli in the book invite them to Uncle Balin's mines. In the book, Gimli came to Rivendell to get word of Balin's mission to recapture Moria. The final thing to mention here is that in the film, the interplay between Gimli and Galadriel is entirely discarded, while in the book this contributes greatly to the friendship between Gimli and Legolas. All in all it makes the group hug at the end when they set after Pippin and Merry come out of thin air.The end result, to which other factors contribute is that many of the subtleties in the book are utterly lost. The One Ring actively talks to everyone and gets on people much more blatantly than in the book. Galadriel is portrayed like the Elven witch that rumour in the outside world would have her be. The Elves and Dwarves bicker openly at the first opportunity, rather than mistrusting each other because they are unfamiliar with each other.The saddest thing is that most of this could have been fixed easily. Galadriel could have had three more sentences at the Mirror, and all would be explained and within the storyline of the book. At least some attention could have been paid to the motivations of the characters, particularly for Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, but for all of the Fellowship to some degree. Kindness, doubt and grief at the many losses are a major part of the book but the film has just made no time for it.Instead, Jackson chose an action heavy film, thereby degrading a great book of fiction to an ordinary fantasy novel. The focus is on the visual horrors they encounter and the characters are propelled by some inbuilt fate or else by Elrond's mission decree. While I have seen worse, the source material has so much more debt that I cannot but call this film a sorely missed opportunity to bring Tolkien's book to life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Perfect film-making, flawless fantasy rollercoaster ride!","I am one of few who openly admits his favourite movies are Edward Scissorhands and Titanic, but before seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (abbr.

To have such a blend with amazing cast and director... is a delight. Peter Jackson has performed a miracle. He's taken the most popular novel of 20th century, defied the pessimists, stood tall in his shorts and turned it into the greatest movie I've ever seen. I tell you, everything in the film was ""perfect"". Nothing less.The script must have been difficult to write but it has been done so well here. Peter Jackson has also managed to get a cast that is known but not really ""super-star"", and they are perfectly cast in their roles. Fate brought Viggo Mortensen into the role of Aragorn (I can't see how Stuart Townsend was chosen) and I've never seen an actor live into the character so much. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, so no contest and hand him the Oscar, thank you. The hobbits are wonderful and especially well portrayed, led by Elijah Wood, the story's small hero. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are heavenly and Tyler even surprised me with good accent and acting. So did Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee and that newcomer Orlando Bloom.Added to this is the mythic and wonderful music from Howard Shore. I love it and it brings me everytime to the emotional highs and lows of the film and I see the sorrow, the faces and my heart cries out. It's a powerful film, with marvellous acting and music and sets..., directed flawlessly by soon-to-become-my-favourite-director Peter Jackson.

An Absolute Epic,"Let's take a moment and consider what a risk this was for New Line Cinema. It's the late 90's early 2000's and Peter Jackson comes in and wants over 100 million dollars to make a fantasy movie. Peter Jackson, a director whose previous credits include ""The Frighteners"" and ""Bad Taste"". Fantasy films were seen at the time as box office poison. Lord of the Rings was seen as a book that could not be adapted. It had a loyal fanbase, but the film adaptations had already tried and failed to bring in a return. And Jackson was wanting to film 3 movies altogether at once. This pitch must have sounded crazy. Thankfully for all involved they gave the greenlight and we got this wonderful film.This is the go to fil as an example of grand fantasy epic. The cinematography and effects are breathtaking, letting the audience grasp the huge scope of the adventure. The music by Howard Shore is pitch perfect, conveying triumph, mystery, sorrow and any emotion needed for the time. Although magical and mysterious, the film seamlessly explains the stakes and story to the audience. The action scenes are all well shot and the quest always feels like it is going forward.Along with the technical aspects of music and editing, what really holds this film together are the characters. All 9 members of the fellowship are casted and acted perfectly. All the characters the fellowship come across do a fantastic job. Christopher Lee as Saruman, that is the role this man was born to play. They bring these literary characters to life in such a way that I can't picture anyone else in the role.Compared to the other two films in the epic trilogy, this one is the most focused. As the films go on, the storyline will get split into the different side quests of the groups. But in this first one, save for cutting to Saruman, the story focuses primarily on the adventure of our fellowship. This is also the only one of the trilogy that has Enya do the end credits song, clearly all the other movies could have benefited from doing the same.I'm not sure what more I can add to the conversation that hasn't been said before. There is no other movie with such a long runtime that I have watched as often as Lord of the Rings.

"Very high production values, very long, perfect for ""Ring"" fans.","I went to school in the 1950s and 1960s. I never read ""The Hobbit"" nor any of the ""Ring"" trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about, although I already knew there were ""Ring"" fanatics of all ages out there. I got a ""free"" DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be ""Ringheads."" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of ""extras"", several ""making of"" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year.While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that ""the fellowship of the ring"" will undertake, to ultimately return the ""one ring"" to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a ""great"" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect.  However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works.

Terrible beginning,"At the end of this movie, it made me wonder what is the nature of drama and science fiction building for this movie or series.
Throughout this film - which was relatively long in length - he did not explain the importance of each individual and what dimensions would happen if we lost any of them, but he answered himself, is that if we lost any character if he affected us, some characters were interchangeable and without a dramatic build that made me not Sympathy for any character who died, what is the benefit of inserting characters and disposing of them without any dramatic construction that makes us sympathize with them? This is however, it took a long time for us to know the characters presented
As for building this world itself, it carries a lot of problems, such as how important is my knowledge of the number of rings that were made, or what is the importance of the people who carry them, the whole idea focused on one ring! Or what is the importance of those rings basically!
The film suffers from defects on the level of visual effects, and the solution was that they color the film with exaggerated colors in order to hide these defects.
On the level of events, and after reviewing it in my mind after finishing the film, I did not find anything that would serve the future development of events. The film was weak in exposing the dimensions of the world in which the story tells all that happened is to show the skills of characters in adventures that have no cause or meaning in three hours And half.
I did not like the way magic was cast and it was totally unattractive compared to other films like Harry Potter, and by the way Harry Potter was in the same year and it had much better visual effectsIn the end, I liked the original score and sounds and the cinematography, the movie gave us some wonderful staff",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
LOTR: The Video Game,"I really don't understand the hype and attention surrounding this film.  It basically plays out like a video game version of the book.  Are people so bereft of imagination that they have to see it up on a screen in order to really enjoy it?As an avid reader, I occasionally run across a book that makes me think ""gosh, this would really make a great movie.""  In fact, after reading Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" years before it was made into a film, I thought about that -- and the rest is history.Many have commented that LOTR is one of those stories that just don't translate well to the big screen, so what's the point?  And in my opinion, it honestly didn't translate well to the screen.  The story feels rushed, the action sequences feel like a video game and unless someone has read the books, it's impossible to care about the fates of any of the characters.  No matter what people say, this film is primarily by fans, for fans -- and that isn't a formula that translates into any kind of quality.What has happened to people?  How could this passable yet ultimately mediocre screen translation have made it to #1 on the IMDB?  I suspect it's because people are really wanting a continuation of the saga of Middle Earth, which I understand... being a big fan of LeGuin's ""Earthsea"" trilogy, I wanted more books featuring Ged's adventures among the islands too (the fourth book was almost a ""sellout"").  But I wouldn't want to see the Earthsea trilogy butchered like ""FOTR"" through translation to a format that's totally unsuitable.  LOTR might have made a great, high-budget miniseries, but condensing each book into ~3 hours is just flat-out impossible, it's butchery.  Murder by camera lens.I'm sure the video game (coming soon, no doubt) will sell millions of copies, because apparently that's what people want... an escape into imagination and fantasy, and for some reason this particular story is ""it"" to many people.  There's nothing wrong with that, but why aren't the books good enough?  You have to have Tolkien's subtlety browbeaten into you with ""The Mummy"" style CGI and sound effects, too?10/10 for the book series, 5/10 for the movie (great visuals, poor everything else).",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent adventure,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb ""Top 250"" list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Big Surprise,"Before this movie was made, I had barely even heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When the movie came out, it got such rave reviews and looked so interesting that I was quite eager to see it. When I finally did see it, I was SO impressed. The story is absolutely enthralling, the special affects were amazing, and the acting was superb. This movie really got me more interested in all the actors playing the hobbits, and also Ian McKellen, actually to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed all the actors, especially, Viggo Mortensen(playing Aragorn). There is not one element, one scene in this movie, (in my opinion) that could use any improvement. I would strongly recommend this movie to any who enjoys the fantasy\science fiction, even if you have not read the books. This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Middle Earth is a Place to Marvel,"It's just hard to complain about Fellowship of the Ring. Even the time isn't something I'm mad about, regardless of the fact that I watched the extended cut. There's just so much poise and beauty to this movie, even for one that didn't come from a time of great CGI and VFX that we have now. Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with this movie to the most minute detail. Every acting job is done amazingly, and I love every bit of it. One thing I found really interesting was the way humans are portrayed as these greedy people who are hard to manage, compared to such elegant and fun creatures across the Middle Earth. They really make our human conditions shine. From start to finish, there's so many layers of amazing things, and it just brings a smile to my face while watching. The action is sprinkled throughout in a good manner too. I just love Lord of the Rings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
You Shall be the Fellowship of the Ring - 16 Years Ago I entered a Magical World that had me hooked and enhanced ever since,"16 Years ago when I was 9, I bought a VHS of Fellowship of the Ring and as soon as I watched it, I was enhanced with the world, the characters, creatures and visuals and my mind was blown - I had not seen a film like this. The movie is more than sheer brilliance - its phenomenal and undeniably passionate movie-making on a flawless scale - from the unforgettable and fantastic acting from a brilliant ensemble to the splendid writing that develops the character, kick- starts a great story with thought-provoking themes and builds a glorious fantasy world to the intense and impressive action set pieces.Based on the book with the same name and set in the world of Middle- Earth, The Fellowship of the Ring sees young hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a magical ring from his uncle, Bilbo, that is revealed to have been created by the Dark Lord Sauron, who was destroyed during a battle with the forces of Men and Elves. If Sauron regains the ring, he can regain physical form and bring destruction to Middle- Earth. As Sauron's forces desperately seek the ring across the land, Frodo and a group of eight companions - comprising of the wise wizard Gandalf, mysterious ranger Aragorn, Frodo's loyal companion (and love interest) Sam, Frodo's mischievous cousins Merry and Pippin, elf prince Legolas, fearsome dwarf Gimli and the troubled, but heroic warrior Boromir - set out from Rivendell to the fires of Mount Doom where the ring can only be destroyed.So where can I start? The film perfectly captures Tolkien's world from the books by using beautiful sets and using New Zealand landscapes to visualise it, backed up by fantastic performances from the entire cast (including the creatures), the use of brilliant CGI with prosthetics & practical effects and big-atures, an intriguing script to bring a monumental story to life and the unforgettable action scenes (intense and thrilling fight in Balin's Tomb, Gandalf's stand against the Balrog, the prologue with Sauron as a bad-ass and the heart- poundingly stirring fight at Amon Hen). The film, like its successors, is epic in every way - from cinematography to costumes to its music score to its flawless directing - setting the standard from filmmaking and being the most revolutionary films in the fantasy genre. Even though The Two Towers is the best installment (and my preferred favourite) in the Rings Trilogy, I'll admit that Fellowship is the most flawless in the trilogy. Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an undeniably outstanding achievement in cinema and a fantastic start to the greatest trilogy of all time and all three films are utterly phenomenal.Pros: The script & story, the cast & characters, flawless direction, action scenes, beautiful cinematography, Howard Shore's stirring score, practical effects/prosthetics with great CGI, the use of on- location and Boromir's death is the most emotional (and possibly the best) death in the entire trilogyCons: Frodo is a bit stiff in a few scenes, I didn't care for how the characters make Boromir look untrustworthy when he's a deeply troubled individual, Galadriel and Arwen could have been more developed as characters and Sam crying out for Frodo in the cornfield is the most cringiest moment in the entire LOTR trilogy",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Beautiful images but painfully dull plot & pacing,"This film is beautiful to watch - like looking at a wonderful photo album of a fantasy world. But it is PAINFULLY slow and dull. I gave it a second watch recently and after about 1.5 hours into it I was playing with my iPHONE instead.The trouble is the protagonists are invincible and you know they're always going to be okay. And even worse, the director throws at them stupid number of baddies which is totally unrealistic, and there's no real sense of danger. The battle scenes are too CGI obviously, and go on too long.Watch the original ""Clash of the Titans"" instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books?,"Trying to be as objective as possible from the stand-point of one of the ""purist"", my humble question is: Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books? Or more importantly, did Ms. Walsh ever read the books? After all, is it not the responsibility of the true screen writer to condense and translate (while remaining true to the original works) the written word to a format suitable for filming? While no one can deny that the cinematography, graphics, special effects and even the casting (in most cases) deserves the highest praise. It is the loss of the true spirit of the literary work, that irks me most.While I can forgive the omission of many key characters (the films would have been ten times longer), I can not forgive the changes made to what motivated the remaining characters; the blatant changes in events and the placement of characters; the addition of scenes and events that never happened in the book; and of who did what, when and especially why! For the ""purists"" I would not recommend these films, your will be utterly disappointed and dismayed. For those who don't care, or have never read the books -go -you'll have fun -enjoy!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
AMAZING!!!!!! a brilliant work of art!!!!,"I just have to say, that The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best movie's that I have EVER seen!!! Although most of Peter Jackson's films weren't that great, he hit a goldmine with this one. And the cast was perfect. Ian McKellen had the perfect ability to seem both kind and friendly, as well as appear frightening when called for to portray Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen possesses the right amount of mystery and cunning to play Aragorn. Sean Astin has the dimwitted and homely quality to play Frodo's loyal friend Samwise. Elijah Wood, in a surprisingly new role astounded me as Frodo, able to show both his frightened side and his brave side. John Ryhs-Davies portrayed the proud and somewhat snobbish (in the line of elves) Gimli. Orlando Bloom, in an amazing breakthrough performance captured Legolas' quiet and graceful demeanor perfectly. Sean Bean played Boromir's greedy, yet nationalistic character wonderfully. Dominic Monaghan and Bill y Boyd played the dim-witted sidekicks of Frodo, Merry and Pippin, without flaw.It was a powerful adventure and I can't wait until December.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Epic Film that beings the book to life,"So with the Lockdown back in effect I thought it was time to get started on re watching The Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit Films so yesterday I watched The Fellowship Of The Ring and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of companions from different races have to come together to travel to a dark land to destroy a powerful ring and stop the dark lord Sauron.Main Character
Elijah Wood plays Frodo Baggins a Hobbit who is tasked with carrying the ring and he is great here. You really get the feeling that Frodo is out of his depth on the quest but Wood does a good job in making him likeable and you really want to see him succeed in his quest. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and he is brilliant here, he is such a physical actor here and he nails all the action scenes that he is given. He is also a really interesting character, I mean you are given bits and pieces in this film to keep you interested, but not giving you too much right off the bat.Supporting Characters
There are so many characters in this film and everybody is great but I will only talk about a few of them in greater detail. Sir Ian McKellen plays Gandalf The Grey and he is awesome here, Gandalf is so wise and McKellen nails it as the wise, fun and action heavy wizard that is a real mentor figure to the rest of The Fellowship and does it effectively. Sean Bean plays Boromir and he is also a really interesting character here, he has a bit of a darker personality then the other characters but he gives a very memorable performance. Sir Christopher Lee plays Saruman The White and of course he is fantastic, he is a legend and a hue Lord Of The Rings fan so of course he is great in the role, Saruman is another really interesting cog of the film and his dynamic with Gandalf is fascinating to watch. As I said everybody is great, Orlando Bloom is great, Cate Blanchett is great, Sean Astin is great and the whole group is just so great and one of the greatest ensembles of all time.Story
The story is great, it brings you into this world as we follow these people come together on this epic quest. The characters and their connection together is what drives the film forward and you will end up caring about all of them throughout, it has a simple good vs evil but layers it with so much depth to make this a great journey. The film may be 3 hours long but the story stays interesting throughout and moves at a really nice pace to keep you intrigued for every minute of the film.Script
The script is great, it takes this fantastical world and gives us interesting and down to earth characters that we can look up to and care about. This is obviously a very dramatic film and it nails all of that but it is the humour too that makes this script legendary. You can go from drama to humour and it feels really natural and helps build the world and the characters up.Style
The style of the film is amazing, the landscapes of New Zealand where it was filmed it as beautiful as ever which is advanced by some legendary cinematography mixed with Howard Shore's epic score that just brings you into Middle Earth. Even though the film is 3 hours long it is paced perfectly and as I mentioned before keeps you invested throughout with some great action scenes.Overall
Overall, The Fellowship Of The Ring is one of the greatest films ever made, if you haven't seen this film then find not only 3 hours but nine hours to watch all of these films, heck maybe watch the extended editions but do it whenever you can as it is a must watch.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Extended Edition Recommended,"A world so distant never feels so close. The Lord of the Rings is an immersive experience, taking you along a journey of emotions as you absorb the beautiful landscapes in New Zealand along with one of if not the most iconic scores in film history. Attention to detail in costumes is some of the highest quality seen in film history, and CGI still holds up to many modern movies and tv. While not an exact replication of the novels, LoTR is possibly the most perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stupendous!,"I've never been a fan of fantasy(not read Tolkien's books),but Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring"" totally blew me away!This masterpiece is simply amazing!Everything here is excellent:the acting,the sets,the special effects by Richard Taylor etc.The film was shot in New Zealand for example in Matamata(Hobbiton),Kaitoke Regional Park(Rivendell),Glenorchy(Lothlorien)etc.My favourite characters are:Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen),Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood),Galadriel(Cate Blanchett)and Boromir(Sean Bean).The film is full of incredibly beautiful images(the Dark Riders galloping on their horses etc.),some scenes like a fight with a huge Troll in Moria are literally unbelievable.I still can't believe that Peter Jackson,who was responsible for such excellent(and extremely gory-I might add!)horror movies like ""Bad Taste""(1987)and ""Braindead""(1992)created this masterpiece.I only hope he'll return to his splatter origins.10 out of 10-what else?I am waiting impatiently to see the following two parts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Haven't felt this excited since I was a 12 year old kid,"Whether it was the opening action sequences or the finale, my heart rate was going a mile a minute watching this movie.  FOTR did everything every other fantasy film should have done; it had fantastic creatures and beings that had previously only appeared in my dreams and my imagination.  Jackson did a tremendous job making tangible what I previously had to visualize by reading the books. Without getting too specific and spoiling the ending, my only critique of the movie was that it was a little anti-climatic.  Then again, the book was also anti-climatic because it was the first part of a trilogy.I would also like to comment about how many people have compared Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to this film.  My advice is to see them both, don't compare them, and enjoy the each as the great stories they are.This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of.  It wasn't boring.  It didn't lack action.  It wasn't overhyped.  The acting was good.  And those that said it had too many ""Scenery"" shots should consider Doctor Zhivago...it was 4 hours of trains and snow, but still a classic! Give this movie a shot, and enjoy it for what it is; the visualization of a classic tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"More, more.  I want more.","I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more.  This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films.  Thank you, Peter.  I am hungrily awaiting the next two.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
*A Timeless Journey into the Heart of Middle-earth*,"From the moment the screen flickers to life, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring unfolds like a grand tapestry, intricately woven with legend, adventure, and the epic struggle between light and darkness. Peter Jackson's masterful adaptation of J. R. Tolkien's beloved novel is not simply a film; it is a monumental achievement in storytelling that transcends the genre of fantasy and truly captures the essence of human resilience and friendship.At the heart of this cinematic masterpiece is the journey of an unassuming hobbit named Frodo Baggins, played with poignant nuance by Elijah Wood. The sheer audacity of entrusting the fate of Middle-earth to such a humble figure creates a powerful narrative dichotomy that resonates deeply with audiences. As Frodo embarks on his perilous quest to destroy the One Ring, we are invited to accompany him and a fellowship that includes the brave Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the wise wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the fiercely loyal Sam (Sean Astin), among others. Each character is beautifully fleshed out, their distinct traits and backstories enriching the quest and imprinting them into our hearts.The film is a breathtaking marvel, with the sweeping landscapes of New Zealand serving as an awe-inspiring backdrop for the iconic realms of Middle-earth. The cinematography captures the breathtaking beauty of the Shire, the ominous shadows of Moria, and the ethereal majesty of Rivendell, making every frame feel like a painting come to life. Howard Shore's hauntingly beautiful score acts as a symphonic guide through this grand adventure, imbuing each moment with a sense of urgency and wonder.What truly elevates The Fellowship of the Ring beyond mere spectacle is its profound exploration of themes such as friendship, sacrifice, and the eternal struggle against evil. The camaraderie formed among the members of the fellowship mirrors the strength of unity in the face of insurmountable odds, reminding us of the power that lies within bonds forged through shared peril. This film teaches that even the smallest person can change the course of the future, a message that resounds powerfully throughout generations.The craftsmanship in this film is remarkable-from the stunning practical effects to the meticulous costume and set design, every element has been carefully considered to ensure authenticity. The dialogue is rich and brimming with the gravitas of a world steeped in history, and the inclusion of Tolkien's own words grounds the narrative in a sense of belonging to an ancient lore.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a timeless classic that stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. It enchants, inspires, and invites us to dream about the possibilities that lie beyond our own backyards. As the credits roll, we are left not only with the echoes of an epic adventure but the unforgettable truth that in a world shadowed by darkness, hope, friendship, and courage can light the way through the darkest of times. This is more than a film-it is an invitation to embark on a journey that will forever resonate in the hearts and minds of all who dare to step into Middle-earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Best Lord Of The Rings Movie!,"Most people would say Return of the King tops Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers as the best Lord of the Rings movie. Whether it was the incredible makeup, cinematography, directing and acting there's no doubt that Return of the King was an amazing movie but in my opinion the Fellowship of the Ring was better. I felt they did a better job keeping the story going and maybe it's just that I always seem to prefer the first movie out of series but I just thought this one was better. But anyway this is definitely worth watching and while your at it watch the other two there fantastic too.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A painful mutilation of the greatest piece of fantasy literature.,"I am a big fan of Tolkien's books, but the movie doesn't do justice to them at all and actually is a major annoyance. The scenery and most of the personae are actually depicted very nicely, but as soon as acting and talking starts it becomes plain that the story has been cut, changed, dumbed down, and vulgarized to such a degree that nothing is left of Tolkien's masterpiece and what remains is just an over-length,  fantasy film with a thin story and boring characters.The film has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, its fundamental assumptions seem to be: (1) if a danger is such that the heroes just might escape then it's no real danger and must be enlarged to ridiculous proportions. (2) Comic relief can only be achieved through slapstick of the crudest kind. (3) Battle scenes must last at least as long as it would take a five-year-old to read the corresponding passages backward in Chinese. Moreover, if they could be done without special effects they are bad and must be ""enhanced"". (4) A traitor must walk around with a sign saying ""I am a traitor"".The worst example for this lack of subtlety is that the Ring is handled much too often, too openly, and with too little care. This trivializes the sinister and threatening item and takes away much of the power of the story.The reckless exaggeration in the ""action scenes"" is equally awful. Case in point the ""Gate of Moria""-scene, when the Watcher gives Frodo a ride     in the merry-go-round until everyone had a chance to hack at him; the more restrained story in the book is much more effective IMHO. Similarly mutilated are the scenes: ""Crossing of the Brandywine"", ""Cutting Cushions in Bree"", ""The Burning of the Riders"" at Weathertop, ""The Drowning of Sam Gamgee"", ""Wizards slug it out in Orthanc"", and, of course, ""They have a Cave Troll"", and, really, all of Moria.The main hero, Frodo, gives the impression of a loser: all the scenes in which (in the book) he shows courage, wisdom, resolve are cut or changed. Worst i find this in the key scenes in the Barrow (cut) and at Weathertop. There is nothing in the film giving any hint why Frodo might be ""the best Hobbit in the Shire"".Due to the many cut or twisted scenes, more than half of the characters have little resemblance to the ones in Tolkien's LotR: Frodo is a loser, Merry and Pippin are idiots until they suddenly turn out to be warrior princes, Elrond appears to be permanently pissed off -- as if everything ""... stinks!"", Strider is just another warrior hero (his being a loremaster, a healer, the ""greatest traveller of our time"" etc. does not show), Galadriel and Lorien is done so badly that i wish it would have been cut completely (""more fair than thought of mortal men"" is a tall order, but Jackson does not even manage ""fair""). Only Gandalf, Bilbo, and Saruman are rendered more or less well.I could go on, nearly every scene has gone wrong. Nothing of the depth of Tolkien's vision, the attention he paid to details (not only visual but to fine-tuning the development of the main characters) or the poetry in his creation is conveyed. What remains of the story is not told in a very coherent or convincing fashion, neither the acting nor the special effects are remarkable.All in all, a complete and utter failure to turn a great book into a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Monumental masterpiece,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The first chapter in Peter Jackson's beautiful re-imagining of Middle- Earth created by J.R.R Tolkien's best selling novels comes a story of friendship, trust, hope and tragedy. A small, shy Hobbit Frodo Baggins gets more than he bargained for when he has to protect a magical ring from evil hands and save Middle-Earth from eternal darkness. I could go into a lot more detail but I don't want to spoil the superb story-line. Just know it's of memorable quality and definitely keeps you engaged until the end.Story: 10/10I'll touch on the wonderful visuals created by Peter Jackson, from The Shire all the way to the Mines of Moria and Amon Hen these all look beautiful and unique, Peter really wanted to create something memorable, unforgettable and spectacular here. The characters all look unique and easy to tell apart. Elves look like Elves, Dwarfs like Dwarfs and Orcs like, well, Orcs. The costume design is great, the CGI effects and locations are stunning, even to today's standards. With the Blu-Ray edition of these movies you are getting a real treat visually.Visuals: 10/10The next thing to explain about, is the sound design. Howard Shore gives his musical excellence here to provide a truly breath-taking soundtrack. When the audience is meant to feel happy, the music is heart warming and cheerful, when you are meant to cry the music deepens down and hits your heart strings emotionally. The music does a perfect job of immersing you in this fantasy world and really keeps you there until the experience is over. The dialogue is key to success also, the actors all provide key and believable dialogue here, the sound design is also as fantastic as the visuals.Audio: 10/10The acting is key here, you wouldn't a bad actor in any main role of such a high expected movie. Elijah Wood provides his role as young Frodo Baggins and plays him extremely well here, accompanied by Sean Astin as Sam-Wise Gamgee. The stand performance in this movie has to be Ian Mckellen as Gandalf the Grey, his timing with his lines is perfect, his facial expressions are spot on and his commitment to the role is also worth mentioning, all the actors seemed to have fun in their roles and all seemed pleased with their deliverance of performance. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett also provide roles as chief characters in this masterpiece as all the acting is of top standard.Acting: 10/10The overall verdict of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is ...Perfect visuals, a masterpiece of a soundtrack and superb acting. Overall I put this as one of my favourite movies of all time and this is definitely worth the highest mark.Movie: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This trilogy is a trilogy that I don't think gets enough credit.,"I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom.I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing.The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored.When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category.Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films.The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot film.These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy.My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs.The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic.Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit.FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
2nd time around still a very good film,I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Peter Jackson Conjures Up the Most Potent Motion Picture Magic in Years!,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai.In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom.Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment.Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way.Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolutely an epic,"Novel to movie adaptation is difficult, the storyline is easy to be disrupted, and the characters will also be affected.

surprising,"well, ""the lord of the rings"" has always been my favourite book. when i first heard about the movie, i decided to boycott it. I mean, it's so annoying to not be the only one loving the novel anymore. for years i've tried to convince people to read the book and nobody wanted to/had the time to/was interessted in it. and just because there was some hollywood-blockbuster made, everybody around me has turned into a ""lord of the rings-expert"". so, can't change that anyway but didn't ever want to watch the movie because I thought there was no chance that anyone could ever bring the shire to live the way i've been imagining it. boy, was i wrong... some friends of mine ""convinced"" me to watch it (=told me they had tickets for ""Le pacte de loupes"" and waited for me to find out which movie we were actually watching) And, what can I say, I loved it. i totally lost myself in the beautiful landscape and the (let's not deny it) HOT actors. Although I should hate my friends for tricking me into watching it, i'm now a big fan of the movie myself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
My mouth is watering,"I left this movie yearning to see it again and again!  And I did so- four times in the theater.  I can't wait till it is released on DVD, or until the rest of the trilogy is released.  From one who has read the books, I have to say it stayed very true to them.  A few omissions were made, but they were necessary to keep the movie down to three hours.  Now onto the good stuff. Casting was excellent.  I can't think of a better person to play Frodo than Elijah Wood, nor a better person to play Gandalf than Ian McKellan.  The other hobbits were played very well, and notable performances were given by Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom.  Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler played their parts very well, too.  The landscapes, shot in New Zealand, were simply breathtaking.  The Shire and Bilbo's house were just as I imagined them.  The background music complimented the action very well, and the visual effects, especially the Balrog, were stunning.  I am also particular to the storyline, but I think it could not have been done better.  Good luck at the Oscars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Should have easily won best film 2002,"Well what can you say that hasn't been said before 2,900 times. One of the biggest films of all time, and a tragedy that the boffoons at the Academy voted snoozathon A Beautiful Mind as best film. Yes it was OK but really how many times have we seen movies similar to that?Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, had everything one could wish for. Top notch acting, a dramatic storyline, superb cinematography, Stunning landscapes and a classic soundtrack!Some reviewers have stated it is too long. I say it's not long enough and I could have quite happily have sat in the theatre for another hour no problem.I also noticed that many people have voted this film a 1. IMDb should have another top film table, minus the silly ""1"" votes. This film could never, ever be a one in anyones imagination.I, like many here, have read and loved the books. Watching the movie we see the images that were conjured up in our minds when reading the books. So many have said its exactly what they imagined it's almost uncanny but fantastic to behold. I totally agree.As for a lot of the doubters saying its not a patch on The Godfather, Shawshank, etc, well they wouldn't know whan a real classic came along to join these great movies. Yes, Godfather is a good movie, Shawshank is a good movie (though in my opinion slightly overated) But LOTR is the fantasy classic of our time. 20 years from now LOTR will have earned itself the status of classic fantasy adventure, with virtually no doubter whatsoever, a landmark that other films will strive, and mostly fail to achieve.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing Middle-earth to life for so many of us grateful fans. Personally I can't wait for the extended DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of unseen footage, which arrives in November.cheers",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolutely Magical,"This film (along with the entire trilogy) is regarded as one of the greatest, most influential films of all time and with good reason. This movie has audiences captivated from the beginning to the end. Even watching it in 2015, I am still stunned by the special effects, the set, the scenery, the acting, the plot, the camera shots and angles, the make up, the costumes, and the editing among many other factors. Most note-worthy is the score which brings a whole new perspective and sound to science fiction and to fictitious worlds and characters. Even though the story contains a lot of sci-fi jargon, the writing and dialog do a very good job in relaying the information to the audience. The writers did an excellent job in simplifying and clarifying an intricate and brilliant story.Well done Peter Jackson.

What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end. You'll understand that only by watching the film.I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but Tolkien's universe is one I loved, and this is one of the movies that introduced me to the whole world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Heroic Fellowship,"Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read ""The Hobbit"" way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style.The narrative at the movie's beginning was necessary for a novice like myself. The One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron must be destroyed or all will be lost in Middle-earth. The Ring possesses great power and the seductive power of evil. The Ring that has been lost for 2500 years ends up in the hands of Hobbit, Frodo (Elija Wood). The powerful wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) recognizes the Ring for what it is. Frodo's charge is to destroy the Ring. Soon a Fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest. There are Elves, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Orcs, and Humans along the way. The journey is filled both with bravery and betrayal. Gandalf's master, Saruman (Christopher Lee), has aligned himself with Lord Sauron. The Ranger, Strider (Viggo Mortensen), becomes the protector of the brave Frodo. The first hour moves very slow under the weight of the material and set up. The last two hours of the movie move briskly. This is a very stuffed 3 hour movie that does not feel longer than that, or shorter.What makes ""Fellowship of the Rings"" so captivating is it's tale of heroes and great warriors. Elija Wood does an amazing job in the transformation of Frodo. At first Frodo is overwhelmed by the responsibility he undertakes, then he sees that he must do what is right, and he realizes that he is not alone. Wood combines the anxiety and courage magically. Ian McKellan is awesome as Gandalf. As the powerful and aging wizard he is the leader that inspires greatness in others. Viggo Mortensen as Strider/ Aragorn is charismatic, and the soul of the ""Fellowship."" Strider is a great warrior and a true samurai. Strider gives his word to Frodo that he will protect him with his life, and he keeps his word. Mortensen plays Strider as man of few words, backed up by action, compassion, and seemingly haunted by a dark secret. He absolutely commands the screen. Also impressive are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the Elf archer, and Sean Bean as the warrior Boromir, who battles the seductive power of the Ring. Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as Galadriel, the muse of this Fellowship. Liv Tyler is beautiful as Arwen, though she does have much of a role in this installment.Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful storytelling with great performances from a very talented cast. I look forward to rest of the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny ""You shall not pass!""so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something.

These three LOTR films are a flat-out miracle -- the high-water mark of fantasy cinema,"Just back from seeing Fellowship of the Ring at a special screening from one of our local indy cinemas. I have the Extended Editions of all three on DVD, but I'd never seen the EE on the big screen before, and wow was it worth it. It's an immersive experience like little else I've ever had at the movies. The audience I was in was filled (mostly) with people too young to have seen the original release back in 2001, or else parents who would have gone to the original now taking their kids to it. The whole theater was raptly silent through it all, laughed and gasped at the appropriate places, and applauded at the end. I really think the Extended Editions take care of most of the shortcomings or gaps in the original theater-release versions, and by now should be the canonical versions.All three of the LOTR films get a 10/10 from me, but you can make a reasonable argument that Fellowship is the best of them. There's so much material, so much ground to cover, done so well! It has the crucial job of starting off the epic task of building an entire world in front of our eyes, setting the scene, and introducing most of the key characters: and the stakes were high. Had this opener failed, the rest of the trilogy would have been dead in the water and maybe would have brought down New Line Cinema with it. Scene after scene that sticks in the memory: the lengthy Introduction with Cate Blanchett's silky voice narrating. The Shire, of course. The inn at Bree, and Weathertop. The ride to the fords of Bruinen. Rivendell and the Council of Elrond. Moria and the bridge of Khavad-Dum. Lothlorien. The Riven Anduin, the Argonath, Boromir, the splitting of the Fellowship. Peter Jackson and his immense New Zealand crew succeeded in conjuring an entire self-consistent universe for us to live in that, still, no other fantasy movie has ever come close to achieving. And in each of the three movies there are scenes that I can only call transcendent -- so riveting and cinematically brilliant that they leap right into your heart. One of these is the Mirror of Galadriel. In Two Towers, the very opening. In Return of the King, the chain of signal fires. And think of the major role of Howard Shore's musical score; hyper-romantic, heroic, edgy, comforting, delicate by turns; his themes (leitmotifs, really, like Wagner operas) are as dominant as any character. It's kind of impossible to recall any part of the trilogy without that musical score running through your head. For years, one friend of mine listened to the score on an almost weekly basis, and who can fault him?One VERY important thing that struck me right from the first viewing back in 2001 was how much attention was paid to the historical context of Middle-Earth. We're looking at a world that has already had thousands of years of history and conflict. It's an old civilization and the sense of deep history is being put right in front of us -- the old watchtower of Amon Sul (Weathertop), the ancient mines of Moria and the dwarven halls, the immense old statues of the Argonath, crumbling ruins from ages past, everywhere the Fellowship goes. What's being played out in LOTR at the end of the Third Age is really just the end-game to a long, long story stretching back to the First Age, when the ultimate lord of evil Morgoth was defeated by the gods at Thangorodrim. The equally long Second Age finished up with the Last Alliance of Elves and Men on the slopes of Mount Doom in a bigger, more titanic battle than anything the Third Age would see. This richness of invention is incredibly impressive.And then there's the cast. This series made stars out of Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Karl Urban, Sean Astin, and half a dozen others in career-defining roles. The already-big stars like Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen and Hugo Weaving rose further, and two decades later they are indelibly linked with their LOTR roles.I want to go on and on but I'd be repeating what you can find in any number of reviews elsewhere. So to say again, the LOTR film trilogy is a bloody miracle. Inevitable followups have come along (the Hobbit trilogy of course, and the new Rings of Power series) that are actually not bad. Taken on their own merit, they have great production values and decent acting. It's just that they can't match up to one of the high-water marks of all of cinematic history.I'm still waiting for someone (Peter Jackson, are you listening?) to take on the story that was actually Tolkien's favorite, the one closest to his heart. That's the one with Luthien and Beren, Morgoth and the First Age, the one that set off his whole work on the history of Middle-Earth. Gods, demigods, heroes, monsters, romance, pure good and evil and everything in between -- it's got it all just like LOTR. Well, maybe someday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Film for Our Times,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is a movie for our times. If we look past the stunning visual effects, lush scenery, and spectacular action sequences, and listen to the wisdom of Gandalf and Galadriel we hear the quiet whisper of the true meaning of the film- heroism. The message of this film is that true heroes are not the great and powerful, but the everyday person placed unexpectedly into trying circumstances. What a message at this time in our country's history. On September 11th we saw normal, everyday peoples lives changed suddenly, unexpectedly. They were forced to be heroes, to work to save not only their own lives, but the lives of others too. As Gandalf says, we do not choose what times we live in, but we choose what we do with the time we have.Remember this theme and focus on Frodo's trials and perserverance whenever you watch this movie. Remember the loyalty and friendship of Sam. That is what this movie is truly about.Peter Jackson has created a visually stunning film, filled with action, yet rich with meaning. He has for the most part stayed true to the themes and sequences in the books. While he has changed some characters and scenes, those changes do not significantly alter the plot and in some instances actually improve it.Though the movie is played out on a grand scale, the film is really about a story of one little hobbit, Frodo, and his unexpected challenge of having to be a hero.The score by Howard Shore is superb, quite worthy of the Oscar it received. The score is destined to become a classic.The cinematography is also superb, also definitely worthy of its Oscar.My one criticism, is that Saruman is given more time on screen than in the books. I felt he should be more so behind the scenes as he was in the books. The more sinister evil is the evil that cannot be seen. Though Christopher Lee, as always, is superb.The rest of the cast is also superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Kate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are also excellent in their roles, bringing a strong female presence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Lord of the Rings: The Forging of a Superior Series.,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the starting point for the now classic Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and while aspects of the movies haven't aged too well (like the rubbery CGI rag-doll stunt effects), they're still joys to watch and you are truly in Middle-earth. Peter Jackson brings his bombastic and theatrical sensibilities with these movies and his direction brings something from across the emotional spectrum of many different cinematic genres; and the experience works so well.For any lover of Tolkien, such as myself, it's notable and incredibly obvious when Jackson takes creative liberties; but the changes from the novels are necessary. In spite of some of the inevitable changes when making the movies, they play out fine in the end: the changes add nice drama to the story and there's still nice visual subtlety in the performances from the magnificent cast of Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies.The film is full of classic moments like the Mines of Moria sequence, the Lothlórien scenes and of course the good-old Shire: the locations of the Baggins of Bag End. There are so many remarkable things in this movie. Everything right down to the music is well done here and adds to one of the most well-realized fantasy film settings in history.I'd want to thank Peter Jackson personally for giving us the three movies of his fantastical magnum opus based on one of the greatest novels of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"With stellar performances, beautiful cinematography, haunting epic music, and it's regards to the source material, The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start after 10 years","Based on the first installment of the trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story about a dark lord named Sauron who created the powerful ring that would rule all of Middle Earth. Despite the dark lord being destroyed, the spirit of the ring lived on for ages until one day, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit leaves the Shire and leaves the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. However, Sauron's army seeks to find the One Ring and kill anyone who carries it. Aided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, three hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin along with Aragorn, a strider, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, and Boromir of Gondor, the group set off on a journey to Mount Doom and send the One Ring back to the fires where it was created.When I was a kid I was only into cartoons and then I came across the 1978 cartoon from Ralph Bakshi when it was on video (only parts of it until I saw the whole thing when it was on Cartoon Network) Later, when I was a teenage, I finally got into watching the trilogy and needless to say, I was blown away. This film is not only a great start to the trilogy but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not to mention that it got me into reading the book trilogy which is well written full of beautiful world building, great characters, an interesting lore surrounding Middle Earth, and engrossing action.The story is great and keeps up with the spirit of the source material. Not only that, it has emotional moments and great action sequences while having some character depth. The pacing while slow is very lively, the editing is superb, the directing from Peter Jackson is solid, and the cinematography is very gorgeous. Even the costumes are well designed.The music score from Howard Shore is great. Epic haunting, and sad which gives a neat atmosphere to the film especially the themes of Middle Earth and the characters as well. And last but not least the actors.Acting-wise, everyone gives a stellar performance. The late actors Christopher Lee and Ian Holm did great as Saruman the wizard who gathers Sauron's forces and Bilbo Baggins the hobbit who got possessed by the ring for a long time. The other actors did a great job too. Ian McKellen did fantastic as Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortensen did stellar as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom and John Rhy Davies did great as Legolas and Gimli, Sean Bean did a nice job as the corrupted Boromir, Liv Tyler and Hugo Heaving did great as Arwen and Lord Elrond, and the actors who played the hobbits did a stellar job too.Elijah Wood as the vulnerable hobbit Frodo, Sean Astin as his loyal friend Sam, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan did great as Pippin and Merry who share some nice humor while providing some loyalty too.Overall The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and a solid adaptation of the book.

A Powerful and Moving Movie,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was the most magnificant movie I have ever seen. From the sets to the costumes; from the acting to the directing; this movie has a stunning outcome. The most truly wonderful thing about this movie is the story. J.R.R. Tolkien had such a brilliant mind. His languages and creatures were ingenious. But, Peter Jackson was also brilliant in his glorious attempt to bring the books to life.First of all, the scenery was amazing. Hobbiton was exactly how I imagined it. Bilbo's hobbit hole at Bag End was quite a site. Moria was as dark and scary yet bold and beautiful as a mind could imagine it to be. Lorien was so incredibly beautiful. The quick glimpse shown of Minas Tirith was enough to tell us that Gondor will be a stunning site. The Great River and Amon Sul were also sights to behold. But the most beautiful thing created on the set was Rivendell. That is the closest thing any mind could compare to paradise. The sculptures and intricate carvings were amazing. The sets alone were a true accomplishment.The costumes were perfect. Arwen and Galadriel both wore stunning, flowing dresses. Gandalf wouldn't be Gandalf without his tall pointy hat and long staff. The elves magnificant garments and the hobbits adorable apparel only made the movie better.What pulls any movie together, to make it worth seeing is the acting. Elijah Wood has always shown off his wonderful acting talents and he proved once and for all that he is an amazing actor. Ian Mckellen seemed so wise and magical that if one didn't know better, you would have assumed he was a wizard. Viggo Mortensen was amazing. He turned from a mysterious ranger to a bold King. I know in the next to movies he will continue to amaze us. I wasn't too fond of Arwens increased part but Liv Tyler made it count. Sean Astin was perfect for Samwise Gamgee, the best friend someone could have. Two of my favorite characters of course were Merry and Pippin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd made the movie very enjoyable adding some comic relief. The rest of the cast were just as good in their roles. And it doesn't hurt that Orlando Bloom is incredibly attractive.All in all, everything about this movie helped to make my favorite books a reality.

Uninteresting,"This was one of the most anticipated movies, ever, and this is also the first movie I have ever seen that had required 3 sittings to go through, because I feel asleep twice. The point of a movie is not to set up the scene for subsequent movies, rather, to move along the story and not dwell on the same themes over and over again. Yes, we knew the wraiths can find the ring, yes, we knew Aragorn was the king and he didnt really want to be king but he needs to be king. Yes, we know gandalf kicks ass, yes, we know that the lure of the ring is great and it can corrupt easily and blah blah. How many times can the SAME themes be repeated over and over without being boring?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It just does not get any better than this. Period.,"I've watched this movie the first time it was released when I was young (my father took me to cinema theater in my hometown) and I watched it now in 2024 for the roughly of total 20th time during the past years until now. As I've made a longer pause between my last watch and this one, just to see whether this movie is really a masterpiece now that I'm older than before - and it fricking is! I cannot stress this enough. This movie has made my life better and more dreamy at times whereas it stands alone as one of the best cinematic experience (and overall artistic pieces) that made an impact on me. Moreover, for a great number of years I even didn't perceive it as a cimema (for example, forgetting to mention it as one of my favorite movies) but it felt almost surreal for me. At the moment, it is the nostalgia that hits the hardest with this last watch. I've recalled my childhood memories, emotions, imagination that I had after swallowing the fairytale content from this movie and everything that this masterpiece was delivering to me throughout all these years.Bravo movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
EXCELLENT. JUST EXCELLENT,"This is my first time, watching a lord of the rings movie and oh my god what a breath of fresh air this movie got me hooked from beginning to end. I really like a lot of stuff so let's get into it. First I really like how the characters were not a mess or all just feel like they are trying to take the spotlight from one another they all have there own motivation that try to prove themselves and also tried the prove that they are worthy of a good fight, in this movie, Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, are honorable mentions for the best character in his movie but by far the best character in the movie in my opinion is Gandolf he does show that he can give us some tension on what's to come, when I first watched the movie I thought the beginning was going to be boring. Give us some useless information and just drag it out but no it gives us important information on whats to come and what's the come throughout the whole trilogy I can't wait to see what going to happen in these movies because I am into this adventure. I really like this first movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This movie is the best,"This is one of the few movies I've seen that does justice to the book it represents. True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours. This movie is incredible. There simply is nothing to complain about. The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime. The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable. This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least). I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters. This movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scenes are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the innocent hobbit on a journey. There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazing!!,"This is truly the greatest movie of all time! No other movie will win me over like this one has. The acting, sound effects, special effects, make-up, etc. were all wonderful. They did really good by not putting some REALLY famous actors/actresses in there to make people go see it, it was good enough on its own. The actors they did choose were excellent! My favorites were Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom. I am thrilled that it is nominated for 13 awards and wish it were nominated for more! I saw couldn't get enough of this movie, I ended up seeing it five times, that is before it was taken of the theater. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, it truly is the best, most brilliant movie ever. Those who haven't seen it really should, you won't regret it. I can't wait to see the next two movie sequels, they will only make the whole movie better. As for those who totally don't the movie, I can only say one thing. I read in a newspaper article that tests show that those who disliked the movie had a lower I.Q. than those who liked it. What else is there to say?

One movie to rule them all...,"...that was maybe too much! But, I do got to say: one of the best movies ever made!Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo Baggins, the confused, scared but brave little fellow. Then we got this Strider guy, Aragorn. Viggo Mortensen plays him supreme and is probably the movies best character, and we've got Sean Bean as Boromir, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Liv Tylor as Arwen, Ian MacKellen as Gandalv and we can go on and on.The film music is one of the best I've ever heard! Especially after Gandalv has died - very mood."" Run you fools!

Why this film deserves to be No.1,"Now I've heard a lot of people saying that this film is nothing more that another ""fantasy"" and once the hype dies down it will only be remembered as a mediocre  ""fantasy"" film.  Well first I'd like to point out that ALL films by definition are FANTASY, unless its is a documentary.  Second, how could this film be called mediocre?  Unless you were under the impression that all films of the same genre were of LoTR quality or better (just watch Harry Potter to see how that is not true), or prehaps you some how managed to mistake Harry Potter for LoTR.Now why, you may ask do I believe that LoTR should be No.1.  Well, in how long has there been a film that can engross people from the ages 6-80+, male & female alike?  Not in a long time I would say.  As it has the special effects & action we now expect in ""blockbuster"" film, but also it has ""heart"".  When I say it heart I mean it has done more than just dazzle you into thinging you have seen a good film, by making the special effects the main star for the film.  In LoTR, while the special effects are amazing to say the least, they don't steal the show from the main characters of the story.  Now other films have this quality, The Godfather & Shawshank Redemption to name a few.  But until now no other film has come as close as LoTR to have a successful marriage of the two.  And there for can appeal to a wider segment of population without the feeling it is playing to the lowest common denominator.Well this is my reason for saying LoTR should be the number 1 film, and if not Fellowship alone then just wait for the complete LoRT trilogy :-) Also this film improves at least X10 on the second viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
classic fantasy move,"As a person who loves to watch the fantasy genre, Lord of the Rings is a classic movie that has all the right criteria for a great fantasy movie. With enjoying these types of movies I can tell you that Lord of the Rings movies set the bar high for all fantasy movies that came out after 2001 after bring Tolkien's books to life. Even though I have yet to read the books that the movies are based on, the director (Peter Jackson) did a great job telling this epic story while pulling you in the world of wizards and ring bearersThe special effects, props, wardrobe and the New Zealand scenery tied the movie perfectly together. Though this movie is 3 hours long, the times fly by fast as there is always something interesting to see on screen. The actors did great job pretraining their characters and telling the story. I one hundred percent recommend the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit movies as they are both a great way to escape into a land of magic. Thought note if you have read The Hobbit books the movies are slightly different but still holds the beauty and magic that all great fantasy stories have.Overall the Lord of The Rings is a brilliant movie that will never get old and is definitely a classic movie in the fantasy genre. These movies will always hold a special place with me and it's a movie series that I have to re watch every year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Overrated Film of the Century (already!),"First of all, most people who praise this film did NOT read the books. The books are amazing but cannot work as film. Maybe that is why no one has undertaken this epic until now. What I can't understand was how people can praise all the different aspects of it. The costuming and sets were the only thing decent. My complaints? Too many liberties were taken with the book. Now, I'm not referring to the plot elements (which were more or less intact except for Tom Bombadil. If you don't know who that is, read the book!) but the style that Tolkien worked so hard to preserve in all of his books. The first item that was ruined in the first 5 minutes was the mystery of Sauron. Sauron is such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him. Tolkien keeps this throughout all the books. Jackson ruined that in 5 minutes. Next, the action always follows the hobbits. This put you in the place of the hobbits. What characters would be better for an audience to identify with? They were as much outsiders to this strange world as we are. Unfortunately, Jackson ruined that also.The directing was nothing spectacular. It was unobtrusive, but there was no style really, so it did not add any more depth to the movie. The acting was pretty good, but it could not save the movie from the unforgivable sins that the movie committed to the book.The special effects, though praised, were not good at all. You'd think since they have to do 3 films with hobbits that they would come up with a good way to do them and stick to it. Not the case! The hobbits change size drastically throughout the film depending on the technique that is being used to reduce them. Sometimes they are children, but the worst is when they just put them further from the camera. How is that supposed to work? Although we do not have depth perception in the theater, the audience can still tell when the size difference is only created by the perspective. The CG effects were not outstanding, but after seeing Star Wars: Episode 1, it was nice to know costumes can still be used well.Now, if I had not read the book, would I have a better view of this film? You bet, but too many things from the book were ruined to make it more of a conventional movie. Even still, I definitely would not think it is worthy of being ranked so high on IMDB.com.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Close to perfect,"I am a fan of Tolkien and have been eagerly awaiting someone to make a serious attempt at LOTR. The horible animated thing from the seventies - was, well, horrible. This movie succeeds fantasticaly well. The look and feel are just right - the technical aspects of the production - costumes artwork and photography - all done in such a way as to immerse you in a vision that respects the feel and spirit of the books. The casting is generally excellent - Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo, Ian Mckellan an impressive and strong Gandalf. The screenplay keeps the essence of the story very well while shortening it to reasonable movie length (I am a fan - but I find the books have overly long bits that leave me wanting the story to progress a bit faster!) The other minor plot changes - such as having Arwen rescue Frodo are all enhancements that strengthen the story and help keep it ""tight"". The Mines of Moria were always a favourite scene from the book and when I saw it on the screen it was just as it had seemed in my head - something no other movie adaption of a book has ever achieved to to the same degree, for me. I am hard pressed to find anything but the most trivial criticism of what is a fantastic achievement.This movie is so close to perfect it would seem petty to point out its trivial faults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Brilliant and peerless,"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD (Extended Version) and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two distinct categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"".Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve.Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Magical,"I haven't read the books so I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie & having heard it was over three hours long I was a bit sceptical about watching it. But I have to say I was amazed - The acting by all concerned is good to excellent especially from Elliah Wood as Frodo & Ian Mckellen as gandalf, The action was well handled & very exciting, The special effects were great but thankfully they didn't distract from the plot (as in MEN IN BLACK 2) The beautiful New Zealand scenery was a joy to watch, and the 3 hours fly by as long as you are prepared to give it a go as it is quite slow to begin with, With the strong characterization of the first 40 minutes.

Great Fantasy Book Becomes One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made,"When Peter Jackson took on this amazing trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien he was taking one of the biggest dares in cinematic history. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has gathered countless fans over the world. The books are captivating masterpieces that delve deep into our imaginations. To think that it would be transferred to the big screen. But Peter Jackson had that certain touch, he turned a great book into a film that will be treasured as one of the greatest films to ever have been made.For those who haven't read the books (I urge you to) the plot focuses on a ring. A ring made for evil. This ring can turn the bearer invisible at will. By luck, this ring lands into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from The Shire. He passes it down to his nephew Frodo Baggins. When Gandalf finds out about this he immediately sends Frodo on a quest to destroy The One Ring. Because if it falls into the wrong hands it could mean an end the Middle Earth. Along with Samwise Gamgee they set off on an epic adventure.This movie is one-of-a-kind. An adaption has never been this good. Everything about this movie is captivating and just so brilliant. I have read the Fellowship just once but I was just so pleased with this movie. The way Peter Jackson has gone from paper-to-film is very inspiring. The look of Middle Earth is extremely beautiful. The beautiful Hobbiton and dread-filled Mordor are just perfect.The roles are perfectly suited. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise was a perfect choice and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was an extremely smart choice. This movie is just perfect and if you haven't seen it I urge now.

Director Peter Jackson and his superb, highly motivated cast and crew have done the seemingly impossible in turning Tolkien's beloved books into a movie, and they have done it so amazingly well - finding their own idiosyncratic interpretations while staying absolutely true to the spirit of the book - that all I can say is: Go and see it!! - if you haven't done so yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Peter Jackson mixes it up a treat; one minute filming with epic long shots of middle earth vistas crammed with detail, the next shooting extreme, fish-eye close ups and whipping the camera all over the place. i.e. as stately as a David Lean epic, whilst being kinetic enough to keep a modern audience satisfied... whateverI havent read the books, yet my palms were sweating throughout because I was so caught up in the film (Its surprisingly scary in parts), it felt like I hadn't blinked once!

"Lord of the Rings, the Second Best Movie of all time Um. No.","I have heard so many things about this movie it is unbelievable.  I have seen this movie twice, read the books, and I can say for sure that it is not the 2nd best movie of all time.  It is also ridiculous that this movie won the AFI best picture of the year against ten other briliant spectacular movies.The first time I saw the movie everyone in my group was half and half on the opinion of weather they liked the movie.  Some people thought it was dreadfull and were upset with me for making them see a 3 hour movie that they thought was ""stupid.""  Others thought the movie was wonderfull but no one thought it was the best movie of the year.  I thought the movie was average but when other people wanted to see it I thought I would give it a second chance.The second time I saw it was a different experience.  I liked the first half of the movie better but I thought the battle scenes towards the end were ridiculous.  The acting was average but some of those ""1-liners"" were stabbing me in the heart.  For instance, ""Let's hunt some Ork"" was my vote for the most ridiculous line in the movie.I thought the special effects in the movie were amazing but the music and the acting were average.  My favorite character was probably Frodo Bagins or Gandalf.  I thought the movie relied on too much action which the book did not.  Some people I heard said they were bored by the dialogue.  That was my favorite part (besides the ring wraiths) in the whole film.In short I do suggest you see this movie.

The 4K UHD Version is Definitely Worth It,"After viewing in the theaters (early 2000s) and the extended DVD versions (late 2000s), I recently purchased the remastered 4K UHD blu rays with Dolby Atmos, and watched the entire series with my kiddos (7 and 9). It was a fabulous experience, with top-notch picture and sound enhancing the canonical greatness of the story (and the film) itself. It took us about five weeks (December through early January) to watch all three films; in fact, if the extended version is included (and all the extra/extended scenes are high quality, they just needed to limit the length of the theatrical version), the trilogy is basically like a multi-season show of the Netflix (or better, Amazon Prime!) era, which can be enjoyed in 20-30 minute viewings.Sienna's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gandalf, Legolas, and Aragorn; scariest characters: witch king, Mouth of Sauron

The best film of 2001,"Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin.I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized.

An instant classic.,"Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One ring - and three great movies - to rule them all.,"A pop culture phenomenon, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is unlike anything that you've ever seen.

The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I've never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses.

Most precioussss,"This movie getting made is comparable to Bilbo finding the ring. The unlikeliest of events and the world is better for it.This a book adaptation done so well that it cannot be matched or beat. Ever. If one day I should be proven wrong then I will be more than happy.The Fellowship of the Ring has everything. Tolkien built a complete world and this movie does an incredible job bringing it to life. Going on the journey with Frodo is filled with excitement, danger, friendship, betrayal, mistakes, loyalty, sacrifice all brought to life with an unforeseen amount of attention to the smallest detail, making the world feel so real that you can truly immerse yourself in the adventure.When the movie came out fantasy was not mainstream. The fact this movie got the budget it did is a miracle. (at the time Peter Jackson was known for Bad Taste) It also didn't seek to change things to fit ""modern audiences"" or anything else. The changes made to the source material serve the format of a movie. However the spirit of the books is captured flawlessly.Since then the world has changed. Studies only produce stuff with a ""proof of concept"" meaning it already has been done before. Risk taking is no longer part of the industry that wants you to simply buy the same plastic superhero fireworks time and again so they don't need to make anything new & creative. Sad as that is, this movie has power to make you feel better. It suits all moods, helps you forget - and remember what is important in life.When you watch this movie make sure you get your hands on the extended version since it is even better and allows you to travel to Middle-earth for even longer. It's worth it, guaranteed.I would claim this movie is as influential to mainstream cinema as the books were to literature. The acting is flawless (Ian McKellen & Viggo Mortensen deliver performances for the ages), the soundtrack is other-wordly and magical and the story is unlike any other. If you like good cinema, you will love this.On top, the movie came out in 2001 and it still looks better than movies coming out decades later. I believe it's due to the passion and love that guided the making of this film. You can feel it through the screen. The movie has its own energy. And its own will. Can you feel it? It's calling for you.It wants you to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Three hours wasn't enough.,"I'm a naturally contrary creature, so I didn't want to go see LOTR simply because everybody else seemed to be seeing it. My daughter persuaded me, telling me she'd buy my ticket and promising me ""lots of eye candy.""Well, blessings on my daughter's head. LOTR was a breathtaking delight (and not just when Aragorn threw his hood back and my hormones gave me a jolt that drew an ""Oh, my!"" from my lips). When the end credits started to roll, I whimpered, ""What? No more?""I'm just hoping they'll do a theatrical re-release before TTT opens in December. There are friends who missed this in the theater and I'd love to share it with them in all its majestic scope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow,"I'm not sure that there are words to describe what I thought of this film, but I'll have a go.  Everything about it was amazing - the landscapes, the script, the effects (and they don't normally concern me too much), the music (can you wear out a CD?!).  But what really got to me was the emotion emanating from this film - whereas most films get into your head, this one got into my heart (corny, I know, but true).  The reason for this?  The acting.  A film may have all of the above listed things, but if the actors aren't right then you'll never accept the film.  Every single character was perfectly portrayed, including Arwen and Galadriel (who a lot of people didn't seem to like).  In fact, I think extending Arwen's role was a change for the better - at least in FOTR (I'm reserving judgement on her role in the next two installments).  I must make special mention of four actors though.  Firstly, Elijah Wood.  A perfect combination of vulnerability and determination, and those eyes - I could just drown in them!  Secondly, Sean Bean.  Boromir was always one of my favourite characters, but I truly sympathised with the character in the film.  Thirdly, Ian McKellan - he is Gandalf, what more can I say?  And finally, Viggo Mortensen.  His performance just blew me away.  Apart from being gorgeous (!) I loved the way he portrayed Aragorn's fear that he wouldn't be good enough to be King. And boy, can he swing a sword!In summary, go and see this film.  I've seen it five times, and I'm not stopping there.  Simply the best film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Finally watched it all the way through.,"After only ever getting through half of it previously, I finally watched the full movie through. It was a great glimpse into a deep world of fairy tale lore. I appreciate that typically it isn't just magic saving the day, and the characters all have strong archetypes that shine in interesting ways at times. Though we don't learn terribly much about most of them, outside of their archetypes. Having seen and enjoyed The Hobbit in theaters, many years ago and without seeing these, it was really exciting to see the connection between Bilbo and Frodo. The cinematography is epic as well, and instills feeling of a deeper world and story at play here. It really does feel like they're so close, though I know there are many many more hours of film left. I am excited for the next in the series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Meh.,"Granted, I did end up behind a big, tall blue-haired guy when I saw this in the theater, so all the subtitles were hidden behind his big, tall blue-haired guy-shoulders, but I did catch 99% of this movie and I feel I'm qualified to review it.  It has great acting but the story is sort of incomplete and hard to follow in spots, and not in the ""ooh I can't wait for the next one."" sorta way.   It seems to depend TOO much on its sequel, at the expense of allowing ANY kind of closure.  There is a very sharp cut in this film which divides the first part (All About running from Ringwraiths.) From the second part. (All About running from Orcs.)  It occurs on the riverbank before the Elf forest, and is followed by a dream sequence and a lot of choppity chop editing  that confuses the reality considerably.  It turns out that the dream sequence isn't a dream at all, though it had me and half my party fooled.   That sequence is totally awful and stands out as utter confusion amid a story that is pretty smooth otherwise, though there are a few parts that just leave you up the creek.   It doesn't help at all that the characters themselves are incapable of reflecting on what happens to them.. Not once  does Frodo look around and muse, ""What do you suppose happened to all those Ringwraiths we were running from earlier?  Strider said they could never die, and would never stop chasing me, but they just seem to have disappeared.  I'm not even worried about them anymore..  Why is that?"" ) There is altogether too much ""acceptance"" of what is happening, and not enough questioning or curiosity on the part of our heroes, curiosity which would really help the viewers understand things better.  The characters are given almost no depth at all, and people respond to this with, ""Well, it's not the whole story.  They're going to explain everything in the other movies later.""  So this completely liberates this film from the burden of traditional necessities like character development and plot explanation?  Okay fine, but that made it all the more difficult to really get involved and be interested in The Fellowship of the Ring..  Yes, beautiful effects, great costumes and makeup and  atmosphere, but not quite enough substance.   All the acting is superb, especially Elijah Wood's performance, and there is even some sex appeal (Nevermind Strider..Legolas is where it's at.) And that grand sense of ""Epic"" you would expect... but this one just didn't do it for me.   Not worthy of its publicity and popularity, Fellowship is being carried by the literature and lacks its own identity.  All in all, it's just a mediocre movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"unvisionary, mainly boring and uncareful made","the problem of the movie is mainly that it is made to be liked by as many people as possible, and that´s never a good start for anything. i don´t like jacksons personal visions of the book. he degraded the horrifying black riders to nothing more than weak actionfigures. saruman is too early and often shown, so he can´t be as fear-creating as he is in the book. his (jacksons) direction is more or less unsatisfying, and the acting is -with the exception of hugo weaving (elrond)- bad. jackson would have done good respecting that ""the lord of the rings"" is no romance but some sort of great ""fantasy road movie"". missing bombadil and good-fitting music (from rosenman) i will by any time prefer the bakshi animated-feature from 1978 (although it´s incomplete, and bombadil is missing too.. someone finish this movie, pleeeeease).. i´m personally disappointed that a great man like howard shore (crash, silence of the lambs, dead ringers, existenz, the fly, ed wood) could do such a boring score.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Peter Jackson for best director!,"I know it's my second time writing a review on Lord of the Rings, but this isn't it particularly about Lord of the Rings. As some of you have read my last review (it was only posted yesterday, so the chances you did read it) you could tell just by my one line summary that I loved the movie. This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind.  One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy. I know there's nothing any of you people can do about it, but I just felt that Peter Jackson is the one who I think truly deserves Best Director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

crap.. what absolute crap,"Peter Jackson couldn't pace a story to save his life. Everything which makes the book a timeless treasure is completely thrown over in favor moronic ""improvements"" aimed at a perceived demographic. The only saving grace of the film is the art direction, but even that leans far too much toward the most recent calendar-illustrators of Tolkien's work (Alan Lee, John Howe, etc.), and lends a slick, sci-fi look that the author would no doubt have found distasteful. The subtlety of the story, with just the right bits of information revealed at just the right times, is rejected in favor of a blunt-force approach which gives away everything at the outset in order to showcase some more lousy cgi at the earliest possible moment. The Ralph Bakshi cartoon, while also far from successful as an adaptation, is far superior by comparison. The other two films Jackson's travesty only get worse.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
well crafted but...,"Lord of the rings is not a bad movie but it is far from being a masterpiece as many describe it. Director Peter Jackson, who before LOTR has done mostly low budget movies, showed great skill in terms of cutting costs, dealing with complex sets and managing great number of people but his film simply lacks true epic momentum. The reason for that is simply the fact that main characters are hobbits, ells and other imagionary creatures that only fans of LOTR books can symphatize with. Also, other big minus of the film, or all three films,is Peter Jacksons preoccupation with special effects and scenery which made him forget that all of those imaginary creatures represent different types of people and their relationship towards nature. The actors did their job well, scenery is excellent and if Peter Jackson paid attention to the true meaning of the book and didn't bore us with his slow motion heart touching scenes of battle it would have been a true masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"The Word 'Epic' Gets Tossed Around a Lot Today, But Here It's Appropriate","Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Who could imagine..,"Okay, the moment has come. I've re-read the whole LOTR trilogy once again as a preparation for the movie, memorized all the characters and watched the Peter Jackson interview again just to remind myself that no matter how good the director is, the movie version can never reflect the depth, complexity and magic of the original book.Still, expectations were extremely high as I stepped into Monte Casinos' Premier theatre for the special premier (simultaneously  presented with the Premier taking place in London). Even before that, every time I went to the movies and the FOTR preview came on my skin began to crawl, the ""One Ring"" speech given there just made me want to jump out of chair and scream ""SHOW IT TO ME NOW!"". Now that the screening is over I can tell you one thing. While it is not an exact representation of the book (and nobody can really expect it to be, because even when they try, the result will be something as unimaginative as the Harry Potter movie..), but it does create the incredible magic and atmosphere of it. The characters are amazingly built, the plot is presented with flawless clarity and the story is done in such a way that you simply cannot imagine how it could have been done any better.Visual effects, dialogues, acting and music are all combined to create a true master-piece. Not only was I not disappointed, I cannot wait until I go to watch it again (or for X-Mas 2002, for the The Two Towers premier..).

An electrifying eye candy feast.,"A wonder to behold and not to be taken for granted, the first chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers.The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as ""the Fellowship"".Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the ""Fellowship"". There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here.Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past.One last thing, since I haven't seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved ""Best Picture"" and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Set pieces...battles...set pieces...battles...,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS has its admirers who are familiar with the plot and the strange characters inhabiting it--and who genuinely love the book and were eager to see their favorite story on the big screen.In this case, it helps if you are familiar with the plot and the characters because the screenplay is a murky one with none of the characters given enough time for us to understand what they are all about. Instead, we move from set piece to set piece (grand, beautiful sets abetted by dazzling visual effects) and in between each new grand view locale there's another battle of good vs. evil with weapons clashing in every direction and limbs lopped off as fierce battles ensue.It's a sort of dungeons and dragons world and if this is your thing then this is your dark movie adventure. I saw this on video rather than the big screen so I can assure you it probably all looks a lot grander on the theater screen with the deafening stereo sound effects adding to the vigor of the story. But none of the characters really stand out amid all this swordplay and skullduggery.Only Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood have substantial enough parts to connect a viewer to the movie. The others are all backgrounders without becoming characters we care about--with the exception, perhaps, of Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, who always makes a convincing villain. Another problem is the sound--voices are dropped so often that much of the stilted dialogue is muted. This is a special drawback because several of the actors have some sort of accent. The worst offender happens to be Ian McKellen who nevertheless gives a very compelling performance behind his grizzly make-up--however, someone should have dubbed some of his lines for greater clarity. The likeable Elijah Wood relies on his specialty--wide-eyed wonder or tense concern for close-ups, but it's rather a one-note performance.All in all, I was disappointed. With all of the hype (and due to some of the comments expressed here) I expected a much more substantial story than this, especially for a movie with a running time of almost three hours. The drawback on video is that many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the big screen grandeur is lost even when viewed on a large TV screen.A bit of a letdown in every department.

A Fellowship of nine must destroy it !. A New Power Is Rising !. The Battle for Middle-earth Begins! All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil !.This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama , plot twists , gorgeous exteriors from New Zealand and being pretty entertaining , in spite of about three hours runtime , while still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamilar with the lengthy literary work . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale to be continued by two top-notch sequels . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational and colorful cinematography by cameraman Andrew Lesnie and long-standing as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values and lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein .

There's beautifully crafted sets, a unique and recognizable soundtrack and realistic proportions and costumes for each character.My favourite aspect of film is production design, so I might be biased...but I think the sets are what make this movie so magical. The fantasy prevalent in the sets is what allows ""The Lord of the Rings"" to be so easy to follow and enjoy.

The music was well suited to each scene, and helped capture the emotions the characters experienced. The music included a lot of unique instruments, and had a great otherworldly sound.An aspect of this film I found very impressive was the costume and character design.

An awesome film - and a superb adaptation of the book.,"Peter Jackson's mammoth task of recreating JRR Tolkein's classic epic ""Lord of the Rings"" has been done masterfully. I have read the books over 50 times, and I have always found in the past that movies rarely satisfy my imagination when based on books that I have read.This is different. The characters, locations, scenery and music is all portrayed just as I had pictured them in my mind (with the exception of Boromir - I always thought of him as more Viking-like). On top of this the special effects are spectacular, but they serve only to enhance, rather than overpower, the story. There were sections of the story that were glossed over or removed, but thankfully little was changed. By my recollection, there were only two scenes that were dramatically different to the book - Frodo escaping the Ring Wraiths over the river, and Frodo farewelling Aragon. However, the reason behind these changes was clear, and really I can't see any other way to keep the movie as short as possible.Although LOTR is a long movie (almost 3 hours), it is never boring and keeps the viewer enthralled. As well, the narrative at the beginning of the movie does an excellent job of bringing any non-readers of the book up to speed.In case you hadn't guessed - I loved the movie, and I can't wait until the next 2 are released. One word of warning - this is no kid's movie - it is not Harry Potter or Star Wars, and parents that expect their pre-teens to be able to watch this without nightmares should expect to be proven wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A True Masterpiece,"This film is a true masterpiece. Elegant & enthralling, this film lulls you into the world of Tolkien from second one.The casting is inspired as is the music score.

Old fashioned fantasy,"One of my all time favorite movies as a kid and it still holds up today.I watched a special edition with all the extra scenes and it makes it a whole experience that doesn't feel like any of the characters is left out to dry you get all the good character interaction and boromir a gets the scene. He needs to be a likable sad Guy.The visuals are still amazing, It looks so good. There are some scenes where they use 3D puppets and character for a meme guy in the minds that I ice couldn't not look at but all the other things look amazing and the painting they used in the background and special effects and many sneaky ways they used the camera as to make the hobbits look smaller than they are. Actors amazing job they made this story with is a bit hokey and cringe sometimes but they sell it it never feels cringe it feels so honest and believable despite. How old fashioned fantasy it is.I have watched this movie a lot of times and I still tear up at some points, I still get emotional and if I still do that that means that the movie still has a lot of value and sentimental abilities and honest and wholesome and friendly bromance between every character is what I need.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
MAGICAL and FABULOUS. A great film!!,"I just want to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this great film. It is clearly the best movie of the year, and if ""A Beautiful Mind"" wins the Oscar it will be due to internal Hollywood politics - how Miramax's ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat out the superior ""Saving Private Ryan"".In all aspects of movie-making, ""Lord of the Rings"" stands out: direction, special effects, sets, acting, and even the script. Parts of the Tolkien classic have been very nicely compressed, or expanded - such as the fight with the cave troll (barely in the book). As for FX, it doesn't get better than the jaw-dropping fight against ther Balrog on the bridge at Khazad-Dum.There was no performance that was not at least good, and the dialogue between Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee I thought especially effective. Cate Blanchett was luminous as Galadriel.The musical score deserves special note. It added extremely well to the drama and mood of the film, along with taking us into a magical realm.The entire film was magical.

Dull.,"This was the first Lord of the Rings movie I saw. It's awful. It's dull, tedious and boring. Worse than Star Wars movies, really, and they're pretty bad. I tried to get interested in it but it was just one gimmick after another to delay the story line: another monster, demon, dwarf, elf, wizard, etc., etc. I guess the final analyis there isn't much of a story line at all. It's sort of like ""The Wizard of Oz"" on steroids but with none of the charm, and it's way too long. The scenery is nice and the special effects are good, but that's all. In the end I didn't care about the characters or how the movie ended. And then, to top it all off, the movie didn't even have an ending. It just stopped with the characters still short of their mission. What a waste of movie-making!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A well done recreation doesn't mean it's a great movie,"The Lord of the Rings is a good movie, especially for this year, but it is in no way above classics such as Citizen Kane or Shawshank Redemption or even Momento. Just because Jackson did a good job at capturing the book's character's appearance and personalities, doesn't qualify it to be the second best movie of all time. It has no message, it's just a very well told fantasy story. So stop giving it praise it doesn't deserve. It's an 8 not a 9 or a 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"In a word, this movie SUCKED!","I can't believe that so many of you people loved this movie!  First of all, I completely agree with others who have complained about its lack of character development.  What happened there in that Elf village where the Fellowship suddenly formed?  ""Okay, Frodo, you carry the ring, and we'll have an elf, a dwarf, 2 humans, an old wizard, and three other useless hobbits tag along with you.""  To the people who read the book (I did not), you need to remember that for a movie based on a book to be ""GREAT,"" it should be self- sufficient.  I should not have need a Lord of the Rings fanatic sitting next to me explaining every scene and telling me things like, ""Oh yeah, those guys are called Ringwraiths... no, the bad guy is Sauron and the wizard who became bad is called Saruman, can't you keep these names straight? ... No, Tolkien couldn't use names like Fred and John because he needed unique and magical Middle Earth names!  (except of course for the arbitrary naming of Sam the hobbit)....""  What is all of this hogwash?  Are you people all on drugs?  Can't you see what kind of nonsense this movie is?  Don't you realize that by reading the book, you got all of the character development and background story that the rest of us just did not get?  Clearly, you all used your previous knowledge to fill in the gaps that the rest of us just had to endure. I'm just stunned at how many weirdo Dungeon and Dragon freaks there are out there who ranked this movie so highly.Bottom line:  This movie was terrible in every sense of the word. Long, boring, filled with useless scenery shots (which were really just CGI enhanced shots anyway) and shots of Elijah Wood's blank expression as he stared at the ring in his hand, devoid of any character development (I couldn't even remember main character's names, let alone motivations or backgrounds), and filled with cheesey action sequences that made ""The Mummy Returns"" look like a masterpiece.  You need to be a huge Tolkien/Fantasy fanatic to appreciate this movie.  Otherwise, go see ""Ocean's Eleven"", which is much better and more entertaining in every respect.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring - Saturday Night Review,"Simply Stunning. Mind blowing. Breath-taking. The movie is all of that and more.And since it is the first movie of one of the finest trilogies, a tiny outline to the story would be aptly fitting. The story goes around a young Hobbit named Frodo, from the Shire, who embarks on an epic journey having been entrusted with a powerful and ancient ring that he must destroy by taking it deep into the cracks of Mount Doom, in Mordor, the enemy's lair itself. It is not a versatile story, but a quest. An Almighty quest that is filled with determination, friendship, brotherhood, hope, and trust.Giving his utmost respect to the late Mr. Tolkein, Peter Jackson has undertaken and completed a wonder of a movie that never fails to leave you with your mouth gape open, the marvel of the land that is Middle-earth, with the wide variety of characters ranging from the little Hobbitses to the giant Wizard Gandalf. It is a quest beyond anyone's imagination and capability and the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkein is executed to perfection on to the big screen.The Shire has been depicted beautifully, with its people (the Hobbits). Every step of the journey has breathtaking scenic shots and sequences that leaves the audience craving for more. The magnificence of Lothlurien should not be missed, too.Coming to the cast, the roles played by almost everyone is near-perfect. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Sam) represent the perfect hobbits with supporting roles of the Fellowship representing Legolas, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Boromir, Merry and Pippin have been wonderful. The dialogues are a no-miss, some of them are truly excellent and add to the effect to the movie. Gandalf's ""You shall not Pass"" statement to the Balrog is of such power and magnitude, it will send a chill down your spine. The screenplay, the display, the music is all magnificent and adds to the beauty of the Lord of the Rings.All in all, The Fellowship of The Ring is a masterpiece. Those unfamiliar with the Middle-Earth and its characters will find it a ""little"" difficult to cope up with, but no worries. The mere beauty of this film will leave them happy come end. This is a terrific movie, and it will be one of the best movies I have ever seen, along with the other 2 movies of the LOTR franchise. A full 10 / 10. Do not miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Greatest Movies Ever,"I saw these films when I was 7, 8, & 9 respectively. An impressionable age to be sure, but my life was nevertheless changed forever.It holds true that my favorite films are often the ones that effectively put the viewer inside the world that the filmmakers have built, and from the ground up these films exceed this. The landscape, the sets, the costumes... every bit of praise these films have received is deserved. The CGI is to date some of the best I've ever seen and is--thank god--free of the oversaturation guilty of the trilogy's prequels. And if that wasn't enough, Howard Shore completes the journey with one of the most perfect scores in all of cinema.I could talk for days about this trilogy, but in the end it would only amount to the pointless musings of a fanboy.

All of these movies have been good, but the books were amazing and the movies did not live up to the standards set by the authors. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, does live up to the story. It did leave some character. and scenes out, but they did bring the stunning books visuals to life with a very well made movie. From the legendary actors like Ian McKellen to younger up and comers like Elijah Wood, the acting is stupendous and the set design is eye popping.

Rock solid,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is epic filmmaking at its finest. As part of terrific trilogy, it's great. It's also great as a stand alone film. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson and company hit the ball out of the park with this movie. The movie looks great. It's stunningly beautiful at times. The script takes a dense book and makes it understandable. The cast is also terrific with standout work by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a long movie that at times feels like it. But when it's ends, it feels like it just started. I remember when I saw this movie in the theater there was a father with his his teen son sitting in front of us. When the movie ended he turned to his son and asked in frustration ""That how it ends?"" (Obviously he didn't understand it was the first installment of three.)

Simply breathtaking...,"From the first moment the movie starts you are immediately captivated by the story that evolves. The cinematography is just amazing, Peter Jackson did an incredible job conveying to us the times of the Hobbits. I believe the cast had excellent chemistry and it's refreshing to see a group of actors who seem to really break into their roles. I'm so happy that Elijah Wood played Frodo, he's a great actor and doesn't get as nearly enough recognition as he deserves. It's also a good breakthrough for Viggo Mortenson who has minor roles in ""28 Days"" and ""A Perfect Murder"", Liv Tyler is sweet as Arwen and I look forward to her character expanding in the next two installments. Ian McKellen is just a great actor to watch and really brought Gandalf to life, Sean Bean again is another actor who doesn't get nearly as enough credit as he deserves. Orlando Bloom is a cutie as Legolas, the hobbits are just funny to watch especially Sean Astin's Sam. Cate Blanchett was rather freaky as Galadriel, but I think the way her character signed off to Frodo is just the beginning of our understanding of her.All in all this is just an amazing movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The First Instant Classic Movie of the 21st Century...,"In 2008, the American Film Institute came up with the list of the 10 Greatest American Fantasy Movies of All Time. There was no way ""The Wizard of Oz"" wouldn't top this list but guess which newcomer took the second spot that would have belonged to ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Indeed, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is not only the most recent inclusion in any American Film's Institute's List (it is also in the Top 100 Greatest Movies) but it's the highest ranked. It says a lot when a less-than-a-decade old film is literally sandwiched by two classics that are half-centuries older.And 2001 was quite a year for Fantasy; the four highest-grossing movies of the year were the first ""Harry Potter"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Monsters & Inc."" and ""Shrek"". And despite that huge competition, it's the cinematic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien that became an instant classic in the same vein than ""Star Wars"" in 1977. I know ""Harry Potter"" deserves a honorable mention but I don't think the series created something as endearing as ""The Lord of the Rings"" did, a myth, a saga made of characters that are now parts of pop-culture. And if George Lucas has an edge over Jackson because he created his own mythology, Jackson still took up the most difficult challenge ever: recreating J.R.R Tolkien's universe on the screen.The book, the movie, the involvement that made the transition from one format to another possible are all explained in DVD special features, as long as the movie itself, and I watched them with excitement, because nothing is worthier of admiration than an impossible mission being accomplished, starting with the book. Tolkien was a man of classical education, the same generation than Asimov and Pagnol, brilliant literate minds who studied languages, sciences and translated their academic background into art. Tolkien's specialty was language and when he created his world, he didn't just throw names or drew forms; he invented languages, civilizations, that the appeal of Tolkien, his stories felt real, like belonging to humanity's canon.Sure they venture into fairy-tale territories but his creatures are people with specific cultures and lifestyles and even individually, they are not all the same. You have the Elves who are wise, beautiful and immortal, men who are brave but easily corrupted, dwarfs who are practical and rough mine-workers and of course, the friendly Hobbits and their bucolic happiness. The story centers on the most universal myth of all-time, good vs. evil, with one a small object that can destroy the world and yet seems indestructible. Tolkien meant it as an allegory for machinery and its poisoning effect on the world, but the story is told in the classical epic way, featuring the quest of nine heroes, and the journey of a young Hobbit named Frodo.Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, is the film's ""Luke Skywalker"" there's something undoubtedly Obi- Wanesque about the Old Wizard Gandalf, played by Ian McKellen who reveals to Frodo the ring's dark secret, and like Alec Guinness, he was Oscar nominated for his performance, a rarity in Fantasy films. And the performances are integral to the film's success, more than the special effects, more than the production design, the armors and weapons, the Orcs' make-up, the battles' choreographs, if that was enough to make a box-office hit, it takes more to get your three films in IMDb's Top 50, just look at the ""Star Wars"" prequels.Speaking of the performances, Ian McKellen displays a wide range of emotion going from the friendly elderly man, to the warm and reassuring friend with Bilbo Haggings (Ian Holm) but he shows who's the boss when needed to. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great chemistry and you cannot doubt over their friendship and the two other hobbits actors know how to play comic reliefs without going over-the-top. The rest of the cast, from Cate Blanchett to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn all in their characters, with as much sincerity and intensity as if they were trying to grab an Oscar and that proves one thing, they respect the work of Tolkien.The DVD features show them all being interviewed about their experience and you can see in Mortensen, McKellen and the late Christopher Lee (who plays evil Saruman) that they have a sort of fascination and respect for the Master. And rightfully so, it took Tolkien fourteen years to finish the book, and four times more to make a film out of it. Jackson understood why it took so long when he started making the film. He shot it in New Zealand, the perfect place to recreate Middle-Earth, savage enough to look like it belongs to ancient times, then he recreated Hobbitebourg, and the film took form, step by step. And he shot the three films at once, to maintain the feeling of continuity.Jackson's determination, hard-work is as colossal as Tolkien's creation, what he did was objectively impossible, but he embraced the courage of his hobbits, the wisdom of Gandalf, the strength of Aragorn and went on his own journey, making an epic fantasy, a historical war film, and a coming-of-age story, and if Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is promised to centuries of fame, the film adaptation will certainly be responsible for it, because that's what makes a myth last, they're translated into different formats, they adapt to their world. And Tolkien's book was begging for a great cinematic adaptation.And Jackson did it. I know there are purists who think the adaptation doesn't do justice to the richness of the book, but the film is still new, give it time. Think of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it was a book, but who can imagine it now without the version of Fleming in mind. Well, in a few decades, ""The Lord of the Rings"" will be as iconic as irreplaceable, maybe it already is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A true achievement in film.,"Peter Jackson adores DVD. He knew going in to his daring translation of Tolkien's fantasy that it wouldn't stop at the cinema. The idea of a finished film can be fluid: scenes excised for valid reasons can be reinstated for home consumption. So, for DVD, not a 'director's cut' replacing the theatrical version, but an alternative extended edit. Put back into the film seamlessly, the extra half-hour of footage doesn't denigrate the original cut, but enhances it like an encore. The tone and story don't change; the journey is deepened, even if the momentum slows. Book-devotees especially will delight in the re-inclusion of Bilbo's voiceover on bucolic Hobbit culture, the extension of Aragorn's backstory, and the small additions on the other members of the Fellowship. If any section feels improved, it is Lothlorien with Cate Blanchett's Galadriel: here we get the famous gift-giving sequence which will prove significant, in the films to come, while the thematic weight of the Elvish decline grows more prominent. Nothing is lost and plenty is gained - this Special Extended Edition DVD is precious indeed. ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination. Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Sock Blowingly Superb!,"Superlatives are perhaps used too casually these days, but not in the case of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.I've been trying to work out why this film had such an effect on me, that I've been back to see it again and again.The special effects are superb, The cinematography is breathtaking. The music is awesome. And the tale that is told is wonderful. But there's something more than that.This film has moral themes which strike deeply. Evil is a tangible force that appears to be unstoppable. But, though it appears to be victorious at every turn, in fact this is NOT so. Hope is found in the unlikeliest of places, and you get a feeling that, although the evil is terrifyingly powerful, there is something greater at work. I can see why Christians love this film.The characters in the film are not cardboard cut outs. They seem real , and you find yourself caring for their welfare which is a very rare thing in movies. They are not invincible heroes, far from it. They suffer from self doubt and other infallibilites. They are afraid, even desperate, but you respect them because they have a cause worth fighting for, hopeless though the fight seems.The movie's ending is tragic and sad, but you leave the cinema strangely uplifted. It's not over yet, not by a long way, and you so want the free peoples to win through that you want to see the next two instalments straight away, even if it means sitting another six hours in the theatre.Oh, and I have to mention the trailer for the Two Towers. It raised the hairs on the back of my neck, and, after it ended, my heart was pounding. This is a story and a half, make no mistake.So choose your own superlative for this movie.

Over-rated boring movie!,"This film is sooooo over-rated. I'd never read the books so went into this with an open mind but was massively disappointed. It is without doubt one of the most boring films I have ever seen.At first I quite liked it even though the f/x were truly terrible and the acting a little wooden. But after the first half hour it turns into mindless drivel. The plot is very dull. A group of creatures have to take a ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they have to fight various monsters. And that goes on for 3 hours!! It was so mononetus that I almost fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during any film but this one really had me dozing off.It has a total lack of humor and emotion and the CGI effects are so fake looking that it ruins any sense of drama. Really, how scary is an army of blurry CGI monsters running at you?The action set pieces have no tension and you are left with a feeling of ""Okay, hurry up and beat this monster so we can get to the next one!"" That's what it's like. It has NO sense of excitment, danger or suspense and that has to be down to the terrible direction of Peter Jackson.The only joy I had watching this was laughing at some of the performances. Does Elijah Wood realise that he has ONE expression in the whole film? Does Cate Blanchette realise how rediculous her lines are? Do Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen realise that they look like rejects from an 80's heavy metal act? And what's with Ian McKellan?

A thrilling Introduction to kick off mybfavourite movie trilogy,"""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" is directed by Peter Jackson.It stars Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee.The first part in this great trilogy follows a hobbit named ""Frodo"" and companions who are tasked with destroying the one ring which could bring chaos and destruction to ""Middle Earth"".""The Lord of the rings"" trilogy is for me the greatest trilogy ever made. I could watch these films any day.The positivesThe films premise and story is fantastic. The film is near enough three hours of setup but it also does a great job in captivating you to watch the next films. Every character has distinct personalities along with great motivations and starter development. The romances and friendships all feel real thanks to all the actors having great chemistry along with great performances. ""Ian McKellen"" is for me perfect casting. No one else can play ""Gandalf"" In my eyes. The action in this film is fantastic. Not only are the stakes high in them but they are shot brilliantly. The whole film is shot fantastically. There's so many unique shots in the film that are memorable. The character design and makeup are all flawless. The ""Orc"" makeup is so good that I sometimes forget the people playing them are actors as they look so real. The CGI is fantastic even to today's standards. Finally the film also manages to be really scary. The film is full of creatures that won't hesitate to kill. When the characters are in danger I still get chills because of how scary those scenes are.The negativesThe only minor flaw is that a couple of action scenes just last a bit too long especially the staircase scene. But all the action is entertaining and full of tension.ConclusionFor me, ""Fellowship of the ring"" is one of the best first acts to a trilogy ever made. With its interesting story and characters, incredible chemistry and acting from the actors, brilliant camerawork, thrilling action, state of the art CGI, great makeup and some genuine scary scenes make this film almost perfect.I'm going to give ""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" a:10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This is my fave movie!!!!!,"I wanted to read the books before I went to see the movie. So I bought the fellowship of the ring and the two towers (knowing later i'd go buy the reutrn of the king). And as i read i never took the story in but once i saw the movie i have become more involved then ever. I have seen the film 3 times and plan to see it again and buy it when it comes out. I check the websites each day and download videos and evrything. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as the hobbits were by far my favourite characters, they are all talented and amazing in their owns way and brought the four hobbits to life. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was perfect and he played the part wonderfully. The rest of the cast were great too and Peter Jackson should be proud. Every thing that happens for this film and cast they deserve. I can't wait to see the next two films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Quick Comment,"After seeing LOR, I was completely amazed by how Peter Jackson did absolutely amazing adaptation of the first novel. The acting was top notch, the special effects where used as a tool for the film, not the film was the tool for the special effects. It goes to show that good filmmakers are still around. Lucas should of watch LOR before he made Episode 2 (or before making Episode 3) and take notes on what real film making is all about, what if Peter Jackson directing Star Wars Episode 3? If he did it would have save the Star Wars Saga, and rescue it from the unbearable cheese of first 2 pre-quels. Besides the best Star Wars episode i.e. Empire Strikes back', wasn't made by Lucas but studio master Irvin Kershner. It goes to show that the Star Wars medium is brilliant, but with wrong directing it can be pure crap. And the LOR medium is equally awesome to Star Wars, but thank heavens that LOR had a good director. even though LOR books was one of the influences for Lucas to create the Star Wars saga anyway. Besides I shouldn't have compared LOR and Star Wars, but it was a natural Instinct to do so of the two Epic tales of good against evil. Peter Jackson doesn't care about world class box office sells, he cares about world class film making and that feeling is present within the film, thus making LOR refreshing to see.P.S. I know I will get criticised for what I said, I dont care.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
'Rings' proud and true.,"My Take: Grand-scale epics at best.After plagued with much hype and anticipations upon release, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, the first of three adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series, is a highly satisfying and intriguing trip to a dark and yet magical new enterprise. New Zealand-born director Peter Jackson, like most of Hollywood's directors and producers, demand a great deal of money to create such project, but unlike others, Jackson has his own vision. He doesn't let the film blunder with too much special effects without first seeing what's more important, plot characters and storyline. With such great framework, it's no wonder why FELLOWSHIP is steady and strong.Firstly, the movie is filled with dazzling special effects. There are dozens of flashy advances on the effects. Now, we are able to create towers, civilizations, creatures, caverns, and many other locale and characters in grand scale. It's a convincing look at a terrific combination of miniatures, digital effects and the like. This is a grand motion picture achievement, and it's great to look at. This cost a lot to be sure, and it shows.But the movie isn't all flash and dazzle, it's also about characters and a story, and it doesn't water down Tolkien. His vision of Middle-Earth is wonderfully and respectfully visioned by Jackson, who takes his imagination to create it. The characters that populate the story are actually valuable. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his gang of Hobbits, and the rest of the Fellowship, comprise a surprising amount of friendship. These characters are a real fellowship, as we care about them, and what happens to them. The plot isn't tailor-made for Tolkien fanatics alone. The plot is easily explained and punctuated, and avoids much confusion.Although the adaptations of the follow-ups are more superior, it only shows that something great can actually be something even bigger. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is superb, epic-scale, with heart.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Plot and Cinematics,"This film completely changed my perspective of cinema and its potential for the first time i streamed this movie in my TV. What this movie has achieved is still way beyond caliber of filmmakers in 2024. A very important question it has answered and that is crystal clear, sharp and high quality vfx and cg is not all that you are supposed to sell in modern film industry, but a blend of all (plot, history, fantasy, graphics and sound) is what people want.Well on the other hand, i really felt bad when they streamed their series on Netflix, it didn't grew up to the potential of what franchise has achieved in past.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The fantasy movie,"A lot has been said about The Fellowship of the Ring over the years. It was a cultural phenomenon unlike few others at its release. People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies. It's quite likely that the current superhero craze would not have happened had this movie not shown that people cared about make-belief, care about escapism into a foreign and strange world, filled with magic and wonder.It truly is a wonderful movie. There will doubtlessly be other adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnum opus in the years to come. We can only hope that whoever they end getting to direct, will love the world of Middle-Earth as much as Peter Jackson does.Because that's why these movies are so good, why this movie won us over almost instantly. It's not the huge budget, or the talented actors, or even the majestic landscapes of New Zealand. Although they do help. A lot. But in the end it's the hours put in. All the tiniest details that someone included, not because they absolutely had to, but because they wanted to make it as perfect as possible. Because they care about this world, about this story.The Lord of the Rings has now shaped multiple generations. It has shaped how we think about stories. It's definitely one of my favourite books ever written and this one is definitely one of my favourite movies ever made. Not because it's the perfect adaptation. Or the perfect movie. It's neither. There are things changed, which I wish were not. The storytelling has its hiccups. But those don't matter. Because at its heart this movie is in the right. It cares about what it is, what it represents. About what it's telling us. What kind of a story it is.And it is for that reason that I love this movie so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"FUNNY, SHE DOESN'T LOOK ELVISH","THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS  (2001) **** Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, John-Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloo, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Andy Serkis.  Grand taskmaster filmmaker Peter Jackson's immense undertaking of the epic cult novel  the first of a franchise trilogy shot back-to-back  by J.R.R. Tolkien makes quite an impressive achievement in telling the odyssey of hobbit Frodo Baggins (Wood in arguably his finest performance to date) in his intrepid quest with an assortment of Middle Earth denizens in safely delivering a magical, powerful ring and facing incredible odds and obstacles in the long trek ahead.  Excellent ensemble of wizards  grand old sage Gandalf (McKellen); evil Saruman (Lee); elves  sexy Arwen (babelicious Tyler); trusty archer Legolas (Bloom); fierce dwarf soldier Gimli (Rhs-Davies); humans (stalwart Mortensen and edgy Doubting Thomas Bean) and his three fellow hobbits  best friend Sam (loyal Astin) and ersatz Rosenrantz & Guildenstern buddies, Pippin & Merry (Boyd and Monaghan, respectively)  make for one amazing journey into darkness with some wicked villains, nasty monsters (truly vile Orcs), kick-ass battle sequences and sword bouts aplenty are counterbalanced by ethereal beauty and astounding state-of-the-arts visuals.  A feast for Tolkein freaks and newcomers alike; you won't be disappointed.  One of the greatest fantasy adaptations ever committed to celluloid.  Kudos to Howard Shore's bombastic score (and special thanks to master sound dude Greg Laporta).  One of the year's best and a near-instant classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Dull, Pretentious, Stupid and Uninspiring","First of all, I think this film suffered due to the arrogance of the filmakers. Before it's release, the cast and crew were going around saying things like ""you've never seen anything like this!"" and ""I cried and you will to!"".Well sorry but I have this before. ALL OF IT! There is absolutely nothing in this film that is new and in fact it seems in places like a cut and paste job from other movies.Sleepy Hollow, Jason and the Argonauts, First Knight, Camelot, Willow, The Ten Commandments, and so on. They're all represented here and some of the shots are identical to shots in those movies.And no I didn't cry because ALL of the characters are so unlikeable.What you have here is a bunch of second rate actors(Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee aside} portraying a bunch of unlikeable and dull characters. Characters who for most of the movie, run away, meet some bad guys, run away, meet some more bad guys, run away again and this keeps happening until the end. Except there is no end!!!!  It just stops in a cynical ploy to get you to go and see the next movie.The story is boring and has no narrative drive. It's supposed to be an adventure story but where is the adventure?! There is no tension or excitement. And the action scenes are so muddled that it shows Peter Jackson up for the amature that he is. He should have stuck to B movies.The plot is ridiculous. A magic ring which somehow has magic powers must be taken to the ""Dark Gloomy Mountain Of Murder"" or something like that, and our ""heroes"" decide to do it without any real questions.From then we meet a mirage of incredibly embarassing creatures like Elves and Goblins and some CGI monsters which are so badly animated that it takes any realism out of the film.But the worst thing is that everyone takes things so incredibly serious! Are you not allowed to laugh in middle-earth? Everyone is so po-faced.The film has no zip. No spark and is instantly forgettable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Pure fantasy,"J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.Since then this story has influenced pretty much every single author that has come after it. Naturally, a movie adaptation was going to be made at some point, but for the longest time people in the business thought it couldn't be done. You needed to introduce a whole new world, including back stories that could fill whole shelves with books and tomes. The amount of characters alone would make it cumbersome. Without even mentioning the special effects needed. But, finally in the late 90s, movie technology had advanced enough that you could theoretically pull it off. And so Peter Jackson accepted the challenge and in the process created a movie trilogy that affected cinema almost as profoundly as the original book trilogy had affected literature.All three The Lord of the Rings movies are fantastic, but if I had to name my favourite, it'd be this one, no doubt. Not because it's the most direct or has the most flowing narrative. Quite the opposite. The first one contains the most story, has the most detail, jumps around the most. And yet it succeeds in pulling you in. I had read the books numerous times before this movie came out. I knew how much sheer information Jackson had to convey in this first film. I had my doubts. But, the thing is, it's beautiful. From the very first chord of music, from the very first lines of dialogue, from the very first scene of the rings being forged, you're in Middle-Earth. There's just no other way to say it. There's movies capture the essence of Tolkien's original books nigh perfectly.For those that read this and have yet to see this film - yes, all three or four of you - know that this is my second favourite film of all time. It is a fantasy film unlike any other, a tale almost without equal. It is the courage and nobility of men distilled into story form. It is The Lord of the Rings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"This movie is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. It harmonically combines great acting, outstanding set designs and an amazing soundtrack. Since the first minute of the movie, the viewer gets the feeling of being sucked into the world of Middle Earth. Even though the viewer got introduced to this fantasy world only a couple of minutes ago, they find themselves in a world that appeared to be already existing since thousands of years. The great set design just supports the impressive fantasy world created by Tolkien and gives the viewer right away the feeling of looking at an ""epic"". Not only are the visuals convincing, but the storyline itself shows real depth. Overall is ""The Lord of the Rings"" a movie that does everything right when it comes to creating a compelling and fascinating fantasy movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Opened my eyes to the wonderful world of Middle Earth,"I, like so many others, have never read Tolkien's books. However, the movie was so incredible that I instantly rushed out to Barnes and Noble right away! Now, I'm not sure whether to read the books, or wait for the shock, awe, excitement, and utter captivation I can expect from the next two installements. Oh, what *tortue*! (I thank Peter Jackson whole-heartedly for it.) I won't try to explain the plot, for that's been done so many times in so many other reviews. However, I will state that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" rose to number one on my list after my first viewing, surpassing such classics as ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Godfather"" and new wonders like ""The Matrix"" and ""Moulin Rouge."" LOTR embodies both, for lack of better terms,  ""movieness"" and ""realness."" It is ""Moviefull"" because of the strategically placed and oh-so bloody and vicious battle scenes, which holds the viewer's attention (and this is a lady speaking!)The love element is also there, yet underplayed, making it not ""in-your-face,"" and therefore appreciated and even wanted. The melodious background score captures the perfect emotion for each part of the film, ranging from terror to torture to triumph. The plot is explained, is understandable, and is riddled with foreshadowing, symbolism, and all those other literature tidbits that us Advanced-Placement English nerds adore (this is also a student speaking!). The movie is intriguing, understandable, captivating; the perfect begining for the next two installments. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job in making us, the huddled masses, feel the suspense and aniexty well enough to want- nay NEED- to return to theatures next Christmas. The movie is also ""realfull,"" (for extreme lack of a better term) and by that, I mean I agree with the cast and crew when they say you can believe that this event actually happened. This is, of course, strictly a fantasy film. However, the animals do not speak. The characters do not fly. When wizard Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) does his magic, he does not wave a wand like Harry Potter, but manipulates nature and utters ancient words. While imaginary races(i.e. Hobbits, elves and dwarves)   exist in the story, the plot is down-to-(Middle)earth, making it classic. The movie differes from the book, because while Tolkien alone slaved over his novels, countless crew and cast members devoted themselves to this work of art. My hats off the lead actor Elijah Wood (good job, buddy!) and Mckellen, Tyler, Weaving, and Holm. Fellow Hobbits Pippin and Merry are loveable, and tall, dark and handsome Strider rises as my favorite character. While Mckellen received an Oscar nod this year, I hope the Academy will not forget Elijah and Viggo next time around.Aside from the respectable cast, the crew deserves a standing ovation! Oh god, those sets! Thos weapons! Those costumes! Those FEET! Every staue, tree, building and every little everything was unbelievably beautiful. Even the shots taken by the camera crew and the editing done are so right; there's nothing in this feature I can think to critise. Except, of course, the long wait between Christmasses.

"Do not miss this movie, you will be glad you watched it!!","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an awesome movie. I have read The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. I have yet to read The Return of the King. While there are imperfections here and there, overall the movie is extremely worthwhile. I absolutely love Tolkien's enchanting books and would recommend them to anyone before I would recommend the movie just becuase there are several more events included in the novel and because Tolkien is such a brilliant writer. Back to the film: I was very surprised that it followed the book so well (compared to other such films based on books). Yet, I was still disappointed that it did not include the scene at Crickhollow, the house of Tom Bombadil, or the incident at the barrow-downs. Also, the most disappointing element was the appearance of Arwen, who does not act as a major character whatsoever in the novel The Fellowship of the Ring. However, I praise the film on many aspects. I thought it was very appropriate to include the ""history"" of the ring at the beginning, since many of the movie-goers have never read the books and therefore it would be difficult to understand the whole thing about the ring, etc. Also, the scenery was GREAT....just as I imagined it...especially Bilbo's house,the Mines of Moria, among others. The music was very fitting for the movie, as was virtually all of the excellent actors to their characters. Ian McKellan as Gandalf was superb, Elijah Wood as Frodo was great, and Viggo Mortensen as Strider was absolutely perfect...just as described in the book. I highly recommend this film, if for nothing else its brilliant storyline, breathtaking scenery, and excellent actors. Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Easily the best movie I have ever seen,"Nothing compares to the greatest film of all, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. As I watched my favorite books come to life before my eyes I was positively engrossed in this movie.To start off, the scenery must be of the most beautiful places in the world. New Zealand was the perfect place to film it and from the grassy fields to the high mountain tops, each shot was capturing and very believable. The Shire was exactly how I imagined it, with the rolling fields to the hobbits holes, with their round doors at a perfect height for the little hobbits. Rivendell was the most stunning scene out of them all, as perfect as a picture, with misty waterfalls, sparkling streams and the careful structure of the buildings and towers.The beginning told well of how the great rings came to be and Cate Blanchett has a very powerful and capturing voice. The characters all played their parts well. Elijah Wood was more than perfect and adorable in his roll of Frodo Baggins. Ian Mckellen did an outstanding job in his roll of Gandalf the Grey. One of the best characters has to be Strider/Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen. The scene between Aragorn and Arwin was one of the most beautiful. Liv Tyler gave a great performance in her role although I do not think that Arwin was a big enough roll to be credited third. But I guess they have to intertwine women into the picture. In the movie, the two most enjoyable characters were Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). They  were quite funny as the good natured hobbits, always ready for their next breakfast. And there is no friend quite like Sam (Sean Austin). Comments about Frodo and Sam being gay are silly thoughts because its nice to see that two guys can give each others hugs with out being homosexual. Saramaun (Christopher Lee) quite frightened me at first but after reading about the actor who played him and his life,I would love to meet him. Especially since he has meet J.R.R. Tolkien. The orcs, quite yucky, but very believable and very evil. I love Gimli (John Rhys Davis) with his axe and I must admit that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) who is very quick with his bow and arrow is also very attractive. Boromier (Sean Bean) although was very tempted, in the end proved to be worthy of his master.The last thing I must comment on is the directing. Peter Jackson could have done no better. Every shot caught your eye and the graphics that went along with it made it all the while better. Also, the sound track for this movie better win its Oscar because the music is beautiful especially the Enya songs. All in all, this being the greatest movie, derived from the greatest books, I cannot wait to see how they have captured the second two books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Exceeded my every expectation,"When I first learned that this movie was being made I unconciously conjured images of the horrid Lord of the Rings made in the '70's.There were so many things that could have gone wrong with a movie of this magnitude, but to my great pleasure none of them did. Peter Jackson and company did an extraordinary job of bringing this incredible book to life.The sheer amount of detail is astonishing. Nothing since Star Wars has created such an amazing fantasy world. But none of this would matter if the acting wasn't executed to perfection. Every actor fits their role to perfectly.I only have a couple of complaints. The romance between Aragorn and Arwen was only briefly touched and seemed a little forced. We're only given a couple lines of dialogue about the impact of their relationship but nothing that shows why Arwen should want to give up her immortality. I can only hope that this will be fleshed out in the sequels. I was also a little disappointed to see so much of Lothlorien cut out of the movie. We don't get to see any of Gimli's affection towards Galadriel or the gift-giving scene and much more that occured there.But these are very minor complaints. As long as you aren't a die hard fan who will be mortally offended by the changes from the book to movie or just plain against anything fantastical in nature, then you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very worthy but why didn't I find it fun too watch?,"Wizard Gandalf retrieves an evil ring from Bilbo Baggins he finds it's true nature and must destroy.  Frodo, a hobbit with a pure enough heart to resist the ring, is selected to make the journey to destroy the ring.The story here is very heavy and a good job has been made of trimming down the story to make it accessible to those not familiar with the story.  The characters are quite well developed - the beauty of the film is that it knows it will be a trilogy of films so it doesn't have to rush past characterisation where other films would need to get down to action quickly to ensure that it can get a sequel greenlighted.The visuals are fantastic, the special effects are brilliant and are mixed well with New Zealand's natural scenery to great effect, there's no doubting that Jackson can cope with such a grand canvas to work on.  The action scenes are also very well handled and the monster special effects are mostly good (only occasionally it is obvious that some are computer generated).The main problem with the film is that it isn't a lot of fun.  I know it wants to be serious but it also needs to be fun for the audience to watch, three hours is a long time to sit listening to lots of talk about family trees and ancient quests etc.  I didn't want comedy but it all took itself too seriously to be totally enjoyable.  Another problem with it is that the pacing is all off - the film has a set pattern that goes all the way through, first a talky scene with slow camera movements, then the music changes, the camera starts zooming around and we enter an action scene, then back to a talky scene, then an action/chase scene and so on.  It all gets a bit tiresome with it's continual cut between action/talking/action/talking with a relentless monotony.  There's nothing wrong with the content but it all gets a bit tiresome after a while.The cast are roundly great - almost totally well cast with the exception of Hugo Weaving who looks, sounds and acts just like his character in the Matrix - it makes it too distracting.  Wood as Frodo is a little too serious at times, gazing off into the distance and delivering straight dialogue. Bean and Mortensen are both great, Bean especially with his flawed character struggling against the ring.  The best character in the film is the ring! The film suffers from not having a bad guy to focus on (Christopher Lee is built up but he isn't the main source of evil).  Giving the ring itself the ability to tempt and manipulate and speak, this makes it the main evil character and makes the quest even more tense.Overall it's a big grown up blockbuster with amazing effects but it isn't very much fun to watch (not just laughs but basic enjoyment).

Over hyped and muddled telling of a great story.,"I wonder how many Tolkien fans have praised The Lord of the Rings to their friends whilst secretly bemoaning the many narrative gaps, chronological and character errors introduced by the film-makers in an effort to keep the audience's attention? I'm not saying that this is a bad film, far from it; as a piece of theatre it is excellent, well acted, filmed, directed and scored. The problem for me, and several friends I spoke to, was that most of the time watching the film was spent counting the differences between the book and the film. Of course, such a long book as this would have to be greatly cropped to produce a watchable movie, but I felt that some of the disregarded scenes, (such as the journey through the Old Forest and meeting Tom Bombadil, or the Barrow Downs), could have been incorporated without much difficulty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Star Wars will always have a special place in my heart, but this ONE MOVIE beats them all.As I said, it's hard for me to say this...But having not read the books and not even knowing much of the basic plot, I went into this movie with open eyes.  And I was totally blown away.  I figured LOTR was kid-friendly, with cute little hobbits and dwarves and such.  But the movie was so DARK!  It's a tale of temptation, of power, of emotion.  Not a corny ""Harry Potter"" (which I saw only for the Episode 2 trailer), but something that pulls at the heartstrings and makes you think. Not only is the plot excellent, but the special effects and acting are extraordinary.  I still don't fully understand how they made the hobbits so short (but that will be answered on the DVD, i bet), and I could only find a few obviously bad effects (Frodo in the Council of Elrond).  There is only one word to describe the battle sequences: INTENSE.  It's just so fast and I don't know how they didn't hurt anybody.  I've seen the movie three times and the ending still gets to me.I don't know.  It may be my age (I just turned 18), it may be the changed world, but Star Wars seems a little childish.

Absolutely Magnificent...,"The incredible story that began with nothing more than a ring, and led to a fellowship sworn to destroy it before it destroys them, comes to life with Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring.I have been a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings ever since I first read the books, and when I heard that the trilogy was being turned into movies, I wasn't sure whether to be excited or disappointed.  Most movies tend to bastardize the books they are based on, so I went to the theater in December prepared for a bit of a disappointment.  To my surprise, I found it to be excellent.I happen to be one of those people that, when reading a book like Lord of the Rings, can in my mind's eye picture every little detail as I trace the paths traveled by the characters, from how many clouds are in the sunset sky to the linden trees by the narrow road to the hoofprints left in the dirt by a cantering horse.  So I had my own sets already pictured when I entered the theater, and I grimaced at the thought of what they might have used for the movie.  But the sets were almost exactly how I had imagined my own to be, from the dark, almost Gothic streets of Bree, to the ethereal, elaborate elvish worlds of Rivendell and Lothlorien, and the towering immensity of Isengard.  Almost unbelievable that this was all filmed in only one country.When I first looked over the names of the cast, the only ones I recognized enough to put a face to were Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, and Hugo Weaving (though it was a little strange to see Weaving without his earpiece from The Matrix).  The rest were unfamiliar to me at the time. But I think that having any bigger names, like Braveheart's Mel Gibson or Die Hard's Bruce Willis, would have detracted from the characters that these actors portrayed-when I think of those movies, the first thing that pops into my mind is who is in them, not the stories or the characters or anything else that should be what makes a movie good.  But the acting by the cast in Fellowship was superb nonetheless.  Elijah Wood's honest, innocent, young features contrast sharply to the ruddier appearance of the other hobbits, and his portrayal of the nobly courageous Frodo is so believable and convincing that the hobbit comes far more to life than I had expected him to in the movie.  Liv Tyler brings with her the courage touched with femininity that the books were seriously short of, replacing an elf by the name of Glorfindel who has no other part in the books; this I believe to be a good choice since it gives a beginning to the romance between Arwen and Aragorn that the book only explains in the appendices.  Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel was as ethereal as I had hoped it would be, and having her explain some of the history of the ring at the beginning of the movie really set the scene.  Viggo Mortenson fit Strider/Aragorn incredibly well, and he brought the rugged nobility and royal gallantry of his character to life.  The ever-so-loyal-to-the-end Sam Gamgee-my favorite character in the books-is played to bumbling perfection by Sean Astin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd give a comic edge to their characters, Merry and Pippin, that really portrays the laid-back, almost child-like personality of true hobbits.  John Rhys-Davies makes an excellent dwarf in his gruff bravado, and the talented Orlando Bloom looks so natural shooting his bow and arrows in that machine-gun style you would expect of an elf. Sean Bean plays the valorous but struggling part of Boromir extremely well, portraying very believably the torture of one who has held the ring but knows he cannot have it.  Christopher Lee commands respect as Saruman, the sage wizard who has been led astray by the deception of the ring.  And as for Ian McKellan's performance, there is nothing to say-he, as the great wizard Gandalf, is magnificent beyond words in his role.But even a movie as stunningly well-done as this cannot be completely without fault.  Not only did they leave out the verse about the original rings, but they also cut out Strider's verse (All that is gold does not glitter,/Not all those who wander are lost;/The old that is strong does not wither,/Deep roots are not reached by the frost./From the ashes a fire shall be woken,/A light from shadows shall spring;/Renewed shall be blade that was broken,/The crownless again shall be king.).  And then there were (although a minor detail when compared to the rest of the movie) the elven-cloaks from Lothlorien.  These I had pictured in my mind as something slightly more elaborate than made of fleece-type-flannel-looking material.  And also, they never once referred to the Balrog as 'Durin's Bane' as they did in the book.But for each of the few things cut that should not have been, there were a score of things done right.  The Balrog was impressive for not having much of a physical description in the books to go on, Orthanc was intimidating, and the Uruk-hai invoked the fear that they were meant to.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole three hours and five minutes (both the first time I saw it and the second) as it was shown to me that even today, great movies can still be found, one without the objectionable material that movies get attention for today, one that places emphasis on loyalty and friendship and sacrifice.  It was breath-taking; it was stunning; it was magnificent.  It was Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and awesome in its greatness.This is one movie that definitely deserves a thirteen-and-a-half out of ten in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Oh, dear. Could it have been any worse?","Tolkein was right. He said his story could never have been made into a film. Peter Jackson has proved him right. This movie was terrible. It's like a cross between The Mummy Returns and Xenia: Warrior Princess. But those productions are made with tongue firmly in cheek. LOTR was meant to be taken all so seriously.It's like Monty Python and the Holy Grail but without the jokes. Very pompous and VERY overblown. Jackson is only interested in the battle scenes which are done so appalingly that you actually sit there waiting for them to be over.The score grates and whines. Be thankfull then that you won't remember it when you leave the cinema. Some of the effects are good but others are SO bad.The cast are also wasted. It's a good cast but the script is dismal and it lets them down badly.I don't know why this film turned out as bad as it did. All the ingredients are there for a good movie. There is a great story, a good cast, a compotent if not awe-inspiring director, so why then is the film nothing more than a 3 hour long episode of Xenia: Warrior Princess?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Breathtaking,"I just wanted to point out that I have never read the books so I came into this movie with a very open mind.  When I first saw the previews I honestly wasn't sure of what to expect out of this.  Some friends of mine read the books and were going on about how Peter Jackson was going to ruin the franchise by making a movie.  They were proved wrong.  My friends and I went and saw it 2 days after it came out, and needless to say, we were all completely blown away by the beauty of this film.I may be young and I probably don't look at film-making the same way, but the way that Peter Jackson conveyed those words in the book to the big screen is just complete brilliance.  I have never seen anything like it. Middle Earth was beautiful.  Choosing New Zealand as the location to film this movie was the best decision ever.  From The Shire to Rivendell to Mt. Doom, it was all captured flawlessly by Jackson.Now on to the actors.  What better person than Sir Ian Mckellan to play Gandalf the Grey.  My god, the guy breathed eternal life into that character and he did it with such grace.  I have to admit that going into this film, I was very skeptical on the choice of Elijah Wood for Frodo, but again, I was proved wrong, as Elijah provided an innocence to the character that I don't think anybody else could have done.  All the other actors from Viggo Mortensen to Sean Bean to Liv Tyler did one hell of a job.In summary, this movie is, arguably, my favorite movie thus far.  All the things that I've wanted in a film have been weaved into this fine piece of artistic mastery and I'm definitely anticipating the sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the best movies ever made .,"The fantasy genre is very under appreciated ,mostly because it is considered a genre aimed to the kids .But there are many good and beautifully made titles .

Jon Monsarrat review: Perfect. A Fantasy movie that non-fantasy people will like.,"Like many fans of the book, I walked into LOTR mentally praying ""please, if there is a God, don't let them screw this up.""They didn't. The movie is flawless; perfect, and pays tribute worthy of the original book. Acting, visuals, directions, perfect.If you normally don't care much for fantasy, but might be persuaded to see one, just one movie with ""elves"" and such, this is the one.One note, however -- check your watch when the movie starts so you will know when the ending is coming up. That way you won't get caught out in a couple of places where it ""feels"" like the movie might end at any moment. It is long, so be ready for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Magnificent,"Magnificent! A great start to the franchise.'The Lord of the Rings' is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.Very eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Cinema was invented for this INTENSE kind of experience!!!!,"Breathtaking!Pete Jackson did it! This movie is so extraordinary that it is hard to describe with words alone. It is thrilling, frightening, spine-chilling and exciting from the first moment on.This was the most intense movie experience since I went to see ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, then being a 11-year old boy. ""The fellowship"" simply blew me away, drove me to the edge of my seat more than once. My girl-friend was totally exhausted, saying that she felt like she herself would have walked with the fellowship over the mountains and through the mines - and the last half hour, she only wanted to say ""stop, I cannot walk any further, I'm totally worn out!!!"". For me, knowing the book, the film still was physically strenuous, but I just could not stop adoring the wonderful pictures and the sensational cinematography.Everybody will have his favorite moments in this movie. Mine were the escape from the black riders in the first part and Boromirs fate in the second. No spoilers here, but Sean Bean was fantastic! And I had to calm down my girl-friend during the Troll sequences at Moria - and many more times during the spectacular end...I am very glad that the movie, unlike many others, more than lived up to the hype.Those hours were among the most exciting movie hours I ever had, and I can't wait to see the next two parts.

"Excellent Science Fiction in the Tradition of ""Star Wars"".","Outstanding first film of the franchise which received a whopping 13 Oscar nominations and definitely makes a case for being the best film of 2001. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is excellent story-telling that is told in an epic style that is rarely seen in the cinema these days. The film uses new technologies and old customs to create an amazing experience. Elijah Wood is entrusted to destroy the most powerful ring created in Middle Earth and it is up to him to cast it into the depths of fire from which it came many, many centuries earlier. Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean and John Rhys-Davies make the large impressions as they are among those attempting to assist Wood in his all-or-nothing quest. Ian McKellen (Oscar-nominated) gives his greatest performance to date as he steals every scene and gives the film an element of grace that few could have done. Other high-class actors like Ian Holm and Cate Blanchett stand out among the ensemble. The movie is much more than entertainment. It is a film that shows that the smallest of people can make the biggest difference in the most important of times. The elements of love, friendship and goodness are major themes. All this makes ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" one of the best movies of all time. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I did not enjoy the film.,"I found the changes made in the story line showed Mr. Jackson did not understand the book, -at all.  His his replacing the character of Glorfindel, a warrior, with Arwen, a Lady of the Realm (turned female warrior for no apparent reason other than to attract Xena fans), completely destroys the point of the Tolkien trilogy.  He simply can not undo the damage he has done with this ""substitution"".  A significant segment in ""Return of the King"" hinges on the fact that there are not female warriors.I am so disappointed in the film and will not be watching any of the following installments.I just wish Mr. Jackson had bothered to read the books before he butchered them.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazing. A Masterpiece.,"I was so happy when I saw this. It is proof that Hollywood can spend huge budgets and not always produce bad movies! They need to hire a director who's not from Hollywood, but they can still do it!This is a great adaptation of the first book of the LOTR trilogy with not too much deviation. The cinematography and sets are particularly amazing. They truly capture Tolkien's rich language and vivid detail from the book. All the lush visuals are beautifully rendered in what is one of the few good uses of extensive CGI.The non-CGI elements like the costumes and music are also breathtaking. The people who worked on this worked their butts off many times and they deserve all the praise they have gotten and will surely receive for the rest of their careers in film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Best film I have seen!!, and I've seen some greats!","As a fan of fantasy films since my child hood I have eagerly awaited this film since I first heard it was being released, I remember being read the books when I was younger and being enthralled although I remember nothing from them. Fantasy films have sets and costumes that build magical worlds that the audience can be lost in but of all of them bar Star wars, none have been exceptional and all flawed in some way. I like the sword and sorcery slant more than anything else but have never had a film that nowadays I could look at critically and call excellent. My favourite film of all time is Masters of the Universe, no other film filled me with such excitement as that did, but it is majorlly floored, other favourites include Legend a film that visually was breathtaking but that was about all it was. Anyway this is the complete article. Visually this is the greatest film ever from the sets, effects down to the amazing and groundbreaking effects. Some of the flowing camera movements are vertigo inducingly brilliant, an example could be the opening battle scene as the camera sweeps through hordes of battling soldiers falling off cliffs or bludgeoning each other as the camera takes us through the battle fields. Peter Jackson's direction is dynamic and at times breathtakingly brilliant. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end throughout this film, I was lost in middle earth for three hours thanks to Jackson's mastery, his imagination obviously running rampant in the designing of the characters, worlds etc based on nothing more than descriptive story telling and perhaps a few odd sketches. I am glad I decided not to bring in any popcorn or sparkling beverage as an unwelcome need to go pee-pee may have resulted in me wetting myself and the fellow viewers either side of me parting like the red sea from the subsequent whiff. Apart from the amazing visuals the films story is imaginative and engaging but what do you expect from a classic fictional epic like Tolkiens Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jackson as far as I know has stayed faithful to the story but of course needing to cut down a few moments of the piece and of course these will go noticed by some to varying degrees of noticability because of course everyone has their own ideas of what parts of a book they have read is important compared to somebody else's opinion. What is great about Tolkiens world, and characters is they are universally compatible, you don't need to have read the books to fully enjoy this, its easy enough to pick up, good versus evil and we get an opening story telling about the rings creation as well as other things of importance. The actors are all well cast here, and all of them perform excellently. Elijah Wood is very good in the lead; he manages to hold the film together in such a big role where others may have lost it to the supporting cast. Ian Mckellan is also brilliant as the wizard Gandalf and others who impress are Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, and a very good Sean Bean in a key role and all the others in this film performed to a level bettering anything I have seen them in. Worthy of note are the two main females the gorgeous Cate Blanchett as the wise and at times scary elf queen, and the impossibly attractive Liv Tyler who must surely have silenced unfair criticism with this performance, she is exceptional in this. She is sexy, tough, gentle and she steals the screen whenever she is on it, simply said she looks hot! One person I have not yet mentioned is Viggo Mortensen who plays Aragon; he for me was narrowly the star of the film. Viggo makes an excellent action hero in this and his performance is outstanding, I genuinely believe he is worthy of Oscar consideration for this film. The only minor fault of the film I would say is the end, because being only a third of the story of course there is no conclusion so it ends all so suddenly. Like pulling a bottle of milk from a baby's mouth when he was only half done I felt mildly annoyed and desperate to see part two, and considering I have to wait a year, I became equally desperate to watch the film again. I do feel that a whole year is a lengthy time to wait and I can see it as nothing more than a marketing ploy to build demand and expectation for the sequel. Anyway Christmas time has once again become an exciting time for me thanks to the Lord of the rings trilogy. Also excellent about this film would have to be the ear poundingly good sound effects, they were astounding. This added to the feeling of the film and like for instance Gladiator this film is one you just have to see on the big screen. I give this a definite 10/10 and it is number one in my mind. What excites me the most is that the sequels are supposed to get better and better. Bring on number 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Needless to say this film (along with Two Towers) was robbed of the Best Picture award. The music gets to me every time and this is a masterpiece of all time. Elijah Wood did a good job as Frodo but the outstanding actors were Ian McKellan as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and of course, Andy Serkis as Gollum.

A beautiful film that never drags once,"I have never been a fan of Tolkein's works. Whenever I've tried to read them, I've become bored and have stopped bothering. It's taken me a while to get around to watching The Lord of the Rings, but I am very glad that I have now seen it. In fact, it actually made me read the books and I prefer the movies to the books.One of the things that I enjoyed so much about this movie is the absolutely *stunning* cinematography. Filming in New Zealand was a brilliant move and I am so glad that this was filmed ""on location"" instead of in the studio. I realize that a good deal of this movie is CGI, but it flows beautifully and there aren't any particular moments where you say, ""AHA! Green screen! Right there!""I truly enjoyed the performances given by the lead actors. Especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. His performance is authentic and he obviously strove to not only play, but *become* his character. Orlando Bloom is wonderful as Legolas and this is easily one of my favorite performances from him. Although in all technicality Legolas is a supporting character, he is an individual supporting character. In the fellowship, there are no other elves for him to be supporting, so in that aspect he is a very individual character, even if he is not the lead. Elijah Wood is good as well -- he does a wonderful job of capturing the simplicity of Frodo and his depressed emotional state. And more credit to Mortensen as well as Liv Tyler with their emotion charged love scenes. A rare thing in Hollywood, these scenes are more sensual then sexual -- a welcome relief from the modern Hollywood blockbuster that just screams sex.Many people aren't particularly wowed by Peter Jackson's directing ability. But I have to say that I think he did a wonderful job. Despite the 178 minutes running time, the movie never drags once. Jackson did a good job of getting as much as he possibly could out of his actors and that is easily the film's biggest asset. This is an amazing film and everyone should see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Totally agree. Lacks Substance,Sure it may look great.But the story lacks substance. It feels to me like they go from adventure to adventure with no story ark. Elijah Wood is not Frodo. You had no sympathy for him.Legolas completely wasted. They turned Gimli into a fool. Which is totally against what was portrayed in the book. All in all I thought the acting was Ok at best. Very stiff dialogue.I normally love Christopher Lee.But not in this.Too monatone. Samwise Gamgee was the LOTR equivalant of Jar Jar Binks.All in all very disapointed.

Don't be scared by the long run-time. This movie wouldn't work with anything shorter than 3 hours (I watch extended edition and you should too). The best part of this movie is probably the end. You go on this adventure with Frodo and at the end it isn't over. Personally when reading the books thus shocked me. Then when Sam comes out and delivers his speech, teats start flowing.

A transporting film with the definitive metaphor for human strength and weakness,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001) is such a definitive adventure, perfectly realised through the intention of Peter Jackson.The truly awe-inspiring production design, the perfect casting of everyone from Elijah Wood to Ian McKellen, the haunting score by Howard Shore, the perfect editing (in both versions, in my opinion). It is simply a work of art, and perfectly realised.But what to me is the most beautiful message of Tolkien's masterpiece delivered for the screen by Jackson is the symbolism in the world of Middle Earth. The ring is perhaps the purest ever depiction of the fragility of the human condition. Our search for power, influence and the ego. At the same time, the way in which love is portrayed by Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and perhaps most of all Sam, is daringly beautiful - in fact all Tolkien's caricatures of Christ.A definitive statement - not only for the fantasy genre - but one which has cemented itself in cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great movie even if you are like me and know nothing about wizards, elves or spells.","First of all, let me just say that I know nothing about hobbits, elves, wizards or spells.  I never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, nor have I ever got much into games like Dungeons and Dragons.  Most of my knowledge about these sorts of things comes from when I went to see Harry Potter a couple of months ago, if that tells you anything about how little I know.  While I wasn't very impressed with Harry Potter, ironically with Lord of the Rings I was.If someone like me could be captured by this film, then just about anyone could be.  It quickly gets you involved in the plot by summarizing how ""the ring"" got to where it is in the present time, therefore doing without the long drawn out boring beginning that so many movies have.  The acting in it is superb, and there are so many different characters with their own personal trials and tribulations to deal with.  I'd venture to say that there is a different character for just about every type of viewer out there to relate to.  It is this quality which makes the movie so deep and is what makes it possible to keep your attention for the full 3 hours that it lasts. Three hours never went by so fast in a movie theater, I swear.The only gripe I have with the movie, is that it doesn't provide any closure when it is over.  As we all know, it is just the first installment of a series of 3 movies.  Therefore of course the end of the movie isn't really the end of the whole story.  However, in other trilogies, such as Star Wars (now more than a trilogy), each movie had it's own struggles which led up to a big catharsis in the end to provide the movie with some closure until the next one.  However in Lord of the Rings, it just ends as if still in the middle of something.  It feels like you're just going to a commercial break when it ends.  So naturally now, you have to go see the second movie if for no other reason, because you left the first still waiting for the climax to take place.All in all though, I gave this movie a 10.  It's original and well done. Perhaps if movies in general weren't so lame in the past decade, this movie wouldn't be rated a 10, but rather an 8 or a 9.  However considering what I am used to seeing, it's a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A good, solid story","I have read through many of the comments on this topic, from a sense of psychological curiosity as much as from a real desire to know what other people thought of the film. Having seen the three movies a few times, the first two in Extended Edition form, the third only in the released form, I have of course a much broader opinion than I did at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring.Firstly, I find the movie itself decently made, with a couple of sparks of brilliance. While I disagree with many people on Elijah Wood, who I think could have done a better job (mind you, the expectations I had from Mr. Wood were proportional with the importance of the part he played - which is the main part), the cast in general was well chosen and I do approve on the choice of Viggo Mortensen rather than Steward Townsend to play the part of Aragorn.I read that a lot of people disagree with the movie these days and I am not sure whether they do this because it's ""fashionable"" to be a rebel in the crowd or because they genuinely disliked the movie as much as they said they did. I find it for instance incredibly difficult to believe that they really could dislike the special effects in the movie. In the end, they were extremely well integrated in the movie and as opposed to the Mummy or the Mummy Returns, they were not overstressed and not so obviously fake.I agree that a couple of scenes were overdone, and the person in charge of those I thought was Orlando Bloom, who, despite the perfect way in which he was made to look Elven, did not act too Elven to my mind. His performance was, I thought, very fake and his good looks can't save him from that. On the other side of the acting are clearly Ian Holm, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen. If Boromir had been shown more, I would have placed Sean Bean in that list more.The movie began in a rustic, very peaceful manner, like the hobbit land is supposed to be and I found that very relaxing and gripping at the same time, because all the while you feel the menace of the Ring, due to Howard Shore's masterpiece, but then it turned into a more gripping and action-filled story mainly due to the appearance of the two sides of villains - Saruman's ""filth"" and the Nazgûl. There is nothing wrong with having a rather sedated pace at the beginning of the movie, as long as the focus is kept on the purpose of the movie, which it was. For viewers who had expected blood and gore from the first movie, I am glad Tolkien disappointed you - as a fighter in the War he was utterly against violence when that could be avoided, which translates into two great massacres presented in the Lord of the Rings, but nothing more.In my mind, this is not what one would call the most significant movie in the history of cinema. Yet Peter Jackson did a very good job in translating the books (which I did read, for those curious about it, and which I did like) into movies. The ""essence"" of Tolkien, as another viewer put it, is in my mind captured very well in all three movies, with the exception of the character of Faramir, which is slightly off-course. On the whole, I will give the movie a 9/10, because of the downsides I talked about earlier.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Shambles!,"As a huge LOTR fan from early childhood, it pains me to write this review - but they've completely missed it! The Lord Of The Rings is about, and should be about, and always has been about two things: story and atmosphere, both of which are missed completely in this film.As any other epic story, the plot needs time to develop and breathe, as such, thus creating a connection, on a very deep emotional level with the heroes. What the production team in this case had done, is crammed a huge story into three hours that make a VERY boring viewing. Boring, since the story has no credibility whatsoever when you don't understand why the heroes are where they are at, how they got there, or how long it took them to get there. All it leaves you with, is looking forward to the battle scenes, in which you will find yourself thinking: 'yeah right, whatever', on more than one occasion.On top of that, or rather because of all that, with the exception of Sir Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, the heroes seem ridiculous and pathetic and you are left feeling completely indifferent to them! Unheard of! Indifferent to the heroes of the LOTR! Oh dear, you got it SO wrong! Shame! Whenever I think about this film, I can't help but thinking about Gladiator, which I thought was fantastically written and executed. LOTR HAD the potential to be as good, but, and it pains me to say that, is not even in the same league.My money back please.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Epic movie,"The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films that comes once in a lifetime, how fortunate we are as human beings to be around at a time where 3 of these films are released within 3 short years!!The fellowship is just the perfect blend of setting the story, fleshing out characters and introducing us to the world of middle earth!Ian McKellen as Gandalf is just legendary.... mysterious, loveable, occasionally hilarious and in THAT iconic scene, completely immortalised.Elijah wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd showcase perfectly not only their playful naivety and innocence but a good heart along with their fierce will and courage to do whatever it takes.Sean Bean does what he does best in most films but has never upset as more in this case and whilst doing so shows us both the best and worst qualities of humans in the harsh, hostile but magical world of Middle earth.By the end of the film you're dying to see what happens next and at every turn you get both attention to detail and storytelling that is seldom found elsewhere.If you haven't watched the Fellowship of the Ring yet, I beg of you! Do it!! It's the first film of a trilogy that is so close to perfection that it will only be seen once in a lifetime 🏅",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Is This The Weakest One Or Is It The Best,"I think it's impossible and actually pointless to try and view The Fellowship of the Ring or any of The Lord of the Rings films as individual movies: they're a collective achievement. And what you can say about one mostly applies to all.How these films did so much so well from the almost perfect casting to visual and special effects and most aspects from the broadest down to the more minor details were done correctly with only a few exceptions. Naturally, most of this is thanks to Peter Jackson who outside of the trilogy might not be that good of a director but his job here is excellent.The Lord of the Rings thrill and they think, they exceed as entertainment and cinema and will probably continue to hold their well-earned status for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Greatest movie ever made, of any kind","Tolkien nuts:  CALM DOWN!!!  I love the book just as much as you guys, but come ON.  It won't be a perfect translation!!!  It would be about 40 hours long, so live with it.  Could YOU do better?  NO!  So CALM DOWN!!!  Look at it as its own entity, not just as a translation of the original.  That's like making the entire Bible into a movie and complaining if it isn't exactly perfect or complete!!!  If you look at it with that POV, you will realize that this stomps Citizen Kane, American Beauty, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and so forth into the ground.  Nothing this grand and epic has ever been accomplished.  Whenever people try, they FAIL.This movie is simply beautiful.  I started The Hobbit in 5th grade (I'm 18 now), and read LotR itself in 8th, and ever since, I've been waiting for a movie to do it justice.  This was everything I could have ever wished for. I teared up at almost every scene to see the places of all our dreams and fantasies come alive.  The first shot showing a sizable portion of the Shire made me shudder with near orgasmic joy.  The only issue I had with it was Liv Tyler.  She wasn't even bad, I just don't like her.  Let's go through the rest of the cast, shall we? Frodo - perfect Galadriel - perfect Aragorn - perfect Boromir - perfect (wished he woulda had his horned helmet tho) the other hobbits - perfect Saruman - mind blowing!!!  Christopher Lee is the messiah, or I'm a goat Elrond - funny looking, but still great Gimli - perfect, tho he acted a bit like the dwarf from the D&D movie Legolas - second best piece of casting EVER Gandalf - BEST piece of casting ever EVERY OTHER BLOODY CHARACTER - SIMPLY PERFECT!!! I've seen a few times, and I hope to go at least 5 more times.  I just can't wait to see the Ents and Shelob.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wonderful interpretation,"Wonderful movie...I'm glad that the movie business left it alone until it could be done properly...ever since I saw Terminator 2 ,I thought,this is it,they can do anything they want with special effects now,LOTR must be coming soon...well,it took a while,but they did get it right;From watching it,I can only assume that Jackson is a Tolkien geek,which is great,that's exactly the sort of person who should have got to do it.Amazingly ,for what is presumably going to be a 9 hour movie,there is still a lot missing from the book,but,fair enough I suppose..I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Legolas and Gimli..It's not really clear in the first installment that their respective races have a touch of antagonism between them,and this makes me wonder whether their blossoming friendship,which I found to be one of the most moving parts of the Two Towers,will be overlooked in the next installment..I hope not,as Legolas is an extraordinary character in the movie. But,that is mere hair splitting;a wonderful movie,wonderful visuals,and the bravery to cast people who are right for the parts,rather than A list 'names'..Keep it up for the next two parts....9.5 out of 10,go and see it(and read the book)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Book me on the next journey to Middle Earth.,"Many people have expressed their fondness for this first part of the trilogy already, so I'll devote this brief review to discussing the flaws of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""Flaw 1: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. In amongst an otherwise fine cast, she's the only one of the principals who seems to not believe where she is; her performance suggests she thinks she's in a perfume commercial (you almost expect her to say ""Obsession. Calvin Klein""), and the soft-focus of her scenes only underlines that impression.Flaw 2: IT ENDS!Sam supplies the best possible review: ""Well, that was an eye-opener.""

Breath- taking movie on all levels,"Warning! Small hints one may not want too hear if they want to be completely surprisedThis is an excellent, amazing and breath taking movie on all levels. I have to admit, that after the first time I saw it I didn?t like it at all. Probably because I had for a long time held a grudge against fantasy and sci-fi. After seeing it a second time though, I fell completely in love with the whole thing. I read all three books in 2 weeks after that and it is the only time that I found that a movie adapted from a book was just as enjoyable (if not better in some ways) as the book.Peter Jackson was very brave too take on this project but it is evident that he really cared about what he was doing because it is so amazing! I thing however that they?re could have been less violence and perhaps they could of put in a bit more of the beginning of the book, where you really get a feel for the simple and happy life of the hobbits. Even so, these are only small problems and they are all made up for with the exquisite scenery, amazing cast, wonderful music and of course the breath taking special effects. This movie made me cry, laugh and scream and there was never a moment when I wasn?t doing one of these.I don?t think a better cast could have been chosen. All the actors seem as if they actually could be the character they play in real life. Elijah Wood is perfect for Frodo. He may not be the strongest actor but Frodo, especially in the first book, is not a terribly dramatic character. He also looks exactly like all the descriptions of Frodo apart from that he?s not fat, which is a good thing as far as I?m concerned. I would of chosen him just for those eyes. Sean Astin does one of the best jobs portraying his part. As the innocent, common-sensed Sam he shows that although he is deathly afraid of what lies ahead his love for Frodo is stronger and he will not leave his side until the end. Billy Boyd is hilarious as the scatter-brained but courageous Pippin (my favorite character) and Dominic Monaghan is equally good as his brave cousin Merry. Viggo Mortenson is amazing. It is almost impossible for me too believe that he isn?t really Aragorn. He manages too look old and dangerous and at the same time young and noble. Sir Ian McKellen gives another outstanding performance. I don?t see why he wasn?t born a wizard, he suits the part so well. His academy award nomination was well earned but the fact that he didn?t win wasn?t right. Orlando Bloom is excellent as the elf Legolas. He walks so gracefully and lightly (meaning no offense, of course) and his archery looks as though he took years too learn it. He is somewhat of a role model for me, being an aspiring actress because this was his first real role! John Rhys-Davies has real ?dwarf? personality. Indignant and competitive. He manages too show very well what a ?real dwarf? was like and not like the ridiculous dwarves in Snow White and so on. Sean Bean, although his part wasn?t very large, shows very well how Boromir is slowly being taken by the power of the ring. The two women in this movie Liv Tyler as the beautiful elf princess who is in love with Aragorn and Cate Blanchett as the powerful elf queen Galadriel are just as good as all the rest. Although Arwen is not a big character in the book I am glad she is given a bigger part because the story needed more women. Cate Blanchett once again did an outstanding performance.I have to give credit as well too the evil characters. Christopher Lee is very powerful as Saruman the wizard who is taken by the evil will of Sauron and drawn to the power of The Ring. Andy Serkis, who does the voice of Gollum didn?t have many lines I this movie but he becomes an important character later on. The reason I menchain him is because he does an extremely good voice for Gollum that hardly sounds human. I tried doing that voice while reading the book out loud and got a sore throat plus I wasn?t even very good at it.Although they?re is much more to this movie, I have no time too talk about it. They?re aren?t even any suitable words in the English language to describe the exquisiteness of the special effects. All I can say is they are amazing! The sets, costumes and make-up were also extremely good. It is a miracle that they were able too re-create Middle-earth and it?s people almost exactly as it is described by Tokien.All other movies that I would of considered excellent movies now seem worse because I have The Lord Of The Rings to compare them too. This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen and I can?t imagine that anything could ever outdo it except perhaps the second and third installments of the trilogy! I would give this movie, as well as the book, all the stars there are in the universe out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Review/HUMN246 Shayne glass,"Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring is the first in a series of quite possibly the best fantasy/adventure movies of all time. The film is directed by Peter Jackson and is based off the novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien. The film is a masterpiece of not only it's time but for times to come. It now stands among the ranks of the greatest movies ever created. The film has the ability to capture the audience and introduce them to an entire different world full of hobbits, wizards, warriors, and monsters. The film was so exceptionally created that it does not matter whether or not the creature are real because when watching the movie you are ""part"" of the film itself rather than just an audience member.While watching the movie you begin to see how greedy people can become when faced with physical items that they desire to have so badly. The theme of the film is that of understanding why and how man can become so greedy, selfish, and willing to do whatever it takes to have something that he desires. I think that J.R.R. Tolkien's goal was to have the reader/viewer after following the storyline to realize that all the ""things"" in life that they are chasing are not as important as we think they are. I believe that he was trying to show the things that really mattered in the film were love, friendship, and all the characteristics that go with the both love and friendship. This theme can be seen throughout each of the Lord of the Ring films.Frodo Baggins was placed in charge of holding and carrying the ring to its destruction. He was chosen to do this task by Gandolf the wizard simply because of Frodo's intellectual understanding of the things that really matter in life. Frodo was not quick to fall into temptation as easy as many of us are. While Frodo and his companions are attempting to destroy the very thing that is causing so much hatred and destruction the rest of the ""monster"" kingdom is trying to gain control of the ring and maintain it for their own greedy purposes.The angle of the film and the lighting in the film are two techniques that the director uses to progress the theme of the film. The director uses a very distant angle at times in order to capture the extreme vastness and greatness of the world of Middle Earth. This allows the director to capture the viewers into the world that the characters live in. The lighting is done by the director in a manner that is to show the difference between good and bad. Characters that are seen as good in the movie have a lighter aura surrounding them during the scenes. Evil characters are many times surrounded by dark lighting that allows for a negative aura to surround them.Overall Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent movie and a beginning to one of the best series of all time. I appreciate what both J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson were trying to do with the theme of the movie. Tolkien did an excellent job of creating the storyline and Jackson did an excellent job of turning the novel into a masterpiece film for years to come. With the adventure/fantasy in the film comparable to even that of Harry Potter and all of its films the Lord of the Rings is a must watch for anyone!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Rough Guide to Middle Earth,"Tolkein's epic fantasy novel had long been considered unfilmable, on account of the richness of the imaginative landscape described in his prose and occasional, vertiginous drawings.  So the first thing to say about Peter Jackson's film is that it looks (i) amazing and (ii) exactly as you expected it to look. New Zealand and computer graphics have combined to create a visual extravaganza wholly true to the original's aesthetic.  But the replacement of words by images in itself is merely a prerequisite for a successful film. And the words are largely, sadly, replaced: little of the text survives, and even in the beginning, when Galadriel gives us an introduction to then history of the ring, Tolkein's own various accounts have been discarded (arguably necessarily) in place of a softer, more matter-of-fact overview. None the less, the main details of the story survive. Scriptwriter Frances Walsh has simplified in places but has not shied away from the essential complexity and richness of the tale.  Of course one has quibbles: we lose the subtlety of Saruman (a shame, when Christopher Lee is the perfect casting); all the hobbits, Bilbo excepted, seem about half a generation too young; the re-invention of Arwen as a warrior princess is dull, obvious and anachronistic; Hugo Weaving's Elrond is slightly camp and his council lacks due solemnity; and however often Viggo Mortenson flashes his cheekbones, Aragorn was surely never such a pretty boy. But compared with what seems right, what seems wrong is surely trivial by contrast. And yet the film still fails to really capture the magic of the book.The problem is that a lot of the strength of the book is what happens when nothing is happening.  A few examples suffice to illustrate the point. Headed towards Weathertop, Aragorn tells the hobbits fragments of ancient legends; by the time the party arrives, their destination is established as a place of wonder and history.  But in the film, we leap there straight from Bree: Aragorn points out the ruined fortress as if he had never mentioned it previously, in the manner of a tour guide pointing out the sights.  The subsequent flight to the ford is notable in the book as a time when the heroes are waiting, day after day, for inevitable attack, which when at last it happens has a much more powerful impact than the simple chase scene rendered here; while the attempted passage of the mountains, grimly familiar in prose to anyone who has battled the elements at altitude, is reduced to a single dramatic scene, that makes the point (that the pass will not be crossed) but wholly fails to suggest that the characters might die here (and slowly), defeated by nothing more magical than weather and cold. In consequence the film becomes a mere sequence of dramatic challenges: fight the orcs, flee the balrog, meet Galadriel, etc., etc., etc.  The sense of time, and of the characters' changing perceptions of their mission as it passes, is lost.  Instead, the battle scenes, which in part one are merely skirmishes, are played up.  In spite of its great length, this film lacks patience. Everything is amazing; and so in a sense nothing is.  Each landmark, so hard-earned in the primary text, comes quickly after the one before, like a sequence of edited highlights.  Overall, the effect is that of a three hour trailer.For devotees of the book ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is fascinating but flawed. It's far from clear that it could have been better.  But maybe film is simply too literal a medium to capture a vision that as literature is always more than the sum of its parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Congratulations on the tech demo, where's the film?","Peter Jackson \ C/O WETA Productions \ New ZealandDear Peter,I write to you care of your special effects studio, as that seems to be where you spent most of your time during the production of this 3 hour technical demonstration.I would like to congratulate you on producing a proof of concept that demonstrates that you now have the technology to make a great adaptation of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and I would be keen to know when you intend to do so.While your proof of concept was nearly technically flawless (not many people will have noticed Legolas drawing CGI arrows straight through - and not out of - his quiver), I am sure that you realise that this is only a necessary prerequisite to actually producing a dramatic and enjoyable film. Clearly, your cast realised that they were just doing a dress rehearsal, as they delivered unengaging and one dimensional performances.  Unfortunately, Liv Tyler and Sean Bean seemed to be labouring under the mistaken belief that they were actually filming the real movie; it was rather cruel of you not to let them into the secret.  Boromir's line of ""And they have a cave troll."" contained a full TWO nuances (sardonic, resolute) and sounded as though an actual person had spoken it, which jarred badly with the idiot-board delivery in the rest of the tech demo.It was an interesting choice to show half of most of the plot lines (as opposed to most of half of them), so that the test audiences could get a taste of what to expect in the final version.  For example, showing Sam saying goodbye to Bill the pony, without explaining where he came from, or setting up Gimli's antipathy to elves without then allowing him his one piece of character development, his adoration of Galadriel.  Of course, no one who has actually read the books will be satisfied with this token coverage of the facets that make the book so enjoyable, and I trust you will resolve this in the release version.When you do film the final version, I would suggest that you obtain both an action choreographer, and a decent sound recordist.  It is clear that you had neither for this technical demo, as the action sequences jump cut once or twice a second, usually away from imminent snafu's, and the entire film is drowned out by the yammering and cliched soundtrack (Enya! How capricious!), a clear sign that you had no decent original to edit. Apparently you will have $90 million to spend on the final version, and you will only have to cut perhaps ten seconds of CGI to be able to invest in some actual cinematics (I suggest the pointless Indiana Jones scene that serves the sole purpose of setting up a poor ""joke"").  On the issue of investment, I notice that your tech demo cameras can only focus at under twelve inches, or over fifty yards.  Perhaps buying some cameras that can perform mid range shots might be an idea.Once again, congratulations on showcasing WETA, and good luck when you actually decide to make your long awaited adaptation of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".Yours most very sincerely,Ripe Peach",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A perfect film doesnt exis....,"Peter Jackson ""Hold my beer.""As near to perfection as a film can be FOTR shines. Not just in the cinephile catagories such as cinematography, production, directing and its perfect screenplay, casting and acting but also in catering to the genre nerds. Deeply respectful of Tolkien, the world building here is subtle without massive exposition dumps except that given by Galadiel as the film opens. And that too is perfect... the words, the visuals, the music... we the audience are captured, lost, and invested from the start.I understand why ROTK got all the awards recognition. It completed the trilogy which was rightly recognised as a cinematic achievement of a proportion that may never be equalled but FOTR is the best film of the set. The fact that Jackson, McKellen. The writing team and the film itself were nominated in their respective catagories and didnt win is frankly quite astounding.

epic filmmaking as it should be!,"No I won't be silenced about this film! No, it hasn't quite reached obsession!Alright. A quick plot summary, as if you don't already know. Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), having reached his 111th birthday decides to take off on a last adventure, like he used to in the old days. He leaves to his adopted nephew/heir, Frodo (Elijah Wood) his property and a mysterious ring, which Gandalf (Ian McKellen), the wizard bids Frodo to keep ""secret and safe"". Of course, as oft happens in these cases, the ring turns out to be the One ring, created by the dark lord Sauron, millennia ago, with the power to enslave the whole of middle earth. So it is that Frodo must leave his idyllic existence in the shire, with his friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and later superfluous hobbits Merry and Pippin and trek across middle earth to finally take the ring to be destroyed. Along the way, and after much peril, Frodo is joined by men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas and Dwarf Gimli. So the fellowship of nine, in a nutshell, is formed.What can one say? It's a film that I was waiting for a year and a half for. I was trying to ready myself for disappointment. And so, at 9:50am, Wednesday 26 December, during the first session of LOTR in Brisbane, Australia, I was to finally see this film, for which I had pined, ached to see for so long, and the result was... pure bliss!So much had been riding on this film. And so brave it was to make all three at once, but it has paid off for the first instalment at least, and created such a marvellous cinema experience that I could hardly contain my excitement when I emerged from the cinema three and a half hours later, feeling rewarded for the experience as I noticed the huge line-up for the fourth session.The opening of the film, not just the introduction but the whole Hobbiton sequence, was just perfect. It was so pure, so idyllic, so wonderful, rich. It was best we could hope for for the introduction into this world of hobbits, their tranquil, simple existence, which would be sharply and horribly contrasted with the sudden emergence of the evil bound to the ring. And from then on this sprawling epic took us on a journey rarely experienced by cinema audiences.It is HUGE! It's on such a mammoth scale that you feel breathless watching these beautiful images, these sweeping crane shots, this massive view of a mythic world. Middle Earth is so convincing and not once did I think of it as a fantasy, more of a rich history. Surely we owe this to Tolkien but if it was not for Jackson's vision it could have emerged on-screen in a lesser and inferior form. Such imagination and vision, rich with detail, heart and genuine enthusiasm for the project is rarely found in a big film like this. Imagine what George Lucas would have done for instance. There would have been some annoyingly cute young hobbit characters and Gollum would have been more like Jar Jar Binks than a mysterious, shadow-dwelling enigma. `Mes-a Gollum!'? Shudder at the thought. It shows though that Jackson cares so much about the books, the characters, the story, that he does not sacrifice it for cheap grandiosity or easy commercialism. I actually cared about the characters, what happened to them, the struggles they had to face to achieve their seemingly impossible aim. And the film is not just a fantasy adventure with Jackson pointing here and there saying `look at this, see what I can do??', it works well as a beautifully-conceived, emotionally-rich drama. There are at least two very effecting, very real scenes, both toward the end of the film, in which you truly care and the actors show their craft. In these moments the audience would stop silent. Especially in the first session, there wasn't even a rustle, a crunch of popcorn or a breath to be heard as the struggle was shared by the audience. The performances are exceptional. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, evoking both youthful enthusiasm and great strength and resilience mixed with a sad loneliness and weakness. He is in one moment both determined and weary. Also worthy of note (and they all are, but being selective) are Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee and Sean Bean as Boromir. Each brings to their role a painful honesty and true heart. Sam is one of the most admirable and delightful characters I have seen in ages. Sean is a long way removed from Encino Man here. And hopefully he will gain credit for this role, as he is truly excellent. Sean Bean is a man tortured by an underlying will to do good, but a strengthening urge to have power, corrupted by the evil of the ring. He is an excellent Boromir, who despite his transgressions is quite endearing at the same time. It's a given too that Ian McKellen is brilliant, and another Gandalf you could not imagine. Wise, bold, mischievous, caring. And Ian Holm as Bilbo is equally as good. Need I mention the superb art direction, costumes and eye-popping special effects. Particularly good is the way the differences in height from Hobbit, dwarf, man and elf are perceived.And so, this film, so detailed, so beautiful, both subtle and thrilling, with some very tense moments, is instantly a classic and one of my favourite films of all time.From one (potential) filmmaker to another, I can think of no better compliment to pay than to say, I wish I made this film. This is the type of film I would love to make. I wish I had some part, whatever it may be, no matter how tiny, in bringing this marvel to the screen. It pains me that I don't live in New Zealand and am still at university, because I would throw myself at Peter Jackson and say, `Take me, I will make you coffee!!' This is the effect of this film. So wonderful, so beautiful, so full of power and magic and bringing together a brilliant team of professionals who are all geniuses in their craft. A year and a half, so much waiting, so much anticipation and it was rewarded and here we have the first instalment of this trilogy, and we wait now for the other parts. It's hard to imagine a better adaptation or a better person to have brought this to our cinemas. Hardly surprising what score I gave it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very good entertainment,"Although hopes were high for Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring it absolutely was not a disappointment.  Ian McKellen was great as Gandalf and I don't think that anyone else could have done better.  What was astounding were the special effects, they are simply amazing.  The computer graphics and the music are astounding.  The feature length is 2 hours 47 minutes which is about half an hour to much, for my taste, but for hardcore fans it's probably not enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A brilliant epic - Peter Jackson brings Middle-Earth to life.,"I have watched this film 80 times (no lie) - I have enjoyed it every time. Peter Jackson has brought Middle-Earth to the screen brilliantly and with glory - New Zealand's beautiful scenery and huge mountains recapture Tolkien's world in a way that would make him proud. On top of that, every actor owns his/her role 100% (especially Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf) and delivers very powerful, meaningful performances that ensure that every character has their own story to tell (and their own movie to act). Though some of the battle scenes aren't great - there is obvious ragdoll usage in the troll fight scene - this film is a stunning start to the most successful trilogy of the millennium and a chance to experience Tolkien's world on screen for yourself as it always should have been - flawless. A must-see. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazingly it manages to stay perfectly faithful to the book and still keep you entertained for the full three hours.,"Even though Peter Jackson's movie is very much a Tolkien fan's dream, it still has a life of its own as this three hour epic unfolds its universe with amazing details and a superb cast. The story follows the book closely with only a few omissions and a little editing to make the narrative flow. In fact some scenes follow the book so closely that one is left with a strong sense of deja vu.There is much to marvel at as the computer generated images blend perfectly with the action in a way that is far superior to George Lucas' efforts in The Phantom Menace.The only problem is that the movie ends rather inconclusively as does the book. 12 months is a long time to wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Perfection (well, almost)","What can I say that is able to describe the immense quality of this film? Words don't come easy when I try to describe the impressive beauties of an epic legend turned into images. The enormous task of adapting the film is superb, with and outstanding plot, a perfect direction and a very well chosen casting of actors! Is is a film that fills and overwhelms all I had imagined when I read the book. There is few films than for me, deserve a 10, if I could, for this one, I would give a 12 to it!!! Emotion, action, love, passion, tragedy, greed... All the most touching emotions of our world moved into an fantastic and moving world filled with strange creatures that will, of course, make you stay 4 hours (yeah, 4!, so big is the greatness of the film!) in your sofa, absolutely amazed and desiring to know how continues.

Difficult to Fault!!,"How can a film miss when it has everything going for it, storyline, graphics, authenticated digitalization, and maybe some of the most fabulous cinematography that I have ever seen in any movie made whatsoever!! This was a painstaking effort of folklore and fantasy which homogenized in conjunction with the rendition of the novel ""Lord of the Rings"" by Tolken!!! I do not know if anybody remembers the animated version of ""Lord of the Rings"" made in 1978? I enjoyed it very much!! However, with this triumvirate of epic ""Lord of the Rings"" movies which besieged the movie viewer in the early part of this decade, and eventually took the movie industry by storm, more and more film aficionados will appreciate Tolken's work now than ever before!! ""Fellowship of the Ring"" fascinates the movie audience by manufacturing monsters who wind up taking on mere mortals... This induces a David and Goliath confrontation which provides a suspenseful entertainment for anyone watching this film!! I just cannot get over the breathtaking cinematography in this film!! I believe it was filmed in New Zealand, now, I want to go there!!! Rated as one of the top twenty American movies ever made, I definitely recommend seeing ""Lord of the Rings/ Fellowship of the Ring"" Survival of the fittest never became more creative than with this movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
OH-MY-GOD!!!!!!,"I have seen Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth. It is beyond everything I ever wanted it to be. And then some. Having read the books several times, I was hoping for this film to be a candidate to my all time favorites. Now it is.I've been following the production of these movies for a long, long time now. On my computer, I have those storyboard-drawings from long back, that was shown on NZTV. You all know; the one with Gimli, an axe and the other with a hobbit looking scared into the camera. I remember when Miramax wanted to make just two movies. I remember the first geeks seeing Sean Connery in Wellington, instantly screaming `Gandalf spotted in Wellington'. I remember a photo of a constructing-worker digging hobbitholes. I remember when Ian McKellen signed, to much relief. My room is covered with the posters for the movie: Frodo holding the Ring, looking anxiously at us, looking down The Pillars of Argonath towers over my desk. I have a wall covered with photos from the film My room is a Geeks' confessing to his love for Middle-Earth. And yesterday I went there.And OH-MY-GOD! This is one of the best films ever! I do not want to spoil anything for those who haven't read the books, but I promise you; this is one movie you will never forget! The casting is superb, almost to perfect to be true. Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Been, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin etc. They are all great!! The effects are stunning and ""invicible"", the editing-costumes-make up-music-EVERYTHING is put together beyond expectations. Look at the clothes Bilbo is wearing, listen to the music after the Balrog has done its' business, watch the editing in the Nazgul-Bree sequence. But above all, the cinematrography is extraordinary. Andrew Lesnie's camera is everywhere and it makes you wonder: ""How the ¤%¤&""#& did they get a camera in that position?"" The directing, the script, the rest of the GOD DAMN stuff is so good! I can't wait to get back in the theatre, to get back to Middle-Earth.I love the last scene, I love when Gandalf rides thru the Shire, I love the Hobbits cocking food in the deep mountains, I love the sound the Nazguls make, I love the first vision (Yes, it is a vision) of Arwen, I love the voice of Galadriel AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE!THANK YOU PETER!!!!Eirik",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
As good as any movie can get!,This movie keeps me glued to the television every time i watch it. For all fantasy lovers this movie is a must-see! You will not be disappointed one minute through this three hour movie. You will be begging to see the next movie. The whole cast in this movie was absolutely brilliant. It made you feel as though you were really in middle earth. I love this movie and it is dear to my heart. I've watched it a hundred times a swear. Yet i never seem to get sick of it.

Peter Jackson...one heck of a director.,"When I read books, I read so I 'see' what's happening in my head, like a mini movie while reading. I read the entire Tolkein series in the eighth grade, a year and a half before this movie came out. I must say, I LOVED the books.When I saw the 'Fellowship"" I was quite impressed. Peter Jackson pretty much took the movie out of my head. He brought this movie to life, and only reading the book, for me, could make it as real. Peter Jackson is an amazing director, and he did wonderfully on this, and the other two, movie. I was only disappointed that he had to cut a few key elements/people. Other than that, I think this man is a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A three hour film about walking.,"Ok, so forget all the hype and think about it for a second.  3 hours in which nothing much happens except a bit of walking and then a bit of fighting does not a good film make. There may be those who are fans of the book and I don't doubt that to them this is a great film. But to anyone else who have never ventured into the world of Tolkien then it is a huge let down.  There seems to be too much reliance on knowledge from the book as none of the characters seem to have any back story and we haven't got a clue to why they are prepared to take on the quest.The action scenes are few and far between and when they do come they seem a bit lacklustre. The acting is nothing special and there are some scenes (The council meeting) where the effects people must have taken the day off. Which leaves the walking... there's a lot of it. In fact they're some of the best bits as New Zealand looks very nice. However that's all that gets done and after a while I was convinced that the film was going to show and advert for Millets or the Rambling association at the end. Painfully dull though if  rambling or fantasy is not your thing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Quite Simply:  One of the Best Films Ever,"A few thousand reviews in a month or so bespeaks of many things.  I find it hard to add what has already been said.  But I will try to capsulize my take on LORD OF THE RINGS:1.  Superlatives are insufficient to describe the utter awe that this movie has elicited - in me - and in the world.2.  You'll never be able to please everyone. Mr. Jackson has virtually achieved that. I haven't seen such a splendiferous response to a movie in a long time - not even from 'Titanic' or 'Harry Potter'.3.  The movie's opening comes at the most propitious time in history.  We need fantasy right now, Harry Potter and other vehicles are providing that...but it is hard to compare them to the sheer virtuosity of this movie's execution.4.  3 hours has always been a horror story to Hollywood's mass market audiences. But to anyone who has attended a screening of a really long movie like Bertolucci's '1900' 5 hrs+  or 'The Sorrow and The Pity' (almost 5 hours - depending on the version), 3 hours is NOTHING.  Movies SEEM to be getting longer these days.  But the audiences are not complaining as much as they once did.  This is a good thing.Frankly, at the end of the movie...I just wanted to go ON AND ON.5.  Every actor, every scene, every effect is believable. Despite the more than generous mix of sets, real outdoor scenes, created outdoor scenes and mixtures of these, one's beliefs are never jarred from the Tolkein-Jackson fantasy world.6.  The Howard Shore music (which suggests some measure of doom by adapting the most famous motto in history - second only to Beethoven's Fate Motto from his Symphony #5 in Cminor - the DIES IRAE (Day of Wrath) theme from 'Office of the Dead' from the extensive catalog of Gregorian chants) - uses music and sound and not just Super-compressed FOLEY sounds (which are OVERUSED these days to a fault instead of music in order to shock audiences into an artificial level of frenzy)...to evoke true suspense and excitement.7.  Elijah Wood - proves that no other actor could have portrayed Frodo (even if the 'book Frodo' was much older).  His performance is astonishing in the breadth he exudes with the economy he expends.  His eyes are among the most expressive I've seen in a long time.Elijah has always taken the more interesting and unflashy parts during his surprising career. But in each role I have seen, he has brought deep human emotion and a strength found ever so rarely in the more flashy actors. This is not to deride as Speilberg's choice of Haley Joel Osment as Frodo. Quite simply, Haley would have been just too young and though his talents seem limitless to us now, Elijah just IS FRODO.Thanks to all involved in the making of this masterpiece.  The world cannot wait for the next two!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Bring the Magic Back to Movies,"Seeing ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" made me feel like a kid again, bringing me back to 1958 watching ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" with Ray Harryhausen's heroic special effects.""LOTR"" claims its rightful place as one of the founts of inspiration for ""Star Wars,"" with its conflicted good guys up against a growing stronger evil -- that resonates in a post-9/11 world as it must have for Tolkien post-WWI and concurrent with WWII (and eerily like HBO's ""Band of Brothers"").The cast of Brits, Americans and Antipodeans (including obscure favorites of mine from Brit TV and indie movies) team up amidst special effects that are thrilling yet comprehensibly old-fashioned.In terms of comparing it to the book, I'm one of possibly two or three Baby Boomers who didn't read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" until this month (and will wait to complete the rest of the cycle in time for the following two movies), so I was both fresher to the material and less fanatical about it than some, including clarifications of some bits that I had misunderstood in the book.I appreciated some of the telescoping of details (such as combining the elf princess Arwen, as played by Liv Tyler, with a legendary princess' love story) and missed others (by leaving out Tom Borondil and his mate the River's Daughter, the brightness of nature is left out, making for a darker movie than even the book). The endless exposition in the book is handled well, as both voice overs and through flash-back demonstrations. The final DVD will include deleted scenes.Particularly well-handled is graphically showing the tempting danger of the Ring's evil power, on others and on Frodo -- a key difference in the mature themes of ""LOTR"" in comparison to ""The Hobbit.""I was disappointed that the songs and mythic poetry were barely replaced by Enya's hardly noticeable background music.(originally written 12/29/2001)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
You want more after 3 hours,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring would make the late author very proud. It is extremely well done with a great cast of actors. There are not enough female roles in this story and it is a great story. Who would have thought that Sean Astin grew up to be a hobbit from his days as a ""goonie"" and Tobey Maguire who was best known for his role in the Ice Storm as Mike. Now he is the star of the film. He plays beside the wonderful attractive Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, the magnificent Christopher Lee as the dastardly wizard gone arye, Sir Ian McKellen as the wonderful charming gandalf(Sure he could play Macbeth and Shakespearan role but he certainly can play his friend, Dame Maggie Smith, in a Saturday Night Live appearance. He was just perfect and now he plays with his action figures. Then there is wonderful Sir Ian Holm (Just imagine two Sir Ians on the set, what are the chances). The film is about 3 hours and after all that there is still more and you want more.

I have raised my rating after Rings of Power,"After watching Rings of Power, I have new appreciation for Peter Jackson's work. This work always has translated JRR Tolkien's vision of the characters and the book. It also reproduced the Hildebrand art work that was approved by the Tolkien estate and which grew to be synonymous with this work in my mind. They superbly casted all of the characters. The direction and the story boarding of the movie reflects and respects what was happening in the books perfectly in my mind. I was completely satisfied at the end of this move. So much so, that I went to the opening midnight showings of all of the following 3 movies.It must be said that Rings of Power had cinematography and costumes that rivaled the Peter Jackson work, but without the superior interpretation of the original material it is an inferior work.I may sound harsh in this review, but I read the Lord of the Rings on my own while an undergrad going to college. I did this because I understood that JRR Tolkien was writing and creating a new piece of mythology like those that have come down through the ages in a writing style befitting such a work. It is a great allegorical story for his time and is worth reading and understanding lest we forget the lessons of the past.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The beginning,"I am a fan of the book. I admit it right here in the beginning. I have also been waiting for someone to turn the books into a movie or movies since I first time saw incomplete animation by Ralph Bakshi.Then some years ago I began to hear rumours, that a director from New Zealand, Peter Jackson was about to take on this task. The name wasn't unfamiliar to me: I had seen his previous movies, Brain Dead, Bad Taste and The Frighteners. I didn't know what to think. I did like the movies, but then again he was a splatter movie expert, not fantasy.Then I watched them again, and I saw the visual tricks and camera usage he had achieved in those little films and I became more confident. The subtle fantasy elements in Brain Dead convinced me of his abilities. But still, I was little afraid: could he pull it off?Then, sometime later, after hours of studying rumours and leaked photos in internet I and my friend finally got our hands wrapped around the tickets, tickets to get us in one of the first viewings after the premiere around here where I live. My throat was dry and I was anxious to see the final product.Couple of hours later my friend and I left the theatre mesmerized. It had been more than we expected, light years above anything we'd seen before on the screen. We spent hours talking about the experience and we came in conclusion, that if the quality of the first film were a promise from things to come there wouldn't be anything to worry about.Besides of the stunning cinematography, music and special effects there are amazing actor performances seen all over the film: Ian McKellen as Gandalf, a wise old wizard who is leading the fellowship through perilous journey. Sean Bean as Boromir, son of Denethor, steward of Gonodr. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, corrupted head of the wizard's council. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, son of Gloin, a dwarfish warrior. Billy Boyd as Pippin and Dominc Monaghan as Merry, two loyal friends of Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Samwise (Sean Astin).Only two actors I didn't immediately fell for were Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, or Strider if you will, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. There wasn't anything specific in Bloom's case; the part just wasn't a huge acting part, mainly just looking pretty. In Mortensen case I was little bit distracted by his, perhaps little too calm at first, portrayal of Aragorn. But I got over it.The special extended edition didn't bring anything crucial to the movie, just some scenes adding more depth to the story, like the journey of the elves, where Frodo and Sam see the elves travelling in the forest, going towards the Grey Havens, in order to leave the Middle Earth.Fellowship of The Rings was and is extremely good start for the one of the most stunning trilogies of the movie history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
remarkable,"Epic fantasy/adventure is a lavish, breathtaking adventure for all ages. A young, innocent Hobit named Frodo (Wood) is entrusted by friend and wizard Gandalf (a well-cast McKellen) to protect a cursed ring of unspeakable persuasion and power. Determined to keep the ring from falling into the wrong hands, Frodo forms a trusted alliance with Middle Earth's most skilled warriors to go on the journey of a lifetime and destroy the ring before it's too late. The film is long, but it creates a genuine sense of awe and wonder with mythical monsters, rousing battle scenes, and remarkable effects. A fun, magnificent journey to be enjoyed for years to come. ***½",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Poor narrative choices and pacing kill a monster of a movie,"Off the bat it must be said in Peter Jackson's defense that the Lord of the Rings is simply too large and sprawling a tale to condense into even three three-hour films.  While I have read and enjoyed the books, I am in no way a LOTR fanatic, and was more than prepared for changes to the book in order to streamline the story. That out of the way, The Fellowship of the Ring makes some bizarre narrative choices which ruin what could have been a tremendous accomplishment.For some reason, Jackson and company have decided to spend far too much time on the build-up to the forging of the actual fellowship.  A good half-hour is wasted in Hobbiton, and the slow trek to Rivendell eats up a good hour and a half of screen time.  This part of the film lags badly, and is equally hampered by some poor story-telling decisions, such as: why is Saruman suddenly working FOR Sauron?  If you're going to add more to Arwen's character, why make it so sudden, random, and pointless?  And most importantly, why undermine the mystery surrounding Aragorn?  This last point is the most egregious error, in that the actual lineage of Aragorn is in question through the original trilogy, whereas here it is one of the very first things we learn about him.By the time Jackson gets to the actual journey of the Fellowship, he has run out of screen time, and so the actual traversing of Middle Earth's painstakingly described landscapes is condensed into several swooping longshots cut back-to-back.  There is no time to become attached to the Fellowship before their eventual break-up.  This is a serious story-telling error on the part of the filmmakers.  It is here, during their travels, that there was an opportunity to flesh out the cast of nine characters, as well as divulge the exposition surrounding the origin of the Ring of Power more fluidly and naturally.  Instead, Jackson has decided to cram the entire backstory of the Ring into a very awkward and hoky prologue.Other pet peeves which are more subjective are the irritating overuse of slow-motion and the heavy-handed urgency which is given to every scene (thereby undercutting any actual dramatic moments as the story reaches its climax).  The film's score is dreadfully overwrought and completely washes out the incredible sound design.  Astoundingly there are points where it even drowns out the dialogue (not that this is a bad thing, considering much of the chatter that goes on).On the plus side, most of the acting is quite good, esp. Ian McKellan as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam Gangee, and Sean Bean as Boromir.  Many of the other characters suffer from underwritten parts, and Cate Blanchett is given very little to work with as the Lady Galadriel.  Most of the settings are beautifully rendered, although there is a bit too much CGI at work in many of the larger sequences.  A necessary evil in most cases, considering the scope of the books.Overall, the film was a big let down.  There is a breath of hope for The Two Towers, however, inasmuch as the characters are split up, which should allow for personalities to develop unhindered by the sheer number of characters onscreen in this first chapter of the trilogy.  While expectations are now tempered, I have faith that the two follow-ups in the series will at least be enjoyable romps.  Still, given the efforts put into The Fellowship of the Ring, a few smarter narrative decisions could have made for a breathtaking spectacle.  Pity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Don't tell me to read the book. I shouldn't have to...,"I feel compelled to offer some dissent for this mistakenly lauded, and often drooled over catastrophe of a film. Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the book. While this may offend those of you who keep a copy under your mattress, you must understand that by releasing this as a motion picture, it must be able to stand on its own as one.My largest complaint is just that, the writers did absolutely nothing to prepare this story for the screen, other than relying on a gifted cinematographer and production designer to carry the weight. I felt every minute of this story as if it were being read from the pages of Tolkien's umpteenth printing by a four-year-old. The dialogue is slow, awkward, and unjustly sentimental. To someone who has not read the book and doesn't have the pretext of the characters and their motivations, the lines are just as mystical as the glowing ring that every one scampers around in fear of.Other than the spooky horsemen that chase around Frodo the cowardly protagonist, I simply could not find any reason for these middle earth misfits to do what they did. And if you don't find the scene where they all get together under ""Agent"" Hugo Weaving's direction and decide who's the bravest pussy in middle earth absolutely corny and remedial, then you just weren't listening. I'm still not sure what was less convincing: the ridiculous lines or the misdirected attempts to act them.After three hours, and having lost complete sensation in my ass, they have the audacity to end the movie when things are finally starting to happen. At least Star Wars was sufficiently independent in each of its chapters. I didn't have to wait three years and pay $24 to get a coherent story.On a positive note, I have to give credit to the DP and his aesthetic capture of New Zealand. Well done. Seeing your photography was the only aspect that made me feel value for my money. That applies to the inhabitants of New Zealand as well. Thanks for letting us expose your country to the world. I only hope that the leagues of trench coat-wearing D&D players flocking to your ports will spare you from the middle earth references they're dying to make.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

22 years later and still breath taking,"22 years after its original release date I finally had the chance to see Peter Jackson's original lord of the rings epic on the big screen as a special run of all 3 director's cuts at our local cinema.I've been waiting this long as the first time around I was busy being a new Dad so this chance was just a must!Now much to the annoyance of my wife I already own all possible versions on DVD and Blue-ray and watch them at least once a year , so to say I'm a fan is putting it mildly 😀
Now getting to sit and watch them as they were made to be seen on a huge screen in comfy seats , bucket of popcorn 🍿 in hand was thrilling
If you've not seen this film by now
What planet are you living on?Secondly why are you reading this and not busy watching Lotr's Fellowship of the Ring?This movie is one of the top 10 movies of all time in my opinion
Even 22 years on and on a a big screen the special effects still stands up to modern releases and of course the story line the film is adapted from is the definition of a classic novelThe only real shame is the movie is a snap shot of how films should be and not as modern Hollywood is today churning out substandard epics that deserve the love and attention spent on this movie by its makers and it's amazing cast of actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A gargantuan filmmaking achievement,"Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry.  His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres.  If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise.  He now owns the second highest grossing film in history.  Talk about a Cinderella story!This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson.  It took eight years from inception to completion.  He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out.  Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two.  They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three.  He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record.Jackson's task was daunting.  He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books.  Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task.  Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand.  The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay.The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic.  The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre.  The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes.The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar.  Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo.  Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer.   Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf.  With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast.  He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range.  He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo.  Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power.Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon.  Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible.  In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day.  Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins.  Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age.This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone.  By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books.  Still, at three hours, it never drags.It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal.  It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages.  One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released.  I rated it a 10/10. It is motion picture history in the making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

For the record .....,"When I began to write this, there were 4,053 registered user comments on this film. I doubt that anyone will ever read this, but as an avid IMDb user, I feel like it is almost my duty to register my comments.I loved this film. I had not read the books and it mercilessly left in the dust, but no matter. from sheer craftsmanship and filmmaking, it can be enjoyed. The special edition DVD is a must own.There is so much skill, care and (yes, I'll say it) love put into this film, that it is hard not to like. It requires a knowledge of the books, but that can be gained. Peter Jackson set out with a nearly impossible task of bringing Middle Earth to life and triumphed.I cannot call this in the all time top ten, but I think that in time, the three films will be viewed together as one of the most important event is film history. **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The last great epic?,"Where to begin? This film is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Full credit to Jackson for tackling such a project, and, more importantly, in pulling it off in spectacular style.Having read the books a couple of times throughout my teenage years (i'm now 22) I was dubious as to how a big screen adaptation would fare. Tolkien's rich worlds, mythical visions and superbly 'environmentalised' characters created such a rewarding tale, it was akin to being retold a campfire story about your ancestors! (Being English, and since most of this is widely sourced from pan-European pagan mythology, its no surprise Tolkien touched a chord)So, with expectations that I thought would never be realised I was truly stunned by this film. Jackson, the production team, the actors, everyone involved in making the film nailed it perfectly. My only detraction is that it wasn't long enough. I could've happily sat through 6 hours of this movie such is its charm, scope and masterful storytelling. This film doesn't rely on 'big explosions', it doesn't need a 'pretty boy' hero to carry it, in fact it is devoid of all derogatory Hollywood influences. What remains (on a Hollywood budget however) is a pure vision realised without compromising its integrity.And that is perhaps where the film really excels, Jackson shamelessly allows the characters to indulge in sentimental wisdoms that were long ago discarded by mainstream thought as 'traditional', 'old fashioned' dare I say, no longer relevant to a modern, western society. Each persona in the film feels like they carry a history behind them because they haven't been forced to comply with politically correct standpoints. Which has left it open to being criticised by some nay sayers as racist and right wing. All I can say to these people is that if they are worried by the aspirations of creatures as noble and humble as Hobbits, then perhaps their ideas about those of us who aren't afraid to express our love of tradition, should re-evaluate THEIR ignorant and close minded viewpoint! Anyway, enough of this, back to the film!The plot progression and character development work and intertwine wonderfully, and makes me wonder why other films often lack such subtleties. Perhaps Tolkien's writing and Jackson's accomplished directing skills have made this possible, neither willing to take a shortcut if it means damaging the works overall consistency.The Fellowship Of The Ring is my personal favourite out of the trilogy, the transition from innocence to burdened responsibility is handled so deftly and seamlessly, things never feel they have raced forward too quickly without being explained properly or accounted for. Admittedly Jackson was forced to leave out some key areas of the book, Tom Bombadil notably being an absent character, but with the wealth of material that does makes it to the screen, I think you can say it balances out any omissions.The film really does encompass a vast array of themes. The action sequences, unlike so many films, actually have a sense of immediacy about them. You know these encounters aren't just here for our enjoyment to watch, they are but one of the many challenges faced throughout the film. The relationships that evolve between the characters makes you embrace them even more as identifiable entities, as opposed to just vehicles for the plot and action to progress. The story fully immerses you into its own world and nothing seems childish or fake. Since most fantasy films have derived themselves from Tolkien's original works, it is only fit that this movie, with Tolkien's vision intact, is perhaps the most believable example of the genre we will ever see.Sadly, I think this will be the last set of films to ever achieve 'epic' status in every sense of the word. I cannot see their being such a film like this ever again, its a small miracle it was commissioned at all with the risk involved. But more acutely, its doubtful that someone with Jacksons passion and vision will ever be married to such delightful, original, and enthralling source material.So, to those who haven't seen the film, or who have dismissed it, I would urge you to at least give it one try and appreciate this is not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a story, which takes you on an incredible journey the likes of which, may never be seen again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Breathtaking fantasy epic with incredible choreography/cinematography, acting, directing and more - best in my opinion","If you're going to separate these films into three parts like they were released, as much as I adore all three, with them all getting a 9.5/10 or higher from me personally, I would have to give the upper hand to instalment number one, The Fellowship of the Ring - a marvellous, beautiful, stunning achievement and one of my favourite films of all time. Glorious, triumphant, epic, and just bedazzling. It is nearly absurd how incredible the battles are, how amazing the acting is, the directing is on its own level, and the writing of course excellent. I don't actually think I read the books in school, however I did read one of the books in high school, as well as the Hobbit. Needless to say I love the book, but as a film fan, personally the films do it even better for me. And I really love original work. But this is just a tremendous thing to behold. Despite it not having the newest effects, a little outdated, they look amazing in their own right and were perfect for these films and looked superb back then especially. The films take fantasy to new heights, the film is exciting, heartfelt, ambitious, and extremely engaging, having you evokes and catching you in its net from the the opening moments. I am particularly fond of the characters in these LotR films, especially the Orcs, Uruk-Hai, the Hobbits, and characters such as Aragorn, The Nazgûl, Gollum, etc. Sauron is another. Every time I watch The Fellowship of the Ring I'm engaged, captivated, and have a truly wonderful and by all means definitely fun time. It is an exquisite movie that is near unmatched. I would have to say act two and three are perfect, but the beginning is also great and I love the Shire. Regarding LoTR FotR, the design/set locations/scenery/lighting and concept of this film and its characters are all just... they're something, seriously. They are on a completely different kind of tier. It's fantastic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Awesome movie,Big fan of the book - I felt this movie started a little slow but found its pace and turned into a spectacular telling of The Godfather of fantasy books. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is fantastic. The costumes and sets and props are all spectacular. Builds a real container that the dark lord Sauron sought his ring of power and the complex web of heroes and villains who took action to help or hinder his pursuit. It's solid fantasy that pays tribute to the source material. Magnificent.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
the best films i have seen yet,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. I liked the effort put into the make-up and costumes. I liked how they combined so many emotions into the movie. There's the feeling of love and passion, which is obviously potrayed by Aragorn and Arwen. There is the feeling of the tension and then followed either by relief or (most of the time) greif. when Gandalf fought against the Balrog, that was the tension in the movie and as well in the audience, then the slight feeling of relief, then the feeling of emptiness inside if you, like your insides have shrivelled up to nothing. There is also the feeling of dread and regret, most of the time potrayed by Frodo. He sees no hope to his endless last. I really liked how they used Merry and Pippin as the comic relief in this movie. In my opinion, this is the best movie to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Perfect Adaptation,"Most who've seen Jackson's Lord of the Rings recognize it as a masterpiece, a near-perfect adaptation, and perhaps even a life-changing experience. Certainly a once-in-a-generation cinematic achievement. The film perfectly captures the tone, narrative style, and depth of worldbuilding of J. R. R. Tolkien through meticulous attention to detail, clever insertions of original dialogue, masterful props and practical effects paired with revolutionary, yet modestly implemented CG effects, a memorably soundtrack, and a love for the source material that simply seeps out of every frame.Jackson's entire LOTR trilogy is a treasure, but Fellowship is the undeniable crown jewel, one of the finest films ever made. What sets it apart from other installments in the fantasy genre to make it the greatest of all time?1) The Source MaterialAlmost every other installment in the modern fantasy genre is heavily derivative of Tolkien's work. Given that Fellowship is the perfect adaptation of the source material, the only way to make a better fantasy movie would be to have better source material. Good luck finding any.That said, I think Tolkien's passing benefited the film's chances of success. While he lived, he was inclined towards harshly criticizing adapters for the slightest deviations from his 'lore'. There is a version of the live action LOTR films that would have had Tom Bombadil and all the other silly, unedited digressions from the books, or that would have based its artistic style on Tolkien's watercolors instead of the much more visually captivating works of professional illustrators John Howe, Alan Lee, and Ted Nasmith.2) Love of the Source MaterialEvidently, the filmmakers weren't just cashing in on a proven franchise like modern adaptations. On the contrary, they were taking a massive risk because fantasy film up until that point had been a flaming mess. The creative directors and the crew at large had to have a lot of faith in and reverence for the source material to make a good movie. PJ approached the project in many ways like a documentary, wanting to capture the essence of the source without injecting his own tangential messaging.3) The Necessity of Practical EffectsThis can't be overstated enough - CG has ruined modern fantasy and historical film. In its current state, it is a time- and money-saving shortcut that produces worse results than practical effects. The harder the industry leans into CG, the worse movies are getting. The creativity that comes with having to use practical effects on a budget is totally lost when you can just hire a CG firm to use the latest software suite with at least theoretically infinite range. CG makes actors act in a void of undefined dimensions, their movements always perfect, lacking the subtle imperfections of the real world. Practical effects obviously don't guarantee a quality result - it's a risk, but you have a chance at greatness. CG is a cheap and reliable road to mediocrity which was realized in later LOTR films.Even before the LOTR trilogy was through, CG was rearing it's ugly head and becoming problematic for Jackson who started leaning hard into the latest tech as soon as it became available and the second and third movies suffered as a result. By The Hobbit it was game over. Fellowship is a masterpiece in no small part owing to the fact that PJ had no choice but to use practical effects.4) The Perfect Storm of InvestmentGiven the shoddy state of 90's fantasy film, the planets really had to align to bring in as much investment as PJ got for these films. This may never happen again, especially given the current trends towards the use of AI and CG in writing and production.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

More than anyone could have hoped for,"As one of thousands (if not millions) of people who harbored a Tolkien obsession in their youths, I anticipated the Lord of the Rings films with both excitement and dread. It's hard to remember now, but back in the year 2000 most of the world thought Tolkien's magnum opus was unfilmable. It took a hobbit-like, New Zealand native horror comedy director to prove them all wrong. Some fans were quick to point out the flaws, the deviations made from the source material, but for anyone who actually loved the spirit and the atmosphere of the novels, Peter Jackson's films were more than anyone could hope for.A decade later, with the initial excitement, hype and backlash died down, it's easier to see these films for what they are, both the good and the bad. And while they're definitely flawed, and they definitely deviate from the novels quite often (a necessity), they're also - and I say this without second thoughts - the best mainstream films of the previous decade. When considered as a standalone creation and not an adaptation, they're excellent works of cinema, perfectly balancing a fast, energetic pace, impressive special effects that have aged shockingly well, exciting action scenes, great dramatic acting, immense amounts of pathos and drama and just the right amount of comic relief. Jackson also managed the singular achievement of using the trilogy format to the films' benefit; not since the original Star Wars trilogy has there been a trilogy of films in which not one disappoints, each one expending over the previous installments (in stark contrast with the Matrix - which was released around the same time, and in which, it grew gradually clearer, the creators had no idea what to do with the sequels).The problems the films had are mostly derived from the difficulty of filming at such a large scope. Deviations from the original are mostly excused; ""No Tom Bombadil"" seems as ridiculous a complaint, in hindsight, as ""Organic web shooters"". The writers did a spectacular job of removing just enough and changing just enough to make Lord of the Rings work (spectacuarly well) as a work of cinema. My biggest complaint is about lack of characterization and background for some of the supporting character, mostly Boromir, Gimli and Legolas. Boromir was reduced to little more than a villain, though Sean Bean was good enough to give him the kind of depth and humanity the character should have; Gimli and Legolas were practically comic relief. The acting was so good all around, though, that it's hard to notice. In fact, no fantasy casting website could have put together a better cast, and nobody stands out as a ""weak link"".Lord of the Rings is probably the only case in history of a series of films where all entries do nothing but compliment each other - no complete shift in genre (Aliens), no gradual declination (Matrix), no anticlimactic third installment (The Godfather, Back to the Future). For that reason it's hard for me to compare the three, though Fellowship of the Ring has a special place in my heart, because it was the real shocker - it was the crucial point in time when we found out Tolkien could be filmed after all. Every film in the series has its weaknesses and strengths - The Two Towers has timeless scenes with Gollum but some much slower ones focusing on Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas; Return of the King has lots of pathos, but relies too heavily on huge battle scenes and has one of the most disappointing endings in film history. But taken all together, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most solid, most entertaining, most wonderfully impressive and memorable, most epic films ever made, and that will never change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Tolkien Comes Alive!,"Director Peter Jackson remains pretty faithful to the text, feel, and character of the novel of the struggle for Middle Earth.  Amazing detail and state of the art special effects make a world like none other seem to magically come alive before our very eyes.  Filmed in New Zealand, the film boasts some incredible cinematography.  The acting is good all around with Ian McKellan really standing out as Gandalf.  The film also gives the great Christopher Lee a good-sized role as Sauramon letting him showcase his obvious talents and still impressive voice.  The film hovers round the three hour mark, but it goes by fairly quickly.  A truly creative look at the work of Tolkien.  The anticipation for the next two installments surely should be great if they are made with the same amount of care, cost, and consideration employed in this gargantuan film undertaking.

Over Rated,"Like Amber-14 from Sydney, Australia. I am so tempted to give this a 1/10 just to restore some balance. 2nd best movie of all time? Please!! Now I would not put the Godfather at No1 and any list is subjective, but this is a good list very eclectic, it contains virtually all Kubrick's films most of what you expect to be there and current favourites that hang around the top for a while. The star wars films appear in the right order and my own Top choice is at 25 this week `12 Angry Men'. That is what lists are about, debate discussion, who put that there etc. No LOTR is not a bad film well made great acting, but it is not complete. I have not read the books so I have to start from that premise. But not since Back to the future 2 has a film ended with such contempt for an audience, we all know that there will be sequels but end the film and explain why the other 3 walked away. The editing was poor I got dizzy with all those fats cut fight edits and boy were there a lot. Even some of the SFX were poor the crumbling steps was horrible, although a lot of the blue screen art was good. What bothers me most was the invincibility of our heroes, it was actually a pleasure to see Sean Been perish. There was no explanation as to the inconsistency that he wouldn't march on Morodor with 10,000 men but would with a wizard , Robin hood Super Sword and 5 pygmies. Not since most of  Arnie's adventures have you seen a trained Army struggle to hit the target. I go along with the complaints about length and characterisation, this was a good Saturday night distraction, but for 3 hours loose a couple of battles and put in some Plot!

The Quintessential Fantasy Film of All Time,"It is difficult to convey in words what a phenomenal achievement Peter Jackson's LOTR movie trilogy is. It manages to stay relatively faithful to the source material while providing a big-budget entertainment with suspense and spectacle. In fact, it often does so many things right one can only be puzzled at how it humanly possible to achieve anything like it.One should probably need no explanation of why Lord of the Rings is such an important work as book to the world, and why a movie version of it is such a big deal. Some have ascribed the very existence of the modern fantasy genre to Tolkien. In the very least, his book has been highly influential in creating the standard fantasy story setup, and has been hailed as a literary classic ever since its publication. This, of course, mounts huge pressures for any director attempting to make it into a film, something this movie not only manages to achieve, but to excel.The prologue starts of things strongly, and nails down perfectly what the Lord of the Rings is about. What I was worried would be a long and boring explanatory scene for those unfamiliar with the book, was actually one of its fortes. One can only imagine how many re-writes and deliberations the production team has gone through to achieve such a smooth result. What in an ordinary fantasy movie would be the epic finale is only the beginning, and a textbook example of how to do one right at that. Yet even that is only first of the numerous examples of scenes that can serve as textbook examples of how to do a scene right!Against these high expectations set by the beginning, the rest of the movie manages to hold up brilliantly. Scenes move seamlessly from one another, panning from one location to another, transitioning from one shot to another without even noticing. Care has been taken to ensure that each detail is careful though out and emphasised. Such groundwork may not be immediately appreciated by the viewer, but the more one delves deeper into the constitution of the movie, the more one notices the silent effort that holds up the movie together.In visual terms the movie is yet another amazing achievement. Rugged, open landscapes dominate the scene and impress the viewer. Tight spaces and corridors feel claustrophobic and frightening. Visual filters and color palettes are appropriate to each scene and enhance the magic of the locales. The lushness of fields and forests contrasts wonderfully with the grayness of caves and dungeons. The natural beauty of New Zealand is at full display, especially enjoyable on a wide screen.Scenes would not be as dramatic and impressive without the presence of epic and music by Howard Shore. It helps to elevate the tension of action to the heights it deserves, while providing tranquil serenity for the more peaceful scenes.Acting in the movie is not just a step up from other titles but on a whole another level to most productions. Each and every emphasis of syllable and intonation of voice is carefully thought, calibrated and practicised to fit in with the whole. Whatever magic formula the directors have used to extract such phenomenal performances from the actors, it works brilliantly. It helps that the cast is composed of amazing actors, including such legends as Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett.If you choose between theatrical cut and extended edition would be recommend the latter, as it includes more scenes. Especially the scene Concerning Hobbits, which should have been included in the theatrical release.That being said, there are, as always, some very minor details to complain about, that were changed from the books, like replacing Glorfindel with Arwen, or how Tom Bombadil was left out of the movie, but frankly, most of the choices are understandable and help to propel the plot forward. I have seen the movie so many times I know all the dialogue lines by heart and have committed the order and visuals of the scenes to memory, so any criticisms I have will likely be minor and mostly irrelevant to the enjoyment of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A brilliant film,"I was sceptical going to see this movie, thinking it couldn't possibly live up to expectations. I was also afraid I would be disappointed if it didn't stay true to the amazing novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, which is one of my favourite books. However, I was pleasantly surprised by not only how true it was to the book, but how well done it was. The acting was superb, the costumes and scenery were perfect, (scarily, just how I had imagined them, it was like the film makers read my mind), and the story was extremely well done. Even though it was a long film at around 3 hours, it didn't seem long at all and the script writers managed to keep the main storyline while omitting the ""side stories"" which are in the novel, and which would only make the film complicated, confusing and far too long. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and I cannot wait to see the next installment. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out in Australia for another 6 months.

A,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent,"Yesterday, I received this film on DVD. I had already seen it four times however at the cinema. I was not disappointed, and I did not expect to be. Having seen programs previewing the film, I saw how much Peter Jackson loved the books and also how much some of the actors loved them also. And so if people loved the stories so much, they would not dare make a trilogy of films without making them top-notch.I have spoken to very few people who have not liked this film. Most of them claiming it was too long or it had boring bits. There were no 'boring' bits in this masterpiece. I think what they were referring to were the not-action parts i.e. character building.The acting, from everyone is of a very high standard and his extremely believable. Especially that of Elijah Wood as Frodo.The overall appearance of Middle-Earth and it's people was amazing. Every conceivable detail was taken into account by Jackson and his team. Nothing was out of place. Even the extras had perfect costumes.The SFX are second to none. And at many points it was hard to tell what was real and what was not.Some people would also claim that the film is too long. The film HAD to be long, I would've complained if the film had been shorter than it was. Three hours was essential to get as much of the story in as possible (I would, however, have liked to have seen Tom Bombadil) and to build up the characters for what is going to happen to them.From start to finish this is excellent.

Painful,"I can't believe how many people love this movie - I have never been closer to walking out of a movie before.  It was slow at the beginning and I kept waiting for it to get exciting, or at least interesting, but left wishing I could have the last 3 hours of my life back.Some of the scenery was breathtaking, but it was obvious that most of it was done using a blue screen.  The acting, the special effects and the plot were all awful and I often found myself laughing out loud at how truly dreadful it was.This movie just drags on forever.  The entire plot could have been adequately explained in about half the time.  My friend who saw the movie with me left for 45 minutes about an hour into the movie.  In talking to him afterwards, I realized he hadn't missed anything of importance from being gone that long.Probably the worst thing about the movie was the ending.  It's like the director just arbitrarily took a knife to the reel and said, ""Okay, that's a wrap for the first movie.""  I knew going in that this was only the first part of a trilogy, but surely they could have come up with a better ending than they did.  I can't even say it was anti-climactic, because there was nothing exciting leading up to it!Maybe I expected too much from the movie after seeing all the positive reviews but it fell well short of my expectations in every conceivable way.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This movie is an instant classic,"This movie is an instant classic, this year marks the 20th anniversary of this movie. So, I thought it'd be the perfect time to write a review for it! When it comes to fans of the Middle-Earth series (both movies and books) there is one thing most of us can agree on, that being that Peter Jackson basically did just as much for J. R. R. Tolkien's stories as J. R. R. Tolkien himself. This movie has aged amazingly well in my opinion, the VFX & SFX both hold up today. FOTR is the perfect first act to a three-part story while telling a fantastic and well fleshed out story itself, it has the perfect mix of whimsical and dark fantasy. It handles nine lead characters beautifully without taking from the primary story at hand, it gives each of its leads a moment to shine and gives most of them complete individual story arcs. If you're a fan of the books who's never seen the movies, or a fantasy movie fanatic who's never seen the movies, or even someone who's read the books and seen the movies it's worth watching (for the first time or a rewatch). This movie trilogy is one of those rare occasions where something that should've been impossible became a colossal success, this poster boy of the heroes' journey shows what can happen when you are passionate enough about something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

""It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish,"" someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.""The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm"" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable ""Lord of the Rings"" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well.

Perfection,"The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is one of the best movies of all time. Peter Jackson's perfectly adapted premier of his Middle Earth is truly stunning. Everything about this movie is amazing. Every character is perfectly cast with standout performances from Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen who build upon already amazing characters. The technological feats this movie was able to pull off are also stunning. From using insane practical effects to groundbreaking CGI at the time and incredible props/makeup alongside highly detailed miniatures, this movie was the definition of innovative. Jackson does a great job of setting up the world and characters while never feeling rushed or too slow. It's easy to see how influential these movies were in pop culture by the effect they still have to this day. With The Lord of the Rings being one of the most acclaimed stories ever told, Jackson's debut entry into this world was flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Fantasy Epic,"Note: this is a review of the extended edition, which includes about 11 minutes of additional story material.Not much more can be said about Peter Jackson's adaptation that hasn't already been said. It is one of the most successful (critically and financially) film franchises of all time. It has superb performances from all of its cast members. Exceptional special effects that still hold up after twenty years. Stellar set design, costume design, and musical score. The plot of a band of all races of Middle Earth teaming up to destroy the One Ring of Sauron is unforgettable.This is a must watch movie.

Spectacular adventure,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", the first movie in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, is a spectacular movie epic in every way. This film succeeds in all departments: acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, art direction, costume design, music score, sound, and special effects. You name it. The big name cast that takes part in this outstanding motion picture includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Ian McKellen, and Christopher Lee. They (along with others) play characters that were originated by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of ""The Lord of the Rings"" books, and brought to life by director Peter Jackson (who shot this and the two ""Lord of the Rings"" sequels simultaneously in his native New Zealand). This, along with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", stand head and shoulders above all the other 2001 movies. But I don't want to say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best movie of 2001 yet. Right now it is (with ""Harry Potter"" at #2), but there are still a few other 2001 releases that I want to see that I haven't seen yet (like ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Gosford Park""), so probably a month or two from now I will know for sure if this terrific fantasy/adventure will finish on top as my favorite movie of 2001. But what a fantastic movie this was.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This really is something special,"Let me start by saying that I've never read the books. During my childhood I belonged to the legion that read the works of Tolkien's friend and rival, C S Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles.  They got my imaginative juices flowing and I stepped over Tolkien's work.  The films came out and I had been aware of Peter Jackson's work but with all the furore and lack of money at the time I held back from seeing it for at least two months. Eventually I watched it, enjoyed it but it didn't set me on fire.  My favourite scene, Boromir's last stand, lingered in my mind and over time the desire to see it again grew.  The DVD came out and I looked forward to sitting down with my to brother (who had not seen it) to watch again.Wow ! 2nd time around this thing blew my mind.  Whether it was because I then knew the story and could enjoy the characters and appreciate everything else I don't know but it just rocked my world.  I was like a love sick pup with a constant smile on my face enjoying every scene.  I tell you this tale to qualify my praise and make clear that I wasn't a tolkien fan from the start.Peter Jackson has opened my eyes to this world.  I don't know how faithful he's been (and I don't really care) but you can tell from the passion involved and the love heaped on this film that he takes it seriously and is not out to make a fast hollywood buck.  I purchased the normal DVD and recently got the extended version which is even more fantastic. I don't feel cheated and owning both is worth every penny.The film itself is great.  The characters are rich and full, well written and well acted.  I can't really say I have a favourite but Gimli definetly comes out better in the extended version and I am looking forward to seeing his developing friendship with the others and his painfully sweet adoration of Galadriel.  The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn is very well played, again displaying real depth and makes Boromir's sacrifice and Aragorn's renewed faith in man all the more powerful.  In fact the film deals with the whole range of human emotions and knowing that they will be developed even more over the course of the next two films just warms your heart. The action scenes are great and with real time invested in the characters you feel all the more tense and involved.  The world Jackson has created is lush and wonderful with special effects serving and enhancing but NOT dominating the story.  The musical score is perfection, complimenting the film at every turn.  Indeed my favourite scene with Boromir owes much of it's brilliance to the beautiful music that accompanies it.  I am wrapped up in this world and although desperate to see the next two am also slowly savouring the whole heady experience.  For those that haven't got it I cannot recommend the extended version enough, it takes what you love and just adds more.In summary this film is a joy to watch and Peter Jackson's direction and story telling is assured and confident.  For the first time ever I'm preparing myself to enter a theatre and observe two films without any thoughts of whether I could have done it better.  I have total confidence in Peter to deliver what I need to see and knowing his cast & crew's passion for the project I know they will deliver.  It took me time to appreciate this beauty and elevate it to my favourite all time film but sometimes you have to step back and look again to observe real genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The perfect beginning...,"I must admit, I had never heard of the books when I first saw the trailer of this movie. The trailer just captured me, and i made a note to see this movie! I actually ended up walking in freezing temperatures to catch this flick when it was released on the big screen. I left the theater in awe of what I had witnessed, I was inspired! This was a fantastic beginning to the trilogy. The characters were given enough screen time to understand and support them through the rest of the trilogy. The visuals and effects were really nice, and the score was just perfect. The Mines of Moria was perhaps the best part of the film. Its environment was well captured, as it effectively created an eerie feeling.The movie passed like a breeze, despite its long running time, which was essential to capture the aura of the movie. The ending made everyone want more and set things up nicely for the other two sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Certainly a unique blockbuster,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThere's certainly a lot going on in the big budget movie adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.It's main themes are of good vs. evil and how power corrupts.As for the cast,Elijah Wood does a tolerable English accent,Ian McKellen is his usual wise old-self (this time working on the side of good,unlike in his previous X-Men),Sean Bean is eager to impress and Ian Holm has a good leading role as McKellen's friend.The special effects,as expected,are pretty fantastic.However,as the movie wears on,the concept with the rings becomes increasingly far-fetched.However,the movie's main problem is,quite frankly,the length.The movie loses any sense of structure towards the end,and ends suddenly and abruptly.The movie doesn't leave room for a sequel,it requires one.The audience let's out a really surprised gasp at how the end credits begin rolling at a point when they think the film's just going to carry on.But overall,it's pretty fine and you're in with the crowd if you've seen it.***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A solid story-driven movie...,"When ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was originally released back in 2001, it took me three or four attempts to get through the movie, as I found it to be massively boring and unappealing. Which is odd, because I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons since around the mid-1980s.Then I got my hands on the extended version in 2020, and decided to sit down and watch it again. Perhaps I have matured since 2001, because I found the movie to be much more enjoyable this time around, despite it running for close to four hours. Sure, it was a long ordeal, but enjoyable none the less.The characters are well-rounded and they have a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform the various roles in the movie. And I am still amazed with how the visual effects team managed to make the hobbits and dwarves small in size in comparison to the elves and humans. But it worked so nicely in favor of the movie and the fantasy atmosphere of Tolkien.This is definitely a story-driven movie, so it might not have appeal to everybody, especially those hungering for more action.The visual effects in the movie were great, and the Nazgul were impressive.If you haven't already seen ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", it is definitely a movie you should take the time to sit down and watch.My rating for this movie is a seven out of ten stars - or rings, if you will.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
It's simply not that good,"Sorry, but it really ISN'T as good a film as it's been made out to be. After seeing it shoot straight to the top of the IMDB charts, my immediate thought was that fans of Tolkien (or should that be zealots of Tolkien?) had already made up their minds to vote 10 out of 10 before they'd even seen the film. I was challenged by many people on this point, and having seen the film myself, I now know that I was right.I can't say it enough, it simply isn't that good. At three hours, I found myself dozing off a number of times, and having to bring myself back to watching the film. The characters themselves were a mixed bag. Aside from some of the earliest scenes involving Frodo, Gandalf and Bilbo, those three did very well. Some of the comments on here seem to make them out to be gods, which isn't right, but they were definitely well above average. The other characters, aside from Samwise, were really not as good. They were so underdeveloped that I came out of the film not knowing the names of the majority of characters that had been in it.The action itself was again above average, but still nothing spectacular. A lot of the computer generated stuff looked like large blobs of play-do, and some of the make-up etc. on the monsters was truly terrible. Some of it was absolutely ludicrous (the wizard's fight takes the cake there). And what was with the ring? Did the book state that we had to have a close-up of it every two minutes?As most (zealots) may have guessed by now, I haven't read the book, and many claim that's why I didn't like it. My answer was, since when do you need to read a book before seeing the film? Do you normally need to read a film's script before watching it? Even so, much of it was predictable. Basically, after the opening, it was fight/hide from the baddies before moving onto the next part, then fight/hide again before moving on, then fighting and hiding again. And it goes on. And on.... for three hours.It's all very straightforward. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there isn't a lot more depth than that. The one double-cross can be seen straight-away, because the double-crosser looks very evil from the first time you meet him. There've also been a couple of jokes added in..... at least, that's what I read on here, I actually missed them during the film.I've often read comments that state 'scenery and costumes were nice' and frankly, I totally disagree. Costumes aren't that good because they basically consist of rags for the most part, and the scenery once again, while nice enough, just isn't anything special.I know of course that someone is going to read this comment and disagree with everything I've just said because 'Lord of the Rings is the greatest film ever.' I agree that it certainly is an above-average one (from a critical point of view anyway), just nowhere near the top 3 status of IMDB. As for the ending, yeah it was expected, but with any trilogy, each part of it has to tell its own story, rather than just be a part. Sadly, that wasn't the case in this film.5.5/10Frankly, the fact that it is so over-hyped and that whenever someone tries to say something bad against it, all the zealots rise up together and immediately rubbish that person's point of view, have made me hate it deeply, and it was difficult not to put a much lower score.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Personal views on lotr fellowship of the ring.,"I went to see this film the first day it came out not for all the hype but because i love the Tolkien books.No body could create the same world on screen as it is in the book but Peter Jackson did a great job.There was action,sadness ,comedy and a bit of romance.My wife and i were on the edge of our seats my wife had tears at the sad parts and also laughed at parts.The computer graphics are very good the cast is almost perfect Elijah wood is in great form especially at the snow scene at how tired he looked very good.All the cast were good especially the main ones.I can't wait for two towers ,fellowship of the ring is the slower part in book so i am very excited about two towers.my last words are this was the best 3 hours of entertainment i have ever had 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Cinematic history in the making,"The very idea that the same guy who directed Braindead would one day become Cecil B. DeMille's and David Lean's heir must have been the source of much of joy and laughter. But the first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy proves that you need pure, fresh, unadulterated talent if you are to tackle a challenge such as bringing a dense, 1200+ pages, beloved, impossible to adapt literary masterpiece to life. Peter Jackson and his renegade team of mostly unknowns (up to that point) pulled off the biggest gamble in film history that could have easily sent New Line to its grave a few years earlier than it did. It sets the trilogy to a great start, staying true to the original and communicating all the grandeur and darkness of Tolkien's Middle Earth.

Nearly as good as it could possibly be !,"As a long term reader of the Books, I readily agreed with the ""experts"" that said a possible movie would be too limited for the material.When I viewed it, my first impression was that the Director put his heart into it.  Nearly everything that was cut out was necessitated by the confines of the films length. The whole picture had that quality/""the money's on the screen"" look and feel.   My only reservation was the added scenes with the women characters. I hate pandering to any audience. Logically though, if most deleted scenes were added back in at the time, they too would need to be shortened.  Sometimes one needs to be satisfied with what you get and how good that is, rather than anguishing over something lost.All I can say as a wrap is :  They said it couldn't be done !  It is !

Faithful and Satisfying,"I have been a fan of the trilogy for years, and FotR has always been my favorite volume of the series.  I was initially skeptic that this movie could bring to life on screen the images in my mind.  I was completely wrong.  From the smallest detail to the grandest epic sweep of the camera, Peter Jackson's movie translates Tolkien to the big screen magnificently.Be warned: this is a translation, and not an exact one.  Jackson has excised the non-cinematic material, tightened the time frame of the story, and made innumerable other alternations.  These changes do not distract from enjoyment of the movie, however, at least not in my case.This film is a great introduction for newbies to the world of Tolkien, and a fun and exciting ride for the experienced.  I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind leaving our world for three hours and experiencing the magic of Middle-Earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"An example of excellent craftsmanship, but no art.","Pros:Huge scale - it was meant to be.Attention to visual detail of environment, characters.The mood of solemnity.Against:Ill-conceived attention to detail: someone came up with the idea that it would be fitting if the hobbits had bitten and dirty fingernails, so the camera shows those fingernails for ten minutes to let everyone see exactly how much attention to detail they were paying (this is one example among many).Boring and pretentious. This is supposed to be a monumental and serious story, the shots carried out with flair, but the director went ""a little"" overboard. Scenes that are completely irrelevant are forcefully shown as monumental and take up a boring 10 minutes (something like ""They go, they go, they go, the next one goes, the next one goes, with this one looking around, they keep going, going, going..."").Related to the above is the lack of balance of the plot: very important things from the book are omitted, unimportant things take up 3/4 of the film.Selection of some of the actors. Here one can write at length, I will limit myself to the least polite aspect of this problem: Several female characters in the novel are described as absolutely, wonderfully beautiful. Some of the actresses playing these roles.... Well, maybe it's a matter of taste. But it is possible to find women that EVERYONE in the world would find beautiful, there was no need to choose ones whose beauty would be appreciated by connoisseurs with a particular taste.The characters of some of the characters have been changed, what hurts the most is making fools of several of them.All in all - the film will probably appeal to people who haven't read the novel and who appreciate the wonderful visual effects. For me, it is wasted money for which a masterpiece could have been created.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
good film overall,"What I really liked about that film were the characters and their personalities, especially Frodo. He was portrayed really authentic and I liked how you can see his development through the film. Besides, I pretty much enjoyed how Frodos and Sams friendship was presented on their journey.Also I really enjoyed the different settings, I think they were very well made for that time and the sound was great! The brilliant settings in combination with the strong sound made many scenes feel kind of epic to me.The story is creative and entertaining however at some points it was a bit confusing to me and I did not really get everything. This was probably why their journey felt a bit too long for me, which made the film slightly boring after a while even thought there were many exciting scenes.Overall I think its still a great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
great movie adaptation of a truly challenging work,"I probably can't heap any more praise than has already been offered on top of this film.  It is simply wonderful.  And I say this as a Tolkien fan who has read the books at least a dozen times since the fifth grade. (I am 34 now.)Of course there were cuts to be made.  LOTR is not a cinematically constructed novel.  And I don't mind how Peter Jackson made his cuts and changes.  Obviously there isn't going to be long exposition about the myriad of historial references to Middle Earth.  Peter Jackson managed to capture the essence of the story without sacrificing much.  Of course, like many Tolkien fans, I have a list of things that I wish were different.  But none of these really detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.Glad Bombadil didn't make it into the script at all.  The ONLY important fact of the journey from the Shire to Bree was the nature of the swords that the hobbits recovered from the barrow after Bombadil rescued them, but even that is probably too much info to try to explain in the film narrative. Bombadil is a great character, but his involvement is isolated and contributes nothing to the development of the rest of the story after he and the hobbits part company before reaching Bree.  Better he was left out all together.I also didn't take issue with the lack of seeing Legolas and Gimli becoming such great friends in the first film, mainly because the bulk of that happens in The Two Towers.  If Jackson downplays it there, then it will be worth critisizing at that point.Arwen? Didn't really bother me.  She is making up for the loss of a couple of minor characters (Glorfindel, Elrond's sons who join the battle later on).  And if her romance with Aragorn can be played up a bit instead of acknowlegded but invisible as it was in the novel, it will make for a lot more dramatic tension when Eowyn's obvious liking for Aragorn twangs a few unrequited heartstrings later on.If I had to list the films weakest points, I would mention the following:I didn't care for interpreting Merry and Pippin as mostly comic relief. I can't image that Peter Jackson won't correct this in the upcoming films since they play important parts in the development of the war.  But I wish Jackson has preserved SOME of their original motivation.  Merry, Pippin and Sam knew of the Ring from their years of friendly spying on Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandalf, and when they came to know how important and dangerous it was, they were determined to help Frodo ""through thick and thin.""  Making them funny, accidental companions didn't do their characters much justice.  I really missed Pippin telling off Elrond when Elrond declared he was against Pippin being part of the Fellowship.  ""Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison or send me home tied in a sack.  Otherwise I shall follow the company.""  Brave words from a truly devoted friend and much preferable to his rambling, comic speech in the film that I think should have disqualified him from going on a mission to save the world.Not enough Lothlorien and Galadriel.  The special edition DVD is supposed to correct this. I can't wait.I thought the time spent on the collapsing staircase scene in Moria could have been devoted instead to more plot and/or character development (like Merry and Pippin).  Not that it wasn't exciting and well done, but with the Balrog in pursuit this additional 3-4 minute action sequence invented solely for the movie could have easily been dropped for important things that actually happened in the novel.But despite these flaws, a truly wonderful and awe-inspiring adaptation of a very good story that is hard to adapt.  My hats off to Peter Jackson, the cast, and crew.  Can't wait for films two and three.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Now I am Convinced Its A Masterpiece,"My Rating: **** out of ****.The first time I saw this film in the theater, I really did not see what the big deal was. I mean I liked it but I was a bit bored while watching. The second time I saw it, I liked it much better but I still did not find it to be the masterpiece everyone said it was. Well, the third times the charm. The movie shined like it never had on the previous viewings. Its a masterful piece of filmmaking.I will be honest, I have not read the Lord of the Rings books. Also, Fantasy has rarely interested me. I mean I read the Harry Potter books but by the end of the third book, I was tired of them. I may read the Lord of the Rings books sometime in the future but it won't be something I will be terribly excited by. If I read the books, it will be because the movies have improved so much on repeated viewings (except for Return of the King which I was only able to see once).The Fellowship was extremely successful when it came out. 13 Oscar Nominations (won 4 of them), Grossing 860 Million Dollars Worldwide, and I don't know how much its made on DVD. Thats pretty damn good and the amazing thing is that its the first part of a hugely successful trilogy.Its hard to say what works best here. Everything is blended to perfection(or close to it). Peter Jackson's direction is stellar. He paces the film perfectly by never rushing anything. When it wants to exhilirate us, it does. When it needs to take its time, it does. The action sequences are also masterfully executed. Jackson said his dream was to do Lord of the Rings for the screen. Well, it shows in every frame. Although Jackson is not the best director around, it would have been a huge mistake for any other director to do Lord of the Rings. His achievement here is masterful to say the least.Technically, Lord of the Rings is flawless. Sets, Costumes, and Make Up(which won the Oscar) are perfect. The Oscar Winning Cinematography is stunning (I need to go to New Zealand soon). The Visual Effects are some of the most impressive of the 21st Century and were damn well worth the Oscar. The Sound and Score(which also won an Oscar) are also top notch.The cast was well chosen. Elijah Wood is effective as Frodo. As is Sean Astin as Sam. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd do nice jobs as Merry and Pippin. Most of the actors do effective jobs but there are three standouts. Ian Mckellan turns in an excellent performance as Gandalf. Ian Holm(who has always been a top-notch actor) is completely credible as Bilbo. Finally, Christopher Lee makes a perfect villain as Sauruman.The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing accomplishment for everyone involved. Jackson has crafted a masterpiece that is already being considered a modern classic. Jackson has every right to be proud of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One film to rule them all,"In my opinion, this is the single greatest film of all time. The worldbuilding and character development is simply unmatched. 10/10 without a doubt",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the greatest fantasy films of all-time...,"The first installment had its moments and yes, I was wowed and thrilled by seeing one of my favorite novels come to the big screen. However, FotR didn't exactly leave a lasting impression on me unlike, for example, Platoon, where I would always remember the message it brought to me... sort of like a novel. FotR, to me, was more like a spectacular fireworks show.The plot behind the story is simple and Jackson and his group did a very good job transmuting what was in the novel to a screenplay. I don't know why some people complained about the ""complexity"", or didn't understand the purpose of the characters or the plot. How much clearer can Jackson make it without smacking you all in the face and telling you to wake up? It's about a ring, a very powerful ring, crafted by a evil menace. That evil menace lost his ring, and now he's back to reclaim it, but it's now in the hands of an innocent Hobbit. That Hobbit goes to Place A for advice, meets a myriad of characters all of whom describe how evil and powerful the ring is, and now he must go destroy it. Jesus Christ, this isn't quantum physics here.In any case, the movie does a more than adequate job portraying Tolkien's world in oh, 3 hours. It's a monumental task and I'm sure Jackson has spent many a sleepless nights pondering what he could use and what he had to throw out from the 600 pages of the original novel. The sets were done flawlessly (Khazad-Dum ranks as one of my favorite scenes) with the amount of CGI and excellent directing and lighting, and it provided a real and genuine fantasy feeling unlike the schlockfest from Attack of the Clones. My only gripe would be the characters themselves. All of them, decent acting, but the decision how they were going to be relevant to the story... well... that's my gripe. Examples, Jackson's poor handling of Boromir's death scene, the lack of the Broken Sword story with Aragorn, and Gimli's 180 of character from the novel. Regardless, it didn't detract me from thoroughly enjoying most of the movie.I am eagerly anticipating for the Two Towers based on the second novel, IMO, the best of the trilogy, this winter.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The Greatest Show on Earth,"What I appreciate most about ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is how, from the very beginning, it sits you down and just starts shamelessly pummeling you with the story of the rings and Middle Earth. There's this cool confidence evident in all of it, like the film is alive and believes in itself.The opening montage, the prologue that explains the history of the ring, is as good an excuse to not walk into a movie late as there has ever been. What follows is, in terms of modern filmmaking, a revolution. Peter Jackson leaves nothing to chance. He doesn't believe in the saying, 'you can't please everyone.' His first installment of the trilogy makes sure a good time is had by all. It's the ultimate in film entertainment.""Ring"" has the inside track to not only get nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but to win. Like ""Gladiator"" last year, ""Ring"" is the greatest overall achievement in filmmaking of the year. Its only legitimate acting nominee would be Ian McKellen, who deserves a Supporting Role nomination. If not, there is a precedent for films winning BP without any acting nominations. ""The Last Emperor"" did it in '87. Before that you have to go waaay back to the 50s for ""Greatest Show on Earth,"" ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" and ""Gigi"" to find others who accomplished this feat. It hasn't happened much, but it could happen again this year.Grade for ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"": A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Simply Delightful,"When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this trilogy almost fifty years back, it became a milestone in the history of Fantasy Literature. Most of the later fantasy writers that emerged were inspired by this masterpiece which critics consider as one of the greatest adventures of all time. And when Peter Jackson announced the making of three live-action movies based on this trilogy, much talk followed.And thank goodness that the audience was not in the least disappointed when The Fellowship Of The Ring was released by New Line Cinema, for this movie, though some consider to be too long (nearly 3 hours), marked the beginning of a completely new trend of film-making. Jackson has beautifully illustrated peril,thrill and action, alongside with emotion, friendship and love - a combination absent in many adventure movies that only figure thrill and action.Though those who love extreme action may not be satisfied with this movie, it is, overall, a masterpiece - a great movie of a great book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Pathetic.,"This film was over-hyped rubbish and a COMPLETE letdown. I almost fell asleep when I watched it. Right, so this film  has excellent special effects and nice scenery; that doesn't make it a good film. It's 3 hours long and glacially paced. Many of the characters I found to be extremely annoying, including Gandalf, Frodo and Sam. Frodo's feminine tone is enough to drive anyone insane. The elvish dialogue with subtitles is laughable and all of the actors play second fiddle to the special effects.The performances are wafer-thin and Elijah Wood is shrill and bland. His performance is wooden. Then the film just ends midsentence........ thanks but I don't want to go to the cinema next Christmas to see what happens. If there's as little plot development as in this installment, its sure to be as boring and disappointing.I think the media frenzy surrounding this film was completely uncalled for. It's not that good of a film. In fact, it's awful. A real turkey in my humble opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The soul, the smell, the unique spirit of the book was perfectly re-created. All characters are good.

A good movie,A very nice movie. Actually I liked the movie very much. Its a unique creation of director and writer.Sometimes its magical sometime its action. It also show us massages. It has three series all of them are amazing. And Its other parts Hobbit also a good movie. I will advise all to watch this movie once. Many of us may not like the beginning. Be patient. wait and watch full movie. Watch all the series then only you can understand the whole story. Its dialogs and script both are great. Graphics is also a nice. Story is strong and unique. Actor have performed their best. Some time you will find funny and sometime you will find sorrow. But I am sure you will enjoy this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Maybe not the best movie of all.....,"But the best fantasy film ever!!!!!!! This movie is the coolest. Elijah Wood does a great performance. At first I didn't know him, but now he one of the cutest actors I ever seen. I'm sure everyone agrees with me as the best fantasy film.

And the only other films to be equal with this one will be The Two Towers and The Return of The King.

One of the worst movies I have ever seen!,"After all of the build up leading up to this movie, I was vastly disappointed.  It was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Granted there were moments- like the beautiful villages of the Hobbits and the Elves.  Absolutely breathtaking.  But over all the movie was too dark and gory.  Much more so than the book.  The movie overrode the book in many places to have long, drawn out battles.  Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was something out of ""Carrie,"" it was too bizarre to be believed.  Casting 20 somethings to play 40-50'ish year old Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, et al.) also struck a jarring note.  Over all a very bad, highly unfaithful adaptation of a very fine work that deserved better justice.  I do not what the academy is thinking with all of it nominations!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.""","The beginning of the great Lord of the Rings epic. The ring of power is discovered in the hands of hobbit man Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), the title character and hero of JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", who then passes it to his nephew Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) pulls a few strings to bring together the various races of Middle Earth to join in a quest to destroy the ring. Along the way many will fall and many will live, but the fate of the world all rests in the hands of Frodo and his companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Joining them is a burned out ""ranger"" who is actually the heir to one of Middle Earth's finest kingdoms, Aragorn, AKA: Strider (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean) the troubled son of the Steward of Gondor, elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Ghimli the dwarf (John Rhys Davies!) and two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Billby Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, respectively). And don't forget Gandalf the Grey.A great long road movie of a fantasy that could easily have been made boring is kept alive by the direction of Peter Jackson, who didn't stay nearly as close to the books as the inept Chris Columbus tried to stick to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books but somehow delivered a far better film, capturing the spirit and humanity of Tolkien's work. Wood is sometimes annoying and sometimes endearing as Frodo, so I give him a 6 out of 10. Astin, Monaghan and Boyd are all fine as the other Hobbits. McKellan and Mortensen shine as Gandalf and Aragorn, with Bean working hard to make you sympathize with Boromir even though may not like him. Davies makes the most of his Ghimli role while Bloom has little to do except stand around and look pretty. Hugo Weaving really stands tall as Lord Elrond of Rivendell (far more engaging than his Matrix work). As for Liv Tyler as Arwen, well, to me Liv will always be Bruce Willis's slutty daughter from ""Armageddon"". Liv's work here is fine, but I do feel that they were kind of using her face and name as a battering ram to propel the advertising campaign. She isn't bad but it's a shame that she overshadows the work of Miranda Otto as Eowyn in ""TT"" and ""ROTK"" and that Christopher Lee, who played the loathsome Saruman with such quiet malice, was cut from the 3rd film whilst Liv was kept in.Great sets, great costumes, great props, great locations, and great music by Howard Shore. Don't miss Enya's ""May It Be"". Look for odes to the animated versions of Lord of the Rings here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Adventure on a Huge Scale,"The film that birthed a huge franchise, and for me this is easily the best. For me, the magic of something reduces the more you see it, and so future films just don't wow you in quite the same way. The slow building and exposition elements here are justified since it is our first taste of this world on screen.This applies to all the Lord of the Rings films, as they all have the same strong suits. The music is flawless. The film looks amazing, it's an absolute treat to watch. The world is perfectly realised and believable. Many of the characters are charismatic and fun, and all are performed well, by a very talented cast.Being the opening, this was the best suited of the three to be a film structurally. It's paced far better than any other, and keeps you moving through with evenly distributed character introductions, talky bits and big set pieces. I felt the early moments of this film featuring the Hobbits and the Nazgul were unique in tone for the franchise, and were filled with genuine menace. This film is also better humored than the other two, that are a bit more drawn out and harrowing.All in all this is one of the best blockbusters there has ever been, and perhaps one of the last truly impressive spectacle films if we keep moving towards CGI dependence which is much less work but also much less impressive.Nine out of Ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
It's About Time!,"This first installment of 'Lord of the Rings' blows all of the current and recent Hollywood crap out of the water. After being subjected to endless Michael Bay-esque rubbish for so many years this movie comes as a real breath of fresh air.This interpretation of classic literature is nothing short of astounding. The casting, especially Elijah Woods as Frodo and Ian McKellen as Gandalf, is 'spot on' not to mention the breathtaking New Zealand scenery which after years of Xena/Hercules abuse has finally had it's true potential realized.It's a shame such a clever example of the film-making craft can only be realized once the Hollywood big-wigs invest their money in a foreign director and crew. One can only hope this movie will encourage other studios to stop treating audiences as if we have an I.Q. of 3. Rubbish such as 'Pearl Harbor' and 'The Fast and the Furious' are an embarrassment to America. I only hope the more cultured nations out there don't judge us by the crap we export to cinemas around the world.Ten out of ten to Peter Jackson and team for such a brilliant interpretation of a brilliant story.

NO MORE WAITING. IT´S HERE!!!,"Let´s face it. This is something that a lot of us waited our whole life to finally see on a big screen. Jackson carried a real heavy burden of bringing Tolkien´s magnificent world to life. And, by God, he did. I mean, there are a few minor mistakes here, like: Liv Tyler should not, by all means, be with Frodo and the Nazguls in the river scene. She completely ruined the importance and the symbolism of gathering that took place there (it is what the whole movie is about: inner conflict of dualised forces). Sometimes it seems that Ralph Bakshi with his animated The Lord of the Rings understood better the abstract, mythological and philosophical aspects of the book. But, at the end, it doesn´t matter, ´cause Jackson blinded us more than effectively, with his brave and powerful vision. We can even forgive him Aragorn-Arwen romance plot. What else to say than: congratulations mr. Jackson! You brought us the most beautiful and the strongest imagination ever to be seen. By far, the best fantasy (and much more) in the history of moving pictures. You just can´t beat this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazing,"I, like many people, waited a very long time for this movie to come to fruition.  Granted, we have the cartoon from 20 years ago, which for its time was done nicely.  But looking back on it, it seems dated and at times painful to watch.  But to truly see a live action version of this was the real dream.  And to be blunt, this is 50 years of nerds, bookworms, and sci-fi and fantasy buffs waiting for this to come out.The general concensus seems to be for many people that they either loved this movie or hated it.  A great number of the people who walked away disappointed in this movie are those who have read the book and managed to pick out every single little tidbit that Peter Jackson either left out completely or changed.  Yes, sadly there is no Tom Bombadil.  Yes, there is no reforging of Aragorn's sword.  Yes, Frodo is not saved by Arwyn.  But when looking at this movie, one needs to remember a few things.  First of all, to be fair one must look at the movie objectively for what it is, a seperate entity from the book. And second of all, for all you pretentious nitpickers out there, this movie was not made for you and you alone, it was made for everyone.  Fans of the book and newcomers alike.  Did I want to see an inflation of the romance between Aragorn and Arwyn?  Not particularly. But did it ruin the movie?  Not by far, and it made a few romantic folks in the theater happy.  Just as I'm sure it gave the female viewers a kick to see a strong female character rescue Frodo amongst an almost entirely male cast.  So please, let up on the nitpicking and get off your blasted soapbox.Now on to what's good about the movie.  Where to begin?  Should I mention how visually stunning the Shire, home of the hobbits was?  Or maybe I should mention how frightening the Uruk-hai (a race of warrior orcs for you who haven't read) were?  The opening sequence and battle scene was superb, and gives the viewer who has no idea what he or she is about to see a quick back story so they don't get lost too quickly.  Visually, as a whole, the movie was breathtaking.  From the view of the countryside, to the snow covered mountains of Caradhras, to the Mines of Moria, the scenes were candy for the eyes.  Also, quite visually appropriate were the Elves.  They are just one of many signs that Peter Jackson did his homework for this movie.  The Elves are tall, slender, and quite endrogenous looking.  Many a girl walked away from this movie with a crush on Orlando Bloom who plays Legolas, an Elf of the Fellowship of the Ring.  And we see just enough of Gollum, the foul creature who craves the ring (and one of my all time favorite characters of literature) to tease us and await seeing more of him in the movies to come.The most fantastic part of this movie was the performances. Elijah Wood plays Frodo, a hero torn between his will to do good and his fear of failure in a performance that would make Mark Hamill jealous.  And for those of you who have complained that Elijah Wood is about 30 years too young, go back and read paragraph two again.  His companions are no less spectacular. Sean Astin reprises a role he does very well as the underdog and puppydog companion to Frodo you can't help but love.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monoghan as Pippin and Merry respectively, are quite amusing as Frodo's other two hobbit companions and provide much comic relief amongst a serious story. Boyd in particular, is hilarious, and I'm really hoping to see more of him in the future.  Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins gives much life and cynical wit to the old hobbit and gives a stellar performance.  Sean Bean, whom I myself was not familiar with prior to this movie played Boromir in an excellent fashion as somewhat of a tragic hero who is tempted and eventually redeemed in a very well done scene, that in some ways almost steals the show. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies, unfortunately do not receive nearly enough lines as Legolas and Gimmli, the dwarf, though make do with what they give very well.  Gimmli, in particular delivers some of the best lines of the movie.  His defiant statement of, ""Nobody tosses a Dwarf!"" had me rolling.  Even Liv Tyler manges to put on a good, if not beautiful portrayal of Arwyn.  I could keep praising several other performances of other actors such as Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving, but I want to save most of my breath for two in particular.Viggo Mortenson, as Aragorn, also known as Strider, plays the part with stride (no pun intended).  When I casted this movie in my mind, Mortenson never came to mind, but now, even when rereading the novels, I can picture no one else in his shoes.  His loyalty to Frodo and will to finish what he starts runs deep and is one of the best performances of the movie.But the real praise goes to Ian McKellan.  McKellan has long been heralded amongst the critics as one of the best actors of his time, though he hasnt received much name recognition. Though in my opinion, he deserves to have his name mentioned in the same breath as names like Alec Guiness, Gregory Peck, and Humphrey Bogart.  I've been a big fan ever since I saw him in Richard III.  And in this movie you will see why.  He doesn't just play Gandalf, he becomes Gandalf.  He brings every bit of character to the wise, brave, funny, and kind old wizard.  When you see him battle the Balrog, an unusually terrifying creature, and he plants his staff in the ground in defiance and yells out, ""You shall not pass!"" you will know why I praise him this much.Well I could keep going on forever but see it and judge it for yourself. And don't forget to leave your preconceptions and the door and simply enjoy this movie for what it is; a masterpiece that was long overdue.P.S. a note to George Lucas, if you are reading this, watch this movie several times and take notes.  THIS is how you deliver a promise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Of all the movies I have seen, this one will hold a special place in my heart forever.","I will not go into lengthy details about plot, nor will I bore you to tears with ranting about the beautiful scenery or the skilled actors.

No movie, except LOTR:FOTR of course.I've read the books countless of times and I know pages and pages by heart. When I first layed eyes on Hobbiton and The Shire I knew what I saw, it needed no explanation. I immediately knew the characters, even before they were introduced because Gimli looked and moved like Gimli, Legolas was exactly as he's depicted in the book and so on. That's just one of the things that makes this movie so great.After seeing the extended version, I must say: It should have been 3.5 hours long. 3 wasn't enough.But I'm a die-hard fan, if they had released 3.5 hours I am sure I would have said I wanted 4.

Classic fantasy movie,"Loved the books and didn't believe it could be done properly. Boy, how wrong I was. ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" has it all, of course ""The Story"", the ""Fairy-tale""-vibe in the beginning and plenty of action. So many layers in both book and movie. One can see that there's so much love put into. Quite unique in my opinion (watch the extra's and you know what I'm talking about). The casting has done perfectly. Director Peter Jackson has really done a perfect job. His vision brought us some magical moments, married with beautiful classical music. The special effects could have done better nowadays (but not at the time the movie is made), but the experience is nevertheless overwhelming.

"Despite it's many flaws, my favorite movie of all time","I love this movie. I watch at least the first half of it everyday and somtimes watch it and the Two Towers back to back. Having said that I have to say I am surprised at how shoddy the script and much of the production is. I am assuming that most of the problems with the film are Peter Jackson's fault, not Tolkien's. I did not notice most of the flaws in the film until I had watched it  a few times, but now that I have seen it 40 times, they stick out like a sore thumb.In simple production  flaws there are lots of instances where the size differences between Hobbits and humans are done on the cheap. They go by so fast you don't notice them at first, but the scenes between Gandolf and Frodo at Bag End are frought with size discrepencies. Basicly they depended on the real size difference between Woods and Ian McKellan, rather than special effects, but it is clear that Frodo is not half the size of the Gandolf, more like three quarters his size.The rings are a major problem also. Sauron made the ring for himself and wore it. Sauron was twice the size of a normal man, so the ring had to be twice the size of a normal ring. If Frodo is half the size of a normal man and has proportionately sized hands, the ring should be big enough for him to wear as a bracelet, not fit his finger. Also the ring is on a chain one minute and not the next. An example is when Boramir tries to take it from Frodo, it is on a chain. When Frodo shows it to Aragorn a few minutes later, it is not on a chain and after escaping throught the woods to the lakeside he stops and looks at the ring again and it on the chain again. This on a chain, not on a chain thing happens throughout the movie.Then  there is Gandolf's staff. When he escapes from Saraman's tower, he does not have his staff or hat, yet when the Fellowship leaves Rivendale he has both. What did he do go back and knock on the door and say ""OH by the way I think I left my staff and hat here, May I have them?"" Bill the Pony also disapears at times.As for plot problems;I am not sure if it is explained in the book, but Aragorn's presence at The Prancing Pony really bugs me. He seems to know who Frodo is and that he has the Ring and is being persued by the Ring Wrathes. How does he know this? Gandolf just found out about the ring himself and there in no communication between them since Gandolf rides off and gets trapped at Isengard. Gandolf does not seem to be telepathic, so how does Aragorn know what he knows. He is not just there by coincidence since he knows  too much about Frodo when they meet. Is there a missing scene with communcation between Aragorn and Gandolf before Gandolf leaves for Isengard?.Arwen is not the elf who saves Frodo in the book. It is a male elf who comes to rescue Frodo in the book, which seems more in keeping with the action. The scenes when Arwen enters and rides away to Rivendale with Frodo are a mess. Aragorn steps a few feet away from Frodo and the other Hobbits. As he bends over the kingsfoil a sword is placed against his neck and Arwen delivers a sarcastic remark about him being off guard. She then rides in a glow of light into Frodo's view. Since Aragorn and Arwen have a very serious, very loving relationship, I found it impossible that she would jest about cutting his throat.Also Aragorn was only a few feet away from the Hobbits and Arwen would have to be on foot to place a sword against his throat as she does. When she comes into Frodo's view Arwen is mounted and her horse takes several strides toward him indicating she was some distance away when he first saw her. Why would she remount her horse to go 10 feet? The timing and distances are all messed up in this sequence, not to mention the interaction between Aragorn and Arwen. Then Arwin takes off with Frodo like a sack of potaotos and is pursued by the Ring Wraithes. The action sequence here makes no sence when viewed a few times. At one point Arwen is many horse lengths ahead of the Wraithes and in the next second they are right  next to her. Also close ups of Frodo's face show him in a couple of shots with an Alice Cooper like make up job, lots of running mascara around his eyes and yet when Arwen reaches the river and there are more close ups of his face the mascara is gone. Obviously the director and make up people could not decide what the dying Frodo was supposed to look like, made several takes with and without the make up and mixed up the footage in editing. Sloppy!There are dozens more problems like this in the film.(Yet I have detected no glaring inconsistancies in the production of The Two Towers). My last observation is that when the fellowship is going through Moria and comes across Balin's tomb they stop, read the last chronicle and are atacked by the Cave Troll there was an open exit at he back of the tomb the whole time. Why would they stay and fight rather than just leave by the back way? I am not sure whether Tolkien or Jackson is responsble for this stupidity, obvioulsy for the sake of a big battle scene. It is clear that the exit that they run out of after they kill the Cave Trol is at the back of the tomb because of the shaft of light that illuminates Balin's tomb. It comes in through a hole in the back wall of the tomb. As they run out after the battle you can clearly see a shaft of light originating somewhere in the upper reaches of the hall and penitrating the tomb through a small square hole from the outside of the tomb indicating that they are exiting through that back wall. There is a view of a large hole at the base of that wall for a second or two as they enter it the chamber.That has to be their exit. Why bar the door and wait to be attached when they could have barred the door and just exited. Not sure if the shaft of light thing is a production mistake or is described that way in the book, but it is obvious that is was all done for thake of a big battle scene that logicly did not have to take place, but was needed for plot.(if they had excaped Gandolf would not have had his battle with the Balrock,died and been resurected).There are dozens of other inconsistancies within this film, yet despite these problems with both plot and production, this is my all time favorite movie. I never tire of it. The performaces are magnificent, especilally Ian Mckellan as Gandolf the Grey. I treasure this movie, yet I wonder how much better it would have been if they were not making three movies at once and had concetrated all of their efforts on this one.I mentioned that I do do not see the same kind of mistakes in The Two Towers.(there are some things I am not clear on in that film, like exactly how the Urak Hai are being reproduced. It seems like the Orks are grubbing them out of the earth like potatos, but that started in The Fellowship so that is just a conitued puzzle.) So Jackson clearly learned a lot from making this film and applied it to making the following two films. The Two Towers is rather dark for me.(Treebeard is my favorite character)but is a good film.I have not seen Return of the King yet. I am looking forward to purchasing the platimunm DVDs of all three later this year",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Hero's Journey With a Bit Too Much Worldbuilding Thrown at You,"This film basically takes the hero's journey and adds this massive world and large cast of characters to it (kind of like the original Star Wars trilogy). I'm not much of a fantasy guy, so I didn't have very high expectations going into this, and I think that showed throughout the movie. If you haven't read the book (like me), the world building is fantastic but at the same time there is so much of it that it gets a little overwhelming. Let me tell you by the end of the movie I still didn't know the names of half of the characters. The cinematography was really great, and the fight scenes were pretty engaging. The acting was also good, and it felt like all the characters fit this world. I feel like the best part of this movie was the characters, and the world building while visually was done well, as somebody who isn't really into fantasy and never read the books the world building was quite bombarding at times. The production value of the entire thing is great, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I feel like the heart of the movie with the hero's journey was the most engaging part, and I wish they would've focused on that more instead of tons of world building. I'm sure plenty of people would enjoy that way more than me, but it's just not my thing. I think that the movie was crafted very well which brought my rating up, but I didn't enjoy it as much as something like A New Hope, so that prevents it from getting a really high rating. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
ten pounds of ---- in a five pound bag,"I didn't hate this film, but I expected more.At worse I found it overblown, hard to follow and felt like I never had a moment to catch my breath.  After watching it I was left with a vague feeling similar to what you get from eating too much junk food, full but unsatisfied.   Too many sweeping vistas, overkill on the Frank Frazetta-esque beasts and baddies, and very little characterization.  Were it not for the very credible performances by the cast of top notch actors, there would have been none at all.One feels that the director Peter Jackson felt that he needed to cover so much ground (literally and figuratively) that he needed to jettison the quieter moments that make up so much of the great story.One of the best aspects of the Tolkien books was the reader feeling a sense of sweep and getting caught up in the quest, along with smaller moments of detail and quiet characterization.  The latter was sorely missing from this film.  All rush, rush, rush, with out any moments humor.  These two elements were what made ""STAR WARS"" and ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"", so great.  These two quest films, albeit in completely different milieus, were so much fun to watch, and ultimately so resonant for so many viewers because of moments of humor that allowed the audience a chance to reflect and also gave insight into the characters.  This film , with the exception of a couple of cutesy moments with Sam, Pippen and Merry and one line from Gimli, was largely humorless.I have a great deal of respect for Peter Jackson and his work. ""MEET THE FEEBLES"" and ""DEAD ALIVE"" were a couple of the funniest, most inventive bits of work to come out in a very long time and turned their genres (Muppet films and Horror) on their ear with a great eye to the absurd.  Likewise, he did a wonderful job with ""THE FRIGHTENERS"" and ""HEAVENLY CREATURES"".  I was hoping for the same here and was unfortunately disappointed.  I hope, now that he feels that he has set the stage with ""Fellowship"" that he will offer more depth and humor in the next two outings.One other thing, the film's design seemed to be just more of the same old Sword and Sorcery stuff.  ""CONAN"" mixed with ""NEVERENDING STORY.""  Blech!!!  There was even a small film that I saw recently from Spain called ""EL CORAZON DEL GUERRERO (THE HEART OF THE WARRIOR) that had far more interesting design for this genre.

Great!,"Lord of the Rings was amazing!Elijah Wood played great Frodo. He had acted greatly as sad, happy, etc. They all looked so real! The way they changed the sizes of the characters was very cool. They looked as if they were 4 or 3 feet tall. The animation was very good in fight scenes, creepy parts, and the strange animals.Climax, to me, was when Frodo(Elijah Woods) held out the rings & ""tested"" them. He could not trust anyone who would not pass. Keeping the story alive was held up by everyone playing there parts very well. As in being mean or nice when needed.Not much of an ending, but it leaves you hanging.Overall: GREAT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Just the Beginning,"This story was told very well. I felt like the narration in the beginning of the film was overdone a bit, but when the dialogue finally began, it was amazing. The characters are very original, though I would've liked to see more character development from some of the characters, there is no denying how well the actors know their characters. Elijah Wood was an excellent choice for Frodo Boggins. The world created through this film is amazing.Overall, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The best movie ever made and there's going to be more of it!,"When this hit the cinemas a bunch of my friends went to see it, but I didn't go and the reviews I got from them made me think it was either a bad movie or an average movie. So I finally decided to see it, I rented the extended dvd version and now I own it!Summary: I'll keep it short. In a distant time several rings were made and given to elves, dwarfs and mortal kings, but another powerful ring was made in the land of Mordor by the evil Sauron so he could rule Middle-Earth and control all other rings, but by accident his hand was cut off by Isildur, king of Gondor, who took ownership of the ring, not knowing that the ring had a mind of its own and it ended up betraying him. The ring, lost and forgotten was found first by... a thingie called Gollum, who the ring betrayed after keeping him alive for 500 years, and then it was found by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, a small person. There it remained in his pocket for some 60 years, but Bilbo didn't age a day, until one day he wanted to leave. In that moment his old friend Gandalf came to see him. Gandalf realised that there was something about the ring, since Bilbo had made himself disappear in front of a crowd. Bilbo left the ring, but Gandalf could not touch it, so it ended up in the hands of Bilbo's cousin Frodo. Gandalf discovered that there would be people who would come after Frodo and take the ring, so he sent Frodo and his friend Samwise on a journey to make sure the ring did not fall into the wrong hands. But the ring has started to long for the hand of its master... On their journey their are aided by Strider, a mysterious ranger, who they don't know if they can trust. When two of Frodo's friends Merry and Pippin join in on the quest and with black horsemen riding after Frodo, they put their lives in Strider's hands hoping he can help them, unaware who Strider really is. When they reach Elrond he isn't able to help them, but comes with the solution of taking the ring to where it can be destroyed. Someone has to go to Mordor to destroy the ring, and when Frodo volunteers, in total 8 others join him and become the fellowship of the ring.At first I thought the movie was far too long and it had too many things that we really didn't need to know, but after seeing it so many times, I keep questioning why they couldn't make it just a little more longer? My favourite character is Strider/Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, he is perfectly casted for the charming mysterious stranger no one can seem to quite place in the whole movie until the middle. In fact I like the entire cast, they were brilliant!!My rating for this movie is 10/10 and I don't believe another movie can top this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This is a fantastic fantasy film and just a start yet.,"The Lord of the Rings has changed the scope of fantasy films forever. The Fellowship of the Ring was just the beginning.This is a fantastic fantasy film and just a start yet.I have seen the trilogy 3 times and after nearly 10 years, I am revisiting the trilogy. Even now, if give me a thrill that is unparalleled. Now, I know what is going to come but still I wait for the unfolding. I am seeing this in awe and for appreciation of the caliber that was put in the making of these films.The fellowship gave details and the tone is perfectly right. There is a backdrop story that is explained so that those who have not read the book can understand what the story is all about. Why is the title named ""Lord of The Rings in the first place? Also, why is this part called ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".As we travel with the film, the mysteries and solved and we get a clear and bright picture of what the whole thing is about.I watch these films and am now revisiting them because in all these years I have not seen any fantasy film that has such great usage of graphics and keeps things real. The sky, the grasslands, the mountains, the marshes, the landscape everything seems real. Perhaps, all these exist in some part of the world today.The major part of the film was shot in Norther Islands of New Zealand and no film I believe I can capture or depict New Zealand's landscape as this film has done.Peter Jackson deserves all the kudos for translating a novel by the same name, into a near perfect film on celluloid.Perhaps, I will revisit this some time again. Till then 5/5. Thanks to all those, who made this film and this trilogy a possibility of such magnanimity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Epic all-timer, unreached these days","It's an amazing adaptation of the bible of high fantasy and probably one of the best movies ever made. The direction of Peter Jackson, the epic performances by almost every actor, Hans Zimmer's astonishing soundtrack, the scenic views of New Zealand, and even the very good-for-the-times CGI make the whole trilogy a masterpiece unreachable these days.My personal favorite is The Fellowship of the Ring, for it touches on the inception of the ring and sinks the viewer into Middle Earth with such a gentle, child-like romance.I wish more of these excellent movies were made in recent times. Hope is not lost, and I can't wait for The Hunt of Gollum to come out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Brilliantly directed trash,"In a world far, far away, a hobbit named Frodo got a mysterious ring that must be destroyed in order to stop the evil forces of Sauron. But the ring can only be destroyed in a volcano of Mordo. On his journey a wizard called Gandalf is assisting him...""The lord of the rings"" trilogy is an event almost to big for me to swallow it. But you just have to give it credit: it's really rare to find such an ambitious example of fantasy films with special effects that last for 3 hours. And it's messages about the abuse and corruption of power.-------The first film, ""The fellowship of the ring"", was a huge success: it was nominated for 4 Golden Globes and 13 Oscars, and on the site Rotten-Tomatoes.com it got an amazing critic's average grade of 8.1/10. Well, ""The fellowship"" really is a really good film, but after seeing it lately I couldn't hide my shock of how outdated it became in only a few years. That's mostly the fault of the terribly written dialogs, which look almost as if taken from some B film. The other problem is that the the story and it's characters lack a soul. They give an impression of a pale, mechanical puppet. Still, Peter Jackson is one talented director. Some scenes were pure genius ( like Arwen saving Frodo on a horse and creating a water army from the river that ""flushes"" away the bad guys ) and the set design is awesome ( cute hobbit houses ""digged"" in the ground ). That's why it's too bad that the whole film wasn't as good and warm as the magical soundtrack from Enya. All in all, I have to agree at some point with the brilliant director Peter Greenaway who commented on this film, calling it ""just a cynical exercise"".Grade: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Really Bad,"Before this film was released, New Line said ""We hope to beat Titanic"". John Rhys Davies said ""This is going to be the biggest film ever"". Ian McKellan said ""I cried the first time I saw it, you will too"".As the box office and the wave of indifference proves, they couldn't have been more wrong.Perhaps the arrogance of the film makers is one reason why so many people don't like this film. Perhaps that's why it hasn't broken into the top 50 of the all time ""adjusted for inflation"" chart.Me? I was just bored to tears. The story is very, very simple. A group of characters have to take a ""magic ring"" to a special place where it can be destroyed. Along the way, they run away from some monsters, then they run away from some more and this keeps happening right up until the end. Only there is NO end. The film just stops which of course is a cheap marketing ploy to make you see the next two.The script is awful. It's like watered down Shakespeare and some lines are such nonsense that there were a few groans in the cinema I saw this in. It also has a total lack of humor which makes it all the more pretentious.The characters are never fleshed out and some of them take on charachatures. Gandalf is the worst of them all. A caricature of Merlin from the King Arthur stories, he is so 2D he could have been created by Walt Disney.The direction is average to say the least and it seems that Peter Jackson has no real style of his own. Instead he borrows heavily from the likes of Tim Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"". The action scenes are very poorly done and so is the use of CGI.I wish I could talk about the score but I really don't remember it. The acting is reasonable enough but some of them must have thought ""what am I doing here?"" when they had to read such banal lines.Overall it is just a really bad movie. Never living up to the hype and, to be honest, never coming close. No matter how much the cast and crew tell you how great this is, the simple fact is, it's not.3 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Orks are cool mythical creatures,"I will admit Lord of the Rings is probably one of the best fantasy adventure movies of all time. However, despite that, it's just not my type of movie.Before seeing this film I had only previously read the fellowship of the ring in grade 7, then forgot everything that happened in it. Basically what I'm trying to say is going into this movie I knew there was a ring, Frodo and Gollum. Despite that, the movie was what I thought it would be, a good fantasy adventure film. In my eyes, it wasn't anything special. However, that may be in part because I spent every weekend for about two years playing DnD campaigns most likely inspired by these films and the books they are based upon.Now I have given my general opinion on Lord of the Rings, it's time to give credit where credit is due. Not only was the pacing so good that the three-and-a-half hour runtime felt like it was a crisp 2 hours. Along with the great pacing, it is undeniable that J. R. R Tolkien's world-building is transferred perfectly into this movie, from the set design to the costume design, it was perfect. I also think it is important to mention the characters. Frodo was captured perfectly by Isaac Wood. And let's not forget Samwise played by Sean Astin who was probably one of my favourite characters. Finally, I just thought I would mention that I would discuss this being one of the greatest book-to-film adaptations of all time however, I barely read the books so not only do I not feel qualified to talk about that, but it also just didn't cross my mind while watching.So with all of that said despite it not being my favourite, mostly because I'm just overall not the biggest fan of fantasy adventure films, I still think it is a great film that I would highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It traverses such a breadth of landscapes and has such clarity in its story development - seamlessly transporting the viewer from the sweet innocence of Hobbiton through the exciting and perilous journey towards the evil of Mount Doom. It is exquisite in every way.This movie also includes my favourite moment in a movie ever: the look on Gandalf's face when Froddo steps forward at Rivendell.How this movie did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture is beyond me.

"Great, but not perfect movie","Let me start off by saying Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a GREAT and splendid movie. It has a close eye on details and is so very consistent in its universe, making it almost impossible to compare it with other adventure movies (Star Wars might be an exception!). I haven't read any of Tolkien's books, but I have been told that it really follows the book nice, leaving some elements that would make the already 3 hour long movie into a 5 hour long movie.The actors haven been chosen carefully, no hotshot Hollywood actors, which was good. Elijah Wood was excellent as Frodo and Ian McKellen was great as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen also did a good job (well, I had to say this since he's from the same country as me).The special effects were fairish, neither astounding nor incredible. The action scenes were good, although sometimes confusing which was a shame; after all they did work on this movie for quite some time.On the whole, it's a kicksass adventure movie, one of the best in the genre of all time and a great start for the trilogy.9,5 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

May It Be,"I wasn't a big fan of Tolkien's work although I respected his achievement and scholarship (however tedious it might be to some of us).

Disappointed utterly....,"I saw this movie with great expectations and with an open mind. To be truthful there were some delightful moments in this movie. Namely I enjoyed the camera trick that allowed Ian Mckellen to tower over the Hobbits. I enjoyed Ganondorf entertaining the Hobbits, and I liked the unique angles that Peter Jackson used to show off his near three hour long spectacle. Before I get bemoanings that this is suppose to be the first part of a triology let me state clearly that I already knew that this is supppose to be the first part of a trilogy. Yet with all of my intentions of being an unbiased movie viewer I was truly disappointed by this experience. Firstly, I found this movie to be no better than the generic sci/fi, fantasy movie. Sorry to say it but I am never merely blown away by special effects. Effects should be part of the kinetics of an already well filmed story. Too many times in effects movies today the effects are used to wow audiences and to me are empty calories for my movie appetite. I found Fellowship of the Rings to be heavy in these effects. There were so many great actors in this movie. What really was the purpose of Cate Blanchet's character. I really thought she would be the movies' salvation towards the end but alas the actress who so marvelously portrayed Elizabeth was wasted as another piece of eye candy. Ganandorf who I believe to be the films best character found his uses depleted to that of the ""look out"" warning the Fellowship every step of the way. I really dislike when a movie puts arbitrary bad guys in only to be the fall guys for our heroes. This movie never took it to the next level and does not live up to the benchmarks of the movies it seeks company with in the imagination arena such as Aliens, The Matrix, The Terminator series, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and yes The Star Wars saga. Ultimately I do think I will see the remaining movies in this series. I would like to see if the series could redeem itself. I think the Academy embarrassed themselves{ with me at least} by nominating this movie for best picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Is there something I missed....,"Ok..b4 we get into this let me preface by saying I'm a HUGE fantasy fan. As a child I read loads of mythology and as I got older I got into fantasy novels, and yes, I even enjoy a good sword and sorcery flick.  When I first saw the trailer for LOTR a year ago my jaw hit the floor. I coulndt not WAIT to see this movie...and so a year passed. I came to the theater wanting to be swept away into the majesty that is Tolkein...I came wanting to be blown away and fall irredeemably in love with the film. Sigh...maybe I wanted too much.Now the film is not bad, not bad at all..in fact in all honesty I can say that it is prob among the top 5 films released this year(which may not m,ean much considering what came out this year)  Yet..I did not come away with a magical feeling..that warm feeling inside when u know u have had a truly good movie experience.  I came away  a bit fatigued(3 hrs is 3 hrs) and midly dissapointed.The good: overall, I'd say the cast is very good. Id aways thought Viggo was a good actor and he finally got a role he could shine in. Ian Mckellar was great as a somewhat vulnerable Gandolph and Ian Holm was delicious as Bilbo...he made a hobbit actually seem creepy. And the guy who played Samwise(the boy from the goonies) was actually good as well.Even Liv Tyler was impressive(though tolkein purists will claim she had no business in the book) and of course Ms. Blanchett did her usual best(with a narroly defined role).The bad:  the script- I just felt( and still do) that if you have read the books( and mr.jackson was admitedlly a HUGE Tolkein buff) you got alot more out of the movie. I think maybe he assumed a prior knowledge and relationship w/ the characters  cuz there was very little development of the characters and their relationships to each other. Thats why when a certain cast member died,..I really felt everyone was taking it a bit too hard on screen, lol.  Secondly, the dialogue could be on the cheesy side. Now, I know its Tolkein..but at least let me fall in love with the characters b4 u get all cheesy and sentimental on me...at least the two bumbling hobbits were there for a bit of comic releif.CGI- was it just me, or was the rendering horrible?  Cgi is always noticeable even if done well..but some scenes were just embarassingly bad. Also, the cinematography was not very crisp..I felt like I was watching the movie thru a haze the whole time. Now granted..the technical failings of the movie dont really bear much on how much I enjoy the plot..but still, for all the money spent..I dunno, I would have thought at least the cinematography would be good.pacing: point blank...when the characters weretn running for their lives..it dragged.  Since the script failed to get me involved with the characters, I just was blase at best about any reflections they may have . This was especially apparent at the initial 'meeting of the fellowship' scene. Suddenly there are all these characters  that have no discernable relationship whatsoever...yet, they all weep like babies when that certain cast member died...didnt make much sense to me. Now dont get me wrong...there were a few poignant moments( i liked the scene with sam at the end..touching....and Sean bean's charac too..touching) but to me..it was all disjointed...very little flow..I could never really sink my teeth into the film.So, instead of being ravenous for the next installement when the film finally ended..I left like 'well..maybe the next one will be better'. Now, I will say, it was alot better than Phantom Menace..I was never  just bored outright..but for all the hype and commotion..I was underwhelmed. Dont let fantasy/tolkein groupies lead u astry, its a good film..but not a great film and nowhere near as good as the first Star Wars trilogy. Sigh...everywhere that I go I read reviews of this nature..so much so that next week I shall see the film again and see if therw was somenthing I missed the first time-A.N.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all""","Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-03) is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time (perhaps second only to Sergei Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace (1967)'), and played such an immense role in my adolescence that the two years I had to wait to experience its conclusion were as painful as they were gratifying. I'm about to take you on a trip down memory-lane, so bear with me. I first saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' in late January 2002, long after everybody else I knew, owing to a family holiday that nevertheless allowed me to familiarise myself with Tolkien's primary Middle-Earth literature.I greatly enjoyed the novels, and have certainly re-read them since, but this movie was something else. I was immediately transfixed by its magnificent locations, exciting characters, epic scope, and, above all else, its attention to detail. Jackson's prologue gracefully traverses 3000 years of Middle-Earth history, settling finally on the halflings of The Shire, a race of little-people so satisfied with their quaint lifestyles that the goings-on of men and elves are of little consequence to them. It's this balance of the epic and the intimate that makes these films so special. Every time I watch 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I notice something different: the three frozen trolls of Bilbo's tale; the hobbits' hairy, shoeless feet; the glowing of Frodo's ""Sting"" blade whenever orcs are close.Each of the film's characters remain true to Tolkien's original stories. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are self-doubting but courageous, as yet oblivious to the roles they will play in shaping Middle-Earth's history. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) projects incredible power and wisdom, but it is infused by the weariness of an old man, the mental ravages of millennia passed. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a valiant wanderer, and the last surviving member of a shattered royal bloodline, an ancestry that seems to affirm his own downfall. Supporting stars Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, each contributing their own spark of personality into this magnificent world of fantastic creatures and terrific evil.Peter Jackson has asserted that his favourite film is 'King Kong (1933),' a prime motivating factor in his decision to direct his own excellent remake in 2005. Both films capture the awe and wonderment of their respective fantasy-worlds, though 'The Lord of the Rings' is even deeper entrenched in a sort of historical mythology, fuelled by a Tolkien legendarium that seems to stretch far beyond even the film's epic scope. We're all inspired by something. I like to describe myself as an amateur filmmaker, a hobby I've maintained for the best part of ten years. I'd already picked up a video camera by the time I saw 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in January 2002, but my prolonged enthusiasm for film-making came from the realisation that movies could be this amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Yüzüklerin efendisi,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Perfect adaptation,"Faithful to the source material. I consider the Lord of the Rings series as a trilogy (like one big movie) and together, I consider them perfect.

Masterpiece,"Perhaps many viewers will find it unnecessary, or even the theatrical version is enough to understand and enjoy the film. But personally, I don't think so, in the director's version you understand the situation of the characters, the plot, the event even more deeply. You must watch director cut versions of this trilogy. Also about the film: this film, or the rest of the trilogy in general, is the product of masters of their work. This is real art, real cinema. Casting and make-up are excellent and appropriate. You must see this trilogy, and of course the director's version, you are in for a journey into a wonderful world, it still captivates me after several viewings. An unforgettable masterpiece of epic adventure, battle, friendship and loyalty, love, tenacity, hope, courage and classic good versus evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Probably the best adapted movie ever!,"Years ago when I first saw this film, that too without any knowledge of the plot and without reading the books, I expected it to be a normal fantasy franchise with loads of CGI. But when I actually watched it, I was hooked to my seat and completed the 11 and a half hour trilogy in one sitting (Extended edition, mind it!). It is a kind of the movie that needs to be re watched time and again to be understood completely. I was so influenced with the films that I started reading about various characters on the internet and finally decided to read the books including the Hobbit. And then I realized how well adapted this franchise really is!!.The story begins with the introduction of the war of Sauron and the forging of all rings. The one ring which was thought to be lost is rediscovered and the Dark Lord rises again to re claim his lost treasure. An unlikely fellowship is formed to go on an unlikely never before held quest.Many critics criticize the length of the film, but after actually reading the books, one realizes it couldn't have been shorter. After every viewing it discloses something new, some references that were previously unnoticed and are a delight for the the book readers. Like the references to Smaug at the start, the undying lands Valor etc. The list goes on and on.It fairs even better as a stand alone film. If Tolkien was alive, Jackson's vision of middle earth and its characters certainly would have made him proud. With some excellent sets, locations and character designs and visual effects including sound and original score, it was probably the best film on a technical front in years. Each character constructed with minutest of detail. The Balrog managed to strike fear in the viewers eyes as much as it did to Gandalf The Grey. The fair Elves who are the most beautiful creatures on middle earth. The film has some extremely good cinematography.As the story itself is more of a adventure, thus it lacks character development and is less of a character driven story but more of an event driven. Also, there are many character so one can't focus on each of them for all the time. But traces are there in Gandalf's, Sam's or Gimili's characters which have been developed quite a bit. Ian portrays an awesome performance and he is ""Gandalf"".Direction: Excellent and flawless.Story/Screenplay: Couldn't have been better. Extraordinarily awesome.Acting: Ian was best, Sean was good. Others were convincing.Music: One of the best musical scores ever. It is haunting when it has to be, charming when it needs to be and fitting all the time. Shore has done an excellent job creating the score and incorporating it with chants which have a 'mythological' feel to them, just splendid.Probably the best possible start to an extraordinary trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Movie We Were All Waiting For,"As someone who read the book multiple times, this movie faithfully handled the story and stayed true to its roots. The casting was excellent and the editorial choices were made responsibly. I think Tolkein would've loved it.The production values were, obviously, outstanding.Having watched all of the series, I think we can all comfortably say that these films will stay with us for many years to come. The orcs are probably a little much for young children, but other than that, the films are wonderful for almost all ages.I highly recommend the entire series to anyone who loved the books! Wonderful!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One ring to rule them all...,"Fool of a Took- n. Anybody who considers Lord of the Rings to be a disappointing, or ""bad"" movie.Reasons to go see LOTR:1. Unlike movies where you've only been waiting for the doomed character to just die already, such as Titanic, or Autumn in New York, you'll find yourself with tears in your eyes as Boromir gallantly keeps fighting until the third arrow finally strikes him. You'll share the tear that Aragorn shamelessly allows to fall down his face. Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen perform with real emotion, just like the rest of the characters in the duration of the entire film.2. Terror that will leave your adrenalin pumping more than in any horror movie you've ever seen. The chilling ring wraiths conjure up fear in every deadly whisper, ominous footstep, and terrifying shriek. My face still tingles everytime I watch the ring wraiths' chases and fight sequences, even though I already know the outcome.3. Breathtaking visual effects and graphics that would've made Tolkien proud. Rivendell is a flawless, perfect paradise of flowing waterfalls and awe inspiring mountain views. The battle of the orcs and the meeting of the Balrog will fool your senses, making everything seem real as the person sitting beside you in the theater.4. Brilliantly adapted screenplay, based on the masterpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien, who outclasses and definitely is a far better writer than J.K. Rowling anyday. Diehard Tolkien fans will definitely be pleased with the movie, as well as others who haven't been associated with Middle Earth.5. Talented acting from every character. Gandalf's performance is definitely Oscar worthy, as Sir Ian McKellen disappears as he performs on the big screen and comes out as Gandalf the Grey. (Gandalf can kick Dumbledore's ass anyday) Viggo Mortensen gives a powerful interpretation of Aragorn or Stryder, a sword fighting true Lord of Gondor. Sean Bean plays a true hero to cheer for. Elijah Woods as Frodo (the better alternative to Harry Potter), Ian Holms as Bilbo, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Sean Astin as Samwise, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Billy Boyd as Saruman, and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, all deserve standing ovations for their heartfelt, noteworthy performances. Orlando Bloom especially, does a terrific portrayal of my favorite character, Legolas Greenleaf, and is a talented actor that will make his impact on Hollywood.6. Edge-of-the-seat plot and action, the three hours seems far too short as movie takes you straight into Tolkien's world. This movie will never get boring, no matter how many times you watch it.7. Howard Shore's score delivers fullness, richness, sorrow, and excitement on top of an already outstanding movie. You'll be buying the soundtrack before you know it.8. The feeling it leaves you when you walk out of the theater, is undescribable. I left the theater the first time I saw LOTR with the best feeling I've ever experienced from only a movie. Ultimate satisfaction, anxious anticipation for the next installment in the trilogy (The Two Towers), and a warm, soaring feeling are things I experienced from LOTR, and obviously feelings the other people in the theater felt, as they clapped at the end of the movie.I pity those who decide not to watch LOTR, for you are missing out on the greatest movie, in my opinion, I have seen in a long time. (And trust me, the workers at the Cinemark movie theater practically know me by name now.)Those of you who disliked the movie, and didn't appreciate the awesome action scences, intense emotion, thrilling terror, shocking visual effects, fantastic directing, wonderful score, magnificent cinematography, and actors at their best, cannot recognize a true GREAT cinematic achievement when it's right in front of their faces.GO SEE LORD OF THE RINGS!One ring to rule them all, One ring to bind them, One ring to bring them all And in the darkness bind them...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The beginning of the best trilogy to ever be put to film.,"I've grown up in New Zealand. As a result, Lord of the Rings was tied to our countries identity quite heavily in the 00s. This could be a bad thing, but it helps tremendously that the films were so damn good.I didn't watch this in theatres (I was 5). I first saw this film on VHS at my late grandad's house. Going off memories, I wouldn't expect grandad to have liked the film, yet it was one of the few VHSes he bought.I remember seeing the scale models they used for Barad-Dur in Te Papa, the biggest museum in the country. I've been to Weta Workshop where they made so many advances in CGI. I visited many of the locations shown in the film; I've flown over the misty mountains, I've walked through the woods where they made Rivendell, hell I've even been to the little nook where they hide from the black rider. I've met Sir Richard Taylor as well, head of Weta Workshop, and he was fantastic to (briefly) talk to.I think it's important to bring up how intertwined this trilogy is with my country's identity while growing up, because it truly does bring a sense of pride to think about these films. This was a cinematic achievement. The premiere was in Wellington. There's giant Lord of the Rings and Hobbit models at the airport. Hobbiton is just an hour and a half away from me.The making-of on the blu rays is the best I've ever seen, and it showcases the country really working together to bring Tolkien's vision to life. One example is gathering basically all the horses in New Zealand for Return of the King, and dressing most of the riders in beards to pass them off as men (there weren't enough male riders). I don't expect to see something like this achieved for quite a while, if ever.This is the first viewing after I finally read the book for the first time. Usually reading the book can detract from the film, but here it's made me appreciate it all the more. The changes make so much sense, though I understand some people who read the books first finding them annoying. This is probably because the films are what I know, and love. The books don't have Howard Shore's soundtrack, possibly my favourite of all time. The books don't have Ian McKellen as Gandalf, nor Sean Bean as Boromir. The books don't have the NZ backdrop.Though, of course, none of these films are possible without the books. Lord of the Rings is an exemplary work of foundational fantasy, and is extremely rich in lore and detail. This is the lite version, but it carries the heart and delivers it in a tighter package. I prefer the films. Maybe, on a reread I'll like the book more, but it's got a lot to catch up on.Now the review is already long-winded, so I'll briefly talk about my favourite sequence. It goes without saying that the film is high quality on every front. There's only a few CGI shots that haven't aged well-the practical props and sets still look absolutely incredible.But the best part, is the drums in the deep sequence. It's my favourite part of the book, and here it's brought to life so damn well. Every time I watch it, my heart races. I know what's going to happen, yet my heart races. The council of Elrond is where the film starts to get epic, but Moria really solidifies how layered this world really is. This is a living mythology.This rewatch I watched with one of my cousins, who after having lived in New Zealand for 21 years had never seen the film. This was, quite simply, blasphemy. Especially since he was a fantasy fan. So it was a great experience seeing it anew through his eyes, and securing his NZ citizenship (watching the trilogy is a part of life here).Of course he mentioned 'ohhhhh that's where that's from' many a time. These films have soaked into the cultural zeitgeist and much remains to this day. Oh, and the Bilbo moment got him good.So my rambling is pretty much over. I wrote this rather quickly-I think hastily gushing about it, while unedited, showcases my love for this film more (I swear I'm not lazy). Now I'm not entirely sure if Fellowship is my favourite in the trilogy. As a kid it was Return of the King, so it'll be interesting revisiting that one after reading the book. I understand it has the most changes, some of which are considered to be the worst parts of the adaptation. But for now, I move onto The Two Towers, my least favourite, and still somehow an incredible film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Fellowship of hard work (DVD),"Visiting Middle Erath is an huge journey: it took 13 years to Tolkien to write it, almost 6 years to Jackson to shoot it. For me, LOTR knocks at my door every decade: I read the first book upon recommendation by a friend in high school in 1991 (without finishing the two others books). Then, i went to see this first adaptation in 2001 but it's only now, in 2010 that i have watched the entire trilogy, taking a day of vacation to do so: first between 7.00 and 10.00, the second between 11.00 to 14.00 and the third between 15.00 and 18.00 just in time to catch my holidays train at 19.40.I really have a like/dislike with this work: As it's fantasy, it's fascinating but Tolkien wrote it like history and it's as boring as school books. Consequently, i don't feel the same intensity of other fiction heroes (Harry Potter, Spiderman, ...). In other words, the story is too much about facts and lacks some passion, especially romances.Nevertheless, this first movie was a good moment and with the first Harry Potter, it made the year 2001, the second best Christmas movies ever, behind 1984 (Ghosbusters + Gremlins).The opening at the Shire really set the tone for the trilogy because it's the warmest and liveliest place in middle earth. After, all the locations goes grimier and grimier up until the dreadful Mordor. The appeal of this first movie, in addition to be the one that exposes the characters and places, is that it's the only one that reunites the fellowship. Thus, we don't find the separate stories that plagues the sequels and it's a harmonious flow. Another strong point of this movie is that we really appreciate the beauty of natural landscapes. Sure, the shoots are digitally enhanced later but at least, at the beginning, it's nature and not blue screen!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Jackson Blew It!!,"First of all, to all the people who claim that this movie was a risk to make - WRONG. This film was always going to make it's money back due to the fans of the book. Even the ones who were appalled by the thought of their so called ""masterpiece"" being turned into a movie would have still paid to see it.The LOTR fan base ensured that this was never going to be a box office failure. And it's that same fan base who have propelled FOTR to the top of the IMDB. I have friends who are LOTR fans and they gave it 10 out of 10 before they had even seen it!That type of fanatasism means that this film can only really be fairly judged by people who haven't read the books. And as one of those people I have to say that Peter Jackson blew his chance and LOTR is a glorious failure.For a movie to truly be considered ""great"" or a ""classic"" it has to trandscend it's genre. It has to appeal to all kinds of audiences. The way Star Wars is loved not just by sci-fi fans but fans of every genre from westerns to romantic movies. The way that The Wizard Of Oz is loved by fans of musicals and fans of fairytales. The Fellowship Of The Ring apeals to one group of people and that is the die-hard fan of the book. To the rest of us it's boring, cliched, idiotic, and pointless.It's pointless because there is nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. It's been done before and better by everyone from Tim Burton to Steven Spielberg. In fact some of the scenes in this movie remined me so much of Burtons Sleepy Hollow that you expect Jonny Depp to appear any second. Jackson rips off everyone and fails to stamp his own style on this story. It's like watching a selection of your favourite scenes from other movies being copied by an amature.There are two real problems with the movie (three if you count Jacksons direction), the first is the plot. We are told within the first half hour what the story is. A group of characters have to take a magic ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they will face much danger. THAT'S IT!! You can leave after that because you already know what happens. There are NO twists, there is NO tension, and the character developement in non-existent. Once you are told the plot you have to sit through 2 and a half hours of dodgy effects and poorly directed action sequences until the end. That's if you stay awake.The second major problem is that we don't really care what happens to the characters. The heros aren't likable and the villains aren't scary. None of the characters have any kind of charisma or appeal and there seems to be no point in some of them being there. There are a few jokes thrown in (which aren't funny and make you cringe) and a little hint of romance between some of the characters. But even that feels like it's been thrown in at the last minute by the studio. A perfect example of how boring the characters are is in the way Jackson gives us a big close-up of the ring every 5 minute. Why? Is it to remind us why the character are there? Is it to stop us falling asleep?It doesn't work and neither does the film. 2 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

a dream come true,"When i heard that The Lord of the Rings would be brought to screen i was very excited, especially since i've seen the 1978 animation movie. Back in the day the trilogy hasn't been finished which wouldn't happen again.This is one of the rare occasions that a long anticipated movie fulfills it's expectations. Moreover, it set the such high standards for epic fantasy that it took a decade for them to be surpassed by The Game of Thrones (2011) TV show.If you haven't red J.R.R. Tolkien's book, you'd be taken by the world you'll discover in The Fellowship of the Ring.

"Alright entertainment, poor conversion","My problem with this film is one which won't apply to a large proportion of viewers. The book is english. This film is not. Simple.Some will come back and say this surely doesn't matter. Imagine a film about New York being filmed in London (stupid idea) or how about a John Steinbeck novel being filmed in Cornwall (another stupid idea). Britain and subsequentially the book has it's own unique personality (even though this film is set in middle earth all the locations and indeed characters show traits of britishness). The casting was in some parts very good (Christopher Lee/Saruman) and in some parts abysmal (Viggo Mortenson/Aragorn).Having been brought up around the characters in the book, visited Bree-like villages and walked on middle-earth style moors; I can say (however captivating and beautiful New Zealand is) this film captured none of LOTR's rugged beauty. The portrayal of Hobbiton was facile and contrived and everything had an over produced look and feel (the genius of Tolkein was in the details which this film smoothed over).My main problem with the film however is the bits it left out. Tom Bombadil was one of the most interesting characters; this was the easiest part to cut as it's relevance to the rest of the book is limited. However the Old Wood, Old Man Willow, the Barrow Downs and many other sections cut out would have been the most cinematic of the lot, especially the Barrow Downs; another quintessentially english image (just go out on the moors in a thick mist and you know where Tolkein's inspiration came from). The first book has more filmic sections than the other two put together and I'd have preferred to see this film take up half the total running time of all three movies and cut down on the lengthy battle scenes of Two Towers (and inevitably Return of the King unreleased at the time of drunken rant).If I had never read the books this would have been a reasonable film. Very americanised (I know P. Jackson is from N.Zealand). One day they'll get it right hopefully and do the Hobbit while they're at it. They should wait for CGI to be able to handle the task first though. The CGI in this film (the cave troll especially which was not even in the book) was abominable.Don't expect much from this film. Some people like it but they don't know what they're talking about (arrogance is ugly but I don't care, I'm a better person than you anyway).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Fellowship of the Ring (a non-Tolkien review),"I saw Fellowship of the Ring the day of it's US release, December 19, 2001. I had never read any of Tolkien's works previously, so I did not know what to expect.  After nearly 3 hours, I left the theater feeling that though I had seen several moments of pure brilliance ... all in all, I had not seen a great film.Since that day, I have seen Fellowship more times than I care to count. This review is for Fellowship of the Ring as a piece of cinema ... and I shall in no way attempt to review or compare it to the works of J.R.R Tolkien.Before the main plotline of the film begins, there are seven minutes of backstory.   The essence of which is: the dark lord Sauron created several rings of power which he gave away, and one master ring to rule them all. Using the ""one"" ring, he began conquering the world.  However, he was stopped by an alliance of elf and men.  Sauron defeated, the ring was taken from him.  The ring could have been destroyed, but instead was kept by the human king, Isildur.  With time, the ring and its history were all but forgotten.   After many centuries of laying dormant, Sauron has returned and is seeking to recover his lost ring.From here, the main story is the classic tale of a hero on a journey. Elijah Wood plays the lead role as Frodo Baggins, a member of a half-ling race known as Hobbits.  As is the case with most heroes, the journey begins in the idyllic setting of home ... specifically the verdant Shire. Frodo's wizard friend and mentor, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) pays the Shire a visit just in time to celebrate the 100th birthday of Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm).  During the celebration we are introduced to three other key Hobbits: Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee (Sean Austin), Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took (Billy Boyd), and Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan).At the end of this celebration Bilbo gives a speech, vanishes (literally), and prepares to leave his home forever. It is here that Gandalf begins to suspect that Bilbo has in his possession Sauron's ring.  At the behest of Gandalf, Bilbo leaves the ring behind ... and it is from this point that Frodo is thrust into a quest to save all middle Earth.On his journey, Frodo encounters many friends: Humans - Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean); Elves - Arwen (Liv Tyler), Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarves - Gimli (John Rhys-Davies).  His main opponents are Sauron's minions: orcs, wraiths, and the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).The plot is as good as any of its kind.  The acting is more than adequate... enough so, that I find no trouble believing that they are the characters they are in fact portraying.Visually, this film approaches cinematic perfection.  It is evident that costumes, sets, props, makeup, and even locations have been carefully chosen so as best to bring this world to life.  It is easy to escape into the world of Middle Earth when immersed in such an array of meticulous detail.  The camera work is also quite remarkable, adding to the film's already high aesthetics.  In addition, the sound, songs, and music act to complement the visually rich Middle Earth environment, and are truly a highlight of the film.The special effects are quite good, though the filmmakers felt it wise to limit their use.  In fact, it's a decision that may very well prolong the life of the film ... seeing as special effects quickly go out of date. The use of special effects gives this story a modern feel ... but the scarcity of that use helps to maintain the sense of timelessness.  All in all a good balance.The downside to all this?  ... the editing.  Though not necessarily bad, certainly subpar when compared to the rest of the film.  Indeed, the poor pacing was my biggest complaint when I first saw it.  To illustrate:  the first seven minutes are truly exceptional storytelling.  Little time is wasted lingering on a scene when it's relevance to the story has already been established.  Compare this to later sections where minutes go by ... yet very little storytelling may actually be happening.I realize that this may be attributable to how the source material was written.  Still, it is understood that 3 hours would not be enough time to show everything.   That being said, it is questionable that some things were included and not others.  Personally, I think the film could have done without prolonged shots of the New Zealand landscape.  After seeing the extended edition, I have to wonder why the forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers were all left in ... at the expense of all the little character development moments that were left out.Yet, after many viewings I have grown fond of the uncommon pace ... and have accepted that Fellowship is not in fact one film, but just the beginning of something greater.There is no guarantee that everyone will feel the same way about this film as I.  But as for I ... despite whatever flaws, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings is hands down the greatest fantasy film ever made, a true masterpiece.   And for that reason I give it a 10/10 ... a must see for any fan of cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Shame on me for not watching it till now!,"What a masterpiece! And to imagine, it was produced in the late '90s/ early '00s. Apart from the magnificient and fascinating landscape, the whole concept is of another level. I watched a movie of 3 hours and 20 minutes ( i think i watched the extented version ) and didn't get bored for a second, the whole thing was so well thought, from the landscapes, to the visual effects, I really can't understand how did they shoot this thing in those years when technology was at its beginnings. Also you could feel the relation created between different characters, the acting of Elijah Woods was great - the way Frodo's face expression changed from the beginning(a cheerful young boy) to the end (a hopeless person, as Bilbo said it was a big burden for him to hold). For me it was a great movie to watch. Let's see the 2 others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The best Film I Have Ever Seen!,"This is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. I am a big fan of the book and I think that the film did the book a lot of justice. The effects in the film were amazing. The battle scenes and the effects when Frodo puts the ring on. The opening of the film was brilliant with the big battle and how it explained about the rings. I think that the actors who were cast were perfect for the roles that they played, I think that Sean Bean was perfect for the role of Borimir and Elijah Wood as Frodo was amazing. I loved this film and I cannot wait till The Two Towers comes out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Even my daughters love Fellowship,"So, I have 7 kids.  My oldest, 18 & 15, boys, read the trilogy.  So did I as a teen.  The 3 of us enjoy late night discussions about all sorts compelling topics of our own creation.  We loved watching Fellowship and have watched the DVD several times.  My 2 older daughters, 12 & 10, to my surprise, have absorbed much of our enthusiasm for the trilogy.  They've watched the movie and quote lines from it.  I encourage creative thinking in our home. LOTR is fantasy.  I feel some sympathy for folks you can't suspend reality for 3 hours.  I suppose it's as much human to be critical as it is human to be imaginative.  Still, I prefer the companionship of the kind and creative to the company of the mean and critical.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Totally 'Oscar worthy',"Though the western critics don't seem to be favoring this movie that much for some reason, for me it's totally 'Oscar worthy'. The plot is all about one word and that cruelty. We all have seeing fictional evil men starting from Darth Vadar to Saruman and Lord Voldemort. But in this movie you will come across the father of all evil Uday Saddam Hussain, the sadistic son of late Saddam Hussain. A very disturbing yet downright perfect movie making based on real life events that took place in Iraq before the republic fell in to ashes. More than fantastic performance by Dominic Cooper doing both Uday and Latif's characters.Every movie cannot be in the Oscar nomination top 10 list. But it can be in your mind forever.My reviews flickshout.tk",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Disappointed I didn't watch it sooner,"Honestly one of the best adventure stories I've ever seen where every character you're introduced to is endearing and enchanting. The film never slows down as it's constantly jumping from one setting and one plot point to another. Everything about it is impressive from the dialogue, to the costumes, to the makeup, to the special effects, to the music, to the subtle background props and extras making the hobbit world feel alive and lived in. The film has a fantastic way of maintaining a sense of humor throughout the entire journey while still taking things seriously when it needs to. Intense scenes are exciting and mellow scenes are relaxing. It's everything it tries to be in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Simply put, a masterpiece across the board","Upon my first theatrical viewing (I'm at five now, with at least one more to come), I might have scored the film slightly lower, but a revelatory second viewing convinced me that to rate this film at less than a perfect ""10"" would be pointless caviling with one of the most impactful cinematic experiences I've had in many, many years.It's easy to find fault with virtually any aspect of any film (""Legolas looked fake jumping off the Cave Troll!""), but such opinions are, as they say [paraphrased], like certain orifices of the body--everybody's got one. I, for one, prefer to wallow shamelessly in my intoxicating newfound love for what Peter Jackson and Co. hath wrought, and ""objectivity"" be damned. (It has nothing to do with the appreciation of art anyway.)Of course, if you think stories about wizards, goblins, and desperate quests, however profoundly conceived and carefully executed, are really stupid, then by all means stay away from this tale in all forms. But then...what are you doing on the Internet?If, as I suspect, you're in the opposite camp, then my advice is this--see the movie ten times, buy/read the books, collect all four mugs, get the soundtrack, and generally speaking, do whatever else you can think of to reward this risky, epic endeavor. And don't forget the DVDs this fall.If there's justice in the world, Peter Jackson and his collaborators will be showered in gold statues come March. If there's no justice in the world...well, just thank Illuvatar that we may still find solace in the refuge of art, as practiced by great artists like Peter Jackson and J.R.R. Tolkien.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A fantastic beginning,If you haven't watched any of the lord of the rings films... What are you doing? Go watch it!That being said this is an absolutely amazing introductory chapter to the epic fantasy trilogy originally written by Tolkien (although his estate disagreed upon release) the extended edition scenes are an absolute must if you are even remotely interested in the world. Everything from script writing to cinematography to acting is top notch.

The Beginning of one of the Finest Film Trilogies of All-Time!,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the most ambitious films ever made. The sheer scope of the film is enough to warrant a viewing from any moviegoer. Never before has the combination of CGI and live action footage been as superfluous as it was in this movie (this goes for all of the other films in the trilogy as well). Though what makes this film distinguished from the other two Lord of the Rings films is that this is the setup for all that is to come, so there is a certain level of mystery and intrigue to each action set piece. I think it is that intrigue that sets this one apart from the rest of the trilogy. When you view Two Towers and Return of the King, they are very similar in tone and style, but this one had a more different approach than those two, and this is also by and large because this one focuses more so on nine characters than entire nations as a whole. Another key difference between this one and the other two is that the action taking place in this film is more like a Golden Age adventure film in style, where as the action in the other two is modeled to be like epic war sagas.This film was masterfully directed by Peter Jackson, and the film is superbly acted by its wonderful cast, in particular Ian McKellen as Gandalf. After seeing this film it is easy to see why so many people are in love with these books. The world is so richly detailed that one simply gets lost in the overall scope and scale of its story.I give The Fellowship of the Ring a perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Amazing in every sense of the world. Perfect Cast. Perfect film. 10/10,"This was one of the best movies I have seen. Lets start how the movie looked, it looked incredibly far beyond any movie in 2001. I mean come on some of the views were astonoshing. It is kind of cheap to think of it because the movie only cost 94,000,000 dollars to create, I thought it was like 200-300 million. Anyways the best part of the film I think was when Gandalf encounters the dark underworld spirit Balrog. And then it takes Gandlaf. I mean that was perfect, it gave me goosebumps all over. Peter Jackson will always be known for his monumental success the Lord of the Rings trilogies. I congratulate him in making this perfect movie, he deserves all of the Oscars he won.

Perhaps the best movie ever.,"Maybe I'm a little biased, I love J.R.R. Tolkien, I loved the Lord Of The Rings Books, I've read them several times, and going into this movie I had HIGH expectations.  I seriously expected a movie unlike any other, that was beautiful, and poetic, and a true work of art, a motion picture masterpiece if you will...I wasn't disappointed.  I went opening day twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything and I have since seen the movie almost 30 times, I love this movie.  It isn't exactly like the book, it is, however, Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth, and it is a great vision indeed. Hobbiton, Rivendale, The Mines Of Moria, they are all beautiful, Ian McKellan is a perfect Gandaulf, in fact the whole cast is amazing, this is what a movie should be.  In my opinion, this IS the greatest film ever made, regardless of what anyone says...I am eagerly anticipating, The Two Towers in just a few months.""I find your lack of faith disturbing.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Where to start?,"When I first heard they were planning to put my favourite trilogy on the big screen with real life actors I was anxious as to what the result would be.I really didn't need to worry. Kudos to Peter Jackson who has taken a fine cast, beautiful scenery, great cinematography and a fabulous story and melded it into a wonderful movie.As for the Fellowship what can I say, they were all magic and gosh I felt for them, especially Frodo who has the greatest burden of them all. The way Elijah Wood expressed the whole 'I don't want to do this but i know i have to"" attitude was astounding. He made me feel like yelling out ""I'll do it I'll carry the ring for you"".Orlando Bloom was unearthly as the elf and the two humans Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean were wonderfully flawed and heroic at the same time. And Gandalf well Ian Mckellen did it all; nice friendly old wizard and all powerful sorcerer just as i had pictured this wizard with a soft spot for halflings. The other hobbits are a fantastic foil for the increasingly serious Frodo and the Dwarf is a joy.The support cast also shone giving the movie incredible depth.Bottom line: All I want for Christmas 2002 is a ticket to The Two Towers to see what happens next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Very good indeed!,"I really liked this movie and I have read the books several times and some changes or omissions annoyed me but overall I am very pleased.A lot of people are under the mistaken idea that the Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, it isn't. Tolkien originally wrote it as a single book but the publishers forced him to divide it into three parts. Because of this there are no midway endings, the story just continues so the fact that the first film ends abruptly is unavoidable, unless you film the entire book or start doing really radical changes. So ""Fellowship"" is not the first part in a trilogy but rather the first part of one book.My final comment is that for those, like myself, who were bothered by some of the changes, try a second viewing were you can judge the film by itself and not compare it to the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Fellowship of the Ring - A visually stunning and emotionally captivating masterpiece,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson, is a visually stunning and emotionally captivating masterpiece.

The cast, including Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, deliver exceptional performances that bring their characters to life. The musical score, composed by Howard Shore, is equally impressive and adds to the film's already immersive atmosphere.Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a masterpiece of cinema that offers a thrilling adventure filled with unforgettable characters, stunning visuals, and compelling storytelling.

Perfection,"Peter Jackson has created a modern day masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be labeled one of the great fantasy movies of all time. He has created a world that feels very real and in it, he puts some of the most authentic characters who makes the movie flourish. The use of practical effects is what makes the movie shine, the production design in the movie is perfect, everything looks authentic and magical, it's great to see him shy away from CGI when possible. The movie slowly reveals the diversity of Middle Earth and every new scene brings new wonders, it's astonishing to see the world unfold before our eyes.Fellowship is also the most personal and heartfelt of the three, seeing the Fellowship weaken and fall apart as the movie is devastating. Though the battles and storyline are the smallest and least 'epic' when compared to the second and third movies, the emotional impact here is the greatest. This is why the movie is the best of the three, the stakes are high for the group of people we care about, we just get to meet them and already they are falling apart. The character interactions between the original Fellowship is the best aspect of the movie, together there are no more than nine characters, but they are given the greatest task of Middle Earth. Not to mention to great comedy bits that take place between the hobbits and the other members of the group (the later movies move away from the comedic tones).The Lord of The Rings is easy one of the great trilogies of all time, they are all must-see movies!

Incredible!,"Wonderful.  Marvelous.  As fans of the trilogy, we can find fault all day long.  That's because it's easy to criticize, but let us remember that the movie medium has limitations that an author of a book does not have to deal with.  Before being too harsh, we should ask ourselves if the deficiencies are of any consequence?  Is the movie a good representation of the author's intent?Certainly character development is limited in this medium.  But to do more than was done would result in the film being criticized for being too long, or for moving too slow.  We expect a certain amount of this from a good book, but a movie can not be done that way.It is my view that, as measured against what has been achieved, that which was left out of the movie pales into insignificance.  This is the best film adaptation of a complex story that I have ever seen.  If the 2nd and 3rd installments are as well done as the first, this will be a great addition to anyone's DVD collection.

Little did I think that I would be blown away so much that I have not left a theater as excited about a movie since I was a kid after I saw Star Wars. Most people are focusing on the special effects, which are remarkable, but I think that the film succeeds on all levels,most fantasy films these days are fx extravanganzas and are entertaining, but are not remembered soon after, they are just fun video games. Peter Jackson must have really loved this story, alot of care went into the producing of this story. Yes it is an adventure,full of action and thrills, but it takes itself seriously,Jackson has created a whole world, not just a bunch of action set pieces. Star Wars in 1977 felt that way, earnest and completely emerses the viewer into its world, no movie since has had done that as successfully until now, Bravo to Mr. Jackson and everyone involved in the making of Fellowship.

Amazing film,"Good day to all, I want to share with you a review of the film ""The Lord of the Rings: The Brotherhood of the Ring"", directed by Peter Jackson, who saw the world in 2001. It is striking that sometimes there are people who have not watched this magnificent film, which can safely be called a fantasy classic (as well as the work of R. R. Tolkien itself).Although the film was released a long time ago, it does not lose any relevance in terms of special effects in modern times. Computer graphics are at a high level and do not cause dislike even from a sophisticated amateur. The musical accompaniment is also gorgeous.The cast is simply phenomenally selected. I read the book long before the film appeared, and the actors not proposed coincided more with the fruits of my imagination.The only exception is Hugo Weaving, who played the role of Elrond (one of the elven lords). Even though he got a nice haircut and grew the tips of his ears, he still looks like Agent Smith.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A fantasy threat wrapped in childhood nostalgia,"The lord of the rings trilogy is my all time favourite trilogy.My first encounter with Lord of the Rings was when my Dad bought me the Fellowship on video when I was 8. 
I had no idea what the film was supposed to be about. I just looked at the artwork on the cover and asked my Dad to buy it.
We went home and watched the film together immediately.Then we watched it again for a second time the next day. 
And then again the day after.
And for whatever reason, I just couldn't stop watching it. 
As an 8 year old, I assumed it was because I loved sword fighting, monsters and cheap scares. 
Now, 24 years old, I think I know why I did it.It was because of the immersion I felt - and still feel today. 
Not many fantasy series - TV and film - are this immersive. 
I think what really strikes a cord with me is the attention to detail in the world building.
Director Peter Jackson brought JRR Tolkien's Middle-Earth to life and gave the films a suitably dream-like fantasy quality despite also being historically credible. 
I thoroughly believe that Middle Earth could have been a real place in times gone by.So even though the story itself - which is amazing - is a classic tale of good vs evil (Another reason why my childhood self immediately fell in love with it), the attention to detail in the film making and overall world-building is the reason why the film still has the replay value that it does for me even today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

A great modern classic,"This move definitely is a classic of today. The directing was pure excellence and the special effects are outstanding. I havent seen a movie made this well since the late eighties sometime. I was always thinking that it was about time for them to come out with a fantasy movie. Im not a big fan of the lord of the rings but after seeing this i have to get into it more. The characters were awesome. Whenever every single one of the characters do good then youve got a classic and thats in any movie. They couldnt have chosen a better actor than Elijah Wood to play Frodo. He has the sadness in his eyes and the humble like features that i felt Frodo should have. Ian McKellan did great as Magneto in XMEN but he excelled that part as Gandolf. His true colors came out at the end as showed his true courage against the shadowy fire beast. Sean Astin of course did a good job as always. John Rhyeis Davies did wonderful as the Dwarf. I didnt even recognize him at first. Strider was a very well liked character, id like to see more of him in the sequels and Orlando Bloom played an unforgettable role as an elf. It proves to all of us the cool and determination(and great skill)elves have in battle. Even when the goblins attacked at close range you could see the concentration in his eyes to destroy the creatures. I just have to say this movie was a 10 all the way because of everyones effort they put into it.

"Liked, Didnt Love It","Right up front - I give it an 8 out of 10.  So much promise to be a masterpiece, but it just fell short in a few places. Yes, I am a person who read and loved the books, nothing can replace that enjoyment, but I am looking it here as with an eye to how I projected it as a pure cinematic experience.The Good 1.  Sauron was great, as evil and frightening as could be imagined. 2.  The casting was great, even liked Frodo despite my reservations. Strider/Aragorn was just as a imagined.  Didn't even mind the invented Arwen scenes, they worked well. 3.  The scenery was beautiful, Rivendell especially was better than I pictured with its spectacular vistas. 4.  The monster at the entrance to Moria was as creepy as I imagined. Moria itself was perfect though not given enough time.  Loved the Cave Troll, and, as for the Balrog, I couldn't have imagined it any better.The Bad 1. Lothlorien -- it was so brief in the movie, but so beautifully described in the book, I got no sense of it.  It was kind of dream-like, as it is in the book, but I expected a vibrant happy place where they felt safe, never got that.  There was never any time to sense the feeling of being there. I wanted a lot more, but all I will remember from that scene was Galadriel freakin' out over the ring. 2. Wanted more of Moria.  What was given was wonderful, just wanted more sense of being there, wanted about 45 minutes of that instead of 15 minutes. It could have built much more atmosphere and doom. 3. Too much Saruman.  Too much of him building an Orc army.  I don't recall that much attention being given to that in the book.  I didn't need 5 fly-byes of the Orc Army being built.  Way too much time was spent there. 4. Fight scenes - Some were good, but too many were like attention-deficit disorder scenes, slow it down a bit, give us a broader sense of what is going on. 5. Rivendell council was ok, but spend a little more time to understand the characters we're going to spend 2 more movies with.  Its a Fellowship, I want to feel more like I know and like the team.  (I know I do, but the average viewer doesn't).  Give us a little more inside story to grow to like them. 6. Tom Bombadil would've provided a few minutes of some much-needed comic relief and some stress relief.  The movie made me feel like Orcs were on their rear for every second, viewers needed a break for a few minutes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Blown Out Of Proportion!!!,"Apart from the special effects, which are nothing more than OK, this film is simply BAD! Obviously, if you liked it, you're not a Tolkien fan, and if you haven't seen it, then save yourself from three hours of boredom and simply avoid it.The storyline is all over the place, and as a result, has no credibility whatsoever. On top of that, I found myself completely indifferent to the characters, which, if you read and loved the books, like I have, simply says it all.As a viewer, you don't get the feeling that the heroes travel for long periods of time between places, and you don't understand where they are now, or why there are there. Unless you know the storyline of the books inside-out, you will simply get lost in it - and if you do know it, you will simply get annoyed with what they've done with it.Also, in quite a few of the action scenes, there are moments where you'll be finding yourself thinking: 'yeah right - whatever'.If anything, it should've been made into a TV series.Certainly doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top 250 films of all times!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The music of the movie from Howard Shore is superb like the opening theme and battle themes. The story of this film also is just so incredible. Thanks to you J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson.

This movie defined a generation,"I was born the same year this movie came out. I can't believe it is now 20 years old! Man, where do I even start praising this movie?? Of course nostalgia plays a role in my experience, but I genuinely think this movie (and the rest of the trilogy) is the best of all time.Everything here just WORKS so well. The scenery is beautiful. Who doesn't want to live in the Shire with its green fields, forests, and farms? It creates a perfect sense of home for the characters AND for the audience. And speaking of the characters... they are all so well developed, which is thanks to the great script (greatly taken by JRR Tolkien of course) and the iconic actors who play the characters. The acting in this movie is top notch and I was never once taken out of the scene. Each character has their own personality and, even though there are so many of them, they all stand out and get their own moments. I love the bounds between the Hobbits, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Gandalf, and of course Aragorn (my personal favorite character).Again, the SCRIPT. Gandalf has the best lines, like his speech to Frodo in the mines of Moria. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us"". Each character has their own journey to go on and I love how they are all friends. So many movies and TV shows these days have cynical characters, which very well might reflect the state of the world, but this movie reflects a time where there is still hope, and beauty in nature and good in people. I think that the theme of ""good"" works so well in this movie, because the reason to fight is the belief that there is still something good to make it all worth it, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time.The balance of fantasy wonder and natural nature is fantastic. I love how we have Wizards and Elves, but they all live off of the Earth without technology. Again, a simpler time. Each new location is beautifully crafted, whether that be the Elf Realm or Gondor.AND THE MUSIC!! Oh my goodness, such beauty and nostalgia in the beautiful score. It adds so much to the scenes and fits so well: enchantment for the Elves, battle cries for the fight scenes, the soft wistful Shire ambience. It all just FITS.Everything in this trilogy just comes together so well. The cast, the acting, the directing, the script, the scenery, the filmmaking, and the story and characters. I cannot praise this movie enough, and I have nothing to complain about (yes, I did read the books and also loved them!) All in all, I give this movie a 10/10. It defined a generation, it made fantasy revered again. It was a feat in film making. It brings hope and comfort to so many people.

Total Fulfillment!!!!!,"I just saw the extended DVD version of LotR: Fellowship of the Ring and, to my absolute delight, it has met my every expectation! It simply is a flawless enrichment of an already fulfilling experience! On a personal note, Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Trilogy appears to be an exact replica of how I myself perceive the Tolkien universe. I recall seeing the original preview for LotR: Fellowship of the Ring in the theatres almost 18 months ago and instantly recognizing all the scenes and characters from the books. I recall hoping for the elimination of Tom Bombadil from the story line, a character, which I perceived as Tolkien's touch of eccentric attachment to an otherwise irrelevant persona. And now, having just watched the extended DVD version of the film, I find it a stroke of genius in its simplicity as to how Meriadoc and Pippin come into possession of the Noldor blades. Furthermore, I am absolutely thrilled to see Cate Blanchett's Galadriel presented in the completeness, which her character truly deserves! All in all, the extended DVD edition of LotR: Fellowship of the Ring is filled with perfectly enriching sequences, breathtaking to both veteran Tolkien followers and newcomers to the world of Middle Earth.With highest recommendations,Mithelemir",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great eye candy, however story lacks peaks and valleys","Just got home from seeing this movie.  Let me start off by saying the cinematography is fantastic, and the special effects are awesome.  But that's pretty much where it stopped impressing me.With all the hype about this film, the storyline has all but been fully revealed, thus not leaving many surprises.  The plot never really took me up very high and failed to drop me to any depths.  I felt that it lacked any highs and lows, and rather continued on a flat journey.  (visually, a very impressive journey - but as far as the storyline went, I wasn't all that impressed)  What I'm trying to say is that I really didn't become very attached to any of the characters, and therefore couldn't really have sympathy for them during their losses and didn't feel very rewarded during their triumphs.I do feel that the high ratings it has received is largely due to the spectacular special effects, very impressive computer animation, and breathtaking scenery.  (which is why I gave it a 7/10) While it's certainly no Star Wars (New Hope, Empire, and Jedi all get 10/10 in my book) or Braveheart (another 10); VISUALLY it is an excellent film.I will be anxious to see what they give us in the next two...Just my $.02 so please keep the flames to a min. =)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Outstanding!!,"This... this must be my favorite movie franchise to this date. I have seen the movies so many times, and almost ever time I watch it anew, I see something new. And that is something that makes me love these movies even more. It's like The Matrix. You can't possibly see everything the first time you see it. This is just... argh... it's so amazing. I don't think I will ever see a better fantasy movie. And God, the music... Howard Shore could not make the soundtrack even slightly better. So a tips for you if you're going to watch this... Watch it in blu-ray. Full 1080p, and turn the volume up so you can experience the movie the best way. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The Beginning of a Classic Hero's Journey,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is my least favorite film of the trilogy and yet is one of my favorite movies of all time.

To add to that it has one of the most interesting starts to a film and it hooked me from start to finish. Which shocked me cause this is a 3 hour movie.

The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite all-time films.,"The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite all-time films. There are some reasons why. First of all, the casting was great. All the characters were in theme. The filming location was great because it was filmed in New Zealand, and that is a nice country. Bilbo Baggins house looks exactly like the front cover of The Hobbit novel. Everything in the film was as I pictured it. I liked the trick photography in which the hobbits appear to be half the size of wizards and men. However, one thing I disliked about this film was its length. Three hours is way too long.

A masterpiece,"One of the most timeless pieces of film ever made! The trilogy started off with only the highest of standards! I remember seeing this on big screen and was converted to a complete JRR Tolkien addict. A near 3 hour film may seem too long for some viewers, but this storyline is so massive that the length of the film flys by making you wish it didn't end just yet. Director Peter Jackson really stepped up to the plate with a great leap to success. I don't think there can be anything negative to say other than it's unfortunate that there were only 3 films to the story.

A Captivating Journey into a World of MIddle Earth,"From the very beginning, The Fellowship of the Ring immerses us in a meticulously crafted world.

The film seamlessly weaves together themes of friendship, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil. It explores the human spirit, highlighting the resilience and determination of its characters in the face of overwhelming darkness.Howard Shore's sublime musical score elevates the film to new heights, capturing the grandeur and emotional depth of the story. The music becomes an integral part of the narrative, enhancing the film's emotional impact and immersing the audience in the awe-inspiring world of Middle-earth.The Fellowship of the Ring is not merely a fantasy adventure; it is a timeless tale that resonates with universal themes.

An awesome achievement,"I still snicker at some of the wordy trashing comments being posted here. I especially like the arrogant little know-it-all who called this film arrogant.Ever since the 1950's when the Lord of the Rings books were released, virtually every fantasy ever made can trace some aspect of its origins to these stories. Even Star Wars is based on this story, and much of the Led Zeppelin imagery came from here. Directly.To tell most stories, all you need is to pack a little two hour package together. This story is bigger than that, it is sweeping, majestic, and powerful. It is the granddaddy of fantasy stories, so to speak.The point that many people miss is that there is supposed to be ugliness, the ugly parts are to contrast the bright parts. The placid Shire goes up against the horrors of the grown-in-the-dirt Orcs, who are not exceptionally powerful as individuals, but overwhelming in numbers.This first movie is laying the groundwork for the epic struggles to follow. We are merely meeting the characters and setting the stage. If you don't have the patience to accept that this background is neccessary to tell the rest of the story, then I truly pity you.The Extended Edition DVD is marvelous. I am still struck by the incredible attention to detail and overall ""feel"" of this work from Peter Jackson, and I don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say that his previous work does not foreshadow this achievement at all. 208 minutes of this movie is barely enough. The texture is stunning, in spite of the overly lingering Liv Tyler sequences and a few other minor niggles.Maybe you don't have the time to comprehend why this movie is awesome. Perhaps you can't see the value of the intense personal sacrifices being made in every scene of this movie. Too bad for you.The Lord of the Rings was written with the memory of World War II fresh in Tolkien's mind. Wars, battles, and struggle are the nature of the tale. In spite of it all, there are pockets of sunshine and peace, and these pockets are our story. Good will conquer the evil!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

one of the best movies I have ever seen,"10/10After bashing those poor sequels of Jaws and Scream movies I really wanted to write a positive review once in a while. This movie is one of those which I rated with the highest grade possible and just let me tell few reasons why I did it. First off, Lord of the Rings is one of the finest books ever written, I have read the books about three or four times, that's once in a year because of my young age (First time I read it when I was ten or so) and always thought that this would be impossible to be changed to the big screen. I use the word 'changed' because even the movie really is a adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece, it isn't exactly the same story, if we are accurate. Lots and lots of things and events have been either replaced or deleted because of the pace and timing of the movie, for example Tom Bombadil, but I really didn't care. When I went to see the movie almost exactly one year ago --- it was also Sunday --- I felt very nervous. Was this movie going to live up the expectations I had with it? What about the actors? The set? Special effects? Boy, was I satisfied. I honestly think that the movie is brilliant. I gave 10 to the theatrical version and if it would be possible I would give 10+ to the Extended Edition which I highly recommend instead of the theatrical version which is also brilliant. The acting was superb, sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Sean Bean as Boromir, Ian Holm as Bilbo and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel were the roles I remember as the most special, although I think all of the characters suited well and all of the actors were really involved into the world of Middle-Earth. I could go on and on praising this movie, but of course, there were also some scenes I particularly missed. One of those scenes would have been the scene when Frodo knows he has to leave the Shire and he walks through the woods and greenfields of the Shire thinking about his destiny. Yes, I know --- it's what Peter Jackson said himself --- that they wanted to get on the road as quick as possible, but those scenes would've been great and in my opinion, they would've emphasised the meaning of the Shire to Frodo. Well, there were added some great scenes in the beginning to the Extended Edition and Ian Holm's narrating was a great way in introducing Hobbits to the audience.These are just some minor thoughts I have with the movie, but I must say that I am a bit excited again --- because of The Two Towers. I am going to see it tonight, almost exactly one year after the first one, but this time I am not nervous, if you know what I mean, because after seeing the first movie, I realised that this story was held in great and strong hands, when it comes to visionary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A masterpiece of the film industry,"A world full of fabulous beings, terrible creatures and wonderful magic. Many films have this, but only a few master them. The Lord of the Rings tells the greatest and most fantastic story that has ever been made into a film. It ranges from the quiet life of a hobbit to a dangerous adventure in a foreign land. But what exactly distinguishes it from other films.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was written by J.R.R. Tolkien and filmed by Peter Jackson in 2001. Although most of you probably know what this trilogy is about, I would like to briefly summarize it again.
Bilbo Baggins who has found a mysterious ring on his travels in his youth, bequeathed it to his grandson Frodo. He does not know yet what kind of rupture this will lead to him. This ring is also called The one Ring and was forged by the evil magician Sauron to subdue all of Middle-earth. Because The one Ring cannot just be destroyed like something else, Frodo has to set out with his companions to destroy it in the Mount Doom, the place where it was created. His travel companions are Samweis, his best friend, and a group of two other hobbits, an elf, a dwarf and a human. On their journey they have to face many dangerous situation and in the end they even have to part in order to increase the chance of victory.
Not only the story but also the actors are awesome. For example Gandalf is played by Ian McKellen, who is also known from X-Men or The da Vinci Code. Orlando Bloom, known from films such as Pirates of the Caribbean, also plays the elf Legolas.In my opinion, The Lord of the Rings is probably the greatest epic in film history. What impresses me most are the many languages with different dialects that J.R.R. Tolkien devised for these masterpieces. Of course, it should not be forgotten that this trilogy are not just common fantasy, action films, but that they are about friendship and longing. All of this makes Lord of the Rings the best series of films for me.
In conclusion, I can only say that the films should definitely be seen once. Even if you don't like fantasy films, you can give Lord of the Rings a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good affect and extremely strong plot.,"This one was a real treat to see.  It is not often that I have been truly entertained by a good story. Lord of the Rings is on of those few films that does this.  The plot line of this film is was kept me glued to it.  It did not have any weak points that I could tell.  It moved along well and only had a few points where the plot dragged a little.  I also have to admit, at times the film did seem to be taking a very long time but it also seemed to move quick.  I also feel that the film stopped at a good spot and it seemed to be a natural break in the story.  I wonder what more could be coming in the next films.The acting was strong.  I was surprised by how well Elijah Wood preformed in his massive role.  I was very grateful the director did not allow his character or dwell on indecision which tends to bog down other films.  The supporting actors and actresses was also very good and really helped the film move along.  These two things combined really make for a good entertaining experience.  I have not read the books and I am not very familiar with this type of movie so I did not really know what to expect.  I have to admit, this was good and well worth my time.  The only draw back would be some of the fight scenes.  They may be a little too violent for children.Over all, the best film of 2002 I have seen so far, (10 out of 10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Follows the strengths and flaws of the book,"As a sad fan of fantasy fiction, but someone who thought the book of ""The Lord of the Rings"" was overrated, this film came pretty much up to expectations. It has much the same strengths (beautiful scenery and detail) as well as a couple of its own (great special effects, fight scenes, performances from Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee). It also has the same big flaw, the plot. It took me a couple of times to get past the first book as the plot meanders. Unfortunately the film is the same, and after a while, as someone  lese has pointed out, it just turns into a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" game with a number of scenarios which the heroes have to fight or puzzle their way out of.Still worth seeing as, like the book, the plot is only part of the point. The setting, scenery and special effects are superb and there are truly some moments of terror especially near the beginning. The second film, like the second book, will hopefully be better. It's certainly not the best film of all time.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Perfection of the art,"The best movie of all time. You ask why ? I will explain my review by comparing it to The Price of Bondage, which is currently shown as the World's No.1 movie. First of all, in terms of script, there are many movies shot in prison such as The Price of Bondage. The only feature of the movie from other prison movies is that the Banker acts using Andy's intelligence. Come and see that LOTR is a movie that has never been seen before. That's why I think Peter Jackson made The Hobbit. (People can't make movies like this. Just so I can keep doing what I'm doing.) The second one is the soundtracks: As for Soundracklare, LOTR has more than 60 soundtracks as far as I'm concerned. At The Price of Bondage, I haven't even heard one sound track number in LOTR, let alone one. Now you will say what is the relevance of the soundtrack. But One feature that makes a movie a movie and attracts the audience to it is the Soundtrack. Thirdly, Acting(s): In The Price of Bondage, the acting was good. But it wasn't good enough to be exaggerated. In LOTR, on the other hand, it is a great movie with extremely successful acting. Fourth, maybe I'll be accused of holding too much LOTR here, but the Effects were better than The Price of Bondage. Maybe because of the year of production, but LOTR is more in terms of visual effects. Thank you guys for reading my comment. The reason why I am writing this review is because I love LOTR so much and because the movie, like The Price of Bondage, is said to be the best movie in the world.

"I beg to differ, sir","Okay, I was sceptical about this 'masterpiece' before I even saw it, so no surprise that I am not jumping on the bandwagon.  This is not a fantastic movie, in film-making terms.  It is, however, a fantastic cult for those obsessed fans to indulge & immerse themselves in.I may be a hypocrite because I am a huge Star Wars fan, but whereas SW was, in its time, quite in its own league, with LOTR I see many different influences, such as Excalibur (the Arthurian legend) and most of course many biblical similarities.  It presents in an overblown way a very tired genre & very tired themes which are no longer exciting or unique.The special effects in LOTR are, admittedly, spectacular, as was also the cinematography.  But these elements alone cannot make for a great, landmark film, as so many people suggest.  My comments may be wasted as I am absolutely in the minority - those people, like me, who know that LOTR is not for them usually don't bother to see the movie, let alone vote for it, which is why this film has such a ridiculously high rating.LOTR is certainly not as good as SW, let alone better.  Consider also the 30 years which have elapsed in cinematic progress & advances in technology. What's more, LOTR drags on needlessly & ends abruptly in an obvious promotional ploy to get viewers to see the next film.  The cast-list may look impressive, but I found some of the acting (most notably from Lee & Holm) to be rather too much overacting and, as others have said, almost in the comic-book league.  Credit though to Viggo Mortensen who, well, provided the film's only backbone & something to make you keep watching.I perhaps would not be so critical, was it not such an overhyped film which seems to ensnare its victims like flies.  Once somebody considers themself a fan, as I have so found out, it is frankly impossible to make them look at it objectively & regain their common-sense.  In my opinion, it is a fairly likeable & almost exciting adventure film, 6/10 at the most.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"""Lord of the Films""","""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has got to be one of the best, if not the best, movies ever made. Based on the superb novel by Tolkien, this film is a great story of the battle between good and evil. It contains elements that scare you, make you laugh and make you cry, and then it manages to be a totally unique movie. How Peter Jackson, the director of cult classics such as ""Bad Taste"", ""Meet The Feebles"" and ""Braindead"", managed to make a movie of such high quality is perhaps difficult to understand. One thing is certain, this movie rocks, and I can`t wait for the 2 next movies!!!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazing movie,"This film is one of the most iconic movies ever. It will shape and reshape film industry for years to come.People should never forget the magic of shooting on film vs. digital. This is a true example of that.The Hobbit series, for example, are shot on digital (RED Epic cameras), and that movie in particular lacks that sense of feeling like the audience is the part of that fictional world. The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, has that feeling to it. Like we, the audience, are a part of that magnificent world full of wonderful creatures and beasts. Full of magic, stories, love and battle.This truly is one of the best film ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Best Trilogy Ever Made!!!,"20 years ago I worked at Blockbuster. We were promoting the release of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."" I heard of ""The Lord of the Rings"" but I knew nothing about the books or the film. I thought to myself I would never get into a story like that with Wizards and creatures. One day I thought maybe I will rent ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" so I can give my opinion to any customer asking about the film.... Within the first 3 minutes of the film I was hooked and fell in love. This Trilogy changed my life. I am a forever fan. I now rank it as my #1 of Top Three favorite movies ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Startling,"Millions of people who have enjoyed, like me, the remarkable trilogy by Tolkien were certainly apprehensive about this film. Folks, fear no more. The archetype characters and themes in the books resonate clearly and powerfully through this film. The cinematography and the score, the acting and the pacing, all combine to bring this story to breathtaking, startling life. This is possibly the closest to perfect any film has ever come. The Fellowship of the Ring is action, comedy, drama, tragedy, all rolled into a magnificent single package that absolutely does not seem to last three hours. I wanted more. If you have not seen this movie, stop dithering and rent it. Try to find a friend with a big screen TV and a real home-theater system in order to be able to experience this on the level it should be. Glorious film-making. My hat goes off to Peter Jackson for his daring, and also to Ian McKellan: you deserved that Oscar. 10 stars of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"All Rings are round, but some carry a deeper meaning","From a strict cinematic point of view this film is magnificent. Since I did nor read Tolkien's book I cannot comment on the deviations in plot, but the screenplay violates Aristotle rule: ""The Tragedy is the imitation of superior men, the Comedy, the one of inferiors"".Perhaps Tolkien wanted it so, because it disguises the fact that his work is a copy of Wagner's ""The Ring of the Nibelungen"".The following fragment from an article by ALEX ROSS in ""The New Yorker"", elucidates this point: "" Tolkien refused to admit that his ring had anything to do with Wagner's. ""Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceased,"" he said. But he certainly knew his Wagner, and made an informal study of ""Die Walküre"" not long before writing the novels. The idea of the omnipotent ring must have come directly from Wagner; nothing quite like it appears in the old sagas. True, the Volsunga Saga features a ring from a cursed hoard, but it possesses no executive powers. In the ""Nibelungenlied"" saga, there is a magic rod that could be used to rule all, but it just sits around. Wagner combined these two objects into the awful amulet that is forged by Alberich from the gold of the Rhine. When Wotan steals the ring for his own godly purposes, Alberich places a curse upon it, and in so doing he speaks of ""the lord of the ring as the slave of the ring."" Such details make it hard to believe Tolkien's disavowals. Admit it, J.R.R., you used to run around brandishing a walking stick and singing ""Nothung! Nothung!"" like every other besotted Oxford lad. "". The whole Article is at http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/?031222crat_atlarge.Is this a major fault?. I tend to believe so, because the Western Civilization currently lives too easily and pleasurably to dislike Tragedy and jokes are part of any conversation and some even say that the world is ""dumbing down"". This will not last forever...A movie must please its audiences and the Lord of the Rings is a huge success, bur Wagner's Ring survived over a century and the Bible six Milleniums...If Tolkien's Ring will still be in the Top 100 films in 2100, it would be a mighty achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I love this movie,"I can't remember a time where I have been compelled to see a movie in the cinema twice. The first time I saw it, I was blown away. The second time, I could sit back and enjoy it completely. Some of the highlights (not in order)-1. The transformation of Frodo from carefree hobbit, to someone with the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Elijah Wood was fantastic.  You could see the change in his eyes.2. Gandalf- Sir Ian McKellan, need I say more?3. Bilbo- I had tears in my eyes in every scene he was in.4. The fellowship mourning the death of Gandalf- It was understated but extremely moving.5. Enhancing some of the female characters- Yes, the purists will hate it, but reading the book as a young girl, it was hard not to feel a bit 'left out' of the adventure.6. Legolas- a magnificent presence (but I felt that more information could have been given about his background and motivation for joining the fellowship)7. Cinematography, costumes, cgi, script, direction- the attention to detail was amazing(hand-crafting of weaponry, New Zealand scenery), and there was a sense that the director nurtured and appreciated the actors' craft (as opposed to George Lucas, for example).8. The quality of acting in general- I was so happy that no big Hollywood 'names' were used.  It would have detracted from the ensemble nature of the characters.9. The score- subtle, happily lacking the bombastic 'John Williams' touch.When I first heard that Peter Jackson had taken on the Tolkien trilogy, I was both scared and excited.  Scared, because it was such a momentous task, and excited because I truly believe that he is one of the few directors who could accomplish it.  I have seen and enjoyed all his films to date, and I believe that he is one of the most talented directors currently working. His achievement sends a strong message to struggling and aspiring directors, that you don't need to be a Hollywood yes-man to succeed.  If the Oscars have any integrity left, this film and the people who worked on it, should be strong contenders.  I would love to know how he persuaded NewLine to stake their future on these films.  It would make a great book, or maybe they could include it on the DVD :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
best film ever made,"this should have deserved some more Oscars. Never mind. There's alway the sequel! This film has everything I like in a film; special effects, thrills, monsters, a good cast (particulary Christopher Lee and Sir Ian MacKellen) and a good adaption of a good story. I hope Peter Jackson does not disappoint me with his next film being awful, particulary his King Kong project which i have doubt on! See this film! 100 times better than Star Wars or any fanatsy film i have seen! This deserves to be a classic and be with all the greatest films of all time, like Citizen Kane!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Powerful and effecting,"I'm not a real fan of fantasy-movies - maybe it's the Houston Gal in me, but this one rocks.Despite its length the movie never drags, but also never compromises on design, detail and atmosphere. It truly transports us to a banquet of breathtaking places - the peaceful gardens of the Shire, the beautiful Elven city of Rivendell, the gloomy Mines of Moria, the enchanted forest of Lothlorien, many many more. Even minor locations such as the Prancing Pony Inn where Frodo first meets Aragorn, are stunningly well crafted.The key to all fantasy filmmaking is to spend time to create the world of the story and in this respect the film is faultless. Equally brilliant however is the writing and acting, which is pitched at exactly the right level. The characters are larger than life, but all the performances are so sincere that the many emotional moments never fail to deliver. Everybody is good and perfectly cast for their part.I love all the characters but my favourite is definitely Sam, who has none of the powers or importance of the others but always seems to me the most noble and heroic of all. As much care has been lavished on all the aspects of the production, from Howard Shore's beautiful string score/choral score to the fabulous visual effects by Jim Rygiel and Richard Taylor. The movie uses effects in a truly evocative way, epitomised by the scenes where Gandalf is trapped atop the Tower of Isengard while Saruman's orc minions plunder the earth below. This is also perhaps the most enjoyable of the trilogy, setting up the odyssey and bringing the disparate characters together in their shared predicament. It's full of terrific scenes, such as the encounter with the Nazgul on the road, the siege on Weathertop Hill, the fight with the cave troll, Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog and Boromir's tragic demise. I have only one small issue with the movie - the Arwen character; Tyler's performance is fine, as is the writing, but I think she is an unnecessary fabrication for the films (she really only appears in detail in an appendix of the book) and has too much significance. In the book, Frodo makes it on his own across the river to Rivendell - her saving of him in this movie undermines his bravery and stoicism and is an unnecessary alteration in a work so profoundly faithful to its source material in every other respect.7++",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A Boring, Boring movie!","This was way over rated and I think that it was hyped so much that people were almost scared to say anything bad about it! Terrible movie - no one should be subjected to over three hours of absolute boredom! I did think the actors played their parts well, but the directors seemed to be desperate to make the movie three hours so they placed a load of pointless scenery and tedious speech in the film - again BORING!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Part 1 of the most epic trilogy ever,"A word that can be associated with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is epic. Epic is the word to describe these movies. The first film The Fellowship of the Ring is fantastic. The writing is excellent, the acting is great, the effects were groundbreaking. This gave us a good idea of what we were in for with this series. EPIC, EPIC, EPIC stuff was what we saw in the future 2 films. The characters are all very good, and have already become household names. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and everyone else in the cast give great performances. The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring was a start of a great friendship between me and the series.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great movie!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. The characters in the film are appropriate. I also loved the sound effects and music they added.

I could watch it over and over again. Recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A feast for your eyes!,"Not the best movie of all times, but never the less it has to get the highest possible score on a scale up to 10. Why?Because time flies while watching it. See it in a big screen theater and let yourself be introduced to a world that is not like the one you know. Harry Potter is a mere stage magician compared to Gandalf, Terminator is scared of the ring wraiths and you would rather face Rambo in a dark alley than even know of the existence of a Balrog.And, still, it is just a prologue.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One Ring to Rule Them All ... and in the Darkness Bind Them!,"We see the history of Middle Earth and how evil almost triumphed and at the moment of triumph, the evil one is cut short. Some things that are best remembered are forgotten in time. The story, which is adjusted for a different medium than the book must in, was being different in form and timing. However, the essence of the book is captured in this story of the fate of Middle earth, and man is placed in the hands of a mild rather small creature called a hobbit. Galadriel,"" For the time would soon come when hobbits would shape the fortunes of all.""You definitely need to see the extended version as many things were left out of the book as the character of Tom Bombadil. The story goes much smoother than trying to make sense from the theatrical version to someone who has not read the book.I will not go through the story as the thrill of discovery is worth the viewing, however, they could not have picked better actors for each character. Especially Christopher Lee. He adds richness to the character of Saruman. Gandalf reminds Frodo to spare Gollum as Bilbo did. At other times as in Bible stories, evil intentions can bring about good situations.There is great attention to detail; many times, they go out of the way to match the description of the book. At other times they add what is needed to show the tale.The movie is fun to watch and interesting. What you may not see so readily is that the formula that is described by Joseph Campbell of the coming of age of a hero that does not realize he is a hero until he must be proven is included in this tale.The special features of the extended edition help understand what they tried to accomplish yet it does not add or subtract from the tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Three sides of the trilogy,"After seeing this movie about 20 times and having read the books countless times and since my hobby is, and has been for 20 something years, watching movies I think I can make review ...The movie as a action / adventure / fantasy movieThis is the category lotr fares best, all the basic elements of a decent movie are present, a horrible enemy that tries take over the world, a hero (and his friends, that include the comic relief), a object that destroys the enemy, lots of monsters, fight's & cliffhangers. As a ""popcorn"" movie it is quite good, although the movie is maybe a bit too long, for an action movie that is, the audience receives what it is looking and waiting for and visually the movie is quite nice indeed. Just as a action / adventure / fantasy movie I would give it a 7.5 / 10 maybe closer to 8 even, but it's not something that would blow my mind, all this has been seen in countless other movies, maybe in different form, in different surroundings, but still nothing ground breaking.The movie as a movieThis is where it hit's thin ice. Character's are very shallow, their motives and their personalities are left in the dark (other that can be shown in fights) eg. Frodo run's into Merry & Pippin in some field, and so they decide to follow Frodo, albeit they have no idea where they are going and why, had the movie established that they were good friends before it had been a lot easier to understand. Story is driven forward with a really fast pace (after Frodo leaves Shire that is) and unfortunately it is done with the expence of the story, all emphasis is given to action, action and more action. The characters are as basic as movie characters go, you got the comic relief (Merry & Pippin) the unbeatable warrior (Aragorn) the turncoat (Boromir) and so forth, and since the movie ""had"" to be modernized you also need the ""femme fatale"" (Arwen) and still this would be tolerable IF the characters were something more than a aid that just runs the movie forward. One other major problem is that the movie is ""pre chewed"" nothing is left to the viewer, the director takes the easy way out and so underestimates the viewers badly, I think it's rather sad really. So what does the movie leave you with ? well basicly your typical action adventure that is set in fantasy land. It's a typical hollywood production that emphasis on glitter rather than substance. As a movie I would rate it about 6 / 10The movie as a adaptation of Tolkien's workWell, what can I say ? basicly it takes just the basic storyline and forget's everything else, it's so horribly different from the book that it makes me cringe in terror. Those who disagree with me should really read the book's ... Peter Jackson is surely entitled to his vision but he shouldn't say that the movie is faithfull, since it is not. Jackson took the easy way to make this movie, he forgot about the soul of the book and made a action movie instead. Timeline is totally wrong, parts are cut out (like Bombadil) parts are added (like Arwen) since it needs to be ""modern"" I have read several review's here that say that the books needed to be modernized, may I ask why ? dont see a reason personally. I am not going to start to list everything that is changed, as I would need several pages more room, I am sure that if you want you can find places in internet that list the changes. As a Tolkien adaptation my rate is 3 / 10Bottomline is that while lotr is quite enjoyable and should be seen if this genre appeals to you it's not that special, when Jackson made the movie he tried to target as broad audience as possible and so had to seriously alter the books in order to make it more appealing. Visually quite stunning (the landscape) and with good actor's it's nice, althought nothing that would deserve it's present ranking...",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
