One of the Most Unique and Beautiful Friendships ever Committed to Film,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Just excellent,"I am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour. I couldn't.You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.The cast is brilliant. The jokes lovely. The story and the idea behind the movie is beautiful. Especially when you've worked/lived with handicapped people. The music is such a perfect choice, it is unbelievable.I hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their life is and how bad it could have been.Bottom line: Oscar-worthy. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Touché ...,"In less than two months, ""Untouchable"" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success.My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with ""The Tree of Life"", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with ""Untouchable"" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it.So, I saw it  and loved it.The story of ""Untouchable"" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either.And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but ""Untouchable"" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in ""Untouchable"", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in ""Untouchable"", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding.Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title ""Untouchable"" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in ""Untouchable"", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. ""Untouchable"" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue.And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Probably the best French film for years,"Being french and a film maker myself, I have high standards for ratings, and this one definitely deserves in 10/10. I've not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy's first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the ""Joconde"" or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes...",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A Film of True Humanity : Comedy in the Face of Hardship,"It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored.Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity.The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen.The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter.Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc.The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris.On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of ""best movie of the year"".I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored.PS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way ""The Departed"" did for ""Infernal Affairs"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Wonderful, funny and touching","Well, I've just got out of the theater and i must say that all the reviews are right. this is an amazing film! The actors are simply the best, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of Phillip but also the joy.Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one.It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
great performances,"Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors, particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography of images are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social differences in France without being too heavy on it.

"A magnificent, sensitive movie","It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
a touching yet funny French comedy,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music).

Beautiful and Uplifting Story of Friendship,"In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe (François Cluzet) is a quadriplegic millionaire that is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his red-haired secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.Philippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. ""Intouchables"" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.The screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.The cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good.

After this film I have to reconsider my other 10/10 ratings,"This was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The actors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect combination. This film is for me in a league with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair.

"The type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman.","'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Best friends,"A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job.

Painfully Average,"I feel like I need to say something. Not only is this in the IMDb top 250, its very close to the top, sitting at #38. This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your ""average"" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that.There's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me.Clearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you. It's put together well enough to be enjoyed, but for me personally it left little impact, and I can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list.

Hollywood film made in French,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Fantastic !!!!!!,"My my where do I begin.To start with I did not want the movie to end at all. Its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by. This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.Anyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.If just by the word ""quadriplegic"" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.A very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have François Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.Wow !!! that was some movie.

"A carefree (yes, carefree) comedy about a quadriplegic","This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as ""race-relations"" feature.I've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.I'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.And what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.Additionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.A lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
absolutely touching movie....,"I love French movies, so different from typical Hollywood stuff full of special effects but often with lack of depth in stories.This movies is so simple, humane, deep. It's about what should happen more often, great friendship between two so different persons who are able to go beyond prejudices and stereotypes. It's not a sad movie at all, like it could sound to some people, and it's absolutely not racist like I have read somewhere else in the comments. I suggest to all people to go and watch this, you will go out of the cinema with something great you have learned and seen. It's definitely the best movies I have seen this year so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Very nice acting.,"According to IMDb, ""The Intouchables"" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
This is how a genre movie should be done!,"This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.Guess that I really like contrasts in movies. The two main characters are complete opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable. Driss is poor, Philippe is rich. Driss is vibrant, Philippe is a quadriplegic. Driss is black, Philippe is white, etcetera. They are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends, which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable.They don't just become good friends, they also learn from each other and I believe that they also become better persons because of that. This is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from, in my opinion.It doesn't ever dwell on it that Philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head, or that Driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family. If anything, this movie is a celebration of life, rather than than a movie that will bring you down. The effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it, also since the movie doesn't shoves its drama down your throat constantly.There are some small side-plots in the movie but the good news about them is that they don't distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the side-plots or its secondary characters. It keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject, throughout pretty much the entire film.It's a great movie, in every way. It has a good look to it, that isn't cheap or rushed. It's a respectful and professionally made movie, which all paid off for it.Also the acting is just great. Everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie. Of course François Cluzet and Omar Sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this.It's just a movie I can't say anything bad or negative about. It's well made and effective, which makes this one of the better genre movies out there!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A toast to the spirit of Living .. A must watch film for all,"This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic (Phillipe) and his black attendant (Driss). At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived, loud, excessively melodramatic ""Gujarish"" which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss, an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw, rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's ""hands"" not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life, family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to re-marry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest, sweet, touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. François Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence, to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. ""Intouchables"" celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope; it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship, a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe.P.S : This year a great tragedy happened in my life for which I was mentally down. But this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend. I really want to thanks the director duo for making this film",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Cliché-ridden, artificial","The actors give good performances here but the script, and the movie, ultimately is ridden with clichés and not terribly sympathetic. Anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy, but if you have a vast fortune, an army of caretakers, and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others. Why did the filmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a Senegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every cliché -- pot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be refreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply artificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and hair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the adopted daughter -- or further clichés -- e.g. the police. Mildly amusing at times, way too long, just watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
amazing feel-good movie,"It's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why ""Intouchables"" is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment. Definitely, a must-see picture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Inconsistent,"Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.The better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment.The acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.The movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.It is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Better than I could ever have hoped,"I watched this film as part of my French degree course. I didn't want to - I'm tired, I have too much work with my day job and I'm not motivated.Well I am now.

Very subtle social commentary - Disney could learn a lot from this film in how to get a message across without resorting to shmaltz.Oh, the cinematography. That alone deserves an oscar. Not a single duff shot, and a lot of jaw-dropping wonderfulness.Ultimately this is a love story, but not like that. It's a rite of passage story, but not like that. It's a story of redemption.

Simply amazing,"I'm 21 and have lived in France nearly all my life. My cousin recommended this film to me and when I saw that Omar Sy was one of the main actors, I just laughed. For those of you who don't know, Omar Sy is one half of a famous Canal + sketch comedy show called Omar & Fred. To sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & François Cluzet were best friends in real life.François Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was ""Ne Le Dis à Personne"" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.I have seen my fair share of ""touching"" movies but this completely blew me away.

Marvelous Film with Two Great Performances,"The Intouchables (2011)**** (out of 4)Terrific comedy-drama from France about Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a rich man who was left paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and Driss (Omar Sy), a man from the ghetto who hasn't had much going on in his life until he gets the job of taking care of the handicapped man. THE INTOUCHABLES has been breaking box office records around the world but I decided to stay away from it because of some rather lukewarm reviews. I'm certainly glad the trailer kept telling me to go see it because no matter what the critics say, this here is a complete winner and it's easy to see why so many people have fallen in love with it. I'm really not sure why so many critics have bashed it for being a ""crowd winner"" or ""too happy"" because neither makes much sense. I thought the film was quite remarkable because the pre-credit sequence is just so touching and funny that you can't help but fall in love with these two characters and the journey of their friendship that follows was incredibly touching and best of all is that it felt real. A lot of credit has to go to the two leads who deliver remarkable performances and I'd be willing to bet that you're not going to see better from anyone the rest of the year. If so, more credit to whoever is better. Cluzet and Sy are simply so terrific in their roles that you really do feel as if you're watching real people with real issues. The way to two play off one another is so remarkable to watch that once you've seen it I don't see how you could forget them. Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano do a remarkable job balancing the comedy with the drama and in the end they really create such a special atmosphere that it's impossible not to get caught up with it. THE INTOUCHABLES is without question one of the best films of the year and hopefully the strong word of mouth from around the world will get more people to check it out.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Great acting by Sy, but seems like a French remake of Pretty Woman (typical boring rich man story)","Western filmmakers tend to make stories where someone poor who has zest for life meets someone really rich, but tired of life and turns their life around. In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Gorgeous, delightful, funny and a change","A typical, wonderful, french film, full of surprises that grip the mind and the heart, being an Englishman living in France and having a good grip on the French language this film enveloped me like a cozy blanket on the sofa on a Sunday.The Acting is marvelous, the scripting is genius, and the Paris 'decor' helps to give it a certain romance between the 2 principal actors.A must see even if you can't understand French get yourself an auto-translator or take some french student with you that can translate ""en-direct"".Go watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Funny and touching, but not all it could or should be.","A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable.It's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times.At others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Mediocre comedy,"Its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc The cliché goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies.

Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy shine in this French feel good movie,"¨Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.¨ Intouchables is a remarkable ¨feel good¨ French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter. He is hiring a live-in carer once again (since most only last a couple of days with him). Driss (Omar Sy) happens to be applying for the job, but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work. He's been in prison for the last 6 months and away from home, but Philippe decides to actually hire Driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesn't look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person. Driss and Philippe come from very different backgrounds, but they seem to complement each other very well. Philippe is a millionaire who's interested in art and classical music; while Driss comes from a poor African background, who's interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. Driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with Philippe. Together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts. There are some other secondary characters whose names I don't even remember because they are not very important to the story, but mostly revolving around other house servants.Intouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his Arab carer who ends up befriending him. The directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it. One of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others. It is truly an emotional and powerful film, a story that will stick with you long after the film ends, and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face. It is a feel good movie, but never feels cursi or anything like that. I was really surprised with Omar Sy and hope he gets many more roles. This is really a great French film, very different from Le Prophet but just as good. I had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Shamelessly feel-good and sentimental but it works despite how simplistic it all is,"I'm not sure how I came to be watching this film; I had heard of it some time ago and added it to the queue without knowing too much about it other than it was successful in its home market. Supposedly based on a true story, the plot sees a rich quadriplegic employ a rather colorful young man to be his new live-in caretaker. We open the film with a flash-forward but quickly go back to the start of the relationship and quickly are let in on the ground floor regarding how this film will be. Basically Philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically, while Driss is carefree and very different from those in Philippe's world. Will the odd-couple become friends and perhaps benefit one another's lives somehow? Well, only time (and the genre) will tell.Of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the odd-couple comedy/drama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it. There isn't really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot. It feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringe-inducing ""heart-warming"" moments. A big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles. Neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery. By themselves Cluzet is solid and Sy clowns it up for all he is worth, but yet both are quite charming and likable all the way to the end.Ultimately it is fairly shameless crowd-pleasing fare which airbrushes life into a series of fun set-pieces. It really never touches a real nerve but it is still enjoyable thanks to the warm tone and strong chemistry between the two leads.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Just Brilliant,"It's been a while since I wrote a comment for a movie. I rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesn't give a damn of any social issues. And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch.

The one time I didn't mind reading subtitles,"Still struggling to understand why this masterpiece didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, not even for best foreign film. And Omar Sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in. It felt natural, as if there were no acting involved. If it was made today it would sweep the ceremony, no question. At times it made me laugh uncontrollably, and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies. Although this is not strickly a comedy, it falls more under comedy/drama. It tends to get serious at times. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible.This is an absolute ""Must see!"".

Unmissable,"It was very exciting to hear that 'Untouchable' would finally be shown in the UK after appearing in so many other countries first. Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

"""Touching"" - Who could not love this one?","This flick is as touching as it is intouchable.I rated it a ten and keep in mind that it didn't catch my eyes nor ears in the beginning. However, the overall feeling I'm having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece; is a calm and thoughtfulness that I haven't felt since I watched the almost six hour long Italian film, La meglio gioventù.One would think that the main two characters, Philippe and Driss, had been living together for 20 years before the recording of this movie. The chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary. Something intouchable.Together, they complement each other in a way that is unusual in today's films. Driss, who embodies a ""'pragmatic'"" African french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage. Philippe, being in the state that he is, can't use his body language the way that Driss can. He has to rely on his facial expressions. Something he is mastering very well.I didn't want the film to end.

A brilliant portrayal!,"The Intouchables (2011) is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. There are no action heroes or good-looking women necessary to make this film perfect. It's all about the story and the development of its characters. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy did a great job there. Their performances were memorable and well fitted. The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way. The movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds. So I strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie - try to enjoy the jokes, but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie. Totally worth every second! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
7.0/10 - A Charming Little Film,"I have a feeling that I'm writing another short review here, but we shall see.The Intouchables is a French comedy/drama film, based on a true story. The movie follows the relationship between Driss, a young man with unstable life and low economic status, and Philippe, a rich disabled man who's sick of getting looks of pity. As time goes on we see how their bond tightens, and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve.I'll say this: the film is super straight-forward, accessible and simple. The pacing is quite fast and solid. The soundtrack is fun, the cinematography is actually better than I expected, beautiful shots here and there. Some of the jokes fall flat, but some made me laugh out loud. I had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters, though nothing truly moving. Just enough to keep me interested, to get me to care.Yeah, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it's genuinely so...I don't know, basic? That I don't have much to say here. Nothing in this film is truly special, the way I see it at least, but The Intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments. Just enough to make it a good movie, actually. It's not an extremely rewatchable film, but it was definitely a fun, good watching experience overall, with a couple of heartwarming scenes.

"A cheap, manipulative, film that seeks to exploit its audience","One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***.I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables.The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.2.1/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
France has good reason to be proud!,"The Intouchables has already been awarded tons of awards and made over 400 million dollars, making it the most successful French film to date...

The film has a lot of humor, some with a nice British edge to them, and everything is so real and cheesy as it would be in real life. And that is the best thing about the humor! I must pay my gratitude to Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet! Both manage to create a realistic and moving friendship on-screen! The thing is that they are two entirely difficult individuals, Philippe (Cluzet) is a wealthy man in a wheelchair, Driss (Sy) is an ordinary, poor guy with a lot of siblings! You follow how a friendship can evolve between these two entirely different persona's, and what their ordinary day would be like, together. Cluzet and Sy gives humanistic and brilliant performances, worthy of an Oscar nom for the both of them! The film is a masterpiece from start to finish, with deep messages, humor and remarkable performances! This movie would be my pic for ""The Best Foreign Language Film"" at the Oscars!

A Fantastic Life-affirming Comedy,"The fantastic, life-affirming comedy Untouchable, from Writer/ Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, is a breath of fresh air that surpasses the hype.From the opening roar of a Maserati pursued by police along the Parisian périphérique, Untouchable captivates. At the wheel Driss, (Omar Sy) a young, Senegalese street hustler, bets his passenger, Philippe (François Cluzet) a middle-aged, bourgeois Parisian, he can escape. Cornered but not defeated, Driss ups the ante to secure a police escort. With Phillippe aping a potentially fatal fit, Driss races to A&E with Earth, Wind and Fire blaring above the attendant sirens.Flash back to Driss, fresh from a prison stretch, unwelcome at his Mother's overcrowded flat on the sprawling Berlioz housing slum. Living on benefits conditional on attending interviews, Driss applies to care for Philippe, a rich quadriplegic confined to his first arrondissement mansion. Devoid of pity or reverence for Philippe's rarefied world, Driss's open about his motivation optimistically coming on to Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), Philippe's assistant. Although totally unsuitable, Philippe withholds his signature to satisfy the benefit agency. Forced to return, Driss around his expansive quarters and homeless, Driss reluctantly accepts a trial recoiling at the indignities expected of him. Despite initial tantrums and ineptitude, Driss develops an unlikely relationship with Philippe that transforms the entire household.Untouchable, contrary to the tragic set up, is one of the funniest comedies of the year. Creative collaborators Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have produced a string of popular and critical successes since 1995. They took France by storm when Untouchable, based on a true story, was originally released in November 2011. The films worldwide release has broken box office records for a French language film, racked up awards, contending for an Oscar and already scheduled to be remade in English by The Weinstein Company; it will need a brave director to try and live up to the original.Untouchable's casting is superb. Cluzet plays Philippe, a former adrenalin junkie born to entitlement but paralysed in a paragliding accident and mourning his wife. His performance, with the physical limits of Philippe's condition, is an expressive master class, his comic timing perfect. Sy, who emerged from the working-class suburbs of Paris himself, is authentic and effortlessly charismatic as Driss, the aimless, street smart, opportunist whose overwhelming vitality is infectious.Their cultural clashes drive the comedy. Philippe fills his life with intellectual stimulation; poetry, art, opera and classical music repressing the physical pleasures he can no longer feel. Directionless and irresponsible, Driss grasps all life has to offer living in the moment and, forgetting or dismissing his employer's disability. For Philippe Berlioz is the great French composer of the 19th Century; to Driss Berlioz is his family's housing project. While Philippe has poetic epistolic relationships, Driss collects hooker's flyers and constantly propositions Magalie. For his birthday Philippe's extended family gather for a dour classical concert but Driss gets them all grooving to Boogie Wonderland.It's an education for both. The odd couple overcome the barriers of class and race, sharing honesty, humour and contempt for bourgeois pretension. Through Driss' ignorance and innocence, cajoling and challenge, Philippe's rediscovers the pleasures and possibility of life while Driss matures, developing empathy and a knowledge of classical cultural denied his social class.Untouchable avoids sentimentality touching on the deeper issues of social class and discrimination poignantly reminding the viewer to live life to the fullest and embrace our common humanity.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Entertaining, but not very insightful.","When I first saw ""Intouchables"", it hadn't become the French box office hit it is now, in fact I hadn't heard of it or watched a trailer before seeing the film. Members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out, but I merely shrugged.I remember thinking, early on in the film: ""It seems they sort of know what they're doing"", what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography. But as the movie went on, all traces of artistic flair were lost for good.The characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good. Then again, I found myself smiling at various points of the movie, but I only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context: by the end, it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes. Francois Cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic, but Omar Sy makes the most of his (very) limited part. It is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development.Let's sum things up this way: the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story, Omar Sy's performance is really engaging, and yes, the film is VERY entertaining and beautiful, but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

One of the best foreign films I have seen to date.,"This review is mainly a critique, not of the movie, but of the American Movie Reviewers.To start off, i'm not from the United States, I'm from Spain. There have been good TV shows and music coming out of spain for years, but films is the one thing we cannot do, due to all films having to be comedies which a part of them are not understandable by international (specially American) audiences due to the politics and very vast culturl differences.You may think that had nothing to do with the critique, but it does more than you think. Just like Spain, France does have a very different culture, being even one of the European countries with most differences to the United States. Most of the critic reviews i've read about this film state things that are true in the states when talking about social class levels, but when it comes to France, it is completley different.This films is very captivating, and incredibly emotional, one of the best foreign fils I've seen in years, comparable to 2019's Parasite (not as good), and 2018's Roma.
Also something that may bias me, it that i have seen this movie religiously, and knowing a basic french understanding helps.If i were to reccomend 3 french films these would be the order:

So Good,The score is brilliant The pace is electric. The Masarati flies. Omar Sy is magnificent as caretaker of millionaire Francois Cluzet who is quadriplegic from an accident in a glider.

The other characters are all charming. There is humor throughout. The writing is quick and clever.

"Funny, touching, a bit bland","The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (François Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.This film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.All that being said, the story is clichéd. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.Still, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories.

A Heartwarming Journey of Connection Beyond Boundaries,"From the moment I sat down to watch ""The Intouchables,"" I was swept away by the film's unique blend of humor and heart. The story revolves around two men from vastly different backgrounds-Driss, a young man from the projects, and Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic. What struck me most was how effortlessly the film navigated the complexities of their friendship, avoiding the typical tropes of sentimentality that often plague similar narratives.Omar Sy's portrayal of Driss is nothing short of phenomenal. His charisma and comedic timing had the entire audience laughing, but it was his genuine warmth that really resonated with me. I found myself rooting for him not just as a caregiver, but as a friend who brought joy and spontaneity into Philippe's life. François Cluzet, on the other hand, brought a depth to Philippe that was both poignant and relatable. His character's struggles were palpable, yet he approached life with a sense of humor that was infectious.The chemistry between Sy and Cluzet was electric. Their banter felt so natural, it was as if I was witnessing a real friendship unfold before my eyes. One scene that stood out to me was when Driss introduces Philippe to the world of modern art. The way they navigated the absurdity of the situation was both hilarious and touching, showcasing how they learned from each other and grew together.The film's soundtrack was another highlight, perfectly complementing the emotional beats of the story. Each song felt like a character in itself, enhancing the moments of joy and reflection. I found myself tapping my feet and smiling during the uplifting sequences, while also feeling a lump in my throat during the more somber moments.What I appreciated most about ""The Intouchables"" was its ability to tackle serious themes-like disability, class, and friendship-without descending into melodrama. Instead, it celebrated life in all its messiness. It made me reflect on my own relationships and the importance of connection, regardless of societal barriers.As the credits rolled, I felt a mix of emotions-joy, sadness, and an overwhelming sense of gratitude. ""The Intouchables"" is not just a film; it's an experience that lingers long after viewing. It reminded me that true friendship knows no bounds and that laughter can be a powerful tool for healing. This film is a beautiful testament to the human spirit, and I left the theater feeling uplifted and inspired.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Both funny and touching,"Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, the duo who wrote and directed ""Intouchables"", made a clever creative decision by setting the movie's goals up right away in the first scene through a break of expectation. The viewer is initially induced to assume that the pair of main characters - Driss (Omar Sy) and Philippe (François Cluzet) - is dealing with some kind of emergency, but the soundtrack, actors' facial expressions and the general tone of the scene suddenly change when it is revealed that the characters were faking the ""emergency"" and merely having fun. This is deeply related to what the film is about: The lighthearted, comic and happy moments of a friendship tale. Even though ""Intouchables"" doesn't completely ignore melancholy, suffering and tension, it doesn't give excessive attention to them like most films about people with disabilities do.Additionally, the fact that the movie is full of hilarious scenes makes it a fairly good option for those viewers who merely want to watch something for fun. There are even some moments which mix sadness and comedy up, in order to not make the story feel utterly depressing at any point. Besides that, the plot also deals with some serious social criticism regarding privilegies and socioeconomic inequality (a factor which is creatively enforced by the colours and scenarios).Ironically, the film's main negative aspect is also related to oppresion and minorities. Driss makes a few mean jokes about overweight people and other groups throughout the movie and frequently takes some annoyingly sexist attitudes towards a female side character. However, although such unnecessary moments might make the viewer mildly uncomfortable, they don't even remotely ruin the full experience. Also, Sy's character doesn't become detestable, given the fact that he is presented with a lot of likeable and relatable personality traits.In conclusion, except for a mildly offensive line here and there, ""Intouchables"" is a great movie with a phenomenal and diverse soundtrack, sympathetic characters, splendid performances, and a creative use of colours and scenarios, so it certainly deserves to be watched.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

A feel-good Hollywood movie disguised as a french movie,"Let me start off by mentioning what I liked about this movie. The casting was great, and both Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet did outstanding jobs, and the relationship between them seems natural. It was also a very funny movie- though watching with subtitles, i couldn't help but fall for Dris's charm and laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned just isn't enough to qualify this movie for being considered great.I expected a sensitive, understated French film- what i witnessed was nothing but a feel-good Hollywood movie with little to no substance. Where was the point of conflict? Philip and Dris's relationship, which was- I believe- the point of the movie, suffered no breaking points, no hardship. There were a few points of conflict in Dris's life, which never really resolved themselves.In addition, the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes, while useful for comedic effect, blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends. There was very little substantial storyline, replaced by various amusing scenes.I mentioned before that this was a feel-good Hollywood movie, and that in my opinion is the worst part. The film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters, a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us.Look, I did enjoy Intouchables. But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDb top 100, and I believe it was a wasted opportunity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

"it's hearts in the right place and never bad, it's just too... safe for me","I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a ""feel-good"" buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.Other stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical ""magical negro"" stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.When I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).So in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.If you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Strong message wrapped in light-hearted comedy,"This is a film that works very well at the core. It's true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for mass-market appeal. I can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating. That, however, seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees.The acting is superb from both Sy and Cluzet. They deliver force, touch and humour, and have strong chemistry. Although they act out stereotypes frequently, they never become the stereotypes. I think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping, which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away, but must be overcome through force of character. The leading duo (and for that matter the supporting characters) are both believable and likeable.Intouchables is full of light-hearted humour and adventure. Aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level, there's also a strong life message within. Life is something to be lived, not passively observed. Themes of curiosity, self-awareness, courage and responsibility come across strongly. In this sense, the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy. If these guys can expand their horizons, find joy and adventure, laugh a little at themselves, and take charge of their life and families, then surely we all can.Finally, there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline. Old aristocratic France is stuck, and relies on immigrant France to keep it moving (literally), and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too. The two don't often come into such intimate contact, or invade each other's space. But if they did? Lots to think about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

There are now effects no blood or exposions, it seems to be very easy but we cant get away from the screen while watching this masterpiece. The bright beauty of this film is added by the fact that it is based on real events that took place in real life and this makes this film even more attractive and interesting.On top of that, artists, who played in this film are professionals of their doing.

He is also hilarious, sometimes sad, for example, when he asked another assistant to go on a date with him and she denyed, sometimes even angry when he had arguments his family, in particular, a mother who didnot realy love her son for his criminal past.

Tweaked a Known Formula,"""The Intouchables"" took a tried and true formula, tweaked it a bit, and made a sensational movie. The idea of ""The Odd Couple"" has been around for ages. We see it most in buddy cop movies, but it also rears its head in other genres. I, for one, have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends. It's not that I don't appreciate or like the idea, it's just that it has been done so often. The very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes. ""The Intouchables"" takes the idea, guts it, and gives us a gem.Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy star as Philippe and Driss. Philippe is a wealthy, paralyzed, white Frenchman who is in need of a caretaker. Driss is a poor, somewhat hood, African Frenchman who is just looking for a job. Driss has no passion for healthcare nor is he at all sensitive towards Philippe's condition, he just wants a paycheck. What you don't expect is that Philippe admires this about Driss. Philippe doesn't want a caretaker who feels pity for him, he wants one that treats him like any other able-bodied human being. And I think that's where the movie distinguished itself. Instead of us suffering through a contentious relationship that slowly transformed into something special, they were practically friends from the start, even if they didn't recognize it. Philippe wanted Driss as a caretaker and Driss wasn't going to pass up a good paying job.Their relationship grows over time from one of employer and employee to friendship. It's a funny movie that seems to hit all the right buttons. Driss is not so hood and criminal as to repulse you while Philippe is not so steeped in self-pity so as to depress you. I think their personalities were perfect for each other and perfect for the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

8.5 Rating? Really?,"This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form.The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10.

Very touchable!,"Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.The film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, ""a flash-back"" so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.Phillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like ""a nosebleed"" as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.The directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.Untouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A great film!,"After having broken box office records in its native France and across Europe, The Intouchables is brought to American screens.It's a story about a white man and a black man. The white man is rich and paralyzed from the neck down; the black man is an ex-con from the projects. The former needs a caretaker; the latter needs someone to turn his job application down, so he'll be eligible for unemployment benefits. They meet. They clash. And, against all odds, they become friends.That's the plot of The Intouchables (based on a true story), and that storyline has prompted many American critics to label the film ""racist."" Maybe it's coming from a misunderstanding of some journalists, or from a cultural difference between USA and France, but race is absolutely not the subject.Indeed, the French title Intouchables which translates literally as untouchable, refers to the 5th Indian caste, these people ostracized by society, as the two characters. Philippe is rich but quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Opposite, Driss is full of life, but he is poor and comes from the suburbs. His disability is purely social. Using humor to explore the sensitive topics of class inequality, and quality of life for handicapped individuals is a tall order for filmmakers of any country. However, directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano accomplished all of this.An irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility, The Intouchables depicts an unlikely camaraderie rooted in honesty and humor between two individuals who, on the surface, would seem to have nothing in common.

"Tender, beautiful & very funny. One of the French joys of 2012.","Intouchables / Untouchable **** 10 September 2012 I hate having to start like this but, based on the discontented grunts from the morons who walked out in the first minute, I regret I must begin with: Intouchables is a French film. Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.For the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.Intouchables is the true story of Phillipe (François Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.And so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.There are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.There's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.Cluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.I really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.But these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it if Oh, just go and see it.

A French gem,"This is easily the best and most memorable movie I've seen in a very long time. Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.The real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.It's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless. This is the first time I've seen a French film that didn't leave me depressed and suicidal by the end. I hope many more like it will follow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Truly excellent movie.,"I hadn't expected too much of this film because of the carer/wheelchair storyline. It just didn't sound very interesting. So I was pretty much astonished to find myself watching a truly marvellous and entertaining movie.It's a unique storyline which is apparently based on true life.The two guys at the centre of the plot keep bouncing jokes off each other leaving you in fits of laughter. But it's not just a comedy; there's a lot of sad, moving and beautiful stuff in there as well.Script, direction, filming and acting are all of the highest standard.This is a very sensitive treatment of human relationships; sad, funny and involving. It's simply a great movie. I can't recommend it highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Chasing the clouds away,"I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.The film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Defines ""wholesomeness"" and then some","Now here is a film that perfect defines the word ""wholesomeness."" The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.The man, named Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.The next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.I'm aware the story sounds like cliché-after-cliché, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, cliché, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.The film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.As of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.Starring: François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Directed by: Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
incredibly funny and heart warming,"In these days, in my country, the movie Intouchables is ranked very high in box office. Usually French films are not that popular or familiar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite surprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a film from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and successful marketing.I also watched it today, and I definitely recommend this film just like others did to me. So fun, moving, beautiful.

Inspiring film!,"Inspiring film! We need more powerful consequential films for today. I would have thought that people who spend their working lives watching one violent film after the other punctuated by mindless horror, teenage pap and worse would find a film like Untouchable a pleasant antidote but that doesn't seem to be the case and the fact that it's all true - we learn in end captions that both men remain close - appears irrelevant. So much for hacks; the International public have already embraced it and it's more than likely the UK will follow. For many non-French audiences Francois Cluzet appeared on their radar first only six or seven years ago when Tell No One was an International hit. Jazz buffs had registered him as far back as 1986 when he co-starred with Dexter Gordon in 'Round Midnight' (coincidentally another 'true' story based on an unlikely friendship between American Jazz pianist Bud Powell and a young French fan). I personally have yet to see him give even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one; as for Omar Sy this is the first time I've heard his name. There are, of course, precedents for unlikely male bondings in fact Francis Weber, the French writer-director, specialized in the genre in such titles as Le Chevre, Les Compreres, Tais-Toi etc, Daniel Auteuil has also joined in at least twice (Mon meilleur ami, Apres Vous) and so on but despite it being well-worn Untouchables applies a new lick of paint to the genre and delivers a feel good title to remember.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

An inspiring and uplifting film.,"A rich aristocratic Frenchman Philippe played by Francois Clouzet, who is quadriplegic is perpetually looking for a caregiver.He is a tough cookie and taking care of his fragile health and erratic temperament mean that most don't last more than a week.We see interviews happening.There is a train of inept candidates even we know won't last long.They already see Philippe as a dead man. In the middle of all this, in walks a giant of a black man.He is well built and full of raw energy.He does not want the job, just a signature attesting that he tried to find a job so he can qualify for social security.He is out on parole, a stock character from the Paris housing projects, the grim underbelly of which has been superbly documented in La Haine.We know immediately he will be hired.Its an immutable law of films, even if the posters and trailer have not given it away already.What follows are a set of adventures the two embark upon turning conventional wisdom on its head. Driss played by the gregarious Omar Sy, has immense physical energy and a love of life that is infectious, he has a mind of his own and is not cowed by the splendor of the mansion in which he finds himself in.Of course he tests the springiness of the mattress and practices his bathroom singing in a luxurious gold rimmed bathtub but those are not too important for him. Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.If all this sounds like a series of clichés from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.Driss shows Philippe a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

I would recommend it for every audience : each person can learn from the film. Its a story of life, love, daily problems, tragedy but it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the maximum.

modern France,"Olivier Nakache's and Éric Toledano's ""Intouchables"" looks at the friendship between people of dissimilar backgrounds.

That paragliding scene made me want to go paragliding.Beyond the obvious plot, I see the movie as a look at France's - and much of Europe's - growing diversity. Even if a person in France or Germany doesn't like immigrants, he's still bound to have exposure to them (much like how racist southerners in the US are going to have exposure to blacks whether they want it or not). Of course, most important is the different backgrounds that the men have: Philippe is a modern aristocrat, while Driss is from the ghetto.

A Nutshell Review: The Intouchables,"Just as how Jack Neo's Ah Boys to Men Part 1 finally took over the box office crown held by Money No Enough more than a decade ago, so did Intouchables take over the French box office equivalent from the quirky comedy Amelie, which was the champ over about the last decade. As the French entry for the Oscar's Best Foreign Film picture next year, I was glad I held out against watching this while on a flight, patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here, which it finally did outside of the 2nd Rendezvous of French Cinema earlier this month.There were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie, especially coming from caregiving, which is never an easy thing to do. Those who have never done it, I'm talking about full time, real time, on the job alertness, and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party. There's no Off button you can use, and anyone in this for full time employment, gets my utmost respect. And watching how the characters here go about their routine, bring back memories that are forever dear to me, and needless to say, these routines and close contact interaction, bring about a new level in relationships.Lifting someone up from bed in back-breaking fashion, it brings new meaning to ""He ain't Heavy, He's my Father"". Tucking someone into bed. Did that too. The gloves for the toilet visit, nothing new, gross that it may be at first. Wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of one's home, well, it may be the most inconvenient, but seeing someone's face light up for the rare trip out, is priceless. And these life-affirming, relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks, and tasks we take for granted, such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction, but to the physically infirm, it means the world.And this is what The Intouchables is about, the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employer-employee relationship that develops into firm friendship, a bromance even if you'd like. Inspired by a true story, Francois Cluzet plays the rich aristocrat Philippe, who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident, and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day. But his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week, given his rather stiff (pardon the pun) ways, until Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with not the most polished resume - he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare - gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview, and soon, a bet turns into what's life-changing for them both, bringing out the best in each other.You can half expect writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background, with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff, obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family, with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law. But their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth, that it's hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display, going by the adage that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or by one's background or resume. One may be rich, but getting someone else to wait on you, even if providing him or her with a comfortable life, is a different ballgame altogether, especially when one is not kin or kith.But throughout the story, one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way, with wealth on display, and if there's a minor grouse about this, is how old money gets flaunted around, with Meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life. Then again, this is part of the true tale, so it's not debatable. Not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) amongst others who pepper the scenery, the former serving to fill in the blanks for Driss as he tries to gather background, while the latter coming in as an object for Driss' romance, with a little surprise up in store.There's no qualms The Intouchables is a delight to sit through, being a story of hope and friendship. And in some ways, even for the most able amongst us, this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour, which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations we'll encounter from time to time. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put in amazing performances, and their delivery of their characters, screen charisma and banter, are more than reasons enough to catch this. A definite recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Keep the good work, Omar.","My wife was frightened when I was suddenly burst laughing at Omer Sy's spontaneous acting scenes. I enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Omar Sy is a great actor and he deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. I found Omar Sy's role much more challenging and unusual than Jean Dujardin's... of course, few people make silent films today, but the character itself was incredibly stereotypical. As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads — particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely. The racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcom-style jokes, and Harvey Weinstein smells a hit, having bought both the movie and, alas, the rights to remake.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Let's Dance,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.Philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.The rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.This is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.The film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers. There will be a US re-make of this one, but the two lead actors here (especially Mr. Sy) make this one worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT.

"By directing ""Intouchables"", directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache have made a popular ""feel good"" movie.","The concept of popular cinema has undergone considerable change in France. In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely Gérard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film ""The Intouchables"" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of ""the haves"" and the ""haves not"" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people.

Outstanding film,"I've never submitted a review before, but this was absolutely outstanding. The dialogue is excellent, with many unexpected responses, especially in the beginning.

Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well, and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story is wonderfully touching, without any syrup. That it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing. I don't know which other contemporary movie I would rate a perfect 10. Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Brilliant,"To be honest I didn't even know this was a foreign film, till I started watching. I saw it on IMDb's best since 2011 list and decided to give it a shot.This was a fantastic story that was portrayed brilliantly. It left me smiling nearly the whole movie.Any person that just likes a good story about life, friendship, hardship, and man overcoming his fears(no matter how small), this is a movie for you.still smiling...:)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A beautiful film...a MOT for life.,"Rare do you watch a film where the energy just bounces off the screen leaving you with a warm glow. I felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments - a clear summer sky where the clouds are full, loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings.This 'glow' is because the principal casts are excellent. I cannot direct a negative to any of the casts, pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation. Omar Sy is infectious as a performer. He struts. He dominates with his energy. Whoever cast him deserves praise, as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding. Francois Cluzet pedigree dates back decades, and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to Sy's exuberance. Trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance. It would be easy - and a major oversight - to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing. Funny, moving, idiosyncratic, unexpected, real, intimate, soul praisingly positive, and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film.I stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background, and its a gem of a film. One of them films you watch and yell, 'yesssss to life'.The fact that its based on a true story is inspiring in itself. The production value fulfilled the necessary parts to realise a wonderful and life inspiring story, achieving for once, the medium of film to rank in the spheres of great art. An aesthetic tonic for the soul.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Touches the heart and busts the gut.,"Feel-good French film The Intouchables tells the true story of the burgeoning friendship between an old, aristocratic invalid and his young, impoverished caretaker. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of film that, at some point, seems destined to travel down one of two paths, descending either into a lecture on the class differences between certain socioeconomic groups or a comparison between the relative hardships of near-poverty and living with a severe disability.And therein lies the excellence of this film. Not only does it avoid both topics and, in so doing, keeps itself from becoming overly melodramatic, but it actually subverts audience expectations by persistently looking, as those Monty Python boys suggested, on the bright side of life. A big part of the film's charm is the effortless interplay between Omar Sy (caretaker Driss) and Francois Cluzet (Philippe), who clearly have a lot of fun with their roles while concurrently displaying total immersion in their characters.If managed poorly by directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, Driss's avalanche of one-liners and practical jokes at the expense of his handicapped friend could've come off as misplaced and in poor taste. However, the acting pair's wit and comic timing turns virtually all hit-or-miss jokes into gold and contributes greatly to making The Intouchables...well...just plain funny.In the same way that 'fun for the whole family' has comes to be interpreted as 'a living hell for anyone over six' by contemporary viewers, the classification of a 'dramedy' has come to imply a meagre handful of humour, quickly pushed aside to make room for a sob story. The Intouchables gets the formula right, injecting varied forms of comedy in between a genuine, emotionally investing subplot involving the lovelorn Philippe's pen pal Eleonore (Dorothee Briere). A toe-tapping soundtrack brimming with disco classics serves as the icing on the cake for this potentially Oscar-winning delight.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A masterpiece in human interaction,"This went straight into my top 3 films ever seen, just such an evocative and believable storyline, and masterfully crafted as only French films are. There is an inexplicable beauty to some French films, such as Amelie and ""Untouchable"" was of the ilk but so much more powerful given the context and nature of the two main characters. I cannot recommend this enough, I saw it alone, then took my 15 yr old son who also found it moving and wonderful, Nd then saw it with my boyfriend, whose 30 yrs as a hospital doctor have made him harder and more cynical than I, but he too was moved by this delightful, lighthearted approach to what many would see as a tragic story, and is raving about it to his friends too. I cannot recommend it enough it is a 10/10 without a doubt and it is an absolute travesty that it has not received the acclaim it deserves.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A French spin off of Driving Miss Daisy,"I NEVER post a professional review BUT now - - ROGER EBERT reviewed this and said exactly what I felt and wanted to say about this film. Rather than trying to paraphrase his review I am simply posting his original review found on his web page: (since links are not allowed i have put spaces in the link. you need to remove the space to follow the link)http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/ apps/pbcs.dll/ article?AID=/20120530 /REVIEWS /120539995/ 1023It might help to think of ""The Intouchables"" as a French spin off of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" retitled ""Pushing Monsieur Philippe."" A stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the Paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana. This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.The film was an enormous box-office hit in France, and indeed, it is easy to enjoy. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Driss' cheeky irreverence is refreshing, and Philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job.The movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men, based on Driss' confidence that Philippe will improve if he escapes his stuck-up lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from Africa. There may be a certain truth in this, but the education of Philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clichés. Driss, you see, has rhythm and soul, and if only Philippe can absorb some of that, he'll be a happier man. He'll still be a French millionaire surrounded by a protective staff, he'll still be paralyzed, but he'll be happier. How many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face? ""The Intouchables"" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world.The success of the film, despite its problems, grows directly from its casting. Francois Cluzet, who acts only with his face and voice, communicates great feeling. Omar Sy is enormously friendly and upbeat. He reminded me of the African immigrant played by Souleymane Sy Savane in Ramin Bahrani's ""Goodbye Solo"" — a film that avoided the traps that ""The Intouchables"" falls into.The appeal of a film like this, and it is perfectly legitimate, is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters, what makes them happy make us happy. Caught up in the flow of events, we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged. The writer-directors, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags, and their style is ingratiating. But at the end, by looking through the foreground details, what we're being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes.That was also true of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" but it was a period picture set in the South in the late 1940s, with older characters who had been shaped by their times. There was a plausibility there. ""The Intouchables"" is more of a soothing fantasy.by Roger Ebert - May 30, 2012",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"A Touching, Sensitive, and Funny Film","The Intouchables is a French comedy/biography from 2011 and stars François Cluzet (Tell No One, Little White Lies, French Kiss) and Omar Sy (X-Men Days of Future Past, Jurassic World, Samba). It was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano (Samba, Those Happy Days, Tellement proches).This film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named Philippe (François Cluzet) who hires a lower-class man from the projects called Driss(Omar Sy). With help from Driss, Philippe finds humour in his situation and Driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates, listening to funk music and even giving him a joint.This film is propelled by the performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy. François gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements. Surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour. Omar Sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues. Whenever the two are on screen together it is gold. I would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper.Another aspect of this film that I admired was the dialogue. Since there is no real plot other than the story of two men, the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue. For example, when the two are looking at a piece of art, Philippe asks Driss why he thinks people are interested in art, Driss replies with because it's a business when Philippe tells him it's because it's the only thing one leaves behind.This film is basically the French version of Driving Miss Daisy, that is not to say this film is bad. This film's strongest points are writing and acting, but after that it's pretty thin. Directing or cinematography isn't anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film. Yet this is still a heartwarming film it seems like it is a little overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Now, I understand the hype...","Okay, so my first concern why I didn't want to watch The Intouchables was the story itself. Like it was scavenged from a Hollywood studio's thrash can: ""A disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a down-on-his- luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid. The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after."" That really sounds like something Hollywood might cook up. Like Scent of a Woman or Flawless.But here's the catch: This movie is based on true events. Not in the sense as Titanic for example, where the only historically accurate fact was that ""the ship sunk"". It really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie. Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo (the real life billionaire who this movie is about) personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and Abdel Sellou (his aid) as realistically as possible. Sure, they took a little artistic license here and there, but it's mostly accurate.The thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people don't know how to handle them. Dr. House said it best in the series, that once people know you have cancer, from then on everything will be about cancer. People will feel obligated to feel sorry for you 24/7. They will be overly attentive, overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you. They will never ever just be themselves around you. Even if you've accepted your condition a long time ago, and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease, you'll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot NOT see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you.What this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this. Driss is brash, brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for Phillip. He acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic, and he slowly learns to take care of him, but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy oh-I'm-so-sorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be. Instead, he makes fun of Phillip's condition on many occasions making even Phillip himself laugh. He introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into Phillip's life, which makes him see the world in a new light. Instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past, he starts to look to the future, take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has.All in all, The Intouchables was a really positive surprise. It's not a perfect movie but it's a perfect story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
The Intouchables,"One of my favourite films is THE INTOUCHABLES with the famous actor Omar Sy who became popular because of the TV show 'SAV'.

In this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the job to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.Philippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic.

warm uplifting story of two different characters forging a friendship,"Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the ""professional"" applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.The film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.It's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.I liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks.

Short Review,"Foreign Films are often disregarded when choosing a film to watch.

Next Year's 'Best Foreign Film' Oscar Winner,"After missing last year's 'The Help' on principle (the principle being: black people have moved on; why can't Hollywood?), I couldn't help but approach 'Untouchable' with similar trepidation. My preconception was a misconception: It is one of the best films I've seen all year, and is by far the best foreign one. It's about platonic love between polar opposites. It's about hope and happiness.Set in Paris, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's heart-warming film stars François Cluzet (a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman) as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic widower and Omar Sy as Driss, a brutish ex-offender from a Parisian project.Looking for someone who will not pity him, Philippe hires Driss as his carer. Driss almost leaves until he sees his lavish quarters – and Magalie, Philippe's sexy auburn-haired secretary, who Driss makes it his mission to bed. Driss does pity Philippe, but never makes the mistake of showing it. Instead, the two make jokes at each other's expense and a bond very quickly (and believably) develops. They introduce each other to their worlds. One is replete with operas, art and literature; the other with girls, spliffs and street knowledge. By the end of the film they are inseparable.This could easily have been a tale of race, like 'The Help' was, but that is inconsequential in this film. It is purely coincidental that Philippe is white and Driss is black. When Philippe's personnel look disapprovingly at Driss, they do so because of his rough manner, not his colour. One of the film's strengths is that it doesn't mention this detail, which is after all as irrelevant as it being set in France. One thing that ought to be mentioned is that Omar Sy is not just the help in this film; he's the star, commanding the screen with confidence, charm and credibility.What cautions me from classing this as a perfect film is the few but prominent clichés. Philippe has a daughter who's so much the stereotypical spoiled little girl, and Driss's own family hates him. Also, the setups are overly familiar. Driss scoffs at Philippe's love for classical music and abstract art, but then learns to love Vivaldi and Bach, and then, astonishingly, creates a painting of his own which sells for 11,000 euros! This film is based on real people (Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his carer Abdel Sellou), so these things may be accurate, but this isn't a documentary of their actual lives.However, I can easily forgive these clichés because they are outnumbered by the many wonderful laugh-out-loud moments. Returning from a hiatus, Driss insists on shaving an unkempt Philippe. He snips away leaving Philippe looking more absurd upon each stroke, leaving him with a hitlerian moustache!Already 'Untouchable' has achieved a phenomenal level of success. It is making and breaking records across the globe, and is beating such films as 'The Artist' to awards. It has rightly been entered as France's entry for next year's Oscars. It is sure to win.www.moseleyb13.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
'Art is the only trace we leave behind.',"Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant!Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
lively,"Their is a reason why this movie is rated higher than Lawrence of Arabia or 2001, just for the same reason the Shawshank Redemption is rated higher than Citizen Kane and the godfather. Because this is a movie about hope, love, patience....and all the characteristics we all hope we have. And what's wrong with that???The movie is about two people who can not be any more different. One has his health, he is tall, strong and playful but no money and education what so ever. The other has all the money in the world but everything below his neck is paralyzed, he is reserved in manner. After they meet they quickly connect. It is as if they both find, in each other, the things they have been craving for a long time.The movie was a hit with audiences when it came out but it is not that popular with critics because according to them it is too stereotypical. Well i don't agree with that one bit. I thought the movie handles all the moral issues very correctly. I was also sad to learn that this movie wasn't even nominated for a best foreign language film award, it is such a shame. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie please do, because it is one of those movies that make you feel good from the very inside.As for the technical stuff, i thought everything was spot on. the movie is put together in a way that makes you wonder if their even is anyone behind the camera which is a good thing because it shows how the actors are so natural in their rolls.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Pragmatic,"This a straight-forward and simply told tale of two men discovering a mutual co-dependence based on physical need. Not what you might suppose! This is a tale of a poor immigrant man trying to keep heart and soul together whilst suffering various forms of social exclusion and another man trying to experience life whilst trapped in a paraplegic's body. They are poles apart ethnically, socially, culturally and pretty much every other way too. Nevertheless, the pair bond together through their common pragmatism. The wealthy invalid wants no pity and gets none from his unlikely carer. The outcast finds he has a social as well as an economic value. A heart warming tale and beautifully performed by all the actors - striking a very authentic note, even though we can see some 'facts' have been changed in the telling of this tale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A touching and laughable French hit,"Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.Intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.It is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.And with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.Through his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.The amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.I don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.It's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Superb acting,Im not a fan of french movies at all but i must say this movie surprised me. The acting is superb and realistic as if they really were these characters for real.Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy had a great connection they fit very well together in this movie. I think anybody would like it as its just not an ordinary french movie. It is also a very funny one that will definitely make you laugh and feel happy.

"Refreshing, entertaining and frank.","So many movies and TV programmes involving disabled characters are saccharine and patronising in an effort to inspire or hammer home a message of triumph over adversity. Not so the Intouchables. This movie finally gives an honest portrait of disabled man, at once gruesome and humbling, while keeping the focus firmly on his relationship with his carer instead of dwelling on his disability. Indeed this is a story as much about overcoming class divide as it is about overcoming physical disability.Down and out Driss, part of Paris's disenfranchised and unemployed black youth, applies for a position as millionaire quadriplegic Phillipe's carer in order to get a signature for his jobseeker's benefit. Phillipe, appreciating the young man's honesty and frank attitude towards his condition, hires Driss and simultaneously resolves the Driss's poverty and his own boredom.The genius of this film, in spite of its dark subject matter and themes of disability, class and race, is that it is genuinely hilarious. Omar Sy as the no holds barred Driss oozes cool and yet is heartbreakingly affectionate towards Francois Cluzet's Phillipe.I laughed and cried in equal measure - what more can you ask?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
The best movie i have seen,"This movie is about humanity and friendship, based on a true storyThe disabled man has all the money but he is sad and empty and his life is so boring and routine, he is trapped in his body inside his huge mansion.He employs a guy from the streets, used to hard life in gangs and no money. However this guy is down to earth, simple, and fun.It changes his whole world from boring, to living life on the edge, making the most out of things, having loads of fun. He cuts through all the formal rubbish in the disabled mans life to tell him just do it and go for it. This is the case when he writes love letters for 6 months and he finally gets the big push to meet up with the lady and be happy.It is a story of friendship and how people from two opposite ends of life meet up in order for a care job to be done. In real life it proves people from all backgrounds, money, handicapped can all be good to each other and make a big difference to each others lives.This film is so funny you will laugh so much, it maybe in subtitles but his movie is simply superb.Forget Hollywood £400 million pound blockbusters, this film is not about money it is about true friendship and it beats all them other films by miles",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
I don't feel comfortable before sentimental exploitation,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caregiver. Sy and Cluzet give their parts more conviction than they deserve, but their energies can't revive a corpse this dead, this corny, this calculating , this condescending and this commercial, a kinda wishful drama about the friendship between a rich, white quadriplegic and a penurious black job-seeker. Scripters Toledano and Nakache delivered an offensve film. The moments when they are together fill us with inauthentic feeling-good sentiments. Not a must-see picture.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Feel-good at times but definitely overrated.,"The Intouchables is one of the popular foreign movies of the last couple of years, rocketing to a comfortable position in IMDb's top 100 and succeeding the European box office. It is a really charming film, but charm doesn't make a film. It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.Unfortunately the film doesn't have a particular style or it tries things which feel jarring - such as the montage split screen music video style opening credits after a very strong thriller theme. The cinematography is nothing special and the editing is quite distracting with some scenes with time jump cuts that really didn't do it for me. It does focus on its strongest aspects which are the eccentric and charismatic performances, writing and soundtrack (a mix of R'n'B and classical to fit the characters). All the situations are things we've seen before and it's never dealt in a way we haven't seen before (such as Philippe having a long distance lover that Driss pushes him towards), it is the chemistry of the central friendship that makes the film. It is very pleasant. But those pleasant ideas only work for the 2nd act, after an awkward 1st and 3rd that doesn't really satisfy or close itself. It trades potential for genuine conflict or dilemma for directionless despair due to crisis of confidence and ultimately renders the film not making much of an impression. Granted, as a buddy film, it's pretty damn good and it certainly has its strong feel-good moments.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Fantastic, Emotional, and Humorous","Watching movies with subtitles have never scared me, as several international movies have been a great inspiration to my life (Bon Voyage and Downfall to name a couple). Francois Cluzet is a very believable quadriplegic who is suffering spiritually and emotionally because of the death of his wife and the shame that is associated being paralyzed, while Omar Sy is also the believable ""welfare""-needy man that tries to also care for his several siblings.The one main reason I loved this movie was because of it's classy and genuine humor. Everything was real in this film and it was so easy to relate the themes expressed within it in my own life. There isn't a minute or two that passes by without genuine chuckles or laughter (and a good hearty laugh at that).

They told me it was the best movie but...,"When I decided to rent Intouchables on DVD, the store manager told me that it was the best movie he has seen for 3 years. Unfortunately I didn't agree with him. Of course I had a nice time watching it and the fact that the movie is based on a true story is very touching. Both actors were great and especially Omar Sy who was just delightful to watch. But in my opinion it was just a nice, sweet movie nothing more. I think that is very easy to make audience 'emotionally attached' to a film that has to do with a quadriplegic and his life and this is why I believe that it was a safe path for the production and there were not something new, something different, something that can make you wonder and admire the creativity of director or writer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Unfunny debacle,A film about a wealthy paraplegic and his less than obvious choice for a physical aide. The aide is some guy from 'the hood' who gets the job because he shows no pity for the condition of the paralyzed man. From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clichés posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head. Would perhaps have been funny as an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Quite a trial to sit through.,4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
French Magic,"Growing up in Russia, I was no stranger to movies from other places besides Hollywood. European cinematography is different when it comes to making Drama and comedies as it enriches movies with a soul and not just superficial emotions. This movie has been no exception.The Intouchables is incredible from the first minutes up until the closing scenes. It displays the aspects of drama by showing a connection between the two worlds that the main characters live in and when the two worlds merge together, the story manages to keep you smiling throughout the duration of the film. The beauty of the film is that it does not force the jokes and humor, the moments kind of happen on their on thanks to the brilliant play of the main characters who have good chemistry.Last but not least, when I rate movies I tend to give 9/10 and usually that last 10th star depends on the music and job that the composers have done. In The Inouchables music fits perfectly into the settings and the emotions... 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

"So many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score","The Intouchables had cult status written all over it. It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Omar Sy and François Cluzet, superb direction and astounding background score.Philippe becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident and is in search of a care-taker to look after him. Driss turns up for the interview , not to get the job though but to get a signature for the welfare trust. Impressed with his attitude, Philippe hires him as his care-take. Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.Directed by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!I kept on hearing about this film for long time and am glad I took the decision to watch the film. There are so many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score that gels with mood of the film !!!

A Magnificent Film,"A French movie with English subtitles enters the finicky American movie market with two strikes against it.It's French -- strike one.It has subtitles -- strike two.Which is a crying shame, because one of the year's most enjoyable and uplifting films has pretty much come and vanished from theaters, unable to garner much attention during another summer filled with mindless action adventure ""thrillers"" and sleep-inducing ""comedies."" The Intouchables is a marvelous film. Carried by two outstanding lead performances by Francois Cluzet (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Cy (who deserves an Oscar nomination for a movie-stealing performance), this film has wit, candor, humor, sadness, and ultimately great inspiration. The film's credibility is boosted by it being based on a true story.Cluzet plays a quadriplegic, which means he is confined to a wheelchair unable to feel any sensation below his neck. If there's any upside, it's that he's also very wealthy, giving him considerable options that would not otherwise be available to a person of lesser means.Cluzet is utterly bored with his life, not the least of which has anything to do with his physical impairment. One senses that even if he were not parked in a wheelchair, he would still need something more. A great deal more, in fact. What Cluzet needs is stimulation, excitement, and most of all – someone he can call a friend.He finds all of this in the unlikeliest of places.Omar Cy plays the part of unemployed street thug to absolute perfection. He's a Senegalese immigrant languishing in the slums of Paris burdened with typical urban family difficulties -- poverty, drug abuse, lack of hope and opportunity. One can imagine that there are many Omar Cy's living as second-class citizens throughout the modern world. In fact, the city here may be Paris. But it could just as easily be Sao Paulo or Chicago. He meets Cluzet in what can only be described as an unexpected encounter, and the two men begin to engage in an uneasy, but captivating friendship.Everyone can see what's coming next. And that's perfectly okay. Initially indifferent to Cluzet's condition, Cy will ultimately come to care deeply for the man who is not just an employer, but a pathway out of pointlessness. The man in the chair becomes a muse and means of escape, an emotional and spiritual home for a foreigner who instantly resumes the role of ""immigrant"" once he steps back beyond the threshold of Cluzet's luxurious apartment and back onto the streets of Paris.The two men desperately need each other, in completely different ways. Eventually, they engage on a bucket list of activities, bonding in the process, allowing the rest of us to go along for the ride. And what a joyous ride it is.Critics have correctly pointed out this film gives a somewhat sanitized depiction of what being without the use of one's arms and legs must be like. While most of the film focuses on the role of caregiver, we are constantly reminded (or perhaps, I simply could not get it out of my mind) that not every quadriplegic receives such meticulous physical care nor emotional support. It helps to have money, no matter who you are.But I was willing to overlook this and enjoy a film full of energy, comedy, and ultimately of happiness.Admittedly, the conclusion of the film seems all too neat and tidy. But again, I am going to give the filmmakers a pass here for reasons you may understand only if you see the film, which enables audiences to come and appreciate how important people are to other people. After all, we are allowed to enjoy an uplifting film every once in a while. Never mind that it's all somewhat contrived.One of my barometers in judging a film comes with a fundamental question. Namely, do I think about the film the next day, and perhaps the next.I did. I must admit I was moved emotionally by this film. So was everyone else in the audience, from the reactions I saw. I laughed. I teared up. And, I rejoiced in the end.Call me naive, but I wish all life ended just like it does in the movies. I know -- it doesn't.But that won't stop me from dreaming and enjoying the fantasy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

There where few small moments when movie felt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be happy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie Driss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that they show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A good Surprise.,"Before watching this movie, I was a little apprehensive as the movie was in French (although I find the language romantic).

'The Intouchable' is truly a fun, entertaining and meaningful movie.The actors are great and unlike other movies I have watched recently, there is no over acting on their part. Every character adds to the colorfulness of the movie and the movie obviously was sure how the plot would go from beginning to end like most great novels. Since it is based on a true story, it makes you wonder how two people from two totally different world find a friend in such condition. I do not know how much this movie achieved, award wise but I am positive, it is a movie for all people who watch movies for all reasons.This movie may not make the adrenaline going like Skyfall but no doubt about it, it is just as good.

He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH.

Well That Came Out Of The Blue,"My taste in movies is pretty narrow. Untouchables was recommended to me and about 10 mins I could tell that it was going to be at the very least a worthwhile watch even though its not what would typically be on my 'To Watch' list.Give me low budget mind-bending sci Fi, and I'll be satisfied with anything you could throw at me. While I enjoy typical dramas on occasion, you'd rarely see me mark one more than a 6 or 7. Even something like 'The Father' had to have a certain twisty element like it did to work for me.To be brutally honest 'Intouchable' is far from an original movie. The 'odd-couple who end up bringing out the best in each other' trope has been done a million times.Yet Untouchable feels fresh and unique somehow. The acting is excellent, as is the direction, cinematography, music and sound.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work..,"The Intouchables (2011) :
Brief Review -This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work. The Intouchables is based on a true story of an quadriplegic rich man who finds a true friend in one of his hired reckless caretaker. The film is a big story but definitely it is time consuming as the narrative is strictly modified within 112 minutes. There is fun, there is love, there is life, there are problems and then there is a friendship bond and humanity values. I won't deny the fact that the story isn't overwhelming at all, of course it is predictable and too simple. But sometimes simple things works. The problem i have with the film is the hype creted by audience about it. When i am watching a film with IMDb Rating of 8.5/10 and also the Rank 44 film in IMDb Top Rated Films WW i expect something sensational or outstanding and this predictable tale is surely underwhelming by far. Critics didn't admire this film as much as audience and i would like to go with critics for this film (I always don't agree with Critics) at least. The Intouchables lacks the attractive elements but it is Highly entertaining flick by all means. It has laughters on consistent basis. Some of them are vulgar, some are organic and some are outdated but that all keeps it engaging. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put up fine performances and lovable chemistry. The background score works pleasantly while Cinematography is okay. Olivier Nakace and Eric Toodano has made a very good film but looking at all the acclaim it recieved globally it is certainly below my expectations. Maybe attending the biographical story didn't let them use cinematic Liberty upto the course but i have seen so many Biographicals being one of the greatest films of all time, haven't you? There is definitely something less in the film but if you can neglect that then there's lot to enjoy in The Untouchables for sure.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Obvious yet inexplicably entertaining,"For some reason I wasn't so into all the hype about this movie. I feel like I've seen this story before. Think Rain Man, I am Sam and so forth. My wife wanted to watch it and I bought it for her as a gift and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.First of all...I do not understand French...but I won't watch dubbed films. So we watched it in French with English subtitles. The humour does come across, although I'm sure I missed a bit of it. Referring specifically to some possibly French or Parisian in-jokes.The flow of the movie was good, the translated script funny - even witty at times. The acting was better than what you generally expect from your standard Hollywood movie.What I did like about Driss's character is that he doesn't dance around the fact that his new boss is a paraplegic...at all. The bond that evolves between the Philippe & Driss is brought across genuinely...for the most part. I think a 90 minute movie will have a tough time to bring across the core of the relationship between these two characters, but they actors and the directors do a good job.Overall it's a movie to watch and feel good about yourself, whilst at the same time you are reminded to appreciate the things you have; served with a healthy dose of humour, a dash or two of romance and a smidgen of those earnest, emotional realities of life. A feel-good movie, one can actually feel good about having watched.Cheers, OlivierZ",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Very high influx of the Africans in France!,"I will not share enthusiasm for this film. I saw other reviews. I know it is politically correct to help people. And I did not think of the disabled people. I was thinking about millions of Africans and other immigrants trying to come into France, specially Paris and trying to find a job. How many will succeed, one per cent? This film focuses on a aristocrat who hires a poor African from the suburbs of Paris. How often that happens in the real life? Not that often.Plot is, well OK, but not that realistic, and that is what I hate.

I am ready to review it every year. Using the example of the main characters, we are convinced that life is one and everyone can live it the way they want. After this movie , I loved life even more ! He teaches that it is always worth evaluating a person by his appearance and making hasty conclusions. We also understand that it is not worth feeling sorry for people with disabilities. They are people just like us ! Such people are admirable. They don't get depressed, on the contrary, they value this life more than us and we should learn a lot from them. Who would have thought that such different people could make each other's lives so bright??! This comedy is perfect for family viewing. I advise everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A wonderful movie!,"Well, what can I say, it's beautiful... A beautiful, kind story. Two people from different worlds became friends. Well-chosen actors, beautifully shot. The film makes you think about life, values, family, friends. I think initially that Driss, that Phillip decided to communicate with each other only for profit. One needed money, the other needed a person next to him who wouldn't feel sorry for him. And Driss does it perfectly, treats Phillip like an ordinary person, without any problems. But he also takes care of him and does all the work to take care of him. And Phillip at the same time pays him and helps to sell Dris' paintings so that he also gets an income...When Driss tells Phillip about his life, it becomes very sad to think that people still live in other countries.. They give their children... But I think it only hardened him.It was just as sad to see what Phillip's life was like after Dris's departure. There came people he was avoiding, those who treated him like a sick man.Also in parallel throughout the film they show other characters and their situations, it is also interesting to watch and distract a little from the main story.And of course, I can't help but say about my favorite scene from the movie, I think it's not just my favorite.. This is, of course, the one where Driss dances at Phillip's birthday party...To sum up: a film about true friendship, about a person's deep feelings for a person.It's also nice to know that this is a film based on real events. I always love that at the end of such films they show photos of real people. It's interesting to compare how the heroes seem to have been picked up.I RECOMMEND the movie to watch!The film is about good and I want to mention here that Grimas and Odysseus are doing a lot of good.

"A feel-good, life-affirming picture that does its job and does it well.","'Untouchable (2011)' is a feel-good, life-affirming picture that does its job and does it well, delivering on its early promise of a touching central relationship that really does warm the heart. I can honestly say that I had a genuine smile on my face for most of the run-time, thanks mainly to Omar Sy's endearing and energetic performance. It also helps that the picture is legitimately funny and has a realistic edge that prevents it from slipping too far into sentimentality. Even though, at its core, the story is bare-bones and familiar, there's enough fun to be had that the fairly basic concept can be overlooked and the pure joy of two friends laughing together, despite their many differences, can really shine through. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Compared to U.S Remake (The Upside),"The Intouchables / The Upside (remake of ""Intouchables"")The Upside is a movie directed by Neil Burger. The writer is Jon Hartmereis but his screenplay is based on The Intouchables, inspired by a true story. The two original writers of ""Intouchables"" are French writer/director duo Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. The American version is staring Kevin Hart (a well-known stand-up comedian turned actor) as Dell Scott (the caregiver of Phillip Lacasse), Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame) as Phillip Lacasse (a paralysed person on a wheelchair), Nicole Kidman as Yvonne Pendleton, (Phillip's devoted personal assistance), Golshifteh Farahani as Maggie (Phillip's attractive physical trainer).Dell and Phillipe have a good relationship between music, women, etcetera. In their relationship a lot of ups and downs happen. Phillipe has a surprise party organized by Yvonne, but Phillipe wanted to have nothing for his birthday. Phillipe ask dell to break things for him because he was mad and uncapable from his quadriplegic condition. I found this scene emotional and heartbreaking. This scene was one of the best improvements to the original French version.Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano are a duo writer. Their 3 other popular film are C'est la vie! (2017), The Specials (2019) and Tellement proches (2009) which they all made together! Intouchables is the most well like by the public. The English version is funnier at times, while the French version is more emotional between the two main characters.The Upside is a comedy. A lot of moment in The Upside has humor. The Intouchables and The Upside has still a lot of differences. In The Intouchables Driss (Dell in The Upside) likes Magalie (Yvone in The Upside) and flirts with here a lot. In The Upside Dell (Driss in The Intouchables) is making a lot of joke but Phillipe is more serious. But in The Intouchables the both are laughing and telling jokes more equally which makes for the stronger bond. It is a touching story, and fun that is based on a real life unlikely friendship like the Green Book.I will rate both 9/10. I recommend them.The Upside

"Interracial, Interclass Brom-Com Buddy Flick","I had to watch Intouchables because I am on a mission to see all of the imdb top 250. Turns out that this list tells much more about the viewers than the films.Intouchables is a case in point. First off, despite being a rom-com (more specifically, a bromance buddy flick), it ranks, nearly a decade after its launch, #44. Must be a masterpiece, something so unique and original that it has never been done in romcom before, right? Wrong.I regret to report that all of the comedy of this brom-com revolves around the defeat or support of deeply entrenched stereotypes of black people. If you invite them to the opera or a classical music concert, they will disrupt it. The quality of women of most importance to Africans in Paris is white booty. They eat Nutella with spoons out of a jar. They have never seen a full-sized bathtub. They live in HLM (Habitations à Loyer Modéré, aka housing projects) with literally neighborhoods of siblings, all being cared for by a stressed-out single mother, as all of the fathers have disappeared. Black males resolve problems through resort to violence. But they love to dance (to Earth, Wind & Fire!) and are always up for a good ho-op. Please just put them behind the wheel of a Maserati Quattroporte, pass the doobie, and let the fun begin!But, hey, it's all good: because one of these guys proves to the rich white world that a person corresponding to the above stereotype can also be a Mensch!My guess is that most of the 10 ratings of this flick were given by people who have as friends no persons of color. These inflated ratings reflect the viewers' own pleasant surprise at how nice (and clean!) black people can be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

I want to hug Omar Sy and François Cluzet,"The film ""An Unexpected Friendship"" gilds the heart in addition to touching it. Few movies are able to mix humor and drama as well as French directors Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano's gripping tale.With its perceptive and compassionate depiction of relationships and life's surprises, the film provides a delightful experience. It is based on the friendship that actually existed between two guys from quite different backgrounds. It takes us on a journey through disappointments and victories, demonstrating the incredible ways in which an unexpected relationship can transform lives.The performances by actors Omar Sy and François Cluzet are funny and heartfelt. A true and endearing relationship is created by Cluzet, who plays the wealthy and disabled man Philippe, and Sy, who plays Driss, the vivacious and unexpected caregiver. One of the movie's best aspects is their on-screen connection, which also adds a lot to the emotional impact.The dialogue in the script is sharply written and frequently witty and smart. Without losing its soul, the film is able to capture the best parts of both laughter and tears.

That's What I like About Him,"""Intouchables"" is a very unique movie. If I were to describe all the events that happen in the movie, you would think it was a TV mini-series full of episodic misadventures. But, with the way the movie edits its scenes, it moves along at a clip, never wasting a minute. Hearing that, you may think that the film is action packed. But no, it is a very mellow movie. The film is at its strongest when our two main characters are just hanging out. Whenever Philipe and Driss are sharing screentime together, it is a good time. It is whenever the movie jumps to a conflict it is less interesting.I'm glad to see that so many people enjoyed this relatively small French film from 2011. I genuinely wish I would have liked it more, I just found the conflicts with the kid, the egg and the family to be draining.

From what I can remember the main actors were fine, so this is no criticism to them.I assume the film was supposed to be fun, and lighthearted, but it only succeeded in reproducing racist, classist, toxically male, and other stereotypes.^^ I almost gave examples of why I did not like the film, but I remembered I have said it all before, and to quote Toni Morrison:""The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction.

Paris in both ways,"It's Pygmalion again. This ex-convict from the dangerous suburbs of Paris gets a job as assistant to a paralyzed millionaire, Philippe. Of course they make friends. Of course they learn from each other's backgrounds.

The power of companionship,"Intouchables' message is simple but powerful and touching nonetheless. People need companionship. And when they find themselves in a dark place, that's even more important. Even though the plot develops like a typical Hollywood-y romantic comedy (two people meet, they have a good time, then they break up and finally they are together again), in this case it's about a different kind of relationship, the friendship between two men, a quadriplegic, Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and his caretaker, Driss (Omar Sy). Driss' role goes way beyond helping Philippe overcome his physical limitations, he shows him how to have fun and enjoy himself. The movie's biggest asset is the performances and the great chemistry between the two leads. The comedic aspect is stronger than the dramatic, as the latter can get too simplistic, plus it can lose touch with reality due to its excessive optimism, not to mention it doesn't avoid various cliches.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

A French Look At Race And Class,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat (François Cluzet) hires a young man from the projects (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker.The Independent called it a ""a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?""While ""the Independent"" is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as ""The Birdcage"" (at least the American version, if not the French one).Now, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250.

Mentally......grimace,"This is a great story about two true friends, seemingly so different.Francois Cluzet played a disabled man who has lost the meaning of life. He believed that since he was disabled, he no longer existed in the world. He hired nurses not only to look after him, but also to help him morally. After all, his days passed the same way. Parsing letters, writing letters to his beloved, whom he could not even call. Probably, before Driss appeared, he didn't even want to live.Omar Sy played a wonderful man named Driss. It was Driss who taught Philippe to look at the world with different eyes. Through the eyes of an optimistic person who, even in a wheelchair, can hope for the best. He was real, without the mask of a cultured person, he was from a simple family in which, although there were cruel laws, they were correct and taught life. He looked at the world through the eyes of an optimistic person.The director's work was excellent. Beautiful landscapes, everything was shown so well. Simply wonderful. In particular, the parachute flight and car ride at the beginning and end of the film were very memorable.The music was pleasing to the ear. So calm, she approached every moment she played.The film is wonderful, amazing, kind, sincere. It's worth watching for everyone. This is the truth of life. Motivational film and motivating characters. It's a shame that this film wasn't nominated for an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
best movie ever,"For starters, this movie is a true story. The film is about two men who come from different social classes. One being Driss who is from the suburbs around the city, and Philippe who lives in the center of Paris. The narrative of this film begins with the last scene of the film at the beginning of the film. The movie essentially unfolds as a recollection leading up to this particular moment. Throughout the story, we learn that Driss serves as a caretaker for Philippe. As the plot progresses, their bond gradually transforms from a professional association into a deep friendship. From the first time watching this movie in 7th grade it has remained in my list of my all time favorite movies. Its significance is not solely due to French being my primary language, but rather stems from the profound morals and lessons that I have taken away from this movie. Throughout this movie life's challenges, compassion, and the inherent beauty that surrounds us, that we take for granted.I truly recommend this movie to everyone, but especially, to people who are learning the French language. I have gone to a French school for the majority of my life, so the way I was taught French is very different from those who have been taught in an American school teaching system. Something this movie has to offer for the people learning the language is the non textbook French. This movie accurately represents the French language of this generation. In other words it will greatly help with improving french speaking. Now for everyone else who is just watching to watch. This movie accurately represents French people and not by the negative stereotypes everyone constantly associates the French with (rude, mean etc..). The dark humor and the expressions in the dialogue is exquisite and hilarious. Watching this movie while being so far away from my french environment, makes me feel comfortable and at home.Although based on a true story, the actors portraying Philippe and Driss showcased remarkable talent in encapsulating the emotions and real-life experiences inherent in the making of a profoundly wholesome and authentic bond between two individuals. I find it fascinating how society categorizes both of them, and has deemed them as lower class. In the sense that Driss is just a lowlife, criminal that is untrustworthy, and Phillipe being deemed as incapacitated. Despite these biased perceptions of their background, they are people who are incapable of doing anything for themselves. Both of them together prove society wrong.Their unique friendship showcases to the public how two people from diverse backgrounds enriches a friendship, gives us experience and learns different things about each other, whether it was through them sharing their different music taste, or trying different activities for each other, and going out of their comfort zones. Through the respect they have fortified for each other. Driss treated Philippe like any other human, and not treating him differently because of his condition. While Philippe refrains from associating Driss with his past mistakes, acknowledging that everyone has the potential to grow and change, from the person they used to be in the past. Lastly, being there for each other emotionally, whether it was Philippe understanding and encouraging Driss to go back home and take care of his family that needed him. Or Driss being there for Philippe when he had his panic attacks, and soothing him.In essence, their relationship stands as a testament to the transformative power of friendship, breaking societal barriers and teaching us invaluable lessons about acceptance, empathy, and the capacity for personal growth. It also becomes a profound platform for mutual growth and learning. You most definitely will not regret spending one hour and fifty two minutes of your life watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Over-rated,"This film is based on a true story: in Paris, a poor Senegalese immigrant (Driss) becomes the live-in personal caretaker of a very wealthy man who is quadriplegic (Philippe). Despite their differences, they connect well (predictably).Occasionally, the film does well with that winning premise: the snobs against the slobs. Some moments are pleasant and mildly moving though not as hilarious as they could be. Still, it was difficult to be taken into this film mainly because of the characterization of Driss. Frequently, he's rude, overbearing, arrogant, and bullying. The film goes too far when Driss is disciplining others who seem spoiled when he himself seems to need the most discipline. Nonetheless, actor Omar Sy does a fine job in the role.The viewer hardly knows about Philippe's character and why he would take so well to Driss although scenes of upper-class stuffiness around Philippe might give some hints. Knowing more about Philippe might have helped.Apparently, this movie is a phenomenon in France . This must be one of those rare times I miss out on French culture which I often admire.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Hilarious Comedy about a Serious Subject - Deftly Dodges Formulaic Pitfalls for the Genre,My Friday Night Netflix Treat. Needed a dose of joy and got it with the 2011 French film The Intouchables.

Face of Humanity,"Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Mystery,"Untouchable is the cinematic equivalent of lukewarm tea: inoffensive, predictable, and inexplicably beloved by millions. A true mystery.The film follows the tired trope of the ""unlikely friendship"", this time between a wealthy quadriplegic and a streetwise drifter, hitting every cliché along the way. Groundbreaking it ain't. Allegedly based on a real story, though the filmmakers decided that real life wasn't clichéd enough and sprinkled in every stereotype they could find.Omar Sy's Driss is an exaggerated caricature, from his jobless status to his obligatory petty theft when casually pockets a Fabergé egg while being interviewed. Naturally, only to give it to his overworked mother, who is drowning in an excessive number of children. Cliché.The film sticks rigidly to the ""unlikely buddies"" formula. At first, Driss is inappropriate, brash, and completely unfit for the job. But wait! Just when you think Philippe might give up, a miraculous transformation begins. Through a series of manufactured heartwarming moments, the two start to bond. Driss, with his street smarts and carefree attitude, teaches Philippe how to really live. Philippe, in return, introduces Driss to art and classical music - because, naturally, he's never encountered culture before.Safe, shallow, and designed to make audiences feel good without provoking real thought, The ""Intouchables"" is not terrible, just profoundly unoriginal.But apparently, if you slap on an uplifting soundtrack and sprinkle in some ""deep"" life lessons, people will eat it up. Given its absurdly high praise, a rating of 1 feels entirely justified.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

At the crossroads of desperation and need, their paths intertwine in the most unexpected manner, proving that first impressions often mislead.One of the standout elements of ""Intouchables"" is the electric chemistry between François Cluzet (Philippe) and Omar Sy (Driss). Sy, in particular, lights up the screen with his charm, wit, and raw energy, making it easy for viewers to understand how he breathed life back into Philippe's somber existence. Their dynamic remains refreshingly genuine and endearing, driving the narrative forward and capturing the essence of an unexpected friendship.The film masterfully balances humor with depth. The comedic moments are not forced but stem from the organic interplay between the characters, making the audience laugh one moment and then ponder deep-seated societal issues the next. Its impeccable score, featuring classics like Ludovico Einaudi's ""Una Mattina,"" further adds depth, weaving a sonic tapestry that elevates the storyline.However, no movie is without its critiques. Some might argue that certain aspects of the film simplify complex societal issues, and it occasionally treads the line between genuine representation and the risk of perpetuating stereotypes. Nonetheless, its overall message of friendship, understanding, and redemption shines through, making it worthy of its acclaim.In conclusion, ""Intouchables"" is a must-watch, not merely as a feel-good movie but as a reflection on the depth and breadth of human connection.

wow,"Driss is applying for unemployment benefits, and in order to get it, he must prove that he tried to get a job in vain. Therefore, when he came to the interview at the house of the rich Philip, Driss tried to do everything so that he would not be hired: he was rude to everyone, joked rudely and mocked the wheelchair user. Of course, a disabled person who needs at least someone asks Driss to start tomorrow. He feels like no one else that this can be the beginning of a wonderful friendship.As I know, this is a real story about the friendship of completely different people. If we leave the social problems of Afro-French and the heartbreaking drama about a disabled person, then there will remain a tragicomedy with a pure and captivating in its simplicity main idea. If a Senegalese criminal with criminal habits and a boring disabled millionaire with refined manners can really be friends happily ever after, then it is quite possible to find friends in our world and this world still has a chance.

Walking the line between sentimentality and being indelicate,"""Intouchable"" is an entertaining movie about the improbable friendship between a disabled miljonaire (Philippe played by Francois Cluzet) and a jobless immigrant (Driss played by Omar Sy).There are lots of films about improbable friendships, so what makes this one so good?Before anwering this question let me make crystal clear that ""Intouchables"" is in no way the only good movie about an improbable friendship / relationship. Another example is ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989, Bruce Beresford).A comedy about a serious subject often has to walk a thin line between being too sentimental (the jokes are too decent) and being indelicate (the jokes are too rude). This film walks this line. Another film that managed to do so is ""La vita è bella"" (1997, Roberto Benigni)Apart from walking the thin line between being too decent and too rude another condition for this kind of films to be good is that both characters grow towards each other, not one always being right and the other always being wrong.Applying this last criterium to ""Intouchable"", Philippe not only teaches Driss a thing or two about high culture, but Driss also teaches Philippe about popular culture.Applying the same criterium to ""Driving Miss Daisy"", it is not only the driver who teaches Miss Daisy to become less racist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

An Uplifting and Heartfelt Story of Unlikely Friendship and Overcoming Adversity,"*The Intouchables* (2011), directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a touching and humorous French film based on a true story. It chronicles the unconventional friendship between Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic man, and Driss (Omar Sy), an ex-con from the Parisian suburbs who becomes his caregiver. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, they form a deep bond that transforms both of their lives.Omar Sy's performance as Driss is magnetic and full of life, injecting energy and humor into every scene. His portrayal earned him a César Award (the French equivalent of an Oscar) for Best Actor. Sy's charm and comic timing contrast beautifully with Cluzet's more reserved, nuanced performance as Philippe, who learns to embrace life again through Driss' influence. Their chemistry is the heart of the film and makes the growing friendship feel authentic and heartfelt.*The Intouchables* shines in its balance of humor and emotion, never letting the film become overly sentimental or preachy. It treats disability and social differences with sensitivity while emphasizing the importance of human connection and understanding. The film is not about pity but about two men learning from each other, with both characters experiencing personal growth through their relationship.Visually, the film captures the opulence of Philippe's life in sharp contrast with the gritty reality of Driss' background, underscoring the divide between them while simultaneously showing how irrelevant those differences become as their friendship deepens.While *The Intouchables* has been widely praised for its humor and heart, some critics have noted its simplified portrayal of class and race issues. Nonetheless, its message of empathy and the joy of shared humanity resonates strongly, making it a feel-good film that has charmed audiences worldwide.Overall, *The Intouchables* is a heartwarming and inspirational film that celebrates friendship, human resilience, and the ability to find joy in life despite adversity.

Trust me,"When people for some reason are limited in their abilities and cannot live their own lives, they either begin to take an excessively active part in someone else's life, or try to realize themselves through another person. So, for example, single mothers act, having one beloved child, which becomes the meaning of their whole life. Or housewives merging into their husbands. Or that's why grandmothers at the entrance love to gossip so much. Or remember the hero of the movie ""The Benefactor"" played by Richard Gere. However, it is possible to realize oneself through another person both in a bad and in a good way.The paralyzed aristocrat Philip, whose life is not to be envied at all, is sent by the Lord God himself, the gouging Driss. It is only in the opinion of others that Driss is the least suitable for the role of a nurse - a criminal past, uneducated, from the lower strata of society, and generally colored. Maybe Driss is not entirely attentive to details, but he has an excellent sense of humor and quickly ""cuts"" what exactly Philip needs - namely, fresh air, literally and figuratively. He is trying to restore Philippe's taste for life, to diversify it with the help of such simple but important little things - puffs with a joint, a quick drive through the evening streets of Paris, erotic massage. And Philip needs such adventures much more than the close attention of other - ""correct"", but boring to the point of toothache - nurses who also feel sorry for him. Pity and treating him like a porcelain figurine do not give Philip pleasure, but rather only irritate him. But he is delighted with the carelessness of Driss, who without a second thought puts a cigarette into Philip's mouth and rolls it at an exorbitant speed. Philip gets pleasure when Driss treats him like an equal (what a Senegalese thug can do, a wheelchair user can do). This new life experience gives Philip the opportunity, at least for a while, to escape from his sad thoughts - he does not spend all his evenings in the living room, dictating high-flown letters to his secretary. Driss succeeds in changing Philip's life for the better, helping him get rid of the fears and insecurities that prevent him from establishing a personal life. Charming Driss wins the sympathy of not only Philip himself, but also other inhabitants of his house. It is quite obvious that he does his job not just for money, but also gets real pleasure from it. Quite naturally, the relationship between Philip and Driss goes beyond the ""customer-servicing staff"" and turns into a friendly one.On the example of Driss, we are once again convinced that it is not always worth evaluating a person by his appearance and making hasty conclusions. Here we see Driss in a sweatshirt and baggy jeans, and we are immediately tempted to label him as a dim-witted bum. But as soon as he changes into a suit and shoes, he immediately transforms. And when he incendiary dances to rhythmic music, setting the tone at first for Philip's boring and official birthday party, you can't take your eyes off him at all. This is the talent of Driss - defiantly, but organically deviate from the protocol, giving Philip the opportunity to truly feel alive. What can I say - Driss is just a unique character. For all his outward rudeness, he has amazing plasticity and acting skills. Even such a boring and unloved activity by many men as shaving, he manages to turn into something exciting. That's why Philip is so attached to Driss - because he ""breaks"" the standards that Philip is already fed up with.Through Driss, the filmmakers are perfectly able to broadcast the installation to the viewer - you should not feel sorry for Philip. He is limited in his physical capacity, but not at all limited in his inner qualities. On the contrary, such a person is worthy of admiration - he does not slide into depression, misanthropy, but, on the contrary, is very strong in spirit, has optimism and retains human dignity. Of course, we must pay tribute to the fact that Philip has access to a lot that is not available to other people in his position, constrained in their means, because Philip is very rich. But, as the French say, ""se la vie."" We deal with what is. The stronger the contrast of the main characters - the rich and the poor, the aristocrat and the uncouth resident of a high-rise building from an emigrant district, white and black. And this contrast ""holds"" the viewer throughout the film, as well as a very strict adherence to the framework of the tragicomedy genre. The result is a very balanced mix with neither one nor the other outweighing the scales.The Untouchables made me associate with another film made 5 years after the release of The Untouchables, namely Me Before You. There we also deal with a paralyzed aristocrat who is hired a nurse, only in ""Me Before You"" the role of nurse is not an African-French, but a young, flowering girl who also manages to do for the protagonist what was not possible before. Others.""The Untouchables"" is the perfect movie for a pleasant evening viewing when you want something like that. It is like the quintessence of everything French - simple but elegant. The film is moderately light, moderately touches on social topics without tedious moralizing and teaching, moderately provides food for thought, and, most importantly, is based on real events. ""Trust me,"" says Driss. And there is no better slogan for the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A heartwarming film about the unique friendship,"At the job interview for the caregiver of Philippe, he is annoyed by the applicants whose answers are all stereotypical. I understand why he chose Driss among them. For the disability he suffers, the hardest challenge, more than pain or inconvenience, would be boredom.Even though Philippe is a rich and important man, Driss doesn't care at all. Philippe seems to feel comfortable because Driss shows no pity that would embarrass him. In Philippe's slight smile, we see how he is amused by Driss's behavior. Driss is a brisk and responsive man. Philippe has fun with Driss's blunt remarks on things, like painting, opera, and classical music. They enjoy their witty exchange.Being completely opposite at first glance, they in fact share some kind of recklessness. They feel they have nothing to lose because Philippe has lost her wife, and Driss is in low life. But their friendship gradually encourages each other to overcome that.The tempo is well controlled. Emotional scenes are slow and comical scenes are quick. It is like a piece of pleasant music. The indoor and outdoor scenes make a good contrast. Philippe sometimes feels suffocated in his palace and wants Driss to take him outside for fresh air. The shot where the two men run on the wheelchair is very exhilarating.You might expect the film to deal with social issues, like disability or race, but it does not really. The film is about friendship and how it helps you overcome difficulties in your life. And it is truly heartwarming.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

heartwarming and humorous film,"""Untouchable,"" originally titled ""Intouchables"" in French, directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a heartwarming and humorous film based on a true story. Released in 2011, it stars François Cluzet as Philippe, a wealthy Parisian quadriplegic, and Omar Sy as Driss, his caregiver from the projects. This unlikely pair forms the central relationship that drives the narrative and gives the film its emotional depth.The film's greatest triumph lies in its ability to balance humor and sensitivity in handling its subject matter. It avoids the pitfall of becoming overly sentimental or patronizing. Instead, it presents a realistic, yet uplifting portrayal of the challenges faced by people with disabilities, without defining them solely by these challenges.Omar Sy's performance is a standout. He brings an infectious energy and charisma to the role of Driss, providing much of the film's comedic relief while also displaying a surprising depth of emotion. His chemistry with François Cluzet is remarkable, and their interactions are both believable and heartening. Cluzet, on the other hand, delivers a performance that is both powerful and nuanced, portraying Philippe as a man of dignity, intelligence, and wit.The direction by Nakache and Toledano is skillful, with a keen eye for both comedic and dramatic moments. They succeed in creating a film that feels both light-hearted and meaningful, an achievement that is not easily accomplished. The pacing is well-managed, ensuring that the film remains engaging throughout its duration.Cinematically, ""Untouchable"" is beautifully shot, capturing the essence of Parisian life from the opulent world of Philippe to the vibrant streets of Driss's neighborhood. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of classical and contemporary music, complements the film's tone perfectly, enhancing both its emotional and comedic moments.One criticism, however, might be that the film occasionally relies on stereotypes, particularly in its depiction of Driss's background. While these moments do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the film, they are a reminder of the delicate balance required when portraying cross-cultural relationships.In conclusion, ""Untouchable"" is a genuinely touching film that manages to tackle serious themes with humor and grace. It's a story about friendship, resilience, and the capacity of human connection to transcend societal boundaries. The film's ability to make audiences laugh and cry, often simultaneously, is a testament to its quality and its universal appeal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

It is a tale of friendship, love, and care that is too often lacking in an industry increasingly obsessed with grimdark lifeless cinema. My partner is disabled and this film has helped me see that nobody should be treated like an invalid but as the whole person they are.It is not perfect, but it is very good and continues to be good every time you watch it.

Movies of this class are rare,"In brief, it's a heart-touching story about love and friendship. It has an amazing soundtrack. The masterful pieces from Ludovico Einaudi's Uno Mattina blends with the tone of the movie exceptionally. Omar Sy's brilliant portrayal is supported by its screenplay and the fantastic directing.

Simply must watch!,"I will try my best to explain how much I love this movie because it is very hard. This movie is not just an ordinary movie about two great friends; it is about how two completely different people became so close and supportive of each other. I have watched this movie, so many times I even can't keep counting. This is an excellent example of how a strong bond between two people can be and how one's illness can't affect their friendship. Philippe being a high-class persona, becomes friends with Dris who is far away from high class and is just Philippe's care taker.

Exceptional Movie So Far,I have finished watching it right now and i am unable to describe in words how great this movie is i have never watched a French movie before actually i am from Pakistan and i grew up watching just Hollywood Movies or British but recently I've came across intoucables on IMDB and i decided to watch it and just now as I finished watching it. To be honest i have never enjoyed so much watching a movie ever before like this one part of me so pleased with movie and other part of me just feels upset because genuinely i feel like it's too short i wish it could be more lengthy like 4 or may be 6 hours so on I've could never be bored of it watching it's just Exceptional incredible beautiful Movie.

Malii1313,"A very multifaceted film and at the same time it shows how two different people can become close to each other despite their different statuses in life. In addition, the film shows us how the lives of the main characters can change into one. One of the main characters is too correct in life. The second is a completely opposite personality. Also, negligence in work led to the fact that the main character realized that there was no pity for him, thereby he realized that this brought him back a little to normal life. In conclusion, I want to say that the acting was at the highest level. I would have watched a continuation of this story and it's a pity that Grimas and Odysseus were not back in 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Cozy feelings,"I'd been meaning to see this movie for a long time. When I finally did tonight, boy, it did not disappoint. I cried for a good 10 minutes after it ended.
I think the soundtracks are the winner of this movie. Every track is spot on. Every note of every song nails the scene.
Considering the plot of the movie, actors could have been easily over dramatic and theatrical. But the acting is really subtle yet brilliant. I believe this is one of the reasons why it's such a great movie. Both Omar Sy and François Cluzet are amazing actors.
Overall, a warm and happy movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A natural and lifelong friendship,"This film is an ode to a true friendship, two worlds colliding into a messy, lifelike unity. Driss and Philippe both fall into and eschew traditional stereotypes, with one being a crude suburbian and the other a sophisticated elite, yet never failing to relate to one another on a more human level. The comedic moments in this film feel true to life with wonderful character traits and emotions. The disability in this film is a core part of Philippe's life but it never overwhelms his identity nor does it consign him to a sob story, which is a portrayal to be commended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

The choices of soundtrack and camera work were simply impeccable.The story is definitely the highlight of this work, with each character having their moment to shine, especially with Driss interacting with each of them, making them more relatable to the audience.If you're unsure whether to watch it or not, just watch it-it will be well worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Didn't detect even ONE false note.,"I noticed some jaded critics on rotten tomatoes (generally very positive reviews but I wanted to read the critical ones to see WHAT they missed. it's what I do so I can see what makes one tick & their viewpoint) and wanted to address that first.What I think they wanted is to see more sorrow, heartache & troubling nature of being disabled (one mentioned the D/bell & butterfly which yeah, I've seen..I do appreciate but did NOT enjoy that one bit. Still, listen up.... this is NOT going in that direction for a reason!)
You do KNOW some films regarding similar subject matter have varying things to say as it's multifaceted just like our LIVES are.
We can be miserable, full of pity & sorrow one day & full of life & joy another. Thankfully all due to the variety life has to offer. No matter what your condition, physically or mentally.
So I'm clear, they in NO way try to gloss over the harsh reality of paralysis OR poverty.
I got that, think everyone did. But what of Humanity, what of friendship & of the power of hope, kindness? Is this not universal to all?Furthermore, to suggest there can be NO humor, emotion, attachment or soul to experiencing that ....then ALL we do is to shortchange human beings & life itself.
These actors were simply fabulous & I was not only a willing participant to join on both of their journeys but most of all, good to be mindful that this wonderfully touching film is based on a REAL friendship so to address any suggestion of it being maudlin or sentimental (it's neither) makes me wonder what is wrong with YOU.
We witness REAL struggle---even hopelessness. Again, who among us hasn't experienced this at least ONE moment in their life?
In fact, for me watching one of our main protagonists wonderfully celebrate the joys of dance while the paralyzed man's face registers clear unfettered elation.... but can't engage in such himself! (yeah...I love to dance) actually caused me strife when I thought...""...just WOW what if I couldn't dance OR hear music!"" Then next ""what a BLESSING it is I CAN!""
Have I counted my own blessings recently enough? Have any of us?So start counting your blessings & know that life CAN, in all likelihood, be FAR worse. If that's not a good message buried in a great real-life plot--of humanity, friendship, HUMOR, exhilaration of being ALIVE-- well then, apparently I've missed something. But no, really YOU do if this all escaped you. Deeper than it appears.Yes, you should see this. Don't waste your time on the American remake (the upside..I'm American, I saw it. I love Cranston but can't begin to compare! Know that missed the mark.
How happy I was to read these two amazing men are still friends today, so yeah, something we NEED for the times in which we live, affirmation of something that is good.
And maybe all coming from place of serious heartache & damage. Yeah, there's nothing manipulative here, I basically can't stand that sort of film...do not cheapen this one bit to compare it to lesser (someone on RT mentioned ""bucket list"" & I almost puked. Same goes for this critic's writing).
Then lastly, here is from an American that says IF you are going to object on basis of race, you must be one sad, lonely person looking for trouble that is NOT there. This is about 2 men, to me wouldn't matter if they were purple, race has NOTHING To do with it, we are all just people. So the ""real life gent"" wasn't African American? So what? WHO cares? it's a movie, NOT a documentary. I can't imagine anyone in the role of the caretaker than this actor, he imbues the part with his entire being. They both do. Overall, I see no flaw in this production whatsoever. I see why the French embraced it so fully & wonder why America felt remaking it rather than seeing is as I did tonight, the REAL deal, made any sense. I'm sure that part was financial, they wanted to cash in.
Just brilliant. Can't see how this didn't make nomination for every award going (and win it) but assume critics are often a breed most of us fail to understand, much less a snobby academy-award committee who often prefer odd esoteric material that in truth, they likely fail to understand themselves (or it's just plain political).
BRAVO to all involved, from script, direction, acting & final piece of work! I know I will give this a second viewing, maybe more as needed. I believe it's an honest & straightforward powerful elixir, in addition to all else it quite successfully aims to do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Fantastic heartwarming story,"I'm not one for leaving reviews and I shall not attempt to describe The Intouchables from a technical standpoint as is often the case with reviews, in terms of lightning and cinematography etc as I'm not the best judge in that sense. I do feel compelled however to comment on the film simply because I have not enjoyed a movie as much as this in a long time, especially a foreign language film which is very much a minority in my viewing history. It's a wonderful heartwarming story of two people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of bonds living in each other's pockets and it is also at times hilarious and I have not laughed so much for as long as I can remember.

But if someone in the future will tell me - ""From the Director of The Intouchables"", I would go for it.The only thing I found redundant in this movie was the way the story flows - a linear story-line structure would have suited me much better.

513th Review: One of the Front Runners For the 2013 Oscars,"Hilarious and moving, Intouchables is simply one of the best films of 2012. Based on a true story the unlikely pairing of an immensely wealthy quadriplegic with an African immigrant carer produces line after line and scene after scene that are genuinely funny (and I mean really funny not just a gentle smirk) and also wonderfully acted.It's a hard film to fault - it isn't over-sentimental or maudlin, but it makes us care - the drama could have been deeper and more dramatic but I, for one, like that it is a genuine odd couple, buddy comedy - it is simply a pleasure to watch - I have seen it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around.It is also, significantly, one of the most affirming film about disability to date - this is not a film looking for your sympathy or tears - but neither does it gloss over or veer away from disability - but it shouts that disability is not inability or shaming - it is certainly a very strong contender for Best Foreign Film and expect to see an American version (Dustin Hoffman would be great - they are almost twins) soon....",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

"black or white ?

This film is about friendship of two very different persons, no matter if they are black or white.I think, that the black man (Omar Sy) was a very good actor in this role, and the white man (Francois Cluzet)was a good actor in this role as well.And I think that racism will be no more virulent only when people are no more interested in the question if a black, yellow, white or mixed person plays a certain role, but only in the question if he/ she plays the role good or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Aujourd'hui plus qu'hier et bien moins que demain.,"A touching version of a true story that could have only been made by the French combined with a sweetness that only celluloid can deliver! I chanced upon this movie on a Saturday evening, and having loved the language all my life, I decided to give it a go. And, over a period of two hours, my life, my world view, my sensibilities went, for the lack of a better word, *boom* The performances were not good, they were subtle, understated, deep, and so incroyably French! While most say - and, I agree - the movie rides on Omar Sy's very capable shoulders, the music is the Horse that Omar Sy rides on.Ludovico Einaudi could not have done a better job if he had the invisible hand helping him.If you want a deeply moving movie that makes you laugh out loud, helped along by a background of soulful classical music that gently intertwines with funk, or if you want a movie that pokes fun at art while being deeply reverent of it all at the same time, or if you just want a movie that simply ticks all the boxes and then creates some new ones - this will be it.And to the French sensibilities, I once again take my hat off!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Honest emotion and humane message,"If you are looking for an alternative to blockbuster superhero movies or Hollywood cookie-cutter romantic comedies, you can do no better than Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano's film, The Intouchables. Though it has aspects that are familiar and even formulaic, the film redeems itself with its honest emotion and humane message of how vastly different people can learn from each other. Hugely popular in France where it earned $280 million (the second highest grossing film in their history) and was nominated for nine Cesar Awards, The Intouchables can make you forget, however briefly, the day's headlines, and feel good once more about people and the world they inhabit.Omar Sy, César Best Actor Award winner, is Driss, a poor Senegalese man from the ghettos who is hired to take care of multimillionaire Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Based on a true story adapted from the memoir ""You Changed My Life"" by Abdel Sellou, Driss is an ex-con who served six months in prison for his part in a robbery and applied for the job in order to be eligible to receive government benefits after he was turned down. Surprisingly, Philippe hires Driss to be his caretaker, telling him that he likes people who ""tell it like it is"" without overt displays of pity or compassion.The film begins with Driss driving Phillipe's Maserati at dangerous speeds with Philippe next to him on the passenger seat. Stopped by the police, Driss tells the officers that his paralyzed friend must be taken to the hospital immediately as Philippe pretends to have a stroke. Exhilarated by their experience, the two men drive to the seashore to watch the waves in contemplative silence. The events leading up to the incident are then told in flashback. As Philippe's recently hired caretaker, Driss moves into the aristocrat's opulent Paris apartment and learns the job quickly. Before long, he is carrying Philippe from his bed to a chair, carefully dressing him, and even flirting with his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), but he does draw the line on some activities.As a result of Driss' high energy, Philippe begins to renew his enthusiasm for life and the two are drawn together by their love of music of diverse types, fast cars, and off-color humor. There are a few sub-plots including Philippe's snarky teenage daughter (Alba Gaïa Kraghede Bellugi) and her problems with her mop-haired boyfriend, and that of Driss' younger brother Adama (Cyril Mendy) and his fears of being the victim in a drug deal but they do not distract from what is essentially a two-character story. There is a lot of warmth and humor in the growing relationship. Driss introduces the staid Philippe to the music of Earth, Wind, and Fire to which Driss dances flamboyantly at Philippe's birthday party, the young caretaker becomes Philippe's barber, showing him some different and not too flattering mustaches, and they enjoy a hang gliding adventure in the French countryside.While some aspects of culture are ridiculed, the film shows respect for the arts in a way most Hollywood films never would. We actually listen to classical music, view paintings in a museum, and hear Philippe's impassioned poetic letters to Eleonore, who lives in Dunkirk, a woman he's never met. Driss also takes up painting and sells his first work for 11,000 Euros. Also, unlike mainstream American films that seem to exist in a vacuum, there are even references to real life contemporary figures such as Obama, Bush, and Nixon.While the opportunity is certainly present for mawkish sentimentality, Nakache and Toledano steer clear of that pitfall and opt instead for a genuineness and sincerity that allows us to truly care about each character. Though The Intouchables does have aspects of racial stereotyping, it can be enjoyed simply as a charming, warm-hearted, and funny depiction of friendship between two very different people who are willing to learn from each other about how to celebrate life. While happiness in their lives may still be elusive, in the words of existential psychiatrist Rollo May, ""Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy isbased on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Pragmatic ?,"Script-wise the film follows all the rules, but doesn't make an stiff movie, or a collection of predictable clichés, far away from that. All the resources that are used in the movie are used in order to tell a story that it is the core of the movie, the growing and life changing friendship between Philipe (François Cluzet, the French Dustin Hoffman) and Driss (Omar Sy), the second has worked in previous movies of the directors and writers of the movie (Olivier Nakache, Eric Toledano).It is a movie that can blend together perfectly humor and drama in many levels, all the time it plays with that. The spontaneity of Driss is key to explain the force that drives through out the movie, along with the intelligence and sensibility of Philipe.Many of the scenes that we can find it funny and interesting in the movie, it is under this blunt honesty, socially we are under so much scrutiny and so much expectations of behavior of what it is expected, that we can end up drowning in our skin, and probably no one would realize. How can we overcome, our own fears, the weigh of our own lives and really see one another?Friendships can do that. And that it is the story of the movie. Two true friends. ""Brothers"".He laughs at the Opera, which I have been one time in Austria, and I would definitely agree with him, unless you are over 70 year's old, you will might like it though (just don't forget to bring your pants, they won't let you in otherwise). He is able to look at Philipe with no pity and with compassion. They are both able to acknowledge one another and have fun.Movies are made of scenes, of fragments of life. The whole plot can only work, because these emotions and moments come in high level into the movie. True as for what can be recognized by our emotions. - Moments of friendship, it is so easy to see their intimacy. - Moments of teenager joy. (when he gets to drive the car) - Moments of real emotion for the characters. etc...Some truths we think, are so hard to face, that we are not able to admit to ourselves, but only a true friend, can look at it and be able to help us out, to be who we truly are. We usually live with two lives inside our hearts and minds, but things only really start when they become one. And that it the whole story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A Smartly Devised Story with Beautiful Imagery,"This was one of the first titles I watched after taking a deep dive into the foreign film market. And as a result, I have never looked back in the endless search for more and more ""foreign hidden gems"".The Intouchables is a movie which comes out of France. A passionate story directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano which ultimately would become one of the most successful French films to ever hit the box office. You may also know there work from another film titled Samba, another hit which also starred Omar Sy (has also played several smaller roles such as Barry in Jurassic World - 2015).The general premise is that Philippe has been a lifelong paraplegic who is searching for an everyday caretaker to help him with menial tasks such as showering, shaving, eating, and any inconveniences that he may encounter on a given day. Driss happens to apply for the job, desperately in need of a new source of income. While many would have tossed aside Driss on his past alone (criminal record and seemingly never ending impatience for people), Philippe wants a person who will look at him as more than a handicapped man. He wants a friend and someone who will treat him like he is just as capable as the next.I quote a line from the film where Philippe is approached by a colleague who is concerned that hiring someone like Driss, a person with a rough background:Colleague: These street guys have no pity. Philippe: That's what I want.Antics ensue.I claim this to be one of my favorite films and gems for several reasons:1) The chemistry between the two leads, Omar Sy and François Cluzet is perfection. You truly believed these two individuals from polar opposite upbringings had becomes the closest of friends having discovered the beauty and benefits had from learning about one another. And quite frankly, chemistry of this magnitude is a rarity in film nowadays.2) The imagery was beautiful. Every scene from the nights at dinner or concerts, visiting private art galleries together, snowball fights (that humor could be drawn from having a snowball fight with a paraplegic speaks volumes), Driss helping Philippe with his everyday health needs, all the way to merely feeling like he's just a normal person who also wants to have fun once in a while.3) The story was told in such a way that keeps us wanting more. Both directors cleverly scatter humor throughout in order to offer the viewer some relief from the dark drama which is drawn out of these two characters with equally different struggles and rough pasts.I think what ultimately made this entertaining for me was thus: in situations where you have a helpless or handicapped lead (in this case a paraplegic), the first thing I wanted was for a physically capable person to stand up for them in situations where the other is not able to do so themselves.For example, early on in the film we are shown a situation where Philippe has a neighbor who constantly parks in the front of his drive way. It clearly bothers him but he can't do anything besides wait for the ignorant guy to move out of the way. Driss is now Philippe's right hand man, and upon recognizing the situation, jumps out of the car and gets in the drivers face, yelling for him to move his car and never park there again. You get a sense of satisfaction from this kind of relationship, as well as the developing friendship these two develop for one another as they learn to depend on each other.I won't ruin the ending for you, but rest assured that it won't disappoint. This is truly a hidden gem for any American, and I cannot recommend this title more highly.----- 10/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"One of the best Foreign films I've ever seen, period.","I don't often get the chance to take in foreign cinema, but in the case of The Intouchables, I'm reminded of why I enjoy every opportunity to watch something fairly magical unfold on the screen. Sure, it sounds cheesy, but I have to say, the more foreign films I see, the more I find that I truly enjoy.The Intouchables, written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a total wild card, and it works in ways that are completely indescribable. The sense of purity and genuinity is evident throughout the film, and is wholeheartedly embraced by the audience. The Intouchables is based on the true-life events of Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with a troubled background, who Philippe hires as his caretaker. The film follows the interesting relationship that develops between these two men - one of mutual respect and true friendship.While the foreign reception of this movie has been overwhelmingly successful, the stateside opinions of this movie have been fairly varied, most of which find this movie to be racist, demeaning, or otherwise offensive. I feel as though these opinions are somewhat ridiculous, as the movie itself doesn't ever make race an issue; unless you are trying to read into the fact that the white man is rich and the black man is poor, these men are more peers that initially meets the eye. The unexpected companionship of these two men results in fantastic comedic opportunities, and not only are they hilarious, but they are touching and emotionally raw.The true magic in this film shines through by way of the incredible acting talent, and their obvious fervor for their craft. It is no surprise that both actors were awarded the honor of Best Actor at the 2011 Tokyo International Film Festival; additionally, Omar Sy's performance as Driss helped him to edge out Jean Dujardin (The Artist) for the César Award for Best Actor. It is rare to find two individuals that have the connection that Sy and Cluzet share on screen, and their interaction is wholly refreshing.This and the remaining components of the movie all seamlessly work together to provide a satisfying backdrop for the heartwarming story. At one point, Philippe's lawyer displays concern over the choice of Driss as Philippe's caretaker, due to his questionable background. Philippe indicated that such was of no concern, and he was merely grateful to be treated as a person, not as someone with a disability.While I understand that many American viewers will maintain a perception that this movie is offensive on some level, I feel as though the way we as Americans view race is severely different from those in other countries. While I don't consider myself an expert or ""advocate"" for awareness of racial discrimination, I find that the perpetuation of such through the media is unacceptable. Still, I think that this movie warrants an open mind, as it ventures beyond the obvious issues, and touches on a level of humanity that surpasses the pulling of the racism card.To be quite honest, this movie was probably one of the best movies I have seen all year. From a fantastic cast to an emotionally touching story that doesn't get lost or muddled in translation, The Intouchables has leaped its way to the top of my list for possible Oscar nominations (which isn't a far stretch of the imagination). I would definitely recommend this as a movie to put on your ""must see"" list - I don't think you will be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
friendship,"Love story between two guys who need someone to support them ... It begins with one helping the other because of his disability and ends with the disabled helping the other to be autonomous. Yes there are several stereotypes, but unfortunately they aren't : in France, the ""cités"" are mostly left apart from work and help, which can lead to situations such as the one of the character here presented ... I don't think the color of the actor should be taken as a main fact, this film is about mutual exchange, not stereotypes on the color.I would recommend it since the story is well developed, and although it can be a little long sometimes you go out of the theater thinking ... At least a French does since it is inspired of our society.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Recommendation,"I really recommend this movie, not only to those who love dramas or movies based on true stories but to everybody because I honestly think that this remarkable and educational but still story full of humour will love everyone. I haven't met yet a person that didn't like it. I cried and laughed at the same time. This movie really touched me and it is definitely one of the best movies I have ever watched. Actors did pretty good job like the whole film crew. Althoug it is a French movie and most of us are used to those in English or our maternal language while I was watching it I totally forgot that so if maybe that is the reason why you still considering it just stop!

Best French Film I have seen,"This is a great movie. I was not looking forward to watching it thinking it was another boring French film. I fell in love with this movie and have watched it multiple times. I laughed out loud, I cried out loud also. It made me have faith in humans. I smile when I think about this film. I had not seen any of the actors in other films and did not know what to expect. I loved the performances and got completely immersed in the film. Even reading the English subtitles I never felt like I missed anything. The director was flawless in making this film. I have seen over 3,200 films from around the world and easily in my top 10. I could watch the two main characters for hours. You can feel the bond and experience the bonding. I could feel and see the depth of each character and th hard work the actors put into to making this movie one of the best I have seen. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Total positive energy,"Ι never expected that I would like so much a ""French"" film. But from the first minutes it got my total attention. What really surprised me is that for a drama, the story goes really fast. To be honest this is because of Omar Sy. Wherever he appears, you really want to absorb his energy.I really believe that the whole meaning of the film is exactly Sy's energy. We can see how someone with positive energy can totally change your life even if you are in the worst position like a quadriplegic person.Of course the film does not reflect the majority of quadriplegics (don't think they are that rich), so we cannot really see the difficulties that these people are going through. But the fact that it is a true story gives hope to everyone for sure.I really think everyone should watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Intouchable film review,"Intouchables is a french dramatic comedy, this film is one of the non-English movies which is the most seen in the world ! The very high score of ""Intouchable"" is truly deserved ! The plot is based on the true happened story of  Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Yasmin Sellou. In the film, the story is about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic man who tries to find a carer to help him in his daily life. He meets Driss, an black unemployed immigrant. Driss has no competence to take care of Philippe but nevertheless he accepts the job. While the context is very serious (immigrants, unemployment, handicap,...) the atmosphere is decontracted. Driss's tactless manners procures us a very good moment. You can't stop watching and you can't stop laughing ! Even if you've seen it a lot of times ! The main actors Omar Sy and François Cluzet plays their role perfectly ! You get attached on the characters and on the story ! I will not reveal too much but if you haven't seen it yet (and I doubt there are many) then I warmly recommend it to all of you !",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Intangible yet monumental,"Review:I sat to write a review for this film as an acknowledgement of the debt I incurred while watching this masterpiece .The plot revolve around a rich quadriplegic Phillipe(Francois Cluzet)and his temporary caregiver Driss(Omar Sy)and the misdemeanors and infractions of the latter while performing his duties assigned and the very sophisticated yet intangibly compassionate understanding of these actions of the earlier(Phillipe).The temperament exhibited by him (Phillipe) against all the brusque, cocky yet humorous attitudes of his caregiver(Driss),with his withdrawn elegance, are perhaps the driving force and the most rare facet of this film, turning this, in my opinion, into a timeless work of art.The central theme is almost intangible, abstract yet of the most emotive genre which will engulf you despite not knowing what's exactly the dimension of this film causing so. There are moments so intense and so impassioned, though of course not obvious, that will make you feel indebted to this film, with their subtle portrayal in a manner which cannot always necessarily be perceived by the senses otherwise. It will take time for you to understand the parallel facets that follow every measure being pursued by the actors. The background music is almost heavenly took me somewhere so unknown. Simply put, you will perhaps never meet another one of this kind in future .In case of me at least, that have not happened yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

the adventure of friendship,"The French movie, the intouchables, is a comedy about a disabled aristocrat named Phillip and his encounter with Driss, who is a young man who comes from the outsides of Paris and is fresh out of jail. Phillipe decides to hire Driss as his helper even though Driss does not have any education or experience. Together, they go on an adventure that will make them find the value of friendship even though they are totally different characters, they learn to live and see life from a different perspective and at the same time complement each other perfectly. The directors of this marvelous story are: Eric Toledano, who is forty to years old and Oliver Nakache who is 40 years old. Both of them, who have known each other since the beginning of the 1990's, were born in France and did their first their first short film in 1995. The directors were inspired to do this movie in 2003, after watching a documentary about the life of Phillippe Pozzo di Brogo. Eight years later, they decided to adapt this story and create the movie named ""The Intouchables"" I will now analyze several cinematic aspects of the movie and whether they succeed or fail in these within the movie. The title of the movie is suitable and adapts perfectly to the movie because thee friends are inseparable even though they are absolutely different. When they meet, they find happiness and become comfortable with themselves. Hey complement each other because Phillip does not like a person that have pity on him, which makes them the perfect duo due to the fact that Driss treats him like any other person. Phillipe, after a long time of not doing so, laughs and smiles thanks to Driss's personality. On the other hand, Driss finds another way to live; he learns to be honorable and to work hard, to earn things for himself without stealing others' objects. When they are together, they are unstoppable, intouchable. At the same time that the title adapts to the movie, the cast is totally adequate. Omar Sy interprets Driss, a tall and big man who is funny and always smiling. This creates contrast with Francois Cluzet, who interprets Phillipe as a serious and elegant man. The clothing is another success of the cast from the movie. These reveal the different characterizations of each character. When the movie starts, Driss's clothing are scarce and in bad state but as the movie goes one, his appears to have more clothes and also more sense of fashion thanks to his new job and new lifestyle. Phillipe's clothing is elegant all throughout the movie due to the fact that people that know him expect to see him dressed that way because of his social status. He also dresses according to his age and gender. Phillipe's maids have an elegant uniform to work with, and his daughter has a tendency to dressing inappropriately for her age. Driss's family dress with dark, loose and old clothes, which reflects the type of life they have thanks to the society they live in. The script is simple, clear and adequate. Each character has its own way to talk and express themselves according to their characterization. For example: Driss has a more informal way to talk than Phillipe. Music is not a central point or focus of the movie, but when there is music, it is wonderful and helps create the perfect environment for the movie. When Driss and Phillipe are paragliding, the music is harmonious but moving at the same time, it gives a sense of happiness and adventure, which is the exact situation they are going through. Another moment in which the movie is important is in Phillipe's birthday party. The band is professional and present famous songs that make the audience feel identified with the movie. It makes us remember why music is so important in peoples' lives. The sound was low and high according to the situation the character where experiencing. On Phillipe's birthday, the music is loud, as if it were the one talking, instead of the characters. On the other hand, when Driss is leaving Phillipe's house, it is low and what is loud is actually the rain. The scenography, along with the photography is excellent. It is different in each place including Paris, houses of different characters, mountains, etc. The different environments are perfectly portrayed. The photography is simple. The framing is usually from the hips to the top of the actor or the whole actor. One can rarely see the characters and their whole surroundings, which creates emphasis on the characters and the situation they are in. The movie achieves teaching us, through infortune and humor, that everyone is different and we need to help one another because not everyone has the same privileges or problems. Also, that we need to enjoy life to the fullest because you only live once. We have to be happy with what he have and not with what we do not have. I recommend this movie to everyone out there. It is entertaining for people of all ages and genres. It maintains everyone entertained and interested every second and at the same it teaches a great lesson to the public. There is romance, suspense, friendships and a lot more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"""Charming.""","The film does not tell anything new, but the refreshing feel that it gives you after watching is something you will cherish forever. The credit basically goes to the acting by the lead cast. The storyline is pretty simple. Oh and the music is the backbone in this film. It is one of those few films which manipulate your feelings extensively with the help of sounds. The story of a quadriplegic man helped by another man for day to day work and living the beautiful moments of life is sure to impress you.PROS:The thought that fascinated me most was the demand of Philippe from people not to be sympathetic to him. That is so true and original. People met with accident want a normal life again and do not want sympathies which eventually look like forced upon. Omar Sy as Driss has definitely stolen the show. The main story revolves around what the two do all day, but it also gives fair judgment to the personal life of Driss. He has been shown as a realistic character that is kind hearted but on the other side, is not able to live properly with his family. The film, its characters, its locations, music, cinematography and almost everything else is soothing.MESSAGE: ""We all need equal treatment.""VERDICT: ""Most recommended.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Better than expected.,"After reading the blur I was convinced this was another ""bucket list"" movie. To my surprise I was wrong, I found it to be a warm-hearted feel- good film and very much enjoyed watching it. I actually work at a video store and a British English teacher i know comes in regularly, he mentioned to me that this is one of the top 10 movies he has ever viewed. He rents out a lot of movies. So i finally gave it a go after putting it off. The only reason i resented this was due to it being subtitled but i'm glad I put that aside. Not many films make me laugh anymore, I feel as if humor in movies is subtly disappearing but in this film, it is present.

The two of them become close friends and a lot of hilarity ensues.It's a completely unique film about friendship as it lacks all of the schmaltzy, sickening sentimentality of Hollywood movies of the same genre.

Absolutely Stunning!,"What a marvelous way of story-telling is this! Adding huge ounces of principles, love, friendship & emotions into a bucket of life story is something so splendid the filmmakers have succeeded in doing, that not only will The Intouchables touch you, but also will stay with you for decades.I say it because the story is not new to our cinematic brains. It has been sampled before (check out Guzaarish (a Bollywood debacle), Jab We Met (theme), etc.). But, the freshness & adrenaline pumping sequences are high above the reach of typical non-standard plots & SFX or CGI. Without making use of cheap-stakes, surrounding itself with pure blessings of wonderful music, budding cast, performances & screenplay is what makes it a beautiful drama. The comedy will stay with you with lots of improvisation in the slapstick. While the character depth is astronomical, what works for The Intouchables is that it is genuine. From its core.A good 8.7/10 for a wonderful experience. A wonderful story talking about human relations, notwithstanding the stereotypes, flashing the happier (& the dull) side of humanity & its nature, topped with a perfect climax. Minus 1 for the blunt center-story. The Intouchables is simply the best movie to come out of modern France... yet!BOTTOM LINE: 100% Recommended.

What a joy to watch,"This was my second time viewing the film and it was at least as joyful and as fulfilling as the first time.I must admit I've been an admirer and a fan of Omar Sy for quite some time, he brings so much charm and so much presence to his performances, and he absolutely owned this film. He was spectacular, however Francois Cluzet was also brilliant, and the film was very well crafted, beautifully directed, and just a lovely, joyful, funny, uplifting take on humanity.Because Omar Sy as Driss sucks all of the oxygen on screen, it may be too easy to overlook the masterful performance by François Cluzet as Philippe. He's the balancing understatement to Sy's showboating, though the latter won a Best Actor César, France's Oscar, for this role, beating out Jean Dujardin of The Artist. Talk about splitting hairs. Both are charming, effortless, and have an old-school showbiz sensibility. However, Dujardin's performance is more vulnerable.

"not simply a ""buddy movie"" or a ""feel good movie"", but  a movie about humanity, devotion to others, friendship, tolerance.","I have read the review of a famous french movie journalist called Pierre Murat, in the very intellectual magazine ""Telerama"", and I'm furious about it. He wrote that the worldwide success of this movie was highly predictable : good feelings, a ""feel good movie"" in a gloomy time of economic crisis, etc, etc...Nonsense. Who could have thought that a french movie about a tetraplegic man on a wheelchair would be seen by 37 millions people in Europe, that is to say more than the US family blockbuster, the last Harry Potter movie ? Please, be serious Mr Murat.Mr Murat too says that this movie is just good feelings, not good acting or good movie direction. Here again, it's completely out of base. the actors are wonderful and have a perfect chemistry between them, the script is perfect.I laughed and I have been ""touched""at the same time. Laugh and emotion at the same time, it's a rare combination in a whole film.But infamy didn't come only from some pedantic french journalists who always denigrate and despise the successful movies (of course, when a movie is liked my many people, they say it's demagogic and bad taste). Some US critics dared to say that this movie was racist because the actor playing the man who helps the rich paralyzed aristocrat is black ! My god. Why some Americans are so obsessed by the skin colours ? As a French, it's not at all something that I noticed ! Who cares if Omar Sy is Black ? They totally missed the point.What is important in this movie, it's precisely the universal message delivered behind a true story wonderfully told by 2 brilliant actors : beyond all of our possibles differences (physical or social disabilities or prejudices), we are human beings after all, who can be friends.Intouchables is not simply a ""buddy movie"" or a ""feel good movie"", it's a movie about humanity, devotion to others, friendship, tolerance.Unfortunately, Mr Murat kept is social prejudices (he thinks that a popular movie is always a bad one), as some US commentators kept their racial prejudices about black men serving white men.Beware : this movie is for open minded people only !

Nothing that we have not seen but still the life interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy life. The movie does not make use of the beautiful Parisian landscape outside of the closed doors, but rather stays inside to explore the warm fuzzy feeling in a marriage between a quadriplegic and caregiver.

"Warm, nice comedy","I watched this movie for my French class. I remembered having to complete a question sheet and discuss it in class the next day. It was past midnight already and I had an 8am French class. I told myself I will just watch 20 minutes, read the plot summary on Wikipedia, and then go to sleep. However, I just couldn't stop watching it after that 20 minutes. It was warm, delightful, and funny from the very beginning. So I watched most of it that night... and finished it the next day.During our French discussion, people started talking about the stereotypical representation of race and class, like how Philippe is a white rich guy who is only fond of high art while Driss is a funky low class dude with a big heart. I found these criticism unnecessary and too political for a comedy film. These representations of the main characters aren't offensive, and the friendship and feelings are real and touching in the movie.

Sweet and Funny,"It's not hard to see how Intouchables become a hit. It's a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word; a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience, and uses a familiar formula that's been seen many times before. Interestingly, though, it doesn't resort to the lowest common denominator. Nakache and Toledano were clearly aware of the fact that they're not offering any new revelations, and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining, touching and effective as possible, and it works, loath as I am to admit it. The movie is fast-paced, fantastically edited, always entertaining, sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama; the two leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy, have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work. More impressively, they make even the most cynical viewer forget that they heard it all before.Intouchables is, in fact, one of those precious few films I can label as 'almost perfect', in that it's impossible to point out any particular flaws. The biggest flaw, and the only reason I gave it a less than perfect rating, is simply how predictable it is. It's very easy to ignore while you're watching, but Intouchables is, in fact, a formula movie, which doesn't really have anything that new or interesting to say, and doesn't do anything that wasn't done before. That doesn't detract anything, though, from the fact that it's an excellent movie and practically impossible not to enjoy, if only because the two leads are so incredibly likable and so much fun to spend 90 minutes with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Unconventional friendship for hire!,"I wanted to like this film before watching it. Is that a bad thing? I read the basic story line and believed the movie would deliver an experience worth its time. I only knew Omar Sy (Driss) from director Jean Pierre Juneauts' ""Micmacs"" where his knack was a proliferation of clichés that trailed off topic, but ended in that contagious smile and accompanying laugh. Not much to work with.... Not so here. From the opening scene, we know the unconventional inertia of Driss, as childlike stating the elephant in the room and his street smarts, but without Francois Cluzets' portrayal of Phillipe the paraplegic, we would have an immature caretaker with a drooling invalid with no heart or purpose. We couldn't be laughing at our own self imposed limitations. Yes, without Phillipe being rich beyond belief, we'd have no action. Much like the brilliant ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"", this story takes us away from our spoiled selves, not just cinematically but spiritually. Here it is filled with its own Hollywood clichés of dance scene, car chase and feel goodness, but that doesn't distract from the plot as much as it could have in a s""sell out"" studio requirement. There is personal acceptance over stereotypical forced growth experiences and makes for a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

A Gem,"Intouchables is a film that has the rare quality of telling a story about a situation that is sad and putting a uplighting spin on it.Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a rich quadriplegic looking for a caregiver. He hires Driss (Omar Sy), a young man, from a background that most people in Phillipe's circle wouldn't trust. Phillipe is looking for someone who won't pity him and what he gets is a person who gives Phillipe a perspective that makes the both of them grow to become better people.The film is funny, sad, and above all else extremely well made. The story which is superbly written flies by. The cinematography and the editing contribute to the film's smooth style. And with the soundtrack not to forget, you're in for a good time. It can cross languages and cultures and can still be viewed as a gem of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Awesome movie,"The film goes to the bone and masterfully portrays stereotypes of people's attitude towards the handicapped and those with criminal records. The greatest aspect of this movie lies in the interaction between the main actors where every sentence feels like exchanged respect, understanding, love and acceptance in a really brilliantly written mix of comedy and realism. The scenes are in good quality, and the actors, especially the main duo, completely spectacular. Omar Sy is fantastic in his role, as evidenced by three awards at various festivals. Their chemistry on screen is great; it is hard to believe that these two men are not the best friends in real life. ""Intouchables"" is a very touching and beautiful story of an unusual friendship.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"""Pas d'bras, pas d'chocolate!""","I went into this film not really knowing what to see and was delighted. Its subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overly-cheesy movies, This is because it's actually based on a true story. Two men find friendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise. It showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between Driss and Philippe and how these barriers are overcome. When we think of Paris and France in general, we do not think of the slums outside the major cities, the poverty, and brokenness housed just outside the ""city of love."" This movie runs the gamut of emotions. The moments of tenderness and truth speckled between scenes of laughter and, sometimes tears. Overall, I thought this movie was eye opening, touching, funny, and thought provoking. Give this title a shot!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Leave me alone,"The Intouchables is a wonderfully written story by Olivier Nakache, Eric Toledano, about two men who finds each other and builds an amazing friendship together. Philippe, the quadriplegic millionaire who loves fine art, classical music and poems meets Driss, a cocky unemployed man who deep inside is an extremely goodhearted human. He wants to help everyone.The movie is a very ""easy watched"" movie with a lot of small funny characteristic jokes between Philippe and Driss while it also handling bigger questions like how quadriplegic and physical disabled people often strikes self confidence, the thrill of feeling alive in a wheelchair and how you want to get treated by the people around you.One of the best actors in this movie was absolutely Omar Sy who played Driss and François Cluzet who played Philippe. The feeling and their bound of friendship made me really worm inside and happy. This is really a must watch movie for everyone!cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A rich funny movie which will make you laugh and cry,"I saw that this movie had made it on the top 250 list rather quickly so I had to go see it. From the opening scene, the movie kept you engaged with its memorable characters, which provide great chemistry with each other. Makes you wonder if a price can be put on your health and freedom. I had to ask myself if I would trade places with Philippe, with all his status and material riches, but to be totally dependent on a caretaker for the most basic of daily tasks. The Driss character was a total contrast and provided what Philippe could not provide on his own, not just from a physical viewpoint. When I went to see this it was only playing in one theater in the Chicagoland area, a shame that a quality films doesn't get the distribution while the mass marketed produced junk that Hollywood churns out pushes out rich films like this one. Hopefully it will be released in DVD soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Unbelievable,"I honestly cannot imagine how anybody could dislike this movie. The first scene captivates the audience in a way unlike any other, by showing the unlikely, and genuine, relationship between two people who would appear to be, upon first glance, polar opposites. I have read through a handful of negative reviews and it, quite frankly, really bothers me. Not only did I find the movie to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it was also very sentimental, especially more towards the latter portion of the film. This is one of only a few movies that I have ever watched that has had my utmost attention for the entire duration of the film. Not once did I find my mind wandering off, and I most certainly was never bored. However, on a more serious note, I think that the movie also shows how, sometimes, the most unexpected people could become some of the most important people in your life. I would, without a doubt, give this movie a 10/10 and recommend it to everybody. Even though the movie is in French and I found myself reading the subtitles the whole time, I was still able to very easily capture the whole essence of the film.

An absolute gem of a film,"Initially I turned my nose up at the thought of watching a film with subtitles, but my ignorant logic has been changed forever.For me this has to be one of the greatest feel good movies there has ever been. The acting and chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is supreme, and you feel it right from the moment the film begins.The direction of Eric Toledano is masterful, showing both men's backgrounds in such a way (subtle comedy, gripping drama, heart warming moments) you learn so much about them as individuals and how their feelings develop gradually for each other and their own families.With some real laugh out load moments, romance and action too, you really get everything with this movie.You would be foolish (like I was) to pass this off as just another foreign film with subtitles.

Breath of Fresh Air,"Someone asked me to describe this masterpiece and I was at a loss of words and could only depict it as, ""a breath of fresh air.""As someone who does not speak French and had to read the movie in subtitles, this movie is still one of my top 10 favorite of all time. This film is truly amazing; I loved watching every second of the dynamic between these two characters. Some of the best on screen chemistry I've ever witnessed in a movie with truly heartfelt and hilarious moments. I love seeing how these two characters played off one another gave each other something. I could go on and on about how great everything in this movie is. It is difficult for me to comprehend how someone could dislike this movie, it has something for everyone. Yes, I understand it may not be entirely accurate to the real story of what happened, but at least for me I go into a film expecting liberties to be taken to enhance the quality of the film. Watching this movie in subtitles made it difficult for me to evaluate the performance these actors gave; however, it does not detract from this movie one bit as the relationship between these two characters is one that is exceeded by few, if none. For anyone who has not seen this movie, it is without a doubt one you cannot pass up! It remains one of all time favorites and it is considered a foreign film relative to me. I could ramble on forever and describe to you how I was smiling throughout almost this entire movie, or the feelings of happiness it brought upon me, but I leave you dear reader saying this; this work was a breath of fresh air. I adored it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

Comedy of Modern Human Stratification,"""The Intouchables"", so let's start from the packaging of this movie. It is very simple yet humble. You can easily divide this movie into two parts. First, the story part, it is my own term to call the conversation scene, usually without music background or sound effect. And this movie utilizes this part perfectly, I mean it can make the audiences feel the melancholic sense of this movie. The conversation story also delivered in a very natural way, actually with some humble jokes too. And the other part is the catchy part, it is my own term too. This part is when the soundtrack takes place in the scene, very dynamic shot, comedic scene, or attractive act. You know, this part makes the boredom of audiences vanish, and start to laugh as well. Also, this is a kind of stimulant to make audiences keep watching the whole movie. ""The Intouchables"" mixes those two part with great sequence that makes synergy from each part.The second point is, this film combines two extreme paradigm of how we see the world. Philippe represents the upper-class people, who admires art strictly, enjoys expensive sport, also follows the rich- man ritualism. The only weakness of this class is the lack of true love, everything is blur with so many luxurious things that he has. He can feel the beauty of painting and music, but doesn't feel the art of life itself. Even after the tragic tragedy of his life, he still in search in true love. What I mean isn't a love from a man to woman, more than that it is compassion and conscience from every human. Again, even rich-people has a human-side, when he feels cold in his plush property. The other perspective is from Driss, an easy- going man, works as the caretaker of Philippe. Of course, such as a shameless and past-criminal-man mustn't be the keeper of quadriplegic millionaire. This the very point of the movie. The upper-class touch the low- class in a very dynamic interaction. Both Philippe and Driss, learn each other's paradigm of how he sees life. Although Driss has a dark- track record, he is a pragmatic and funny character. It makes Philippe conscious with all the ritualism he had done. Melancholic, that's who Philippe is, learn the way of compassion throughout Driss comical character. So it's just like a motivation show or inspiring talk show, about a batch of social stratification. But, wrapped in a interesting comedy movie.Another view is, this movie actually a satire movie, an elegant satire I think. Let's say how can the upper-class buy an expensive yet simple paintings, in the same time there are so many hungry people throughout their city. What is the meaning of life for the lucky person such as millionaire. Is it just a place and time for them to throw away the money by temporal things. Their compassion is simply blur with all those things. Real human instinct of love is died by the greed. Yes, a deep message one. The feeling of full-life as human, that's what we all the human seek. And unfortunately, usually the low-class-human found out it in spite of the others. Just like what Bibles said.So that's all the implicit contents of this authentic work of art in cinema. Maybe the director, writer, or cast isn't to important. But since the great idea of humanity is the main theme, there is no way to say it's a bad cinema. Simply wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A brilliant heart-warming true story that makes me laugh and cry with every view.,"As an enthusiast for film in every aspect, I truly believe this French drama to be a masterpiece. Beginning with the incredibly well suited score by Ludovico Einaudi which captures the essence of the film I was initially unsure what to expect. The opening scene was majestic and beautifully filmed with dramatic cinematography and introduced the clever comedy throughout the picture.The true story that the script is based off may not at first glance seem relevant to many people, however I realised that actually this film notes a lot on differences in culture and creates a character for Driss, the protagonist who is low in the socio-economic scale, that expresses a lot of ideas that we might not realise and shows that the ways of the wealthy are not only largely different on the surface but deep beneath are much like that of any class.What really made this film get the rating I have given it is the heart that it has, Driss and his friend Philippe have masterfully scripted conversations which have a beautiful mixture of melancholy and satire which gives the film a very natural sense and elevates the fluency of the pacing. Many scenes I found myself bursting with laughter as if i were having a laugh with close friends, the film feels very personal because of this and the accompaniment of Einaudi's soft yet tenacious performance generates a homely atmosphere throughout.the beautiful cinematography carefully mimics that of a persons sight, with artistic blurring and intriguing angles. These angles and camera effects bring you deep into the character of Philippe, whom is paralysed beneath his neck, as it feels much like his view. Philippe's character tends to stare out into the distance and the filming resembles this aspect.Finally this incredible film is accompanied by acting which feels very real and each actors style worked perfectly with the character that they played. the film as an entirety felt natural and real and the superb acting was the heart of the greatness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
"Amazing movie, even for non french speakers","This movie is the best movie of this still young decade so far. It has a fantastic plot, the performances of the actors really make you believe them and in a way want them to succeed. This film comes together as a perfect amalgam of music, storyline, plot and visuals. The comedy that you get all through the movie would not be funny if left in the hands of lesser actors and if done it may even have made some of the jokes offensive. I have to say that it isn't everyday that a movie in french makes a completely full room of close to 200 people laugh, most of whom didn't even speak french. I would have to say that if you are thinking of whether to see this movie or not. Do it, you will not regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Breathtaking...10+,"That was unbelievable...one of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched.One of my top 10!

I would say he is a born actor.I don't really watch French-movies but i was pleasantly surprised by this one. It was a my brother who told me to watch it. That is actually the first time you would see love between 2 men(not in gay way nor a best friend) They an unusual but strong bond that will really move you especially because they come from to different world.one is an ex-convict lives in a bad neighborhood(drug,poverty,unemployment) and the other is a rich man with a severe handicap.As you watch it, you will see how the bond create between the two, and its full of funny moments.I will be brief just watch it.I would rate it over 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
My go-to movie to showcase foreign film.,"If I am ever in need of a film to showcase the beauty and intelligence of French cinema, this is the title I dig out for people. There is a lot to be said for Hollywood and big budget productions but this film is the epitome of modern French cinema.Subtle, delicate and masterful, the build up and pacing of the film is very well managed and not once drags or feels boring, the characters are simply perfect and no single character feels forced or out of place, each one playing an integral part in the story. The acting is overwhelmingly real and as with a majority of modern foreign cinema the suspension of disbelief is never once broken dragging you emphatically into this beautiful at times; otherwise grainy and staunch Parisian reality. The mise en scène is stunningly portrayed and carefully picked by an experienced cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied who really comes into his own here. Simply put, this film is a must see for this generation and should be regarded as one of the most magnificent pieces of cinema to come out of France since Amelie, and certainly one of the great works of modern cinema regardless of language barriers.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"

The Intouchables is a simple heartwarming story of a great friendship... Pure Entertainment,"The Intouchables has broken all the box office records in France and Europe recently and is attracting a lot of audience. Being a fan of French cinema, I decided to be a part of this experience. The Intouchables, based on a true story, tells the tale of a handicap millionaire named Philippe played really brilliantly by Francois Cluzet who appoints Driss (Played by Omar Sy), a broke ex-con, to be his caretaker. Because both of them have somewhat same kind of nature, they develop a deep friendship.I have to say first that the performances were very impressive. Each and every actor was natural in their roles. For example: Driss is supposed to very funny which he is, very much. Even the opening scene was great! Millionaire is shown as a tried old man who's bored of his own luxuries and he appoints Driss just because he sees himself in him: a young exuberant yet a wasted man. Secondly, the relation between the both, their friendship, is the whole point of the film. It was good I guess, I just thought that there were some aspects of it that I had already seen in other films , the same clichés that appear again. But just like I said, the performances were great. So the acting made their friendship more energetic and realistic. Thirdly, it was quite hilarious. One scene where both the leads exchange their taste in music was one of the best. Although there wasn't anything new in it, but their love for each other matters the most in this film. Lastly, the plot is quite simple, no twist or turns. It's a simple but great tale of friendship, in which both the characters learn something from one another and so do we...Though The Intouchables doesn't show us anything new, it's entertaining and a new addition in the French cinema that I would love to discover and rediscover. Highly Recommended.Check out my movie-fan page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulartThanks for reading...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
This will brighten up your day,"Its not often i go to the cinema and am both captivated and uplifted from start to finish. The story, the characters, the cast, everything works beautifully, with Driss playing the lead roll to perfection. You can't fail to love that guy, regardless of his faults. The humour translates well and the jokes remain as funny in subtitles as they do in its original language. The fact that this is a true story tops off an already perfect combination. If there were more films like this, the world would be a better place, and the only problem i have now is that I'm always expecting a similar level of entertainment as this at every subsequent visit to the cinema. Other recent films i put on par with this(for varying reasons) are , a royal affair, the hunt, la grande belleza, sound city, searching for sugar man. If you have not seen this film, you are in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
A really good one,"I stopped trying to watch American movies and watched pretty much every foreign movie on Netflix. The Intouchable was just added. I had no expectations starting watching this movie on Netflix. It captivated me from the start and I knew I would enjoy it and I did. In fact, today I watched it for the second time. It also came in the right time for me, when I really needed uplifting, a different prospective on life. It shows that joy doesn't come with material possessions, that there are so many things we just take for granted and forget to appreciate ""what is"". The look on Driss's face when he sees ""his"" bathroom worth a thousand words. There is nothing fake in this movie. The other movies that I can compare to this one (in quality) are: Sidewalls(Argentinian 2011), The Hedgehog (French);Biutiful(Mexico); Top of the Lake series (Australian); Last Ride (Australian); The Polish bride (Dutch); The KId with a bike (Belgian);The Return (Russian).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Comedy, Drama"
Pleasantly Surprised,"10/10, faultless.Given to me as birthday present, I was sceptical of the ""rave reviews"" splashed across the DVD sleeve (and the subject matter put me off).The film is authentic and genuine.""Untouchable"" made us us laugh because the scenes were both funny and brilliantly done - real life on screen as opposed to ""Actors-Being-Comedians"".Everything is deadly serious, ""Untouchable"" is based (however loosely I cannot tell) on actual events.Eye candy it is not, here we have an insight into a world behind doors that keeps itself to itself. I found myself looking into two greatly contrasting lives.The characters evoke empathy in different ways and for different reasons, even when someone is ""being bad"".The casting is excellent, timing, pace, mood all have been handled with impeccability.Would it have come across differently if it had been presented as pure fiction?

"""The Intouchables"" is Touching.","The French film, ""The Intouchables"" is a very moving story based on true to life characters. It is directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano.

The plot quickly evolves and is checkered with bits of comic relief as in many of Shakespeare's plays. There are moments of tearfulness as well as outright laughter interspersed in such a way as to make this a very satisfying experience.
