I wasn't expecting this!,"I watched some of the next movies before this. I wasn't expecting this one can be this good!There was some minor flaws in it but the story was really good overall with it's effective twist and all. Amazing editing, scores and sound by the way.I believe this is not just an ordinary horror movie, it's also a really great crime movie.Even if the movie wasn't that good at most, the ending would save it, the ending is so perfect with that ""Hello Zepp"" score. That music makes the scene two times better.If I had to mention the minor flaws, here is one example. I don't know why the car parking and all the other areas so dark and feels abandoned? I know, It's because this is a horror movie and the movie tries to scare you. But it's a bit much actually.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The First Great Franchise of the Twenty-First Century,"Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they're able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.Falsely categorized as ""torture porn"" (the violence and gore here are more in line with ""Seven"" than ""Hostel""), this film was the first smart horror film of the 2000s. Intelligent horror fans not only got the blood they wanted, but a clever villain and a mystery to solve. Later sequels would get more complicated than episodes of ""Lost"", and the series loses something as it goes (all franchises do), but this original stands as one of the modern greats. And, luckily, you can watch it without any of the sequels and it makes sense.There has been an effort in recent years to academically analyze ""Saw"", injecting a false connotation on to the film. One scholarly article points to the ""militarization"" of Jigsaw in a post-9/11 world. Jigsaw, like the military, carries out violent acts, but has found ways to rationalize them with moral justifications (saving the worthy, letting the undeserving die). The author makes various other parallels about a ""military"" setting, mentioning IEDs and the industrial setting of Jigsaw's workshop. I find this to be largely silly, and not at all the creators' intention. I see a much more obvious line of progression from ""Silence of the Lambs"" to ""Seven"" to ""Saw"" with the advent of the brilliant, self-moralizing serial killer. Even Hitchcock's ""Rope"" offered a justification for murder, albeit a poor one. Terrorism or not, the horror film will go on.You can make complaints, sure. But for young writers and directors, this was a blockbuster and deserved the massive success it got. As someone who pays close attention to a film's writing and plot, I was stunned. My only real concern is at the very end, when the key's location is revealed. I can't discuss this in a review, but let's just say I found that to be uncharacteristic and unfair of the killer.If you haven't seen ""Saw"" yet, see it. And see the second film. After that, they start to go downhill. But the first two are quite good and must-see viewing for all horror fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The game begins,"Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it's a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.According to the film's notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn't really kill anyone, but ""plays a game"" with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man's hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that's Jigsaw's perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell's eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clichés and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw's philosophical undertones aren't entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what's going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie's more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don't come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).Furthermore, the intelligence behind the film's structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell's desperation is conveyed with an intensity that's almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the ""too old for this sh*t"" gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it's the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Game Over !,"One of the best movies I've watched. I didn't get any spoilers while watching this movie and the ending was devastating.The tension was perfect and you are looking forward to the end.Soundtrack is one of the best.

The best thriller in years,"Since ""Nattevagten"" I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as ""Saw"". Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With ""Saw"" James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Think you're hard-boiled? Think again and watch ""Saw"", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.""Saw"" has been advertised as the new ""Se7en"" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, ""Saw"" does a much better job at actually being creepy. Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being, ""Saw"" does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure, the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart, outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans, but hey, ""Se7en"" and ""Silence Of The Lambs"" didn't care too much about realism, either, did they?""Saw"" does have some flaws. Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters' lines are a bit clichéd. However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.I can't remember the last time I've been surprised by a movie's final twist, but ""Saw"" has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since ""Cube"". I'm really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell's career develops after this fine sleeper.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The first, the best!","Okay, i have seen a lot of horror films. Saw was another one that i liked much. Saw 2,3,4...and so on were movies i disliked.

I review the first one that is the best in my opinion. I liked it. A friend of mine, a co-student at College, told me to watch the movie together. She couldn't remember how many times she had seen it. It was her favorite so she wanted to share it with me.I liked the flow of the movie. And then the movie ended.

Just See SAW!,"Wow. The critics weren't wrong. Not since seven has horror been portrayed so majestically.From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly. Just like 'Se7en', the all-round Grittiness that director James Wan creates disgusts and enthralls. Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle.A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won't be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry!I still can't sleep.It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. It is better than Seven for shock value. It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat.Very highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Most Clever Horror Movie Ever!,"Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere the moment it starts, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that it has one of the best twists seen in any horror movie.I watched this film alone at night with the lights off, expecting to be freaked out by it since I thought it was just another typical horror movie; but instead I was completely intrigued by the story line, and utterly drawn into the film for the whole 100 minutes. At the end I did not feel scared, rather, I felt something very few horror movies have to offer: satisfaction! This movie left me in a slightly disturbed but very thoughtful state. It did not give me nightmares, rather, it plagued my day-dreams; for two days my thoughts could not stray far from this film, that's how powerful it is.If you want a cringingly gory and violent horror movie, watch ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Hostel""; if you want a nightmarishly scary horror movie, watch ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring""; if you want a clever and disturbing horror movie with an excellent story and a great twist, watch ""Saw"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tastefully done,"I was always terrified to watch this movie because I thought it would be over the top blood and gore. I finally found the nerve and was extremely surprised. Unlike other horror movies this one takes in the entire scene of the detectives trying to catch the murder while you're trying to figure out what is going on. Even though the movie keeps flashing back it helps take some intensity off of what's going on and adds a nice story to it. Instead of a meaningless film with blood and gore, this one had a well thought out storyline and a killer with rules. It reminded me a little of Silence of the lambs, they both have that edge that anything brutal and gory can happen any moment keeping up the intensity of the film. Don't get me wrong there is blood and gore in the film, but it's done in a tasteful way unlike some of the final destination movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't confuse this movie for its sequels- this one's actually good,"The Saw movies tend to get a pretty bad rap. Most people think of them as senselessly violent and overly gory torture fests with no actual interesting plots or characters. Granted, some of the movies are like that. But, when you watch this 2004 original, leave those expectations at the door, because this movie is just a genuinely good thriller and mystery.This movie has an intriguing premise of two strangers waking up in a room, handcuffed to pipes. As the move progresses, this mystery unfolds as we learn more and more about these two characters and about the situation that they are in. There are many twists and turns as the movie unfolds, but they never feel forced. These twists feel organic and are truly shocking. Because of this, I don't think of this movie really as a horror movie. It feels more like a mystery thriller, and it draws you into its premise. However, it is a very tense movie and there are some frightening scenes, so it does succeed as a horror movie as well.If gore is the main thing keeping you from watching this movie, I would give it a try. Granted, there is gore in this movie, but it's not nearly as much as you would expect from a movie these days with Saw in the name. The gore is never intrusive or over-the-top, and it certainly is never meant to be the point of the movie. If you cannot watch gore at all, there may be a couple of scenes where you'll want to close your eyes, but there is still so much to enjoy from this movie outside of those moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot.

"Well made horror/thriller, two thumbs up","When two men, wake up and find themselves chained to a bathroom pipe, with a dead body lying in between them, they soon realize that they are prisoners, in the secure lair of a serial killer, nicknamed 'Jigsaw'.This film was, in my opinion, exciting, thrilling, and an overall entertaining film to watch. It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged. This was an enormous achievement for Aussie newcomers  James Wan, and Leigh Wannell.

A puzzling game worth playing,"Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The first 'Saw' is very problematic but is one of the better films of the 'Saw' series. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted. Some of the story is ridiculous with large lapses in logic, Danny Glover's character's actions will have one screaming in frustration at the television screen. Some of the script is tight, other parts are half-baked and silly and Elwes' character's back-story had some taut tension but that it had some melodramatic parts with frustrating character behaviour.Some of the acting is not good. Cary Elwes seems to be thinking like he's acting in a very over-heated melodrama that would have been out of date even in the period when they were in fashion. Danny Glover's performance is also a mess, with a mix of over-compensating and not looking interested. Even for the film's mood, some of the editing is chaotic.However, for a film that didn't have a high budget 'Saw' visually doesn't look too bad on the whole, effective even. There is a real sense of unsettling claustrophobia induced in the lighting, setting and photography. Music has its eeriness.Not everybody fares badly in the acting. Michael Emerson has an unnerving presence and Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell also do a decent job. Then there is Tobin Bell, not easy to forget him after this film. James Wan does more than competently in the director's chair, even with the inexperience.Despite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. There is genuine dread, some truly imaginative traps and kills and much of it throughout is disturbing and creepy. 'Saw' is notable in particular not just for the traps/kills but also for its bold twists, the character of Jigsaw (the modus operandi, impulse and justification setting him apart from most characters of his type) and an unforgettably shocking ending.Overall, very problematic but effective. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I loved it,"Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out as I really want to buy it. My recommendation to all of you is to watch Saw and have a good time like I did.

A cut above the rest.,"SAW (2004) ***1/2 Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Leigh Whannell, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Makenzie Vega, Tobin Bell. (Dir: James Wan) A cut above the rest.Finally a horror film that pays off in actually being scary! Novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell  director/ co-screenwriters  have concocted a fiercely chilling tale of horror with echoes of dank élan to 'SE7EN' as well as any films during the seminal '70s the likes of Carpenter, Craven and Hooper in gleaning some of their mojo glommed onto their uniquely perverse, darkly humorous and more importantly downright bone-chilling spooky with this dark story of a fated morality play.The conceit begins with two strangers awakening from a drugged abduction to find themselves chained in a rotted industrial restroom (just the ghastly cinematography by David A. Armstrong and grotty production design by Julie Berghoff makes one crave a Tetanus shot!) and at the fate of a ticking clock coerced by the whimsy of a madman's sick, twisted game of life or death.Dr. Lawrence Gordon (a very fine turn by Elwes) is a successful oncologist and a slacker type named Adam (Whannell providing much needed gallows humor smart-aleckness) must unsolve a dastardly puzzle with big questions  Who did this? Where are we? - to small details (each have a micro-cassette in their pockets and the only way to listen to the messages are provided in the hands of a blood drenched corpse littered at their feet clutching a tape recorder) as their time begins to erode  as well as their sanity.Using flashbacks it is discovered by the good doctor that they are at their situation thanks to a serial killer  or more apropos , serial gamesman  tagged as 'Jigsaw'  whose m.o. is to abduct someone and have them run thru an impossible mechanism designed solely to kill/maim them with the grand design being that each one realize just how precious a commodity life truly is.Adam and Gordon are also discovered to have a handy hacksaw provided for them to attempt an escape but soon learn that the tool will not cut through the heavy metal but should do so nicely through their own ankles! So begins the sweat-inducing, nerve-wracking quest of getting loose in time  for Gordon particularly since he learns his wife and daughter (Potter and Vega) will be killed if he doesn't kill Adam (a single bullet has been left by the sicko and a handy revolver is in the other grasp of the bloodied victim on the filthy floor).Added to the mix is a police investigation involving Det. David Tapp (Glover, in a snaky 'I'm getting' too-old-for-this-s**t potshot at his 'LETHAL WEAPON' character) and his partner Det. Steven Sing (Leung) who are getting too close to the crazed genius with some truly lethal consequences.Wan milks several sequences in dark, cluttered and silent moments of dread while incorporating themes of infidelity, betrayal, redemption and employs a few stock gimmicks including grainy snuff-film video taping, a hair-raising sound effect of a maniacal clown laugh and just for the price of admission one of cinema's creepiest looking puppets to get his messages across.The screenplay by both  native Australians  hearkens back to slasher/psycho exploitation films yet raises the bar in their inventive, ingenious set pieces especially one ghastly recollection with a 'reverse bear trap' head device ; nuff said.There are moments of quiet devastation, nail-biting tension and just enough nervous laughter for the two protagonists racing against their inevitable doomed plight while also evoking many questions by the film's twisty canny climax (stop here if you don't want to realize the reason the pic is titled the way it is).Violence is underscored with scarily innate logic yet not over-the-top (I for one cannot wait for the DVD to see what made the editing floor to get its MPAA R  rating) and it has some greatest hits of the genre standards like the rooting for the victims to get their much thirsted for vengeance.A true crowd-pleaser that doesn't disappoint but will have you wanting to return to put each simply creative puzzle piece together as more questions will come flooding by its stunning conclusion.You've been warned!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best films of the year,"Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Larry (Cary Elwes) awaken to find themselves locked in a filthy, dilapidated public bathroom. As they regain awareness, things go from bad to worse. They see a dead body on the floor between them, and then they realize that they're chained to large pipes on opposite sides of the room. When they discover a hidden message for each, they learn that a madman is playing a sick game with them. Can they win the game and escape with their lives? Every once in a while, I'm given an opportune moment to engage in a mini-rant, so here we go.Anyone wondering why I usually pay no attention to the Academy Awards need look no further than Saw. In my view, Saw should be nominated for eight 2005 Oscars: Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Elwes), Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing--Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Makeup, and Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures--Original Song (Fear Factory's ""Bite the Hand That Bleeds""). Not that I feel it should necessarily win all eight, but it should have a fair shake at them. There are others that I would nominate for some of those categories--including Hellboy, The Village, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Dawn of the Dead, Kill Bill Vol. 2, Shaun of the Dead, and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. But you'll note that out of those, only The Village got a nod (a single nomination). It's difficult for me to take something seriously that is so far off the mark when it comes to recognizing quality films. But it's not as if a general anti-genre bias in the Academy Awards--as well as with professional critics and the self-appointed film literati--has not been noted before.James Wan and Whannell (who takes on double duty as an actor) have authored a tightly interwoven story, with a puzzle theme that draws you in like the best material of the Cube (1997) series combined with a gritty, Se7en (1995)-like serial killer police procedural. The pieces of the plot fit together precisely and unfold like a predetermined chess game. Wan and Whannell build tension gradually, despite the fact that the film comes out of the gate extremely suspenseful.Wan, who also served as director, creates a fabulously disturbing, dingy atmosphere throughout the film, bolstered by Julie Berghoff's production design, which is as inventive as the script. Part of the delightful novelty of the film is the elaborate, potentially fatal puzzles devised by the villain. Berghoff's designs for these scenarios and devices easily matches the lockstep intricacy of the plot and the ominous foreboding of the overall atmosphere. Viewers will likely cringe at vicariously envisioning themselves in the contraptions, and that's much of the point. The cinematography throughout the film is just as imaginative, easily telling a story that often depends on subtle visual cues, and reaching just the right balance of extended techniques, such as the varied film speeds during a car chase.Because so much of the film is focused on just two characters in a single, relatively sparse room, Elwes and Whannell must turn in powerhouse performances, running a gamut of emotions including vulnerable helplessness, studied hopefulness, vengeful anger and frenzied desperation. Both are excellent, with Elwes particularly remarkable. Danny Glover, as Detective David Trapp, is impressive in his transformation from a somewhat typical macho cop to an obsessive loon, perhaps on a par with the villain in his single-minded irrational commitment.The modus operandi and motivation (which serves as the theme) of the villain are intriguingly gray. The victims are often morally questionable, and can potentially benefit from their victimization. They're putatively given an out from their predicaments if they can muster the necessary wit and skill. At least on one level, the villain wants to give his victims a hard lesson and improve their lives.It should have been clear by the comparison to Cube and Se7en that Saw is not for the faint of heart (although it's not quite as gory as it could have been) or for those who want only clear messages of good and evil and happy endings. As one of 2004's best films, however, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

That was INSANE,"I have to admit, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it, even though I didn't really had high expectations about that movie. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative because the concept of the movie was so different than any other horror movie. The storyline was very well written, everything was well-explained and it was very well executed. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. The filming location of the movie was mainly inside a small bathroom. It wasn't a very scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, however, it was very intense and very shocking. The killcount of the movie was very bloody, even though most death scenes were done off-screen. In my opinion, the traps were super innovative and very difficult. The opening scene of the movie was definitely unpredictable, very promising and I really liked it. The ending scene was definitely unexpected, really shocking and mind-blowing. Also, the pacing of the movie was excellent and gladly, there were many flashbacks. Overall, ""Saw"" was an unexpectedly good horror film, very intense, bloody and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic Horror Film,One of the most dynamic villain's of any horror film. A bitt bloody but its a bit of a staple when it comes to the saw movies.

"It ain't ""Last House..."" But comes really close!","In Wes Craven's film ""Last House on the Left"" two teenage girls are kidnapped, taken into woods nearby one of them's house, and tortured literally to death. Then the killers are met by sterner justice from the parents who lived in the last house on the left. This film included disembowelment, chest carving, stabbing, choking, shooting, fist thrown...the works. And to top it all off to boot, Craven had a social commentary to add to the already intense storyline.This film was a lot like ""Last House..."" with the exception of the moral at the end. this film was a plain, scare the pants off ya, turn the lights on in the middle of the night, scream out loud till ya barf twice go crazy, deadbolt your doors, pray you die early type of scare film. Two men are locked in a sewage room and must try to kill one another in order to be free. Other characters and lot twist are added along the way. But the film is executed unnervingly!Elwes and the other dude were really great in their roles. Danny Glover, as a dried out, discharged obsessed cop was great with what little time he had on screen. The rest of the cast did their own little private parts to make it pleasant. Intense character build up creates a surrealistic atmosphere that makes the audience concentrate on exactly what is going on.. creepy stuff.Audiences who see this will probably not be sleeping for awhile...Don't see it alone!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"They came, SAW and altered (Horror Movies)","I haven't seen the original short movie yet (titles SAW as well), but with this feature length effort, a change has been made in Horror movie history. A new sub-genre was born (some call it ""gorno"", because of the explicit gore it has in it)! Many movies tried to copy the formula, but didn't have financial success. Saw on the other hand, is a brand name now. A 5th saw movie will come out later this year (and more are yet to come).But let's talk about this original, that lays some seeds for the other movies to follow. We get the rules to which the character have to play (the general idea) or let's say the concept. It will keep you guessing from beginning to the end, what is going to happen. And although I like the other Saw movies as well, none of them achieved the tension that this one build up! Apart from the gore you'll get a thrilling experience as well! I can only recommend it (as many others do here too)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not any more.""","FILM: 8.5/10.I revisited the 2004 film Saw before catching the latest entry, and it's remarkable how it stands the test of time, even 19 years after its release. Separating this original entry from its increasingly over-the-top and cheesy sequels is a challenging task, but the effort is well worth it.While Saw isn't the epitome of restraint, the film's originality, coupled with its creative direction and production values, keep it firmly at the top of the franchise. It's a testament to the filmmakers' ability to do more with less, considering its small budget origins.Australian talents James Wan and Leigh Whannell have made names for themselves in Hollywood over the years, but revisiting Saw was a reminder of their early potential. I recall Leigh as the guy who did movie reviews on the Saturday morning youth music program Recovery. Their skills shine through in this film, as they display a knack for inventive storytelling and character development, which isn't always a given in the horror genre.The cast, including Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell, work brilliantly off each other. Their chemistry adds depth to the film's tension and intrigue.Of course, in horror, the villain often makes or breaks the experience, and Jigsaw is an excellent antagonist. His motivation is well-crafted, and the execution is both gruesome and thought-provoking, making him a surprisingly relatable villain despite his horrific deeds.One notable aspect of Saw is the traps. Unlike some of the later, more gimmicky entries in the franchise, the traps here are straightforward, adding to the film's intensity. They make the experience feel like a true journey into terror rather than a carnival sideshow.Overall, my rewatch of Saw left me with an appreciation for its enduring impact on the horror genre. It delivers originality, strong horror character work, and the ever-present sense of dread. If you haven't seen it, or it's been a while, it's definitely worth revisiting this horror classic.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Good, Level accuracy: Good, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 9.5/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One word Brilliant,"I'm really disappointed that this movie didn't do as well as it should have at the box office, it deserved better because this film is brilliant.The plot is original, the acting is pretty good (for being shot in 18 days with a low budget), the direction is perfect. This is the type of film that builds tension, not your typical shocker or hack and slash (which is what I thought it was going to be, boy was I wrong) it's psychological horror. I don't know how the director came up with the idea of the scene were the guy has to use the camera to see in the dark, perfect bit of audience manipulation, he makes you feel like you're blind in the dark like the character; ingenious not to mention creepy.

Saw isn't too sharp,"Two people wake up chained to pipes on opposite ends of a room, the two must figure out how to get out. This film started off pretty well and stayed that way all the way to the first flashback where it all begin to unravel. I sat there dumbfounded as the movie got worse and worse. Seeing plot holes left and right. The acting ranged from bad to outright crap. The film is less like the roller-coaster ride it was billed as and more like a stupefying free-fall in quality. Everyone says ""oh the twist is cool"" NOPE, I saw it coming (no pun intended) within five minutes of the start. Deemed one of the best horrors of the year?

"With an absurdly disturbing atmosphere that makes us always aware of what can happen to the characters, the promising director James Wan creates a classic of horror/thriller","How much blood would you give to stay alive? This is one of the most famous questions in Saw, a production that mixes elements of crime, horror and torture porn, as well as the aesthetics of games and the music video, being responsible for opening the doors to an immense soundtrack of films that had torture as one of the central narrative elements.The movie has an interesting premise indeed. The murderer in question is not essentially a murderer. It imprisons people in borderline situations and urges them to maim and kill in exchange for escape. Many commit suicide. What moves the torturer is not mere childhood trauma or asexual psychosis: he simply wants to show his victims, chosen among hypocrites, addicts and indolents, that they should better enjoy the life they are given. Thus, in Saw, two men are locked in a mysterious bathroom, dirty and almost inhospitable. The fight against time is what will engender the events between Dr. Larry Gordon (Cary Elwes) and photographer Adam (Leigh Whannel, who also writes the script), as they wake up and realize they are trapped by the feet by heavy weights. Chains. As the characters unveil the reasons that led them to that place, they both discover they have been kidnapped by Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), a 62-year-old man who had suffered from cancer and decided to impose on people a new way of seeing life, through of bloody traps, aiming at the social rehabilitation of these socially ""deviant"" individuals.The pieces are on the board and the game begins: what would you be able to do to save your life? Would you be able to kill a complete stranger just because your kidnapper orders you to? Would he be able to saw his own foot in order to escape the chain that binds him to the pipeline, as Jigsaw suggests to the two unfortunate prisoners? Or would you try to join forces to find a way out of the dire situation, and clues that might lead to a possible exit or escape? After the characters and the basic situation are presented, Saw develops a fragmented narrative, back and forth in time, using constant flashbacks to explain everything in the film, from why the two are there to how the bad guy acts against past victims. . Through these flashbacks, we meet Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover), who obsessively hunts Jigsaw after he killed his partner and friend when they were both about to arrest him. In addition to being often long and breaking the good rhythm that is in the bathroom, the participation of Danny Glover is more like a supporting role in luxury for everything to happen than a character really useful to the plot. Even so, the actor is doing well and convinces like the policeman who, little by little, is also going crazy looking for his wanted.In the middle of the film, ""Dead Games"" loses its strength a little, thanks to the aforementioned police investigation, but it soon regains its strength as it approaches its end, where the spectator who paid attention to the flashbacks can try to assemble the entire puzzle. Head moving the film. What's most surprising about this film is its completely unexpected ending that breaks all expectations, offering a bleak conclusion for the participants of the sick games. What makes flashbacks work, despite their shortcomings, is the fact that they're all well-directed and thus hold our attention. It is at these moments that some of the most shocking scenes in the film take place, as they show how the serial killer has acted with previous victims with their life and Saw. Creativity and how everything is put on the screen makes us break into a cold sweat, whether from tension, anguish or fear. In fact, this is one of the most harrowing films that have appeared in cinema in recent times. This is the result of a perfect adaptation of the viewer to what is happening on the screen, as the fear that is transmitted to us of being in the same situation as the person on the screen is totally controlled by James Wan, who demonstrates an absolute mastery when building tension, either in the way the camera moves, whether in the transitions between environments in an organic way, or in the direction of the actors and in the use of the scenic space.While showing a minimum of violence and blood (unlike what happens in all sequels, which would go with the scheme ""the more blood, the better""), Saw manages to destroy the viewer's nerves efficiently, showing some of the more sequences. Strains of recent times, some truly sadistic. The traps are well thought out in this film, always demanding a maximum ""sacrifice"" from the players, as exemplified by the Jigsaw quote from the second film: ""How much blood would you give to stay alive?"". The most interesting of them without a doubt is the ""upside down bear trap"" that has become an icon in the franchise. The spectator thinks of all the possible situations for the character to get out of that situation and one is worse than the other, needing more and more blood to survive. And contrary to what most people think, this movie is the one with the least gore of the entire franchise. In the series ""Saws"" the gore was becoming something more and more frequent.The simple synopsis makes this movie a real puzzle, that when we start watching, we fall into a world where intelligence is welcome to solve the puzzles. If you're not so distracted that you forget about the bathroom while the flashbacks happen, they will add a lot. It is always necessary to fully assimilate what is being shown; that you cling to why it is there on the screen. It is not a free or purposeless film, which is another merit of its story (written by first-time director James Wan, along with Leigh Whannel, the Adam of the film, who is also responsible for adapting the story to the script). The good thing is that everything predictable in the story is in the director's hands. We know what he wants us to know and that makes us doubt several characters throughout the plot. With each new fact presented, we start to distrust and suspect a character, which keeps viewers glazed at the screen without blinking all the time and still manages to surprise and shock us with the final revelations.Wan also manipulates the viewer's emotions from beginning to end, taking them on a veritable ride to hell that is completely unpredictable, culminating in the most original and surprising surprise ending in recent times In the style of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Suspects' , in Saw you'll find the kind of film that seems to have been written from a final idea, backwards, so that at all times it leaves clues secretly scattered throughout the film that, at the end, scream at us for a urgent review. The plot was based on a partnership that involved the recollection of childhood nightmares and the constant dialogue between the screenwriters, who communicated in connections during the night in an energetic flow of ideas and possibilities. Comparisons with Seven: The Seven Capital Crimes are virtually unavoidable, as the script is unapologetically inspired by both elements of David Fincher's 1995 well-directed cop, but unlike the capital crimes investigated by an ""angry"" Brad Pitt, Saw follows the point of view of the two cloistered victims. There is also a relationship with Vincenzo Natali's enigmatic Cube, released in 1998, a far-fetched and beautifully orchestrated plot about people in captivity and the need to play to stay out of the stats and become survivors.The film works very well in two different environments, which together form its characteristic language: the policeman's journey and the psychological terror of the two confined victims. Then we have the well-elaborated and chaotic scenario of captivity where the protagonists are trapped, which is dirty and has a disgusting and abandoned appearance, adding an atmosphere of despair to the scenes. During the arc of the policeman, we are introduced to more urban and common places, but always using a certain organization, which gives a slight contrast to the other location. The disorder only arises when the researcher Tapp comes across the cases of the maniac, at this point, the costumes were also well chosen, giving us the identity of each character and their different social classes, an information that will be useful in the course of the film, as we see the differences between Dr. Gordon and Adam.Photography, like art, is designed to complement and bring to life James Wan's vision, using two contrasting color tones between the different languages of horror. The confinement site uses strong, harsh light in contact with shades of blue, gray and white, giving it the look of a terrifying nightmare that emulates a bit of the classic B movies of the 80s, but with a more serious and careful approach. There are also very unusual framings and movements, in addition to the frantic editing of Kevin Greutert, who takes over the film and creates a crazy and authorial aesthetic for this, and for the next features of the franchise, together with the soundtrack signed by Charlie Clouser, which brings to everyone for the first time the theme that would become the ""face"" of the saga, as well as the soundtracks of Tubarão and Psicose (1960) became emblematic for their respective films.In a genre (horror/suspense) that is increasingly taken by mediocrity and abuse of special effects, where millions of dollars are often burned in soulless and emotionless productions, Saw is a real relief and also a breath of hope, showing that good stories still exist and can be told with very little money and in practically a single scenario. With an absurdly disturbing atmosphere that makes us always aware of what can happen to the characters, the promising director James Wan creates a work that lives up to its fame, with its captive space among the great productions of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally a B-grade horror film that scares and surprises! Great stuff,"Two men awake in a white-tiled fluorescent-lit room, chained to opposite walls, a dead body between them. The only clue as to how they got there is a recorded message. Gradually they realize they have been targeted by serial killer Mr Jigsaw.What's interesting about Mr Jigsaw is that he's the kind of crazy who likes to teach his victims lessons and test their intelligence. Although there's not a lot of gore in this relatively unusual hybrid of psychological thriller and horror, Saw is genuinely terrifying in moments, and merely stressful the rest of the time. The wire jaw lock is particularly memorable. The uneven acting of the cast  Cary Elwes is particularly overblown  doesn't detract, it just makes Saw more of a B-film indulgence.Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who also stars), both from Melbourne, have scored an international hit with this film, which went to No. 1 at the UK box office and to No. 3 in the USA. A sequel has been announced for 2005.Even if you're not easily scared, don't see Saw alone, particularly at night. ***1/2/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slick thriller in the mould of Se7en that covers writing weaknesses with consistent tension & urgency,"(This review contains no spoilers but it is better when you know very little about it and I would suggest not reading any reviews on the film but to just go and see it!)Adam wakes up in a bath of water to find himself in a dark room, chained to a large pipe. On the other side of the room is one Dr Lawrence Gordon, who finds himself in the same position, in the middle of the room is a dead man with a gun and a Dictaphone in his hand. Two recorded messages reveal that Gordon's wife and daughter have been kidnapped and will be killed at 6pm that same day. The only way this will not happen is if Gordon kills Adam before this time, a feat that will involve getting out of his chains and to the gun.The marketing campaign for this film had a very impacting poster with very little text and just the word 'SAW' on it. In a way, with no real bankable names in the cast to sell itself on, the film sold itself on the one thing that will always get audiences in  a concise and interesting central premise. Here it is very simple and very interesting and sets up a real tension from the outset that never really lets up until the very end. Let me just say now that tense is not the same as terrifying and viewers coming to this film looking for loads of gore and screaming horror will be let down; in fact I would class this film as a thriller more than I would a horror for this reason. The film opens with us right in this scenario of the chains etc and quickly we learn the ground rules and then learn more about the Jigsaw killer who is doing it. The flashbacks just take the edge off the main story a little bit but they do work well enough in themselves, and produce a more complex story.In a way this is where the weaknesses come in because the hook of the simple premise is expanded out into a wider story  and not all of it hangs together with a great deal of logic. The motives of the killer are unsure and the way that everything does fit into place is unconvincing (to name two problems) but, while it is on, the film's tension covers these gaps and does a good job of holding you in its spell. This spell lasts no longer than the final credits as you begin to pick holes in the actual story, but by then you'll have been entertained and into the film too much to really let the plot holes bother you and it is only those hoping for a story to match the darkness of Se7en will be letdown, this is not of the same caliber as that film but it is still fun. The director has learnt from several other films and genres. He knows that the simple premise can be used as a great hook for a simple story (many short films do the same), he knows from Se7en that sometimes the horror we imagine is much worse than the one we can see, and he knows from recent Japanese horror movies that unsettling images are scarier than outright gore (hence the use of clown and pig heads). In terms of style the film is winning if a little overdone. Time skips forward with frantic camera movements, 'dank' is painted thick on every scene and generally the film delivers a mood of tension, urgency and unsettling action.Not using the cast for the marketing was a good choice because there are no real a-list names here and, sadly, there are several botched jobs on the acting side. Whannell is good and does a solid job  even handling the script's 'comic relief' requirements without letting it take away from the dire nature of his situation. Elwes is OK but not as consistent. At times his delivery is flat and sounds like he is delivering some more serious lines in his 'Princess Bride' character, sounding insincere and wooden. It also didn't help that his make up for the majority of the film made him look like a tired old queen  I know it was supposed to be like white plastery stuff, but on Whannell it looked good but on Elwes it looked like it had been spread evenly! Glover is OK but given too little to do and his character changes too much too quickly before we have even known who he was.Support from people like Leung and Martinez add familiar faces and generally the support cast do OK  but in keeping with the simple premise idea, the film is best when it keeps those involved to the minimum.Overall this is an effective thriller. It will be compared to Se7en but it doesn't have the writing to really stand in the same crowd as that movie; the plot has too many holes and the twists often come from a desire to surprise and confound rather than coming as a natural part of the story (ie they don't have the common sense impact of Se7en's conclusion). However what it does do well is deliver a sense of tension and urgency focused on this 'simple' premise. This tension works so well that it pretty much covers the plot problems while you are watching the film, and you are swept along with it as you watch. After the film you'll pick away at it and it won't stand up to repeat viewings but it is still a great fun film while you're with it.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Great horror, but is ultimately lacking in purpose","Considering it is by some margin the best contribution to American horror since Se7en, Saw is a strangely unengaging film.It is certainly slick enough. Throwing you right into the action you awake, along with the lead character (Adam) in a Fincher-esque, dingy underground bathroom/dungeon. You soon find Adam is not alone. Across the room another is another man. Both are chained by the ankle, taken by the mysterious jigsaw killer. The room contains a dead body, a gun and two saws. To survive, one of the men must kill the other by 6pm. If not, both die. Problem is, the saws won't cut the chains. To make it out, you must not only be prepared to kill; you also have to saw off your own footNice.Don't get me wrong, there are some good, if not terribly subtle, twists in the film; told mainly through the flashbacks of Adam's fellow captive, Lawrence. And the film has one or two moments that will be relished by the gore-fest lovers. There is some pretty good acting here too, especially from Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Danny Glover (Detective Tapp).The problem mainly lies in the fact that the film is such an obvious homage to Se7en - many of stylistic devices very reminiscent of the Fincher film  without any of the substance. Fincher manages the neat trick of wallowing in the murky side of the human psyche while appearing appalled by it as well. Saw just seems to revel in the brutality. If you're expecting moments that force the audience to be introspective, you won't find them here. Saw just isn't interested in discussing apathy, or greed or even the value of life that the killer talks about. The jigsaw killer is just another sick f*ck, complete with Thomas Harris name, eerie doll, dank warehouse apartment and kitsch slasher movie hang-outs (like subterranean car parks).All this leaves the film feeling a bit devoid of purpose. In style very much life Se7en, in execution, more like Friday 13th. Which is a shame, because there really is much to enjoy here if you're a fan of the red stuff. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Seeing is believing... well, sort of","From what I can relate to you about this movies is--and I'm not 'the brightest bulb in the box'--there's this evil, scary-looking masked killer who wears a 'Punch-and-Judy' puppet-style papier-mache mask, who likes to torture young people and actor Danny Glover. The masked killer speaks to his intended victims through some type of voice-altering electronic sound device to disguise his real voice, and proceeds to teach his human quarry a few valuable lessons about...whatever it is they're supposed to have learned and known already.You may recognize some of the lead and supporting players in this one, such as Cary Elwes (as opposed to his less serious role in the children's comedy ""The Princess Bride"") and Shawnee Smith (an '80s horror veteran due to her debut in ""The Blob"" remake).Throughout the course of ""Saw"" the plot gets sort-of muddled and just the tiniest bit exasperating to (this) viewer's more rational senses. The story's premise is nevertheless engaging. Things happen that you thought wouldn't happen, and vice-versa.

Silence of the Lambs + Mythbusters = Win,"Horror films like this may be old hat today, but I think we should dedicate a moment of silence to honor what may have been the first of its kind. OK, enough silence, let's get back to blood curdling screams.""Saw"" distinguished itself from the usual 90s-00s horror tosh by taking a pseudo intellectual approach as in classics like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""The Cell"" where the killer is not just a mindless hockey goalie on a bad day with power tools. The killer has a distinct, logical, stylish modus operandi that will appeal to people who know the meaning of the word ""modus operandi"". If you don't, or if you don't care, there's still plenty of suspense, action and blood & guts (literally) to keep you entertained from start to finish.""Saw"" is the story of a serial killer who is highly intelligent, highly resourceful (some of the diabolical devices he builds could be featured on Mythbusters), and most interestingly the killer is driven by a twisted sense of morality. This brings to mind the mother of all serial-killer-morality tales ""Seven"" which Saw undoubtedly drew inspiration from. While I don't think ""Saw"" is in league with ""Seven"", it does a great job of keeping up, and I think it's worth a watch.Danny Glover (""Lethal Weapon"") playing the obsessed cop on a manhunt and Cary Elwes (I'll always remember him from ""The Princess Bride"") playing the intelligent victim, raise the bar with their excellent, characteristic performances. And while the story may have 1 or 2 loopholes, you can handily overlook them in light of these two iconic actors and a story that unravels suspensefully at every turn.I did want to mention one thing for the squeamish (as well as those of you who crave the squeam), ""Saw"" isn't as over-the-top disgusting as I had been told. Yes, there's a ton of blood and a few hurl worthy scenes of bad things happening to body parts, but for the most part it's somewhat tame by today's standards. I actually like that, because it's a film I can recommend to my mom. The lack of nudity/sex and the interesting morality angle furthermore might make it a family-safe film. If your family happens to live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane. But you catch my drift.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Film that started another Horror franchise,"I haven't watched this in a long time, likely since around 2005/2006ish when it was still fresh and the sequels were being developed. Saw 2 is ok, but i never cared for the rest of them. Although i categorized this franchise as ""Horror"" in my title, after re-watching it recently it felt much more like a gritty mystery thriller similar to ""Se7en"" than it does your typical slasher or ghost story.James Wan and Leigh Whannell wrote the story, Wan directed and Whannell plays a lead role in the film. It's obvious Saw was produced on a small budget, but somehow the writers and actors were able to pull off a massively engaging film. From the opening scene where we get introduced to 2 men who awaken in a dirty disgusting shower-room with a dead guy laying on the floor between them, the film does a great job of throwing the viewer into the story quickly capturing their attention. From there we delve into these 2 men being held captive and them trying to figure out how and why they are chained up. There are also sub-plots involving 2 detectives attempting to track down ""Jigsaw"" and flashbacks providing context to the story involving the 2 men.The style and editing that Wan introduced was something not quite done before, and was frequently copied in the following years for better or worse. The acting isn't great, but it's no worse than most horror films. The ""Horror"" genre wasn't exactly flourishing at this time (maybe due to 9/11 and the Iraq war being recent events fresh in everyone's mind) but this film gave the genre a bit of a revival again, for better or worse.Whatever the film lacks in terms of production, the story and directing style more than makes up for it.

This is a masterpiece addition to the horror genre,"Saw (2004) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows two strangers that find themselves handcuffed to pipes in an abandoned warehouse basement. They have no idea who eachother are or why they are there. A monitor pops on and tells them they'll help them figure out the answers to those questions; but first, they're going to have to play a game...This movie is directed by James Wan (Dead Silence) and stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride), Leigh Whannell (Cooties), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Ken Leung (Old), Dina Meyer (Bords of Prey) and Shawnee Smith (The Blob).This movie is magnificently written, perfectly cast, fairly original and brilliantly uses background music to create intensity. The torture devices are fun as is the character's reactions to each circumstance. The dialogue is tremendous and there's some Se7en like sequences in this that make me smile every time I watch it. The kill scenes have tremendous gore and are like nothing before it. The conclusion is intense and very thoughtful.Overall, this was a masterpiece addition to the horror genre that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Yeah, I saw it. That is to say I seen it.","Saw really should be exempt from most criticism as James Wan managed to pull of a helluva trick considering the innumerable restrictions and compromises that made the shoot very hard for the first-time feature director. Who'd ever believe that such a tiny movie would be the first to re-invent horror for the 21st century? Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell play Doctor Gordon and hapless jerk Adam, a mis-matched duo who wake up in a disgusting bathroom chained to the piping at either end of the expansive room. A dead body lies between, blood and gore on the floor around it. Doctor Gordon suspects that it is the work of the infamous ""Jigsaw"" - a madman known for subjecting lowlifes to brutal tests to prove their desire to live.A series of flashbacks follow which build a greater story around the plight of the two men, culminating in a climax that is still as unnerving now as it was nearly 10 years ago. Saw is a very clever film, but is let down by overly filtered cinematography, choppy editing that is full of stutter cuts, and a sound design that is bloated with far too many cheap stingers. The acting is a little weak at times too but considering the conditions, and the fact that there was no rehearsal at all so the footage you see is sometimes the first attempt by the actors to get it done means you can't judge it too harshly.The production design tries to emulate David Fincher's Se7en but ends up looking like a cheap 70s porno. But the whole film was shot in one big building, so you just can't pick faults. Like I said, what Wan managed to pull off with the time and budget he was given is nothing short of remarkable. The sequels were given more money to crazy with, but the first Saw movie should be viewed as a different entity.Love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Thriller Ever!!!,"In the recent years, the horror movies have evolved and finally stopped trying to ""scare"" the audience. No matter how gory, loud or jumpy a movie is, it is almost impossible to scare an intellectual scary movie enthusiast with clown dolls or simple ghost stories, because he's just seen tens of them. Because of this fact, the new generation of horror movies entertain the viewer with either the element of ""surprise & shock"" (like ""Identity"", ""Others"") or ""beautiful shooting & fx"" (like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""28 Days Later""). ""SAW"" uses the ""surprise"" element, and does it all the way to make me say ""Holy CRAP!"" out loud. The plot is beautifully written, makes you more curious by each second that passes by, and fully satisfies the horror-lover in the end. Furthermore it does all these with a budget of 1 million dollars and an inexperienced director! Indeed there will probably be wannabe intellectual people who will try to find flaws in it or tell they don't like it, just to create controversy and to look different. Other than that, I can't imagine any horror/thriller lover dislike this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy thriller which has you second-guessing everything,"Saw's trailers and teasers are full of misleading clips which make you believe that the story is about a maniacal killer who has a grouping of puzzles that the person captive must solve in order to stay alive. What the trailers do not tell you is the depth of emotion and psychosis that was put into the movie itself that has you actually caring about those possible victims.This film was a hair-raising thriller to the worst degree as you see characters trying to figure out how they are going to get out of a dire struggle for life and more time to figure out their future after the day that they get put into such a situation. The shots were very stylish and moody as anything released before this film. There has never been a horror/thriller quite like this before, which is amazing because so many thrillers released within the last 5 years have either copied each other in certain shots or stylistics, or they steal from the problems of the main villain of other films. This does neither and it's amazing.The music was on par with movies like 8mm and Se7en and that sort of heavy metal meets unknowing timpani sets of action movies' past. The film was very stylistic, but given the time that it was shot in (18 days!), the film seems better directed knowing that they took less time to do it in. The film was written and directed by the same man (with help from another guy writing), and hopefully we'll see more from the director. The whole puppet thing was odd, and it didn't need to be in this film for anything else than a visual creepy thing, and later on, it served a purpose to tell detectives where the murderer was, but still... I was kind of angry about the fact that there was no in-depth behind-the-scenes on the DVD, and instead it was replaced by an extra-long ""making-of"" of a horrible Fear Factory video. (the video is basically the movie, but more green-screens and cheesy effects including a fake heart, a model who couldn't act, and a lead singer who couldn't have cared less about him being in the video) So I gave this film 7/10 stars. I also would've casted a different doctor actor (from the beginning, he seems to be overacting a lot of the time). But Danny Glover was amazing and a class-act amongst a lot of no-name actors in the States (I might've seen the doctor actor before, but he looks like every other straight-character-actor). But those points are the only I could find wrong with this film. It is a definite buy if you have a chance because of everything I said up above.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
convoluted bloody fun,"Adam Stanheight wakes up in a dirty lavatory chained to a pipe. He finds Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) also chained on the other side of the room. There's a dead body in the middle. They play audio tapes and the voice tells Gordon that he must kill Stanheight before 6 O'clock or else his wife Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter Diana (Makenzie Vega) will die. Adam finds two saws in the toilet tank. Gordon suspects the perpetrator is the Jigsaw Killer. He recounts police detectives David Tapp (Danny Glover), Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) and Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigating. Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) is an orderly and John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is his patient. Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) is the only known survivor of the killer's elaborate games with a harness wired to her jaw.I love the compelling premise of two guys chained in a room. Once Amanda Young's harness shows up, the movie becomes too convoluted to be scary. On the other hand, it becomes fun splatter. There is no denying that the elaborate plans are ridiculous but the movie completely owns it. Jigsaw is a Picasso clown and that's part of the fun. There is an interesting mystery of trying to escape from the room. It would be better if Jigsaw isn't so invasive leaving the clues. For example, there is no need for a clue to tell them to turn off the lights. It would be more compelling for the guys to guess on their own. It feels like a carefully laid out path and there is no tension in that. I'm not revealing the final twist but there are good points and bad points about that. It's impossibly elaborate but utterly surprising.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Live or Die. Make your Choice.,"In many horror movies I have watched, I always think the first parts doesn't bring up too much and isn't always that complete, that it's much missing, and it's just some weak beginnings. In Saw, it's way different. This is probably one of the most epic and complete horror beginnings I have watched in a while. The story starts of with two men trapped in an abandoned facility room or something like that, and they have to follow the sick ""Jigsaw"" rules too escape and save their lives. They can choose to live or die, but the sacrifice most be big. While the men tries to escape, they go through their backstory too find out why they were trapped in this room. And further and further they think, things starts to connect together like a picture out of puzzles. It was very well shown, how the crime investigation goes on, collecting the clues, finding meaning in them, and of course, explore the Jigsaw killers philosophy, that I'm not sure is that good. The story has a fast pace, went through the story in detail, the action was holding, and it wasn't one moment in the film that I thought was boring. The characters here were extremely important for the story, not just some random people that gets killed. Everyone had a purpose in their action, and everyone was linked to the killer in some or other way. Especially the two men trapped in the room, Laurence Gordon and Adam Stanheight, that meant a lot for the Jigsaw killer. The story gave us some understanding for his motive to trap them. The traps were original and creative, made in a violent way, that really made impression. The people escaping the traps had a great expression of fear. I also liked that they focused much on the investigation, not just the traps themselves. Because with the traps only, I think this would be a very boring film. The runtime was just perfect (As I mentioned, no boring parts) and it was very well divided into three, great parts, with the ending that had an amazing plot twist and new course of action, and personally, gave me a new perspective at everything. Including the Saw theme by Charlie Clouser ""Hello Zepp"" for the ending, gave it a dramatic conclusion, that couldn't have been better. For the technicals, I want to mention the camera filming. Very fast paced and dynamic, the fast motion and speed-fast transitions and scene fades gave it much more action and taste into the scene. The use of perspective and unique angles, made this an unforgettable experience. For the music, as I mentioned, ""Hello Zepp"" was an absolute banger, but the rest of the themes were great, too, they fitted the scenes and put things on a new level. The acting was good, dramatic and realistic. Summarizing, Saw was an amazing psychological thriller, and something everyone definitely should watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not the best, but certainly not the worst.","I never intended to see this, but when it came on TV at 12:30 am, I decided what the heck. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's a campy B-movie, with a lot of unintentionally funny stuff (it seemed like Whannell and Elwes were having a contest to see who could be the worst actor of the century), but it is creative enough to make you forget all that. The idea of these people being put in situations where they have no choice but to kill themselves is very imaginative, as is the killer's motivation (making them grateful to be alive). And I usually can see twists coming from miles away, but the horrifying ending took me completely by surprise. If you can get past the cheesiness, and just admire the script's creativity, it is an entertaining thriller that sticks with you long after you've watched it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The piecing together of a brutal puzzle ensues.,"How far would you go to save your own life? Go ahead; ask yourself that question right now. Exactly how far would you go? Would you kill someone if your life were on the line? Would you cut through someone's stomach to get something you needed to save yourself? Would you watch an entire night of UPN programming with no interruptions? Would you make out with Rosie O'Donnell? The extent a person would go to save his life, an indication of how much he actually wants to live, is the underlying theme of Saw.The movie follows the sick and twisted exploits of a killer only known as ""Jigsaw."" But in reality, he hasn't killed anybody. He's much more sadistic than that. He places people in very dire circumstances and then tells them what they need to do in order to survive. It's all part of his game. You break the rules, then you'll pay the consequences.Simply put, Saw is one of the most entertaining, original thrillers of the year. You might want to introduce yourself to the edge of your seat before the movie starts because chances are the two of you will be getting acquainted real quick. In fact, it might not hurt to bring it flowers. My interest was piqued at the very start, and just when I was scared I had figured everything out (and was getting disappointed because I thought things were going to be too predictable), the movie slapped me right upside my face and taught me a little lesson in not thinking too far ahead.Now if you're the nitpickiest of nitpickers, then you can find enough nits to pick if you have nothing better to do. The movie's got its flaws; I won't deny that. Plot contrivances? Check. Plot holes? Sure. The acting? Well, it's a tad suspect at times, mainly in regard to Cary Elwes. Rumor has it that a landing strip was placed on ""the top,"" and he just flew right over it. Elwes kicked subtlety in the crotch, and then beat it while it was down. He's all right when he is more constrained, but at times it feels like he is auditioning for a high school production of Hamlet. I haven't seen so many crocodile tears since Bill Clinton attended Ron Brown's funeral. Oh well, just be prepared to laugh at him and you'll be fine. Other than that, the acting is decent even though most of the characters like to scream a lot.Personally, I can ignore the film's flaws because I was mainly concerned with where the movie was headed and if it could pull everything together effectively. I'm happy to report that the climax is possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie I've seen this year. Off the top of my head I count six unexpected twists in that short amount of time. To put it bluntly, the ending knocked my socks off, ran 'em through the rinse cycle, chewed 'em up into little pieces, spit 'em in my face, and made me thank it for the privilege. It was quite the spectacle.I guess I better warn you that if you're looking for a pot of gold and a rainbow at the end of these proceedings, then you'll be disappointed. But I liked the ending. It fit with the dark tone and dreary atmosphere of the rest of the movie. This isn't a love-fest about every child in the world getting a puppy. It's a movie about a demented individual with a really warped view on what constitutes a fun game. I guess Yahtzee just doesn't do it for some people.THE GISTSaw is the perfect thriller to get you in the Halloween spirit. It's not what I'd call overly scary, but it'll keep you in a constant state of unease. The scariest thing about the movie is that there *could* be an individual out there like ""Jigsaw,"" but it's probably best if you don't dwell on that.If you don't like gruesome movies that revolve around people in very tense, unenviable positions, then this may not be for you, but it wasn't nearly as gory as I was expecting. For the most part we're shown the beginning of an act of violence or gore, and then we're allowed to form our own mental images. It's really nothing I haven't seen on a very special ""Viewer Discretion is Advised"" episode of CSI. So if you think you can handle it then check it out and enjoy the thrill ride.Rating: 4 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

In that room were all the clues and tools they needed to escape, or risk perishing there; all they had to do was find them.""Saw"" was one twisted movie but it was well done. The movie held you in suspense throughout while also interweaving the necessary background information that lead the two pawns to their current situation. Saw was made effective by having an appealing multi-layered plot. There was the cop trying to catch Jigsaw (the bad guy), there were the two guys in the room trying to get out, and of the two guys, one guy in the room also needed to save his family, and on top of all that you are trying to figure out just who the bad guy was.I was completely engrossed in this movie. I wanted to see the two guys survive and I desperately wanted the mastermind behind the whole sick scheme to be caught, and preferably tortured. This was one of those thrillers where you had a true rooting interest in seeing the antagonist either caught or destroyed. Every suspense or thriller has an antagonist, but not many have one that you can really loathe and pray for his demise. ""Saw"" effectively combined the suspense of whether or not the two main characters would survive along with the suspense of whether or not the bad guy would be caught.

Clever. Heart pounding fright and terror. The birth of a new horror franchise.,"Saw when first released in 2004, the low budget horror flick, wasn't expected to do much, but guess what surprise over 100 million! It looks as if though James Wan has founded a new horror gem. When I finally viewed it I was amazed at the clever plot and bloody gore. Saw is well done, well shot as it tries to teach us morals. Only these life lessons are taught by a new sadistic serial killer Jigsaw, who abducts his morally wayward and he puts each in a horrific game of cat and mouse survival. The abducted must fight for life or die in the process. And some of Jigsaw's methods are clever and cruel such as chaining victims feet together, strapping people to seats with leather even ranging from fire torture and barb wire cutting methods how cruel and sick! Saw begins with Carry Elwes who plays an abducted doctor who is chained up with an abducted photographer, the cat and mouse game is clever and sickening, as Jigsaw watches both thru camera and makes cell phone calls to them! The Elwes character is unaware that Jigsaw has held hostage his wife and daughter, and the only way they survive is that the photo man must die. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega give fine performances as the wife and daughter of the Elwes's character. It is just so sad and sickening though when the sadistic killer has both the Monica and Makenzie characters bound, tied up and gagged. As while both are pleading for mercy the crazy uses a stethoscope to check the fright and fast heartbeat of Makenzie while he points a gun to Monica's head, how terrifying as they both scream and cry thru their gagged mouths. Really a tough scene, overall this film is frightening in a way that disturbs the mind as a dangerous game that's tough to win, it seems only the lucky survive. Saw is a must see it was good to finally see a new twist and take on the horror genre with Jigsaw. I must finally say a thumbs up for James Wan's clever new fright franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Refreshing directorial debut let down by dire acting,"To cut straight to the point, Saw is an original and refreshing horror movie. It's premise - where people are put in potentially fatal situations by a twisted psychopath in order to appreciate their lives if they survive - is an interesting one. The psychopath in question, the 'Jigsaw' killer, is a good creation. His puppet-messenger is truly disturbing (especially if you were scared of ventriloquists dummies when you were younger), and there are moments in the film of real tension. For a first film, hats must go off to the two young writers, one of whom stars in (Leigh Whannell) and the other who directs the film (James Wan).The film could have been a superb horror flick, but it really is let down by some appalling acting. And the main culprits should be ashamed: step forward Mr Glover and Mr Elwes. These guys have been around, yet they turn in performances worthy of teenage drama classes only. Bad drama classes. Cary Elwes especially is abysmal. His performance elicited laugh-out-loud moments from the audience from people like me who could not believe that this guy does this for a living. It is so unfortunate that much of the film's final act hinges on Elwes, because instead of sending us reeling and shocked form what is undoubtedly a fine twist at Saw's end, we only emerge ruefully chuckling to ourselves and wondering just how good this movie might have been if an actor of any kind of ability had replaced Elwes.If you like your horror fresh, twisted and dark, see Saw. Just prepare yourself to feel a little blunted by it's performers.Rating ** and a half (out of five)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Worth seeing if you're into these kinds of movies...,"If you like movies such as Seven and Silence of the Lambs, then you will probably enjoy this movie. Alright, the acting was pretty laughable in this movie, and the general story was not that original, but it really had some great, and gruesome, ideas. Many people compare it to Seven, but I think it really worked off some of the ideas in Seven well, improved it some and really made the ideas its own. The cinematography was awesome, and the movie was overall creepy. The movie can be pretty gross at parts, and tends to be very suspenseful and tense. There are virtually no boring parts in this movie. Just lots and lots of rising tension. Very thrilling. The ending was also a complete shocker. Actually, a common complaint amongst my friends is that the ending is too shocking! I know that sounds odd, but once you see the ending, you're going to think to yourself, ""Wow, I did not see that coming at all."" Sure, there are some scenes that the acting is so bad, that it's funny. And it is funny, rather than lame, so I'm not complaining. Some movies seem like they have bad acting, but it's really just poorly written. It's the opposite for this movie. It's well-written, just some of the actors are bad. It's just a good thing that the acting does not really take away from the creepiness of the movie, and its great ideas. So if you like these kinds of movies, then I'm sure that you'll enjoy Saw. And if you do not appreciate the ideas in this movie, then I'm sure you'll at least find some of the acting to be entertaining. 7 out of 10.

a trite cliché with delusions of grandeur,"SEVEN (or ""se7en"", whatever) was a really good film. The killer (Kevin Spacey) was presented in such a way as to challenge us, the audience, about what we really believed about the nature of good and evil, and the status of those concepts in our current society. His madness was affective (with an ""a"") because of the degree of method it involved. He was a smart guy who had really thought about what he was doing and honestly believed that he was right. That we could ~almost~ (that's the key) identify with him, made him all the scarier, and all the more thought-provoking.Unlike seven, SAW is pure fluff. This movie has nothing of consequence to say about anything. It has pretensions of being in a similar vein as SEVEN, but any similarities between the two movies exist only at the most superficial level. It's like writing a harlequin romance in iambic pentameter and comparing it to Shakespeare.The movie has all the typical elements of a provocative psychological thriller, but without any unifying principle to legitimate them. There are plenty of bizarre murders and plot twists, but in the end the only point behind any of it is gratuitous shock value. (Picture the filmmakers prodding you in the arm, saying ""That was some pretty messed up sh*t, huh!?!?"") I especially disliked the murder sequences that looked and sounded like Nine Inch Nails videos. It's works for about 2 1/2 seconds, at which point you ask yourself ""what exactly is the point here anyway?"".Unlike Spacey's character in SEVEN, the serial killer in SAW is just some old guy who's angry at the world because he's dying of cancer. Thus he decides to punish people he feels are taking their healthy lives for granted, by coming up with twisted ""games"" in which they're forced to kill or mutilate themselves or others to remain alive, the ""lesson"" supposedly being that one should value one's own life over everything else, including the lives of others. In my opinion, this is a shallow nihilistic philosophy that's about as ""profound"" as Nazism. Overall, SAW is a pointless exploitation flick that is nowhere nearly as interesting as it pretends to be.I have to admit that it's not entirely without craft (I have seen worse movies - WAY worse, in fact), but the end result I found to be primarily irritating for the simple reason that SAW DOES NOT DELIVER THE GOODS. If it didn't promise them in the first place, this would be okay, (I probably would have given it 5 or 6 stars), but as I have been arguing, that is not the case. I could overlook the plot holes and hackneyed genre conventions if the movie professed to be frivolous entertainment and nothing more. But it doesn't! It tries to pass itself off as a truly disturbing and ""serious"" film. If this is the criteria by which SAW is to be judged, it fails, miserably.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Of course, it is not a perfect movie because there are some things that do not make sense anyway such as some choices that mother and daughter make but these are small mistakes that are present in any movie of the horror genre because unfortunately you have to give meaning and especially a duration to the events that happen.

Saw cuts through a meticulously intricate crime mystery with nothing but bloody wits.,"The cultural phenomenon that has spawned an entire, albeit probably unnecessary, franchise including sequels, prequels, video games and a theme park ride (Thorpe Park anyone?). The film that put the modern legend that is James Wan on the blood-soaked Hollywood map, whilst also establishing the Wan/Whannell dream team. So, this being my first time watching it, was Saw really that sharp of a thriller? Or just blunted by its overbearing sequels? Well, suffice to say, it holds up with excellence. Two men wake up in a dilapidated bathroom with only one order: one must kill the other in order to save his family.An ultimatum that would test the psychological stimuli and moral compasses of both the characters and the audience. Raising that inevitable question: ""what would you do?"". Wan immediately inserts his hyper-kinetic energy, with the assistance of the hyperactive editing team, and introduces several of his trademark directing techniques. Panoramic camera rotations, seamless switches between handheld and static and elongated takes through dark corridors. Sometimes the bursts of 30-40 cuts within a 3 second timeframe is somewhat disorientating, and the aura of TV-movie presides over the frenetic editing, however Wan just about maintains a level of cinematic quality. And with that, his unique storytelling along with Whannell'a script makes for a tantalising thriller.The suspense immediately kicks in when we find ourselves stuck in this room with these two unknown characters. Why are they here? Who are they? How do they escape? It resembled one of those ""escape room"" activities that seem to be rapidly popular for recreational enjoyment these days. But then the narrative shifts. Of course Wan could not keep up the tension for an hour and forty minutes in a room, there wasn't enough substance. So he ingeniously integrated a flashback structure that slowly revealed who these characters were and why they were there tied up in chains. It had a sniff of 'Se7en' meets 'CSI: Miami'. Yet it illustrated the almost labyrinthine story that Whannell devised, with Wan carefully placing breadcrumbs. It held my attention solidly throughout. The serial killer ""jigsaw"", along with his puppet, was practically immortalised after this film. Horror fans would consistently quote ""I wanna play a game"", which is a testament to the staying power of Wan's creation.There are however a few issues. The acting on occasion was, how can I put it, iffy. Whannell starred in the film alongside Elwes and were probably the strongest performances. Glover, Smith and Vega on the other hand were not nearly as effective. The devices and traps that ""Jigsaw"" created unfortunately didn't hold much memorability. Mostly because they were tainted by frantic editing, particularly the barbed wire trap, but mostly because the focus was solely on the current mystery. Which is acceptable, although the sudden focus on the ""jaw breaker"" device held no tension and lost the suspense raised so far, merely included just to highlight the crazed morality of the antagonist.Oh, how could I end this review without spoiling the infamous plot twist? I jest. Unfortunately I knew about it beforehand, but its execution was effortless and I would imagine it blew everyone's mind upon release. That accompanied with the famous theme tune? Yeah. That's gold. Well there you go. Saw is still as sharp as ever and despite a few poor technical and narrative decisions, it comes as no surprise why a franchise was born.

The Pride of horror movies,"First of all I want to thank James Wan and Leigh Whannell created such a good movie. Imagine horror movies coming out one after another with low quality and Saw not existing? That scenario is really boring. I have watched this movie several times, and this is truly a rare bottle of wine. It is not too special and received prestigious awards in film categories, but its entertainment quality is truly amazing. The movie is not too complicated and detective-like like Se7en, nor does it have a lot of inferences and confusing editing like Gone Girl, those movies always need to be watched again and again to understand. This film also does not contain metaphorical details or references to literature. There may be people who like those genres more than me. But for me, these are the movies I want to experience. Shocking plot twists, creative plot, and more specifically, this is a horror movie. Of course, this movie has not yet reached excellence, the character Jigsaw was raised to the level of someone so outstanding that he could predict the police and all developments everywhere, and the story was also edited so that Jigsaw there can be perfect safety. There are characters that are not really clear like Zep, how did Jigsaw manipulate him? And Dr. Gordon's flashback about Jigsaw's cases is quite disturbing but not interesting enough. But we can ignore all that and enjoy the feeling of fear that Saw brings, because certainly Jigsaw and that doll have become an icon of horror movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great movie one of the best,From the first time i watched it when I was 9 it has been one of the best movies I have ever seen from the beginning to the end the ending has allways been the best ending in a movie that I have ever seen the next 2 movies have good endings but do not compare to this one and to this day it has been one of the most nistolgic movies no matter how many times I have watched it never gets old.i have watched horror movies since I was 7 and I have seen so many that I can't even count and this is 100% in the top 3 maybe even the best if your looking to find a good movie i definitely recemend this one.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slightly disappointing and over-hyped horror/thriller.,"Two strangers,Dr. Lawrence Gordon and Adam,awaken in a dank bathroom in the middle of nowhere.They are chained to opposite walls of the room,and lying between them is one very dead guy who has clearly shot himself in the head.The two men each find an audio cassette tape in their pocket, and it is soon revealed that Gordon must kill Adam in a given amount of time in order to save his family from the maniacal Jigsaw Killer.But is the Jigsaw Killer really a killer? Afterall,he just sets up the demented situations and lets his victims kill themselves.""Saw"" by James Wan is a mildly effective and slightly disturbing horror/thriller.It's definitely influenced by ""Seven"" and Dario Argento's works,especially ""Tenebre"".The plot is pretty twisted and the climax is rather shocking,however the acting is sometimes amateurish and MTV-style camera-work is quite annoying at times.Also very little gore,apart from a few brief flashback,is depicted in ""Saw"".So if you like dark horror movies you can give it a look.However I still think that ""Wolf Creek"" is a much better film.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Despite a good premise and signs of potential talent from James Wan, Saw completely falls apart in the last half-hour.","Rating: * 1/2 out of ****Opening to acclaim throughout a number of film festivals, Saw became the low-budget horror flick that came out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise. But hype has its backlash, and in my case, I can't say I came out of this film particularly impressed. There are elements in the film worth appreciating, but aside from a few tricky plot twists, it accomplishes nothing that other films haven't done before with more skill and freshness.Getting straight to the point, Saw opens with young photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) awakening in a bathtub, disoriented and confused towards his whereabouts. As it turns out, he's in a large, dank, grime-filled bathroom, chained to the pipes. He's got a chained companion on the other side of the room, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), and in between them lies the body of a dead man.Through a series of clues, Gordon deduces they're dealing with the ""Jigsaw,"" a serial killer who finds elaborate methods of forcing his victims to perform a series of grueling tasks, and if they fail, the penalty is death. A message left behind by tape informs Gordon of his task; he must kill Adam in eight hours or his own wife and child will be murdered.It's a good premise, but it's obvious the filmmakers aren't going to make a feature-length production set entirely within a bathroom. Unsurprisingly, it's the scenes set outside the bathroom that the movie first shows signs of faltering. Problem number one is that the sets appear rather low-grade, no surprise given the budgetary constraints. Problem number two is that the movie still wants to keep its villain's identity a surprise. In fact, I wasn't swayed at all upon the initial revelation of the killer, especially when this ""surprise"" is still juxtaposed alongside scenes set in the past where the filmmakers' still keep the killer's face hidden.Such twists and turns grow tiresome, all the more so when it's obvious that the killer always (and I mean ALWAYS) has a trick up his sleeve, making the final shock quite obvious moments before its underwhelming unveiling. Hey, I like my serial killer flicks to feature a smart villain as much as the next guy, but it's just plain annoying for them to be all-out omniscient.The scenes set within the bathroom are initially effective. The acting between Elwes and Whannell is convincing enough, with Whannell showing hints of genuine charisma that could serve him well in the future. But all this takes a flabbergasting nose-dive in the last half-hour, beginning with the cigarette scene. It was by this point I wondered if director James Wan was winking at us because prior to this the film was serious in its intent to scare.I can't help but admit that this far into the picture, I started laughing and couldn't stop. I was willing to suspend my disbelief at a lot of the plot, even at the fact that five hours could suddenly pass and catch up on the protagonists (surely, at least one of them would keep better track of the time?), but that the killer would know that at least one of the two men would look inside his wallet and find the right picture and message, and to be aware of how desperate one of them is for a smoke in even such a dank environment and have a back-up plan to test the possible contingency that could result; well, I have to say, it felt like a parody of all the ""smart"" serial killer flicks we've seen before, and the acting only goes further to serve that belief.Decent at first, Elwes goes off the deep end in the movie's climax. One has to question how someone would truly respond in such a situation, so I'm not going to criticize his acting in that respect. I just can't deny that my immediate response was pure hilarity; Elwes is not a very good actor, but he's competent enough for me to believe he was perfectly aware of how silly he looked and overplayed it for all it was worth. Considering the absence of suspense, I think the laughs go a step or two in making up for it.Also, without giving too much away, there must have been other ways for a certain character to resolve his predicament (like seeking help) if the danger that's posed upon him is slow-acting enough for an incredibly elaborate plan to unfold over the course of many hours. The danger is, in fact, so slow-acting that after all those hours, this man (who should not be a very skilled fighter or marksman) is still capable of engaging and holding his own in shootouts, chases, and fistfights with a crazed and determined ex-cop.Director Wan has potential, but he needs to lay off on camera tricks and realize quick cuts and sped-up camera-work serve as distractions and do little to build genuine scares or suspense. In fact, I was surprised by how easy it was for me to sit through this film. At no moment did I ever feel a sense of dreadful anticipation like I do with the best (or even solidly competent) of the genre. Much of the reason for that has to do with the flashback structure, we're clearly aware of who's alive or who isn't considering we know who's telling the story.It doesn't help that each twist spirals the movie further into a hole it can't dig itself out of, the final strike coming in the last moments with a preposterous surprise revelation. We barely saw this guy prior to this scene, so why make a big deal out of this surprise by going through a pointless flashback? This is one case where an otherwise middling movie is destroyed by a terrible ending.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"2 guys waking up in a cold atmospheric room not knowing why, and how they got there. just bound to a chain and waiting till the game begins","this movie mixes several attributes which made me giving a 10-rating: the beginning is fascinating with a cube-like atmosphere. it never loses suspense thru the whole movie....and the sick mind of the killer reminds to john doe's from ""se7en"" of brilliant David Finch. the turnings of the storyline are almost unpredictable which is rare and never any Hollywood-like cliché or happy-end. a lot of surprises, shock and some gore scenes which altogether makes it a perfect horror-psycho-thriller.in my opinion, it beats even cult horror-movies like Texas chainsaw massacre 2003, event horizon, dawn of the dead 2004, cube, wrong turn or evil dead. thru out the time, these kind of movies goes far to the limits of the violence and dark fears we all got into us....so be warned, ""saw"" will give you a sightseeing tour thru hell....enjoy it !",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You really should see Saw,"Saw has achieved a rare feat in Thriller/Horror film-making in that it holds the suspense and intrigue throughout the entier film. From the opening moments (possibly the most captivating first 20 minutes of a film I've ever seen), until the end credits role, the audience is on edge, continually wondering what is going to happen next. The film centres around two men, chained to pipes, at either end of an industrial bathroom. Between them, lying face down on the floor is a body surrounded by a pool of blood. The questions of how and why these men are here are answered is a series of flashbacks throughout the film and this is where my only two real problems with the movie exist. Firstly, the first time out of the bathroom takes too long. Although the back story is interesting and necessary, I wanted to get back to the bathroom faster. The second problem I had was with the use of sped up film and rapidly changing camera angles in some of the flashback scenes. Although this technique did have an impact, after a few moments, it felt a bit 'gimicky'. The scenes in the bathroom however are masterful and the way the writers develop the plot in a setting that can seemingly go nowhere is a real credit to them. Saw is intriguing, it is imaginative, it is scary, suspenseful and wonderfully entertaining. Saw is a movie you must see at the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

For Those Who Love to Laugh and Puke at the Same Time...,"""Saw"" is relentlessly grisly. The serial-killer genre has been run into the ground recently, but ""Saw"" grinds it into mush and churns it out kicking and screaming once again. Here, the killer never really kills anyone, he simply sets up overly elaborate and grotesque scenarios that leave his hapless victims with painful choices, die a horrible death, kill yourself first, or kill someone else to escape. What we get here as viewers, is some of the best hardcore horror gore splattering this side of the latest zombie-fest.""Saw"" has everything a hardcore cult classic of this ilk needs to stand the test of time. The director, James Wan, is a hapless slap-dash hack (the editing is especially horrible) with a lovingly perverse penchant for the grotesque and macabre. Hardcore horror fans will rejoice. The film's set-ups are clever, and its executions are over the top. The film is anchored by a screamingly bad lead performance from Cary Elwes. All the performances here (save for the creepy tape-recorded voice of the Jigsaw killer) are terrible, but Elwes (who always seems to be acting as if he is still in ""The Princess Bride"") has some of the most howlingly awful sobbing/screaming scenes I have ever seen. Once you get done puking, you will laugh, as most of the audience did. I don't think the laughs are intentional, but by george, they are surely needed, because the last piece of the cult-classic-status puzzle is the stomach-churning ending. The last ten minutes of the film give us such a perverse twist, that it will leave the viewer shell-shocked. Don't expect a nice tidy ending. The film is as sloppy as its director, but the climax is as insanely ingenious as the killer it depicts. I was shocked, and so were the hardcore fans I went with, and that is saying a lot. So, if you are like us, see ""Saw"", otherwise, I can't recommend this gnarly hack-work to anyone else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Has One Of The Most Insane Endings But Ruined By Sloppy Plot-Holes,"Pros:
1. The grainy cinematography gives the movie a gritty and grounded tone which helps to make the events feel realer.2. The murders, and the torture games, are incredibly grisly, disturbing as well as strangely introspective. The gore isn't the main focus unlike most horror films of this genre.3. The editing helps to imbue the torture and murder scenes with a chaotic and frenzied feel thus keeping you on edge.4. The score is remorseless in its intensity.5. Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) carry the film which is impressive seeing as it's mostly just them conversing.6. The last 30 minutes have got to be some of the most heart-palpitating, insane and mind-blowing bit of cinema ever created. The ultimate pay-off, paired with the shock twist, is amazingly built up to and then executed.7. The movie offers an uncompromising, but truthful, view of human nature. Particularly how survival is hard-wired into all of us above anything else.Cons:
1. Why didn't Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) and Detective Steven Sing (Ken Leung) remove Jigsaws' (Tobin Bell) hood? Instead they kept allowing him to move with his hood still up.2. How did Jigsaw survive both a bullet and a shotgun shell whilst just walking off with a limp?3.

A GORY SUSPENSEFUL CHILLER,"I have always loved this first Saw film, before the tons of sequels & the big franchise it became, because this flick was a gritty, grimy & grim serial killer Thriller that fit into the same category of those Awesome old school 1990's Thrillers like Kiss the Girls & The Bone Collector for example, Saw was a brutal & exciting movie.Now i really like the first sequel, Saw 2 but after that it's all abit over-the-top but Saw 2 is very good, but this first film is a glorious suspense filled murder mystery & we all know the scary story about two guys waking up in a grungy old room, chained up with no way out but lots of hidden clues for a way to escape but it will mean doing disturbing stuff.The visual look of Saw is excellent, sickly green moody cinematography & real gritty look & a great little cast all help this little low-budget flick make it's impact. We get the always great Danny Glover, a legend of Cinema with the Lethal Weapon films, here Glover plays an obsessed Detective on the trail of a sicko serial killer & he will stop at nothing to get the evil sicko. I've always loved Danny Glover in movies & grew up watching him on video with films such as the Lethal Weapon films, Predator 2, Gone Fishin' among other stuff & he really suits playing a tough Cop, so here it's great having his presence on screen as a hard detective & a comfort for us movie/genre fans to see old Glover with a gun again. The two captured men are both fine in their roles, especially Carrey Elwes (The Crush) but all the performances are actually really good & the atmosphere is always full of tension.

Good Horror Movie,"'Saw' was better than I expected. From the name and the genre, I was expecting something akin to 'House of 1000 corpses' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. I found 'Saw' to be a step above these movies. It had an interesting intellectual component that left one guessing about a central mystery. (This mystery involved how the characters got into, and will get out of, their predicament.) I found the performances, dialog and character decisions to be believable - which is unusual for this genre. I was also surprised to see that there were some fairly well-known actors in the movie such as Danny Glover and Dina Meyer.

"Compelling, Visceral Mystery Box Horror/Thriller","It is very difficult to come up with a film idea that completely captures the cultural zeitgeist for any period of time. The Saw franchise did exactly that in the mid-2000s, and this original is the best of the bunch. While perhaps not a perfect film, it remains as visceral and (mostly) compelling as it was in 2004.For a very basic overview, Saw opens with two men--Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Lawrence (Cary Elwes)--waking up chained on opposite sides of an underground bunker. They eventually come to learn that they are part of a gruesome game set up by the mysterious Jigsaw killer, who is being pursued by detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung).What immediately stands out about Saw is its unabashed, unashamed gruesomeness. This is not a film for the squimish or the faint of heart. The horror here is both physically and psychologically grisly, leaving little to the imagination. Yet, remarkably, nothing within the film ever feels gratuitous. Though later sequels would garner the ""torture porn"" label (and for good reason), this one's gristle is baked into the screenplay from Whannell and James Wan.To me, the hallmark of the experience is how the filmmakers create an air of tension/mystery and sustain it throughout the runtime. One truly never knows what is happening (or what will happen) until quite literally the final moments. For fans (like myself) of such mysterious storytelling, it is easy to sink into this one.Upon a recent re-watch, about the only quibble I had with Saw is how the plot moralizing perhaps doesn't hit as hard in 2020 as it did in 2004. While the Jigsaw ""morality traps"" are certainly an interesting concept, the entire Jigsaw character reveal isn't quite as remarkable as I remembered. To be frank, it actually came off quite underwhelming (fortunately, the sequels do a great job of fleshing out those aspects). That being said, I can't knock this aspect too much, as even I'll admit that at the time the moral-based aspects seemed incredibly significant.Overall, Saw is up near the top of my favorite films of all-time. While perhaps not holding up quite as well as that very first viewing, it's airtight plot, incredible acting, and mysterious aura will allow it to shock viewers long into the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Incredible horror,"Despite the franchise it created, Saw is a film with minimal gore and all the better for it. Closer to Se7en than its own sequels with a focus on the psychological toll of being in one of Jigsaw's traps rather than revelling in the execution. It's a bleak, twisty thriller that's constantly changing and satisfyingly unpredictable.Cary Elwes is terrific here, trying to maintain his calm in a horrible situation but when it does get to him he's phenomenal at portraying the desperation. With less experience Leigh Whannell is obviously not as strong and yet still he's still able to go toe to toe with Elwes for the majority of the film.James Wan's direction uses the low budget so well with an idea that plays into the smaller scale and it only exceeds its limitations for a very brief car chase. Considering its mostly confined to one location, Wan brings an impressive amount of dynamism with some gloriously 2000s editing.The main set is just phenomenal, almost too convincing at being disgustingly dirty which makes everything feel even more gross. Charlie Clouser's score does so much with just one major theme, waiting until the very end to unleash it, making a great ending even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Does this horror cult classic live up to the hype?,"I have finally got round to seeing Saw, one of the most popular and commercially successful horror movies of the 2000s. In Saw, 2 men wake up in an abandoned bathroom and are put through a sadistic, grisly test. While the sequels evidently ramp the gore and violence up to 11, this is a low budget movie (As is clear and not in a good way during certain scenes) which makes heavy use of just one location. Saw doesn't live up to the gore hype, but that's a good thing. It actually shows a bit of restraint. It still earns its 18 certificate though. It's a full-on, brutal and nasty horror film but here much of the horror is psychological, which makes it more effective as a whole. I rate James Wan as a director, and he directs the film pretty well even if it looks like a music video at times. The writing is a bit uneven, with plenty of bland dialogue and illogical moments while the acting really isn't great. It can feel, as a film, fairly cold and emotionless, and it takes a little while to get going. Still, Saw is a smart and twisty treat for horror fans and the famous twist ending will really get you if you don't know it (I, unfortunately, did). Saw is a pleasant surprise and an absolutely solid thriller that deserves more credit from the critics than it gets.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
instant classic,"People asked me why didn't you review Saw when it came out. Simply, back then, seven years ago, you had to wait almost a year for the DVD release. When it came out part 2 was already at the cinemas. So I had to wait until they finished the franchise which was last year. But then again, it wasn't that simple to know what DVD or Blu Ray to pick up, because some were bloody versions or uncut or directors cut. All versions I have are the longest versions, I do have the German collector editions on Kinowelt, they are all uncut.It was my wife who came home one evening, she had won a screening, from the cinema and told me, I just have seen Saw, this is for you babe. And indeed, it became one of my 'things'.What did it for me is the storyline. There are so many twists that you just couldn't see coming. It was based on James Wan's short of 9 minutes called, sigh, Saw. He directed it, Leigh Whannell wrote it in 2003. With that short they went out to hunt a production team who wanted to make it a full feature. Nobody really believed in it but they were so wrong, the merchandise and the franchise it created was beyond limits. Leigh Whannell also played as David in the short and appeared as Adam in the full feature.What attracted me was that it was in fact just a simple police story with the focus on two victims of a serial killer. But what you couldn't see coming was that it contained a bit of real squeamish parts. The red stuff do flows and it is just on the border of gore. Due the fact that there were some really messy parts it created a new genre called Torture Porn, one year later Hostel was released and was gory as hell, with a bit of the same story, torturing for fun. The end of Saw is the strongest ending I have seen so far because what happens isn't predictable at all, and due that people start talking about Saw as they did about the reversed bear trap. The focus here wasn't really on Jigsaw, the serial killer. He was involved but wasn't the main concern of the coppers. But viewers were tricked by the writer of saw.The acting itself was really sublime especially by the victims Cary Elwes. It's also weird that most of the original actors didn't came back in the other parts, only in flashbacks. But naturally it's Jigsaw that steels the show, what Tobin Bell did was really creating a new hero for the horror geeks. This is his best role ever for me.Is it me or my imagination but I clearly saw some winks to the genre. When the so-called boogeyman appears in the closet just look how they filmed him, you just saw his eye in the closet, Black Christmas 1974 indeed. And at the end the closing of the metal door, Texas Chainsaw Massacre indeed.

The start of a long running franchise,"I was first intrigued by the trailer of this film is why I chose to watch it despite the positive reception it was getting when it first came out. The scenario of a serial killer who plays a game of life and death without getting his hands dirty was amusing and actually quite original. The serial killer got the reputation of being called Jigsaw cause he makes the victims go through a game where blood shed is needed to survive, he is obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, in a deranged and sadistic way after abducting them. So basically he tries to test the fabric of human nature. The main victims of this game is Adam Faulkner-Stanheight(Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes), they have to face different choices in order to survive and depending on the choice, it will decide if one or both of them will survive. This was a good and entertaining horror thriller, that is well worth the audiences time, mainly cause of the creativity and a cool twist that happens near the end. The acting in this movie is not very good, especially Cary Elwes. I think he is better off doing comedies like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" cause his acting is actually quite funny during serious scenes. And while the victims are trying to solve Jigsaw's puzzle, it goes back and forth with a cop played by Danny Glover who is obsessed with tracking Jigsaw down. Despite the films low budget, it will keep the audience intrigued and will keep them guessing, it is a suspenseful film that has thrills and chills. Worth checking out if you want to see some originality in horror, just not that good the second time around cause most saw movies are known for flash backs with a twist, but this is a good start.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An absolute masterpiece of a film,"Saw is one of my absolute favourite films of all time. It is a psychological thriller/ horror with amazing plot twists. The writer Leigh Whannell even plays a character called Adam. The film was shot in a short amount of time with a limited budget but you really cannot tell. If you aren't sure whether you would like Saw or not,i would watch Saw 0.5 on YouTube first so that you can get a small idea. There is a whole franchise you can watch aswell. (although i do not recommend Jigsaw and Spiral the 8th and 9th films) Saw is a brilliant, well thought out film with an amazing plot, detail, set, costume, makeup and acting. I very highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Mix in some way cool kills, clever plot turns, and horrendous acting and you get ""Saw""","Saw is a kick your ass kind of a movie. The kills are shown in full detail and each one is so creative and frightening. I also must give props to the writers for inventing perhaps the most terrifying contraption I have ever seen. Yes, I am talking of the reverse bear trap. The movie begins with two complete strangers who get one hell of a wake up call. They are trapped in a bathroom without any recollection of how they got there. The plot is similar to ""Seven"" with a serial killer choosing his victims for their sins of not appreciating life. Lets just say insanity and scary as hell puppet clown dolls ensue. The only rusty edge that Saw possesses is the TERRIBLE acting. There's a major plot turn in which a main character goes insane and it's handled so ridiculously that I ended up laughing instead of feeling the intended pity and horror. But aside from the acting Saw is one hell of a ride.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A necessity for horror enthusiasts,"I do think this is a smart movie; it started the ""strangers trapped together her and have to work together to get out"" concept. Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like ""omg totally makes sense now"". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films. Definitely a necessity for horror enthusiasts to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I Enjoyed It a Lot!,"I may be the only horror fan left on the planet who hadn't ever actually seen a single entry in the ""Saw"" franchise. I had plenty of exposure to it in the form of parody - there's an unending supply of parodies of this film, many of which were just as bland, uninspired and unoriginal as I always seemed to believe the franchise itself was.
Today I watched the first entry for the first time, and i was pleasantly surprised. Was it the greatest horror film of all time, or the greatest franchise kickstarter I've ever seen? Not by a long shot. But it was a pretty interesting idea that you really need to watch for yourself to get invested in. It's not the typical ""person locked in a room with a time limit to get out because there's someone waiting outside to kill them if they fail."" This movie presents a killer with a coherent and interesting back story, even if they don't take the time to fully explore it in this film.The acting is wonderful; spot-on when it needs to be, cliche when the time is right, but always moving the plot along nicely. It's a non-linear story, which I also really appreciate. It's a film that demands your undivided attention from start to finish, and it's interesting enough to justify doing so.While it's far from a perfect horror movie, I think it's a pretty decent entry into the genre that everybody should see at least once. I'm just disappointed that I put it off for so many years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"6.2/10 - Not Bad, but Really Amateurish and Rough Around the Edges","When September has come this year my social media was suddenly full with autumn-related stuff, specifically Halloween-season memes and posts. Seeing it all made me think that maybe I should hop on this opportunity and review some horror films that I've been wanting to watch for quite a while. I've already reviewed another horror film, Inland Empire (which is a very experimental and bizarre horror movie), and this is, well, the other end of the spectrum in that regard - the original Saw, the popular horror movie that started a huge franchise. Let's dive into it.Saw is a 2004 horror film that follows two people who find themselves in a weird, unfamiliar toilet, chained and unable to get out. Soon they realize that they're part of a deadly game now, trying to solve the puzzle of an unconventional, morally twisted serial killer, forced to play for their lives.I think I'll start with the core of this review: this film is, quite understandably so, amateurish. With a budget of around 1-1.2 million dollars, and with the fact that this is the first feature film that James Wan has directed, well, things are kinda rough around the edges here. The dialogue has so many moments in which you know that someone has written it down and said ""this is AWESOME, man, they're gonna LOVE it"", when in actuality it's just an okay line. The characters are very simple, though I have a feeling that this movie tries to be this deep psychological mystery thriller. It only ends up feeling like one of the better horror projects that a film student has made in his final year, not a lot more than that.The premise of this film is pretty cool, at its core, but I find the film's approach one that tries to have a bit of everything without the necessary skills to pull it off. I liked the parts of the film that focus on Jigsaw a bit more - the victim montage, for instance, worked well because it felt pretty creative, and it was dynamic and engaging. It never lingered on one idea too much. In contrast to that, everything that took place in this toilet, up until the final act, is not that interesting. The puzzle feels like it was taken out of a teen horror drama or something, and the character dynamics (which are supposed to be the heart of this part of this film) are just not intense and well-written enough to make this film more than fine. This is the problem - the film tries to be a thrilling, puzzle-based horror movie without an actually interesting puzzle. It tries to be a deep psychological film without characters that have the necessary depth. I haven't seen any other Saw movie, so maybe James Wan's later work is, in fact, better, but I can't ignore the feeling I have here that everything about this film is somehow too ambitious for the set of skills and the budget the director had, at the time.If there's one thing that encapsulates this, it's the final scene. There's a certain reveal, which is a pretty cool reveal, not gonna lie, but the music is so, so cringy. Again, this ""dude, dude, wouldn't it be awesome dude?"" moment in the writer's room. The soundtrack, which has some nice highlights (I liked the soundtrack in the flashback to Adam's apartment, and I liked the soundtrack in the mannequin factory scene), is so childish and absurd here, trying to be the most epic thing in the world when in reality it's far from it. Subtlety would be better here.Why would I say that I generally like it anyway? Well, first of all, the parts that I criticized are never *horrible*, and they do have some trashy entertainment value, in my opinion. And besides that, most of the stuff that happens outside the room is at least mildly interesting, and the final act maintains tension in quite a solid way. It's not the most intense final act ever, but it works well. Definitely redeems this movie a bit. The production design is also solid, and there's definitely a reason that the Jigsaw puppet is so iconic nowadays.The original Saw film feels too amateurish, too rough around the edges to truly be as tight as some people feel it is, at least for me. The final act's intensity somewhat redeems this film, and it's not terrible, really (the main puzzle itself is probably the only flat-out boring main aspect of the film), so I think that despite the film being undeserved of the classic status it holds, it's still a fun, trashy little horror film. Cute. Feeling a 6.2/10 on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
terrifying,"What is certainly peculiar here is the mechanism of telling facts. The viewer, at least is what I felt, finds himself trapped in watching this deadly competition; the director reveals clues, surprises and deliciously twisted moments. The general feeling is of something rather revolting, coz some nauseating scenes give a very strong visceral impact; on the whole I would say that its stronger point is the originality. Not a serial killer movie, but a game created for these unlucky victims on a basis impossible to predict for the audience. Apart from Danny Glover and Monica Potter, other actors are quite unknown but they didn't play so bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If you like Se7en, then you will like Saw.","I liked this movie. I enjoyed the story, acting, and the suspense. This movie is like Se7en, because its about a psycho who chooses people that are involved in one vice or another and tricks them into killing themselves or others; leaving them messed up for life and maybe better off dead. The main gripe I have about the movie is the Killer's reasons for choosing his victims was pretty weak. But, this lack of a decent reason for the complicated design for madness the Killer put his victims through, also made the killer more interesting, mysterious, increased the belief that any average ordinary person could be next. I was surprised about the ending. It is the reason why this movie got a 7 instead of a 6. I went to see this movie hoping to be disturbed. I didn't get disturbed, but I was entertained. Saw should be seen at least once by all (except children).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very unpleasant but it IS a horror film,"Grim, sadistic story of a maniac who tortures people in various ways. He gives them ways to live but they have to do something morally wrong to get that. One woman has a device that will rip her jaw open. The key is inside the stomach of a live man--she has to cut it out of him. In this one two men are chained to pipes on either side of a disgusting bathroom. Between them is a dead body. The killer leaves them clues to free themselves---but if that don't do it in an allotted amount of time--they'll be left to rot there and die.The film is grim, dark and extremely disturbing. There's not one bit of humor in it--it's very much like the movie ""Se7en"". The acting is superb and the tension builds slowly. The final act is very violent, brutal and does NOT have a happy ending. I was left shaking but it scared me---and that's exactly what a horror film should do.

Should've stopped at one,"Saw is a perfect example of a movie that should have been standalone, because the sequels really ruin all the mystery and atmosphere established in this film.

A Se7en-knockoff with a small budget but a few new ideas,"What I liked: the story. I have to admit that I was bored for awhile because I thought I figured it out early, only to find out that I was wrong.Another plus --> this movie tries for the creepy, get-under-your-skin horror as opposed to the cheap startle-scare tactics. And I was surprised to find that after years of watching grisly, bleak films like Seven and Event Horizon that this film was still able to make me wince at times.What was lacking: a lot. The story was decent but the dialogue was poor. And the two leads in the film are both terrible. A lot of people were commenting that Cary Elwes was bad, and he was, but the guy opposite him is equally regrettable. The sad thing is, that guy doubles as the screenwriter, so you'd think he could do a better job with his own words. Danny Glover is so-so, but he didn't have much to work with. This film so desperately wants to be Seven in tone and style (when the killer espouses his philosophy, it sounds like the screenwriter is trying to remember Kevin Spacey's speeches, but can't quite), and yet this director is no David Fincher. And for some reason, he allowed Elwes to ham it up, so he's not an actor's director.All in all: decent, but not nearly the masterpiece that all the other Harry Knowles types on this site are making it out to be. I give it a 5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good...Not Great.,"My only complaint with this movie is Cary Elwes.Danny Glover...unlike in Predator 2...does an exceptional job, but Cary Elwes...nothing against his acting ability.

Even the most innocent well-intended character.But I don't know. He didn't seem to fit the role.Aside from the casting, however, this movie rules, and that's why I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.

Hello Paul.,"A new take on the traditional horror formulae, Saw combines elements from the psychological thriller and slasher canon to create an effective chiller that goes out of its way to create numerous inventive death scenes that will appeal to gore-hounds. I don't think many films set in predominantly one location have been as creative. You start from square one, as an audience member knowing as little as the two leads, then as they find out the reasoning behind their plight the plot unravels into an edge-of-your seat if routine finale, that is set apart by a fairly convincing twist that is well mapped out, even if the acting and the dialogue is a bit shoddy at times.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
' so I saw Saw last night...',"Clever, highly intense horror-thriller is one of the most intelligently done killer thrillers in years.Two men awaken to discover that they are chained inside a dilapidated old restroom, having fallen into the hands of a murderer who likes to play deadly games with his victims.Well-written and tightly directed, Saw is a truly dark and nerve-grinding kind of suspense thriller. From it's mysterious opening to it's twisted, shocking finale it is a high-powered shocker that's sure to draw in any viewer. It packs plenty of chilling sequences, eerie atmosphere, and references to some old-school horror films.The cast isn't bad. Cary Elwes does a good performance as a trapped doctor who is desperate to save his family from the madman. Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film) is great as a photographer who's also caught up in the madness. Veteran actor Danny Glover is perfect as a police detective determined to find the killer.An unforgettable horror film all around, Saw is not to be missed.*** 1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

They soon realise they are playing one of the ""Jigsaw"" killer's sick games, in which he teaches the victims how much life is worth.High on logic and (reasonably) low on gore, James Wan and Leigh Whannell seem to unmask the killer pretty early on in the film, before cleverly misdirecting you. Although the film is pretty low on gore, I would still only advise you to watch it if you are strong-hearted, as the atmosphere is quite harrowing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A true suspense thriller,"Saw in my opinion is an excellent suspense thriller/horror film. Many people pick it apart for several different reasons, and while i admit it may have it's flaws, i believe the important thing about a movie is the effect it has on you while watching it, rather than what you get when you pick apart every single little detail, and this particular film blew me away.It's somewhat of a slow builder, but that's one of the things that makes it so good. It introduces the characters and keeps you interested in what's happening to them and how they interact with each other. You feel like you're there with them the whole time throughout their ordeal, and it makes you care about the characters.Some of the scenes in this movie are truly suspenseful. One in particular will have you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to even breathe, and then even though you should be able to guess what happens at the end of the scene, it will still make you jump.other scenes will make you laugh right before throwing in something completely unexpected.and after all of the excellent, gripping build up, all hell finally breaks loose in the end, leading up to one of the best horror film endings i have ever seen.This is an exciting movie that will get your heart racing, and i gave it a 10/10. i recommend everybody who's into psychological thrillers and who don't mind a little excess blood see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great original idea for the horror genre.,I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and everything except the acting blew me away. The story was very creepy and original and it was one of the first movies to fill itself with toture and gore.

They don't know each other but soon they will figure out they share similarities to each other.

This isn't your typical slasher, gory horror movie......it has a plot twist that could NEVER be guessed.....I'm talking ABSOLUTE CINEMATIC GENIUS.........give that director and screenwriter...(who, by the way, also plays Adam)......an Acadamy Award!!!!!!!! And to comment on the ones who say it is a cheap Se7en rip-off....Yes is does have shades of Se7en in it's death, (or lack thereof), scenes but to compare this film to Se7en....is an understatement. Don't get me wrong until I saw ""Saw"".....lol.....Se7en was one of my favorite films. If only more production studios would take a note of this film and start producing more like it for all us die hard chiller fans!!

One of the best horror movies of the 2000's,"The sequels weren't that good but in my opinion, this is one of the better horror movies of the 2000's. As the film continues on, it gets more tense and the different traps make more tension. As soon as it starts, Adam and Dr. Lawrence start recalling incidents so they can figure out what happened to them and who put them there. It's a great look into human survival and it covers the depths of insanity as they start to turn on each other. I know it's excessively gory at some parts so this is not for everyone but most horror fans would probably like it. Also, at the final 5 minutes, its twist ending will knock you cold. Accompanied, by the epic score, your heart will be racing beyond belief. I'm not going to spoil the ending because it must be witnessed start to finish to be fully appreciated. But, thinking about the true nature of it, makes it more terrifying. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one but if you want an epic, gore-filled, tense story about survival then you'll likely enjoy this one as long as you can get past the gore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie was absolute crap on a stick.,"Well, to be honest I have seen worse movies.....but not many. I was ""fortunate"" enough to see this movie at it's Las Vegas sneak peek a week before it opened. Needless to say I did my best to forget it, but after seeing a sign for ""Saw"" at the local dollar-movie-theater my friends and I began to joke with my friends in the car about the wretchedness that simply was this film. An interesting concept, at first glance, but in retrospect there are a lot of films about serial killers that a far better than this and the only thing that is interesting about the idea is that this murderer is just a little more artsy and creative. Once you get past the acting of Leigh Whannell the first five minutes minutes aren't bad, but then it's all down hill from there. From the cheap hypertension/pop out scares to the cookie cutter chase scenes, this movie blows.......hard. Typically I enjoy Danny Glover and he has given many worthwhile performances. He was definitely the best part of this film, but he was phoning the whole thing in......logically that can tell you what the rest of the movie was like. Whannell is completely awful throughout and made my nuts hurt, just watching him attempt to act. Typically when someone hears you make such a critique they say, ""Oh yeah, like you could do better?"" Well, in this case I would have to say, ""Yes."" Cary Elwes, who I also typically love, is so bad in the last scene of the film that I began to question whether or not it was SUPPOSED to be funny. The acting was certainly as bad as the directing and script. If I do have one good thing to say about this steaming pile of monkey shirt, it's that all parts are equally terrible. How anyone could put this movie in the same class as Se7en or any of the Carpenter, Craven, Hooper, and Barker films is beyond be. This film is pure excrement. When this comes out on DVD (which will probably be in a month) save the two hrs it takes to watch and teach a k under privileged kid how to read.

The problem with this movie is that although they show the other victims of Jigsaw, we don't have any reason to care. Saw is mainly about 2 people, kidnapped and trapped in one room. Trying to get out. Many of the editing in this movie is just sped up creepy montages, but I am still going to give this one a 7.

Quality thrills,"Let me start by saying I for some reason had never really had any inclination to see this movie, for some reason it did not appeal to me. Well anyway I found myself watching the movie on a holiday I have just returned from and let me say I was pleasantly surprised (and pleasant it a word I would imagine you will not find associated with this movie very often). Where this movie works is in its simple premise. Cheaply made with a small set but this actually aides the suspense built up as the main characters slowly interact with one another revealing more about themselves. This is interspersed with reveals to Jigsaw the orchestrator of the two protagonist's fates. The movie moves along at a good pace introducing us to Jigsaws previous crimes as well as the police officers on his trail with a increasing sense pf dread and the payoff is worth it (as much as these things can be) with a very satisfactory ending.

"Call me crazy, but...","I'm really and honestly a bit in awe of this movie's high rating on the IMDb, especially in comparison to some other, and in my opinion, better horror movies. Sorry to say it, but I think this movie sucked, all the more so because I went with somewhat high hopes and because a very good thriller could have been made from this quite inventive and interesting scenario. Before everyone starts posting a bunch of worthless insults and saying I didn't get it or I don't know horror movies, let me just lay out some of my criticisms: Within the first five minutes I was chuckling at the acting and the lines. Whannel actually faired a little better against the more veteran Elwes, who was so over-emotive and so miscast I felt a bit sorry just having to watch him, unfortunate since I've liked him in other movies. The dialogue lacked really any kind of subtlety, and while I understand the necessity to introduce the killer through flashbacks and memories of reading the newspaper, the way it was done seemed so contrived it was like watching a puppetmaster pulling strings. It's a case of show vs. tell, I think. The dialogue seemed to be grudgingly forcing the plot along inch by inch rather than letting it develop.Then we have the scenes involving the other victims: Was no one else annoyed by the sudden and jarring use of ultra fast MTV-motion and pointlessly loud music? I think these scenes would've been better played out much more slowly, wherein every second that passed becomes just that, one second closer to a horrifying death, one more ratchet of tension in which the audience could have felt the torment I'm sure the victims were. Something tells me those victims would have felt every second pass in those situations.Danny Glover's character seemed to be a very unprofessional cop. Anyone involved in any aspect of investigation would know Dr. Gordon's pen appearing at the scene, while odd, is purely circumstantial, and not reason to start an obsessive and far from legal stalking of the guy. In this kind of case a cop would have relied much more on forensic data and psychological profiling. Yeah, I guess his mind snapped a little upon seeing his partner so brutally dispatched, but... I just didn't believe this character. Likewise to the wife and daughter, who were so underdeveloped, and whose only chances at development were robbed by Dr. Gordon's disdain or at least disregard for his family that I just didn't care what happened to them in the end, nor did I believe Dr. Gordon's sudden impulse to lop off his own leg in an attempt to save them.Aside from these, there were just too many contrivances and errors along the way. How could Whannel have woken up submerged in water without having drowned? How would a medical doctor not recognize that the dead body on the floor was not dead? What did Jigsaw have against Zapp (name?), who was the only character who was interested in or kind to him? Could Dr. Gordon really not think of a better way to get that phone? Would that cell phone really work in that buried basement, and would it work only on the plot-dictated occurrences that it did? Why were Whannel and Elwes the only victims to have a long, drawn-out, two person situation? On the plus side, I do think the initial idea is quite inventive, and, although in retrospect the ending doesn't seem to add up logically, the finale of Saw does stick in my mind as being the one part I thought was really fairly well done. The image of Jigsaw standing up, his last look at Whannel, the implied but not shown final fates of our two main characters -- this whole sequence was quite tense and a really unexpected bit of icing on the cake after my expectations for the movie had dropped so low throughout the rest of the viewing. It just seems to me that a much better movie could have been made, the situation offers ample opportunity for a strongly character driven movie, while the outside situations could provide for sequences of unbearable tension, by a more seasoned and talented director of suspense with better dialoague at his disposal and the ability to elicit better performances from less miscast actors.Tell me, am I really wrong in thinking it strange that this is the most talked about horror movie to come out in years... or has American horror just really gone so far down hill? And tell me also, what is it exactly that everyone saw in this movie that I didn't that sets it so far apart from all the other horror movies and thrillers of recent years? I really am quite curious.""Toy-like people made me boy-like.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent,"Saw (2004)** 1/2 (out of 4)The film opens in an abandoned bathroom where two men are chained to opposite sides of the room. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) don't remember how they got in this room but soon Gordon begins to fear this is the work of a serial killer the police have labeled ""The Jigsaw Killer"". This serial killer doesn't actually kill his victims but instead puts them in a life or death situation where in order to live, the victims must kill the other person or instead, kill themselves. Gordon and Adam have just under eight hours to figure a way out of this puzzle before their untimely death occurs.I remember reading a review of Wes Craven's Scream when it was first released and the reviewer, whose name I can't remember, mentioned that the opening scenes were so intense and it took no time to reach that high level of suspense. Within the opening minutes of Saw I felt the same way because, just like a fast car hitting zero to sixty miles per hours in a few seconds, this film takes off just as fast and is pretty relentless in its scenes of torture. However, the film with its wonderful start and finish is like two great pieces of bread without any fillings in the middle.There is so much to admire in this film that I only wish the middle sections were half as brilliant as the rest of the film. The opening scenes have a certain dirty and grungy look to them that sets the film up perfectly. The idea of a serial killer who forces someone to kill themselves is another interesting idea that goes all out. Unlike many other horror films, we've actually got smart people thinking out their situations and trying to come up with the best way to live. We've also got an incredibly haunting ending that has such a claustrophobic feel that I was automatically reminded of the dinner scene in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Another high aspect to the film are the performances by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell who for most of the film are strapped to a pole. These two are the ones telling the story and it's up to them to get the viewers drawn into the story and make us want to care whether these men live or die. I was rather shocked at how much development was allowed in the screenplay for the Elwes character to really grow on us. Elwes has many emotional scenes in the film, especially towards the end when he begins to fear he may never see his wife and child again. The actual look of fear in his eyes is quite remarkable and I'd be curious to know how Elwes got himself to that level. Whannell is the more quiet of the two but he too makes for an interesting characters as does Danny Glover who plays a detective trying to track down the killer.I mentioned the middle section of the film really doesn't work and I think it's mainly due to the fact that the intensity level from the start, once it hits the sixty miles per hour, slams into a brick wall and stops the film cold in its tracks. We get to see some of the serial killers previous victims but this really doesn't add too much to the story when we're supposed to be concentrating on the two men in the bathroom. The side story dealing with Elwes personal life isn't too interesting either but I guess this was somewhat needed in order for the viewing to understand why he was selected to play this game. I think the film would have been better off without all the back story and instead focused on the two men trapped in this game. I personally feel their acting was strong enough that it could have carried the film a lot further than any of the flashbacks did.Having said that, the film hits full stride again towards the end with a finale that is downright shocking. I'm not going to give anything away but I wouldn't mind comparing the ending to this as being just as shocking as the ending to Psycho forty-four years earlier.Not only does the shock ending work but so does the climax to our two characters fate.Again, the feel of dread, torture and pain are so agonizing that I'd rank this higher than what was seen and felt in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film certainly isn't for the faint of heart and I'm sure those with prejudice attitudes towards horror films will be left sickened but hey, that's the point. Saw gets a marginal recommendation due to the wonderful start, ending and performance by Elwes.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fantastic,"This is one of the greatest psychological horror films of all time. Although it's sequels lost track of what made the original so great, the orginal is fantastic. This is a must see for film fans. Also to the people who are scared of gore, the first film actually doesn't have a lot if any besides some tense scenes. It's all left up to the imagination.

A great horror film....,"I thought that Saw was a great film. Two men wake up at opposite sides of a dirty, disused bathroom, chained by their ankles to pipes. Between them lies a dead man clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralysed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. I thought that this was a great horror film with a lot of strong bloody violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best thriller ever made.,"I'm a huge fan of the horror and action genres, and I've seen most all of what both have to offer. Though sometimes I'd find a movie that was great, I've never once seen anything like Saw. It created its own sub-genre and it turned every cliché I've ever known on its end. Saw is one of the only perfect movies I've ever seen.The reason Saw is original is because it takes everything you've known about standard storytelling rules and completely ignores every one. The villain is the only ""good guy"" you're going to see and the ""good guys"" are the only ""bad guys"" you're going to see. From that basic stance alone, I cannot name another movie like Saw. I know works of literature like A Clockwork Orange try to make bad seem good, but it's done is such a traditional way it is ridiculously predictable and nothing really that hasn't been done before. But Saw is so simple in how it twists the rules of storytelling that it is blatantly obvious and punk. The literary geeks hate this movie because it does something they said could never be done: it breaks the rules they said every story had to abide by. The critics hate this movie because it isn't a safe cliché that they have known all their lives like No Country for Old Men. The standard horror enthusiast hates this movie because it breaks every rule of a traditional horror plot ever conceived. And unlike the supposed ""deep moral"" movies like Battle Royale, Saw actually has moral point that you can use and a moral that isn't a redundant cliché.As far as gore goes, it's enough to hold me over but isn't really excessive or as insane as the other movie in the series. But I think what make this an effective movie is there is no cheese like in the old slashers. This is something that could happen, and it's portrayed that way. Also, unlike every other movie like it, Saw is not only twisted but gory as well. It's almost an unspoken rule in cinema that if your movie is twisted/disturbing then you cannot show gore. I'm referring to movies like Sev7n and The Silence of the Lambstwisted, but no gore on screen. Once again, Saw breaks another rule.But what really sells Saw is the stylish punk style. With the flash-cuts, the lighting-paced editing, the blood on screen at almost all points in the moviethis was made for the ADD generation. I'll never understand why traditionalistseven those who don't want to admit they're traditionaliststhink there has to be at least 20 minutes of pure boredom every other scene for a movie to be good. Saw is a true thrillerit doesn't give you a second to sit there and be bored into a comfort zone.The ending plot twist is the single best plot twist of all time. I've seen a lot of plot twists, and while most of them go down the bland physiological path, or the cliché you-thought-I-was-a-good-guy-but-I'm-the-killer! stance, Saw once again uses its own plot to do a plot twist like none I've ever seen. The entire movie is deceptive, and you literally know nothing until the last 5 minutes.I simply cannot think of a single thing wrong with Saw. I tried, but I can't. It's the most perfect thriller ever made, and one of the most original movies of the modern generation.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If the ending were a hamburger....bruh, it'd be the best, most intense damn hamburger imaginable.....","About a year ago, I gave a my two cents on Saw when it first came out. Back then, I was being to critical towards it, and really stuck up about it. After watching it over about four times, I finally enjoyed it, and realized that there was some bad-assness in this movie. Now, I bring to you a better review, a bad-ass review, a review so good that my previous review is in this review's morning craps!!Like I said, back then I didn't like this movie because I was looking too hard. I was expecting a deep movie with sharp plausibility. Then, as I watched this over, I realized, why the hell does this movie need it anyways? It's got a good story, a bad-ass ending, and lots of grungy violence. What more could you ask for, WHAT MORE?!The story is this: Two men, Adam and Lawrence, wake up in a dirty, broken down bathroom, chained to the walls. In the middle of the room is a dead guy. In the dead guys hands are a tape recorder and a gun. The stench in the air..is misery, bruh. Lawrence is told that if he doesn't get out before 6 in the morning, his family will be killed. Adam doesn't have much to lose, except most likely his life. They don't really do much in the time they're given. They find a bunch of clues, they're called on a cell phone and threatened, and also, they're given a hacksaw. The only way to get out is to cut through their feet. Now, if I'm wrong, which I'm not, is that a good story or is that a good story? It turns out, a crazy bastard named Jigsaw is behind this. He kidnaps people, puts them in dangerous situations, and finds ways for them to kill themselves.The acting isn't what you would call that great, but there's a legitimate reason: The actors didn't really have any rehearsals because the budget was so low, so it's forgiven. But, as the movie goes on, the acting gets better, especially in the parts that need good acting.Now, Saw doesn't really have any scary moments, even though it should. But I figure, if the movie's entertaining, who cares? There's nothing really scary in this movie, but does that mean it isn't intense? No, it doesn't. There's only a few intense scenes in the movie: One involving a dude in his underwear tying to get out of a barbed wire maze thing, and the ending. My God, the ending. The ending is kind of like a slap in the face to the audience, but who cares? You absolutely do not expect to see what you're gonna see. When you see what you see at the very end, you're seriously wondering, ""What the F, bruh?! How's that happening?!"" The ending is so damn intense, you'll wonder how on Earth you can take it.Even though there's some stupid dialogue and setups, the movie still does what it wants to: It entertains. It's not scary, but it has some intense moments, and it's grungier than something that's really grungy. Obviously, these people had fun making it, and it was an overall cool movie. Don't look for something deep when you watch it, either.This is a cool movie. Hopefully, part 2 will be just as cool. Also, some Gwar tunes would have been good, but unnecessary, so don't hate it for not having any.Score: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
MY REVIEW: One of its Kind!!,"Saw. The cult gory thriller from James Wan is a pioneer among movies which rely on gory visuals while creating suspense or tension. It is damn good fun while it lasts.The strength of Saw lies in its twists and turns that keep you hooked throughout and imaginative uniqueness of execution from James Wan. Pacing is fast, color tone mostly black and white, characters are twisted, acting overall good enough and length perfectly short of less than 2 hours. If you are seeing it first time, it has enough to startle you but given the disturbing images you might not like it to revisit.I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for Saw. It is something special in horror genre but only for those who do not mind their cinema dark, twisted and disturbing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An awful film, for an awful audience","What is going on with people these days? How come this piece of celluloid junk can garner a 7.5 rating on IMDb, higher than films like ""The Duellists"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", ""Predator""... or ""Bachelor Party"", for that matter? ""Saw"" is yet another derivative shocker, stealing copiously from the likes of ""The Cube"", ""Se7en"" and several low-budget European films. It has no redeeming values, and offers no real surprises to speak of. By comparison, ""Equilibrium"" was another derivative film, but it had a heart in the right place. ""Saw"" is pure cinematic drivel, coming from another ""cool"" wannabe director, probably weaned on video games and MTV-style editing, and scarred for life by hooded men in corridors with blinking yellow/blue lights.Beyond a bunch of shocking images, there's nothing worth a glance, much less a second look. We're not talking about a ""Funny Games"" type of movie here, since the German film was at least engaging, albeit in a sadistic way. The re-watchability factor is *zero* for James Wan's creation... I was wondering why the local Blockbuster stores are selling scores of ""Saw"" DVDs for a couple of bucks apiece. Now, that I've seen the film, I know the reason. Word of mouth may have helped this abomination gain some attention, but its real place remains the trash can, amidst empty syringes, vomit-stained underwear and junk food containers.I honestly wonder if the reviewers claiming this film teaches you true lessons in the meaning of life are in fact convicts escaped from an asylum where they were taught lessons about ""life, the Universe and everything"" - including art - by the likes of Dr. Mengele, Ceausescu and Uwe Boll.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I screamed out loud,"I didn't want to see this. I had seen no previews...The Incredibles was sold out. Although I came out cursing the film, I would recommend it to anyone that has emptied their bladder and has someone close by to grab for comfort.For serious moviegoers, imagine the movie Seven, in quicktime. I was worried that the whole movie would play entirely in the dingy room...much as Phonebooth did, but the plot progressed with flashbacks and the like.The trapped Adam and Dr. Gordon work with the clues given. As they discover the clues, you can predict what is going to happen, which gives the viewer a feeling of involvement. However, it leaves you with enough suspense that you can't predict everything, especially the ending.I, and the entire movie theater, screamed out loud at one part. I also yelled a rated R word without meaning to. My roommate and I held hands since her boyfriend was no comfort.I didn't even recognize Cary Elwes until he began to talk. He has changed a lot since Princess Bride. While I consider him to be a decent actor, he didn't suit this film. He held well until the end, but his last words left me screaming 'fake.'This film is very well made - the plot was fantastic. But warning, the acting belongs to an '80s slasher film. Danny Glover played the cop role, but the movie is not a resume booster for him. Again, while an exciting thriller, this is definitely not Oscar material. Glover deserves better.Leave the children at home.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pure horror,"It's been a long while since I was this scared while watching a movie and I have to say it felt great! I was never a fan of slasher movies, they always seemed to deliver (and still do) such cheap and short thrills it felt a waste of unexplored potential. Now ""Saw"" comes along, maybe the most thrilling, disturbing, horrific and fresh movie of the year, (plus immense kudos for making it on such an outstandingly small budget), and proves my previously mentioned point perfectly. Either way, I'll repeat it again-slasher movies are for pus.ies! Everything in this movie surprised me, and every surprise was more than welcome. Like the dreadful Jigsaw's mind ""Saw"" feels prepared in advance and knows exactly what it has to do. Set the trap, pick a victim (us, the audience), and leave everything else into our hands. I was genuinely petrified in every 'trap' scene, some work just because of great imagination and the main one because of the story and acting. I probably wouldn't have recognized Cary Elwes in his role, and somehow a combination of low budget meets known celebrity faces works really well. I will give you no gory details, you should go see this movie with absolutely no information whatsoever-just step into a world of senseless sense. I couldn't help but admire the crazy Jugsaw man, as sick and banal it may seem, but his character makes a lot of sense. Which, in the end, when we are let to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, makes this movie more than worth your while.Perversely enjoyable, incredibly well paced and thought out, impressively acted(and I'm talking especially about Cary Elwes's character in the end) and directed with a fresh new approach and interesting cinematography, ""Saw"" is a pure cult classic. You will not forget about it, you will only appreciate it-just like Jugsaw wanted you to;)Can't wait to see the next installment!9/10 - Recommendations: Anyone who's looking for much more than a cheap thrill",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""SHARP"", But Not Quite Sharp Enough","Poor Wesley. For Cary Elwes, former beloved of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this is about as far away from the beautiful, fairy-tale perfection of the fields of Florin as you can get. Now, he's Doctor Lawrence Gordon, barefoot and chained in the most hellishly nasty abandoned washroom you could possibly imagine, just like his fellow captive, Adam, (SAW'S author, Leigh Whannell.) They are both the latest victims of the dementedly brilliant serial killer, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell from THE X-FILES, amongst other things), who actually never kills any of his victims...he gets them to kill themselves, or each other, depending on what sick rules he's set for the twisted games he plays.SAW did gangbusters at the box office, and has many admirers...amongst those who probably haven't seen a lot of movies of its kind. But what Whannell and director James Wan have actually done is steal from the best, which is what most great filmmakers do. The biggest problem with doing it, is that when you do ""borrow"" certain plot conventions, you have to do it in a way that one-ups the great sources you're stealing from. And since SAW cribs from SE7EN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and the cult classic THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, it has already shot itself in the foot...so to speak, before it even gets started.Plus, in spite of some great photography, truly disturbing images and some well done moments of outright creepiness, you can't quite shake the feeling that Whannell and Wan were feeling a little too pleased with their own cleverness as they made it. The ""cherry"" on top is one honey of a shocker ending, which unfortunately places it in BLAIR WITCH territory, as a film whose first 85 or so minutes just aren't as good as the last five.I wasn't as P.O.'ed by the end as I was with HIGH TENSION. Not a bad first effort, but the script could've definitely benefited from some more tweaking. And it might've helped if it had been an entirely unknown cast, instead of having the perfunctory low-budget ""guest appearances"" (THE SHIELD'S Benito Martinez, STARSHIP TROOPERS' Dina Meyer, ALONG CAME A SPIDER'S Monica Potter, and most wasted of all, Danny Glover.)

Let The Game Begin...,"Oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and photographer Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a derelict bathroom with no idea of how they got there; they are the latest victims of the serial killer known as Jigsaw, who carries out elaborate and sadistic 'games' in order to teach people to appreciate life.With six unnecessary sequels over the last seven years, I had forgotten just how original and innovative the first Saw film was; what a pleasant surprise then to find that, instead of struggling manfully through my first repeat viewing since 2004, the time whistled by, with the movie feeling as fresh, suspenseful and as twisted as it had the first time.When analysed, the plot is admittedly extremely far-fetched—Jigsaw's games, which rely on his victims doing precisely as predicted, could not possibly go off without a hitch—but James Wan doesn't let that faze him and directs Leigh Whannell's convoluted script with enough style, energy and confidence to make it easy to turn a blind eye to the sheer preposterousness of proceedings. Although the film relies heavily on suggestion rather than outright gore, Wan still manages to make this a very unsettling experience, ensuring it as one to miss for the faint of heart but a gruesome treat for those who love their horror gritty and raw.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror villain ever (It's not even close),"The movie has a really well written story, with every detail esencial for the plot, delivered slowly (maybe too slowly) through the lenght of the film. Dialogue just ok. Acting, not even that.
The ""torture porn"" aspect is of course off putting to mainstream audiences, and apparently even a portion of horror fans, but for the rest, we appreciate the smarts on how and why is introduced, not only justified, but neccesary to the whole point of the saga (that yes, it has a point too).
Also, Jigsaw is the best horror villain ever. Of course, is not as important as the first ones (Freddy, Jason), because those were pioneers, but overall, there is no debate. Philosophically and psychologically, Jigsaw is a real character, not a fantastical one. It's as real as it gets and as brutal and efficient as the others without the magic/fantasy aspects. He's just perfect, including how iconic he's visually too (the doll, the laugh, the pig mask).Having said that, talking just about this one and not the whole saga, the policial procedure and the dramatic (based on the personal stories of the people involved) parts of the movies that aren't about Jigsaw himself, are pretty mediocre (probably in part because of the acting).

James Wan and Leigh Whannell Take Us to the Bathroom,"Photographer Leigh Whannell (as Adam) wakes up submerged in a bathtub, and finds himself also chained to some presumably very sturdy pipes. Seemingly stricken with amnesia, he finds he has a companion in doctor Cary Elwes (as Lawrence Gordon), who is also chained inside, closer to the toilet. Neither of the men need to use the facilities, but Mr. Elwes probably ""goes"" during the running time. The bathroom is not only filthy, but also has a fat, lifeless body situated center stage. At first, it seems like the body may be decapitated, but it's more like a smashed-up head.The men are given a ""Saw"" to escape with - it won't cut through their steel leg irons, but it will cut through their ankles. They are given until 6:00 to accomplish their mission, which is different for each man (as you'll see). Basically (the way I took it), the man who saws off the first leg wins. The plot unfolds in flashbacks. You get a related kidnapping, a series of gruesome murders, and investigator Danny Glover (as David Tapp).

A Splatter Horror Film Legend,"It's almost impossible not to have heard of this series: Saw.After watching the first film, I genuinely enjoyed the story. The premise hooked me, and the overall atmosphere was quite engaging. However, to be honest, I can't say it fully met my expectations. Some scenes seemed a bit sloppy, and the acting was occasionally subpar.That being said, I must give credit where it's due: the makeup and special effects. For 2002, they did a remarkable job. Creating a Splatter horror or Body horror film with just a budget of $1.2 million is no small feat, and the production team definitely delivered a solid piece.Additionally, the surprise twist at the end is one of the main factors that has turned this film into a cult classic.

um..... wow,"The concept is pretty sadistic. two men are chained on opposite sides of a filthy room. they both have to play the game of a sadistic serial killer who ""teaches"" the value of life through his murders. One of the two men,Lawrence, has to kill the other, Adam. Adam could kill Lawrence first, but neither of them can accomplish this without first sawing off the ankle of which their chains hold them.When i heard about this movie, i thought to myself ""Okay this movie is just an excuse to show sadistic, brutal and disturbing murders"". That might be true, but the story as a whole is quite interesting. before i continue, i'll come right out and say that most of the plot developments and concepts in this movie are either highly unlikely, or flat out bull s***.this movie cares about the two men whoa re chained up. there is plenty of explanation of their lives, and we learn about the motives of two detectives as well. as a result, we the audience find ourselves caring deeply about them. I'm talking about the kind of ""caring"" feeling where you're begging the movie not to kill off your favorite character, although it's most likely going to happen.The twists are, for the most part, unpredictable.The acting is great. this is of course my opinion, but I couldn't see how some critics could bash the actors for not doing their job.

A garage sale of ideas,"'Saw' (2004), begins with the high concept of 'imagine finding yourself with your ankle chained to a wall. Someone else on the opposite side of the room is in the same predicament. Items scattered around the room include a pistol with one bullet, a tape recorder, and two hacksaws that won't cut through the stainless steel chains, but would do a reasonable job on your ankle.'Adam and Lawrence are the two men who are chained, both opposites in temperament (but that will change), and each are given instructions via a cassette recorder on how to escape. Adam, a photographer, gets the message ""...what do voyeurs see when they look in the mirror?"" And that he must escape the room, while Lawrence is told to kill Adam before a certain time, or his family will die.A flashback reveals Detectives Tapp and Sing unwisely go and investigate a warehouse without a warrant and without telling anyone. Sing is fatally killed in a trip wire trap; a very 'Giallo' sequence. Tapp, now disgraced, obsessively wallpapers his apartment with news clippings in the style of Se7en (1995), whilst independently (a Dario Argento/Giallo concept) attempting to stop the mastermind behind the 'game.' Saw is padded with flashbacks to prop up the films running time to feature length.A 'garage sale' of ideas from possibly every film the writers and director have ever seen; the grime and toilet of 'Trainspotting' (1996), 'Evil Dead Trap's' camera flash sequence, a man finds himself in a 'Suspiria' like room of barbed wire, the 'reverse bear trap' business fans often compare to Edgar Allan Poe who is 'Suspiria' director Dario Argento's favourite author, and this is where we first see the puppet 'Jigsaw' who is reminiscent of those in Argento's 'Four Flies On Grey Velvet' and 'Deep Red'. There is an autopsy on a drugged man, reminiscent of both Argento's 'Opera' and Takashi Miike's 'Audition', and 'Audition' obviously influences the climax. The multiple twist endings require a suspension of disbelief as it goes into 'look how clever am I' The Usual Suspects (1995) twists for their own sake, that you don't want to think about too much less the thread fall apart.The Saw creators do give credit where credit is due; ""A lot of people have said that Saw is similar in tone to Se7en but the biggest influence wasn't a recent Hollywood thriller at all, it was the work of Dario Argento from the seventies,"" stated the director Wan.With dreadful performances (and I feel the need to give special mention to Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, who if they didn't should have received 'Razzie' awards), Saw surpassed all expectations, becoming one of the most profitable horror films since 1996's Scream by Wes Craven.I was never a fan of the jokey, not serious, just laughs and scares of the Scream school; but I am even less of a fan of 'torture porn,' of which this is hardly the worst, but it's the germ of the idea that started with Evil Dead Trap and lead to such dross as Eli Roth's Hostel (2005), and Srdjan Spasojevic's A Serbian Film (2010).

"I loved it (mild trailers, nothing specific)","I saw the trailers, It looked good...I was pretty excited about seeing it. I must say I was very pleased. I don't know why so many people found fault in the acting. I just didn't see it. Maybe I didn't notice because I was to wrapped up trying to figure it out along with the victims. This movie kept my attention. In the beginning I was afraid I would be disappointed. It seemed to move kind of slow for me...more mystery...less actual horror......once we got onto the second half tho and the doctor started loosing his composure...YES!!! now thats what I want to see...hysteria, panic, realization of whats really going on, despair, all of it..and I got what I wanted thats for sure.

I was pleased as things unraveled as hero's annoy me. I wanted a clever ending that wasn't a storybook close,not and they all live happily ever after. Certainly wont find that here. Not so gory that I couldn't watch....but left plenty of scenes where I had to grit my teeth and hold my breathe...especially when you see that the dr. is coming to the realization that he is definitely going to use that saw for the purpose it was intended.I was like...omg I think he's gonna do it....GREAT STUFF!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen,"A demonic serial killer (Okay, so he's not REALLY a serial killer, but) imprisons two average men (Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell) in a rather unpleasant bathroom in an ancient, long-deserted sewage plant. Things go from bad to worse for them when they realize that the intent of the said killer is for them to turn on one another and ultimately, kill one another.Wow. How can I describe a film like ""saw""? Brutal, disturbing, grisly, unpleasant I think you get the picture. Elwes and Whannell (Who also scripted the film) both give excellent performances, but more importantly, we care about the characters, they're engaging and realistic, usually in this type of film I find myself not caring at all for the characters, that isn't so here, though. The characters are well-rounded and likable. I WANTED them to survive.This is James Wan's first big feature film, and he delivers everything here with extreme intensity, style, and atmosphere. The cinematography was superb and I loved the ways some of the flashbacks were filmed. The guy's got a great eye for detail and I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him soon.This is no Disney film, folks, in case you haven't guessed. Not only is it extremely gory at times, but the situations are so unsettling and mean-spirited that if the film hadn't been gory, it still would have earned every bit of it's R rating (come to think about it, this is probably the most physiologically disturbing film I've ever seen!).In my opinion, the ending was absolutely terrifying. I won't give it away, but it's easily the most twisted, ironic and anticlimactic ending I've ever seen. Yes, I'll admit, I did loose some sleep over it.""Saw"" is a flick that wasn't designed with the faint-of-heart in mind. It ruthless, brutal, and gruesome, but it's easily the most powerful and disturbing films I've ever seen.8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Scary and Effective Thriller,"Saw is one of the scariest movies of 2004 and its a must see for any horror fan. Two men wake up in a deserted basement chained to the pipes with a dead body between them, only to learn that they're trapped by a sadistic serial killer dubbed ""Jigsaw,"" to play a deadly game of kill or be killed. Apparently, this maniac has been doing this sort of thing for a awhile and he an obsessed detective (Danny Glover) is hot on his trail. The plot sounds very interesting and for the most part the film doesn't disappoint. The main actor in this film is Cary Elwes who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon and plays his role effectively. Danny Glover plays the obsessed cop and also does very well. Monica Potter plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon's wife however she isn't in the film for very long. There are some truly horrifying scenes in Saw and one scenes that almost made me want to throw up. Saw is similar to Seven and even though it isn't as good its still worth a look. James Wan does a great job of directing and hopefully will have more opportunities to direct in the future. The ending is done very well and I didn't see all the twists and turns coming. However in the end you don't really care about the characters because they do bad things. I found it hard to have sympathy on some of them but that's just me. There are some stupid moments in the film though but not as many as the typical horror film. Rating 7/10 a very gruesome horror flick that's worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw is it's own kind of film,"This movie is fantastic and exciting. Despite the film's name, ""saw"". It's not very gory unlike it's sequels. For some viewers, it may not be scary at all, but it's the thought and idea that makes it scary. The film revolves around different places around different times and all comes together in a conclusion. You could be wandering why a character is doing certain actions until it is revealed later. These ""twists"" are well thought through and well explained.The film is very unique, as it's a new generation of horror. Saw started a lot of new horror movies like The Cube and Amusement. Instead of having a killer going around killing people violently or a ""demon/ghost is possessing something"" kind of movie, Saw is none of those things because it's different. People are in situations where they can make all sorts of choices to survive, or achieve a certain goal like saving another ones life. The killer in the movie doesn't attack victims, but tests them based on their weaknesses and sins. All these things make the writing really good.The film also has one of the greatest plot twists I've ever witnessed. You will be shocked and have goosebumps when you see it.This is a must watch, even if your not a fan of horror, this film is completely fresh and original and I suggest it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very good horror film!,"Before ""Saw"" premiered at Sundance festival in January 2004, few could have imagined that this new horror film would be part of a new wave of horror films that brought back gore and violence to the screens and moved away from the now formulaic style of self-referential teen slashers started with Wes Craven's ""Scream"" back in 1996. To call ""Saw"" revolutionary would be an exaggeration, but it's fair to point out that it was among the very the first of this resurgence that received wide public acclaim and became popular in mainstream crowds, proving that an R-rated horror film still can achieve financial success.""Saw"" begins with two men waking up in an old, and apparently abandoned industrial washroom. They don't know each other, and apparently the only thing they have in common is that they are both chained to the pipes with only a small saw as a tool, not enough to cut the chain, but good enough to cut their feet. Trapped in this nightmarish scenario, the men try to figure out an escape to their situation, and get to know each other; one is a young photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) and the other is a surgeon named Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). Lawrence realizes they have been kidnapped by the notorious serial killer named ""Jigsaw"", a man who puts their victims in deadly situations that most of the times lead to their deaths.Written by Leigh Whannell and director James Wan, ""Saw"" gives a new edge to the serial killer stories turning what otherwise would be another thriller into a full-fledged horror movie. The premise of the film is quite original, and via flashbacks we discover the past of both Gordon and Adam, as well as the story of this killer named Jigsaw, whose identity is a mystery and seems to be destined to be the bogeyman of this decade. Full of plot twists and with a cleverly hidden secret, the film keeps the mystery until the end, making an enjoyable and for the most part rewarding thriller.But as written above, ""Saw"" goes beyond the common conception of ""thriller"" and adds a horror edge closer to 70s grind-house than to otherwise similar films like ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"". Director James Wan focuses on the graphic violence of Jigsaw deathtraps and makes ""Saw"" a visually different kind of film, delivering a very good mix of detective story and gory horror film. However, Wan can't escape the influence of music videos and the now-clichéd use of shaky camera and rapid cuts. At times the overuse of this device breaks the suspenseful pace of the film in sadly awful ways.The acting is for the most part effective, without nothing really spectacular, although good considering the budget. Leigh Whannell delivers a good performance and while Elwes' accent at time slips out, he is a nice counterpart for Whannell's character. Danny Glover and Ken Leung appear in supporting roles, as the cops following Jigsaw's case. the two have great chemistry together, but it's safe to say Leung steals most of the scenes they share.""Saw"" suffers a lot from the extensive overuse of that music video style described above. Together with the metal soundtrack completely break the atmosphere of the story and look strange and out of place (as the characters are far from teenagers). The flashbacks are for the most part a well used device, although they too tend to break the momentum from time to time. Most critics have labeled the script of ""unbelievable"" and numerate the many plot holes the film has, and while they are right in many ways, ""Saw"" manages to work fine with all those plot holes because in the end, the core story is well-handled.In some way, ""Saw"" came up as a wake up call for the horror genre, in many ways superior to previous attempts to revive the genre like ""Cabin Fever"", but still far from perfect. Still, it's safe to say that James Wan and Leigh Whannell have crafted a nice and original new entry in the genre and may represent a new source of thrills in the future. While maybe not a classic yet, ""Saw"" is a very recommended films for fans and non-fans of the horror genre. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
For the shock and fear factor there aren't many better,"This is the first time since I set up my IMDb account that I'm struggling to decide on whether to give a film a positive or a negative rating. Despite having seen 'Saw' multiple times, the truth is that I still can't decide if I love it or hate it. Each time I watch it, I find myself thinking 'why am I watching this trash?', and yet it manages to keep me completely engrossed - and entertained - from beginning to end. It's one of those films that you struggle to enjoy in the moment, but once the credits roll you realise how good it was.Horror films are all about the shock and fear factor, and 'Saw' has that in abundance. The viewer is on edge throughout and the tension literally never lets up. 'Saw' probably goes as far as any horror film has done to satisfy horror fans. It ticks just about every box there is to tick, as well as a few others that didn't exist before 'Saw' came along. Whether you love it or hate it, or both as in my case, 'Saw' will always be a classic of the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Didn't make a lot of sense, but I didn't want to saw off my limb either.","I enjoy a good ""buckets of blood"" film every now and then, and when the film carries an original concept that makes it a lot easier to watch too. ""Saw"" isn't the gore fest that I thought it would be, but it's pretty close and lots of the film is disgusting and creepy. The creep factor is high in this one.The film starts out with two guys chained to a pipe in a seedy bathroom. There is a dead guy in the room with his brains blown off holding a gun on the floor. The two of them are each given a tape to listen to and follow the instructions. Cary Elwes plays one of the guys and he is instructed to kill the other guy by a time deadline or his family will be killed. The men are also given a saw. the saw won't work on the chains, but it's there to cut through their limbs to get loose. The man behind this is a serial killer named Jigsaw and until later in the film, he never actually kills anybody. He carefully picks his victims and sets them up in precarious situations, that would make them want to kill themselves. All the victims are flawed people such as prostitutes and adulterers. This aspect reminded me of the film ""Se7en"".The film is very scary at times and you never really know whats going to happen next, most of the time. It's well directed and pretty smart. My complaint is that towards the end of the film, you know whats coming. There is a twist ending that makes little sense and I suppose that most horror movies seem to all have twist endings nowadays. That's fine if they help the film. The movie also stars B-Movie horror queen Dina Meyer, Monica Potter, and in a bizarre role for him, Danny Glover.I'm recommending ""Saw"" to people who like their films scary, full of blood, and creepy. If that's not your thing, you'll hate this movie. It kept my interest and I liked it. (***)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"As far as recent horror movies go, Saw can definitely be the best!","After all those half-assed horror movies like Boogeyman, it was time a movie like Saw came and scared us, not physically, but mentally. The sequels that came afterwards aren't entirely as good as this movie, but then again not much can be compared to this movie, which will probably go down in history as a cult horror film, the next never-ending horror franchise in the style of ''Friday the 13th'' or ''Halloween'', without all the slashing action. Saw doesn't scare us with all the gruesome murders (at least not the first one), but it's the psychological aspect of the plot that kept me into the film. In fact all, movie long I was wondering what the hell was going to happen to the two main characters, Adam and Lawrence.In fact the story focuses on two characters: Adam and Lawrence Gordon, two men who wake up chained in a bathroom. They are told to kill one another before 6 O'clock PM or their families will die. Meanwhile, Detective Tapp and his accomplice Sing try to get as much info on the Jigsaw killer by talking to Amanda, a survivor from one of his sadistic ''tests''. Visually speaking, the movie isn't all that great, the visual effects aren't super but for it's 1.2 million budget, it's got some pretty decent effects. The acting is okay, some are very good and some are very bad, the acting is never equivalent. So why am I giving it a 10??? Simply because the script is so well-crafted. The story is so awesome, it's twisted. You think something will happen when it's actually something else. You can never guess, and thus, even after you've seen it many many times. Also, the story affects your psychology directly. The two men socialize in a way that you want to know what will happen in the end. If you want a beautifully crafted, twisted thriller who isn't for the squeamish, then Saw is the closest to perfection you will ever get.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw-ful,"If a rabbit pooped in the woods and a bunch of art critics determined it was a great work of art, would it really be art or rabbit poop? That is the problem with this movie. It was so heavily hyped that i assumed it would be worthwhile. But, when i actually sat down to watch it, it was-in fact- a big pile of rabbit poop.The screenwriters have obviously never had a realistic conversation. The dialogue was trite and predictable. They were more distracted by horrific acts of torture than actual plot. While the common complaint about horror movies is that they are just gore with no substance, SAW would be worthwhile if we just admitted that it was gore for the sake of two Austrailian film students getting off. The film style was that of a bad Lifetime Made-for-TV movie and the ""plot-twist"" at the end was just unfair. It was barely a step above of saying all these horrible things are happening because a drunk squirrel got run over outside of Home Depot. It made no sense.The biggest victim of this movie(other than me for actually watching it) is Cary Elwes' career. What was once a spotless resume has now been forever stained by the skid marks of this terrible piece of celluloid. Danny Glover should also be chastised but he was not the one who agreed to sit in a room chained to a pipe screaming into a cell phone.

A new Beginning for Crime and torture.,"At first I didn't have faith for this movie mainly because it generated many speculation towards a new way of horror film making in the new millennium. I let some time pass and finally decided to give it a chance... my mistake I didn't watch it before.Saw is an excellent Crime/Horror movie with some interesting bits of sci-fi and even giallo. I think about Jigsaw, the movie's villain as a crazy preacher that is angry with anyone that isn't taking the best about happiness. Now this is a clever villain because he doesn't murder his victims; he puts them some mortal tramps and plays with them psychologically in order for them to commit suicide.The character development is really interesting and you get to know them perfectly. Also, the situations surrounded by them are extremely interesting because psychologically they change as some nasty situations happen.The direction is spectacular and I dug the editing.

Mortifyingly Claustrophobic Splatter Film,"When I first saw this ideal sleeper hit, I was absolutely terrified. It wasn't that it was violent or Gothic. Rather, it was that it is claustrophobic even when the story reaches beyond its main setting, an unsavory dungeon warehouse bathroom. Saw never comes up for a breath of pleasant fresh air, even by the mortifying end, an end that will make even the most adventurous or free-flowing of viewers become at least scared of the dark. This was the most scared I had ever been by a movie from the horror genre. I loved it for its nonstop bearhug of creepiness.The film opens as Adam wakes up in a bathtub full of water, getting out of the bathtub and screaming for help, then Dr. Lawrence Gordon tells him that screaming for help is no good because he tried it already, meaning he was awake some time before Adam. How could Adam have been submerged water for so long without drowning? No matter. Bearhug of creepiness. Now, in the neglected industrial bathroom, Adam and Gordon are chained by their ankles to pipes at opposite corners. In the room between them is a dead body with a revolver and a micro cassette recorder loosely in grip. Lawrence and Adam each find tapes in their pockets labeled ""Play Me."" According to the disguised voice on the tape, Adam has to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence must kill Adam before six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be deserted to die captive in this room. This is the irresistible set up for Saw, one so intelligently designed to inject us with great tension in the first single minute that I dread the idea of ever seeing it in the quintessential modern-day American horror film theatrical experience, surrounded by a nearly sold-out rowdy, shouting, giggling, starting and restless audience. It demands our intention.Its concept, which is unraveled which the crisp enough pace to ensure that we are enduring the suspense, is one which does not just play on our irrational human fears that usually result in horror films like Jaws, Night of the Living Dead or Rosemary's Baby. It connects with true misery, helplessness and paranoia to its terrors. For better or for worse, this is a real breakthrough in the realm of debuts among young fanboy filmmakers. And you can tell that James Wan has some growing up to do: His movie inserts, flashes back, speeds up and machine gun-edits too much. Wan could have intensified the horrific atmosphere by letting an image speak for itself without screaming at us that it's an intense moment.But the talent, ambition and spirit behind his work, not to mention the wit and flair of Australian screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who stars as the panicked Adam, is highly infectious. With the surfacing of the ""torture porn"" genre in the past decade, the Saw film series, together with similarly relentless shockers like Eli Roth's Hostel and Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects, is often discerned as an instance of the frequency of manipulatively attractive and stylized graphic violence and gore in contemporary horror films. Nonetheless, Saw is perhaps the very least exploitative of them all, especially Hostel and The Devil's Rejects.Splatter pictures, owing to the wear and tear of special effects and extreme amounts of blood and guts, have a propensity for exhibiting an explicit attraction to the weakness of the body and the sensationalism of its maiming. Saw is, yes, an inordinately violent movie. The word might actually be sadistic. However, Saw's gore and brutality come inherently from its concept, which is designed to horrify us.Saw may be a great horror film, but it is not quite a great film. By and large, its cast gives B- movie performances. There are suspense sequences in which a character makes a glaringly unrealistic choice. Wan needs to mature into a more confident filmmaker with a better understanding of the language of editing. In spite of these things, it's the kind of horror movie of which we need to see more: A horror movie that is as smart as you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Despite my tastes, i like it","I'm no fan of splatter-movies. Rather i don't like them at all with a few notable exceptions. I'm not sure why that is really, i'm not squeamish about blood and i'm not sensitive otherwise either. I guess i just don't see the qualities in a movie where the blood itself is the point.I have seen some people summarily disregard SAW as another splatter-movie. Blood and gore just for the sake of it. Luckily most people don't agree. And indeed there is another quality here. Sick, deranged and quite possibly insane, but also devious and intelligent. There is a method and thought to the killing in this movie. It's not random neither in purpose nor in execution. And that does in fact help when the disgusting scenes become a little too much to watch comfortably.The Jigsaw-killer, as the orchestrator of the games in SAW are called, is one of the more colorful villains in recent years. His insane designs of self-punishment, or rather forced life-defining decisions, are both amazing in appearance as well as devious in function. His single purpose is to make people appreciate life more after having fought a bit for it. While i find that idea disgusting in itself, it is a very alluring concept for a movie.The acting is pretty good, the sets are amazing, the props equally so and the story original. There is blood here, but i think it's still less than what you would be made to believe. Also the sequels live up to the gory expectations more as you would imagine. Here though we have a quite perfect mix between blood and suspense. That being said, i don't think this is for everyone considering that some people would probably just spend the entire running-time behind a pillow.SAW is suspenseful, disgusting and smart - all in the same package.

Freaky enough,"Following the hype, I must say that I expected more from this movie. Still, the entertainment value was very high, I did not get bored a single time. The basic concept is good and freaky enough. The dark, cold and stinky atmosphere was justly portrayed. However, there were some things missing that could've made this movie a true classic. Maybe there are too many flashbacks, police investigation scenes, etc. to get truly absorbed into the main story of the two men chained in a sleazy bathroom. What's more, I was not really impressed by the choice of actors. I never got to the point of empathizing with the characters, and therefore I was not so concerned with their fates (which lessens the tension). More character building would've helped a lot.Also, more focus on the dreadfulness of lying hours in a row as a caged dog in a desolate place would've been welcome: I understand, including a minute or two of silent trepidation would be risky in the commercial eye, but I am convinced it would add to the overall texture of the movie. I also expected more gore and bloodiness; if somebody has to pull a key out of another person's stomach, show more of the actual action. If the doctor is sawing his leg, well, include at least a second more of the sawing or of the sawed-off foot/leg (then again, my own stomach says thank you for not showing that) The last factor which did damage to the absorption level was the logic of action taken. If Big Brother can hear all that's happening in the bathroom, why can't he hear what's being said between the two victims when the light is turned off? And is it not oh so obvious for BB that they made a deal with regard to the poisoned cigarette? When (near the end of the movie) the doctor reaches for the cell phone, he gets frustrated for not reaching it. Hey, you managed to pick up things that were harder to pick up by either man just throwing another object towards it, so why cutting off your foot to do it now?

Very underrated. Perhaps the best horror film ever made.,"Overlooked by many so-called film critics as a low-quality horror piece with no taste and no so-called depth, Saw is one of the best horror films ever made and perhaps even the best among the best.The greatest part of the film, on the contrary to what most people believe before seeing it, is its highly logical and carefully arranged ultra-complex story rather than its presentation of blood and gore. It is the kind of movie where there are tons of totally unpredictable twists and the ending itself stands out as one of the most twisted ones in movie history. In my opinion the story is miles better than that in The Silence of the Lambs, and this alone makes Saw one of the greatest mystery drama films ever too, alongside Memento.Acting on the other hand, is sometimes a little contrived, but sometimes it becomes excessively vivid. Almost every actor/actress does average in average scenes but when horror strikes, their performances become highly believable all in a sudden.Despite the fact that it's not trying to teach you something or to educate you something helpful to being a better man (and forget it, because most films don't), it's a classic that everyone who likes plot- heavy dramas and who doesn't dislike gore/blood should see!Story: 9.8/10 Presentaion (sound/visuals): 9.5/10 Acting and directing: 8.3/10 Atmosphere: 9.0/10Overall: 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stuff nightmares are made of,"I've never really taken the time to fully get into the whole ""Saw""-franchise, mainly because the word ""franchise"" is always sort of off-putting to me. I mean seriously, seven movies in six years? Perhaps the makers can just work really, really fast, but randomly shelling out entries at that kind of ridiculous pace just screams ""cash cow"" to me. I might start checking them out anyway though, because the original ""Saw"" is nothing short of magnificent. It's gripping and terrifying from the first minute to the last, and it keeps putting you on the wrong track just because it can. There's some stuff in this movie that doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's forgivable because all of it's done in the name of mind-shattering suspense. The acting is also great, particularly by Cary Elwes. ""Saw"" is not a movie that leaves you with a good feeling, but who really wants it to? Excellent dark thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
godawful movie,"god,i pray to u to save me from such movies in the future.the script seemed to be ripped off from 'seven', the ending was meaningless, with just a stupid, unrealistic suspense. if the 'dead' man lying in the pool of blood was alive the whole time , is it possible that he didn't move at all for all the hours those guys were around him? (maybe he fell asleep).the acting was the worst i have ever seen in a Hollywood movie!ppl calling this movie a pycho thriller must get their pycho-analysis done. this movie was complete trash.a friend was watching the movie, he called me up and recommended it to me..... i no longer watch movies of his choice. i deserve thanks from those who didn't watch the movie after reading this.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sawsome!!!,"Two men awaken in a bathroom chained to pipes, they don't know each other and have no idea why they are there. They find themselves having to work together to try to find out who has done this to them and why. But as they start to piece things together, it appears that one of the men may know the perpetrator...I first watched this film when it was quite new and before I begun writing reviews and even though this is probably the 3rd time that I've seen this film it never fails to impress me...Even though it's tagged as a gore horror film (and in its very basic form I suppose that's what it is), but for me this film has layers to it that elevates it above your average 'gore horror film.' First of all, there's the man behind all the carnage; he's not your average lunatic who goes round murdering people willy-nilly without any kind of rhyme or reason, but rather he selects people whom he feels don't value life enough and effectively puts them through tests to determine their will to survive. This premise alone makes the film a cut above and gives it a sense of intelligence and sophistication that is rarely seen within this type of genre....So it has enough going for it to satisfy those with a thirst for blood, but it also works well as a crime mystery film, as a thriller and possibly even a police procedural type film. Whilst Dr Gordon and Adam are chained up trying to figure out who has put them there Detectives Tapp and Sing are also trying to do the same thing and the film nicely runs both stories side by side meaning that everyone is trying to work out who is doing this, but everyone is having to go about things in different ways. The first time you watch this film it's really fun trying to figure out how and where everyone slots in to the story and I really like the way the film gradually reveals slightly more information from scene to scene and it's fair to say that there is never a slow or dull moment in this film.The main actors are all solid as well; Elwes and Whannell worked exceptionally well together building up a good sort of anti-camaraderie. Glover is playing another cop, but he distinguishes himself from his Lethal Weapon and Predator 2 cop roles here as Tapp is a tortured-broken soul and Glover does a terrific job in this film (one of his best roles in my opinion). It doesn't hurt that the exceptionally pretty Monica Potter is involved in proceedings as well.Some may be put off by this film based on its name and reputation, but honestly this film is much more than just bloody carnage. If you peel it back you'll so many other layers that make it an incredibly enjoyable film for so many different reasons. Whilst the sequels gradually got worse, this first film is the granddaddy and is one of my favourite films and is definitely worth checking out.HONOURABLE MENTION: No matter how many times you see it, the ending is still brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Cutting Edge Film!,"With the glut of the so called ""torture porn"" genre over the last ten years, & myself being 52 years old & weaned on monster/ghost movies, I just didn't have the time nor desire to watch ""Saw."" A movie that is majorly responsible for this masochistic horror sub-genre, that's really is only an excuse to see people graphically tortured & mutilated, without any redeeming qualities. I was WRONG!I had just got Netflix streaming & there was ""Saw."" I thought to myself, why not, lets see what all the hoopla is about. I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub-genre, has to have something going for it, right? Right! I was very pleasantly surprised! Here we have a film with a white knuckled terrific plot, what would you do to save yourself? Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing & direction, & it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities & characters. It was not what I expected at all! It was actually closer to films like ""Silence of the Lambs"" & ""Seven, & was the best film of that ilk since those great movies! I was almost dumbfounded, & thought, why did I wait so long! ""Saw"" is a movie that every horror & non-horror fan should see. It is a shining example of how to get much mileage out of a film, with no gas money. Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, & recommend!

Amazing,"It's hard not to play five stars in this movie. After watching it, I realized that James Wan was so powerful that he could be called a ceiling level horror movie. The plot is well balanced, and the multi line narrative structure allows the audience to always focus on following the development of the plot. The rhythm is tense and stimulating, coupled with the pressure brought by the music and camera language. As someone who is not easily scared, I also have goosebumps all over the film watching process. I thought it was already a great horror film, but the last ten minutes of the plot became even more unexpected. I won't write much about spoilers here, but in short, the reversal is amazing and one of the best horror films I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Better than average horror flick, but could have been much better...","This was a pretty decent movie (compared to others in the genre) but the plot holes, flawed logic, and small annoyances really keep it from being great.The best thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it will definitely surprise and shock you. There are some great plot twists, even for the most cynical film buffs. It is engrossing and has a tendency to trap you in the claustrophobic terror along with its characters. In most ways, it delivers what you are expecting and wanting after seeing the trailers.The worst thing I can say about ""Saw"" is that it falls short of its potential. The fright and excitement dies down when the plot goes limp a few times. The characters lose your attention when the script goes weak at points. If you focus on these aspects too much it will only frustrate you and take away your enjoyment of an otherwise good movie.The saddest thing about these shortcomings is that with a little ironing out ""Saw"" could have been a really great movie instead of merely good. However, for something that was written by two new screenwriters and shot in 18 days, it is commendable.Better than average? Yes. Worth seeing? Yes. Fun? Hell yes.Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Without a doubt the stupidest movie I have ever seen.,"I will admit straight up front that I am a movie snob, but even my bf who liked ""Night at the Roxbury"" admitted that ""Saw"" crap. Everybody had been telling me that the plot of ""Saw"" was brilliant but I wouldn't like it because it was too gory. Well, I finally watched it last night and there were two parts throughout the entire flick that I had to turn away from. The ""brilliant"" plot was nothing short of retarded. And as for the ""big twist"" at the end, well, that is when the film went from 1 on 10 to negative 100 on 10 for me. My complaints don't just stop at the plot of this film, however. I realize that this film was fairly low budget... but I didn't realize that low budget meant that James Wan could only afford to hire the worst two actors on the planet. I hope that ""Dr. Gordon"" gets a razzy for that completely and totally unbelievable performance.The fact that this movie has become so acclaimed over the last two years only serves to reinforce my view that the mainstream public cannot discern quality from crap. Don't waste two hours of your life watching this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not the classic people say it is, but quite good, nonetheless","With the film industry reportedly experiencing major downturns in its intake, and studios contemplating bankruptcy, stagnation is the order of the day in mainstream film. Everything must be toned down in order to appeal to the broadest audience in a curious disregard for the fact that trying to please everyone ends up pleasing no one. Yet Hollywood seemed genuinely surprised that this film, made for a mere 1.2 million US dollars, made back fifteen times its budget and then some on its opening weekend. I can sum it up quite simply. Saw is the first horror film in over a decade to recognise that its audience will almost exclusively be made up of adults, and plays its material accordingly. In case some glass-eyed film executive reads this comment, I cannot stress enough the difference this makes. Saw and its sequel (which I actually watched first) are the first two horror films, at least if you go by production date, that have actually made me horrified since I was in my teens. Perhaps its success will finally mean the end of all the I Know What Your Breasts Did Last Summer types.Yet for such a remarkable film, Saw's premise is amazingly simple. Two men wake up in a filthy bathroom, unable to remember how they got there. As one begins to fearfully wonder if one of his kidneys is missing, we learn the other is a surgeon. Slowly, we are filled in on the existence of a bizarre serial killer whose chief delight is in testing how far his victims will go in order to preserve their lives. In so doing, he puts his victims in traps, then very casually explains to them how they can get out. The kicker is that he does not lie to them or hide the salient details from them. He gives them a very good, and very obvious, clue. So obvious, in fact, that our victims often overlook it. In the case of the two men in the bathroom, for example, he leaves them chained to pipes against a wall, with hacksaws to be easily found. The pipes and the chains are too strong to be sawn through in the time it would take them to starve to death. Those who have seen the original Mad Max will know exactly where this puzzle is going (one has to wonder if this was a deliberate reference).Surprisingly for a film with such a low budget, Saw also contains a few recognisable faces. Danny Glover is the most famous man to appear in Saw, and one has to wonder exactly how such a cheap production secured his services. A Nicholson-like promise of box office percentage comes to mind. Shawnee Smith gives a brief turn as the one victim of Jigsaw to get away, and it is remarkable that for a character whose vocabulary mostly consists of screaming and crying, her performance is quite watchable. Dina Meyer fills in for a scene as a detective, but her role probably amounted to less than a day's work on this set. Her role is considerably expanded in the sequel, which was green-lit the weekend that this film opened. But it is the performance of Tobin Bell, the man who plays Jigsaw, that really hooks the viewer. For the most part, one only hears his voice, and I am not going to spoil the surprise, but suffice to say that you see him throughout most of the film. When it is finally revealed who he is, you will not know whether to laugh, cry, or throw up.Yet, for all its simple charm, Saw is not without problems. The cameo-like appearances of some actors is somewhat jarring, and plot threads that feature them often seem to go nowhere. Shawnee and Dina get about five minutes of screen time at the most, and some of the scenes they appear in leave one to wonder what happened to this or that plot idea. It is also very difficult to make a film that focuses on two men in a room retain its tension, and the director seems to recognise this, too. There are an awful lot of sequences outside of the room showing the situation of ancillary characters where leaving it to the viewer's imagination would have worked so much better. I suspect that the director realised this in the sequel, too, because aside from moments of the police trying to find where the victims are, the entire film focused instead on seeing the situation through their eyes. So yes, there are some flaws to Saw, and it is not a ten out of ten film, but it comes so much closer than anything else the majors have the nerve to call horror these days.In all, I gave Saw an eight out of ten. It is truly deserving of the cult and mainstream following has, even if it is not a masterpiece. If Saw and its success does not wake the MPAA up to the fact that people are sick of their modern Hayes Code, then they ought to be cast aside.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw: an in-depth review (no spoilers),"Saw was a good and refreshingly original horror film that was almost great. With a mixture of a capture-the-killer plot and sick-and-slick psychological terror it recalls such films as The Cell and the gritty feel of Se7en while remaining completely its own. The plot alone is worth the eight bucks to see: two strangers wake up in a locked room, chained on either side, with a man in the center who died from an apparent suicide. Together, they must jog through their memories and random clues in the room to piece together the killer and a way out. They each are supplied with a hacksaw which isn't sharp enough to cut through their chains but maybe a legSaw is in the category of what I like to call the second-wave new horror that (apart from mpaa restrictions) isn't afraid to take horror to the next level and is much more psychological and realistically gory. Se7en (1995) was one of the films that started this second wave showing there's more to a horror film then a cheap scare. However, unlike such milestones as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, I'm afraid this film will eventually be one of the many films that will collect dust on the video store shelves only to be checked out by true horror movie fans.The problem with the film lies not in its main plot but its execution. The first thing I noticed was the film's blatant inexperience. I checked IMDb when I got home and my guess was correct, this was the writer/director James Wan's first film. Although the plot was amazing some of the story and situations to help run it just didn't seem real, (a major problem I had with Jeepers Creepers, which I apologize for even mentioning.) The characters didn't seem to behave and talk like most normal people would. At first I chalked it up to second-rate acting, but I realized that these actors - especially veteran actor Danny Glover, are not bad actors and that it had to be equal parts inexperienced script/directing.Less problematic but still awkward was the cinematography. Just like most other aspects of the film, it was hit-and-miss. There were some scene changes that were awesome and swept right into each other, and then there were those scenes that just stuck out - a few scenes (and even characters) seemed extraneous. While it's good to have an abundance of information for a murder-mystery these people and scenes did nothing but interrupt the story.I review this film really hard because it truly had the potential for greatness. While the above factors brought the film down it was only from 10 stars to a 7. If this film was ever remade it would be nothing short of perfect but the end would already be spoiled and thus defeat the point. I can only look forward to seeing what James Wan comes out with in the future, let's just hope he doesn't pull a Larry Cohen and make a movie called Cellular after his hit Phone Booth.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

a true psychological thriller,"I have seen many horror, and crime dramas, ""Saw"" was quite unique.I found many similarities to Hannibal sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs The culprit here believes in himself as sort of an avenging spirit of sorts. picks his targets among people who at least in his demented mind are guilty of some form of wrongdoing, in one It's a botched, suicide attempt, which he feels was done only to get attention. In others It's anti-social behavior, or criminal acts.This killer, if the reader cares to indulge me in letting me clarify, is not a killer. That's right , well OK by a legal definition yes he would be considered a murderer, but his Modus operandi is to place the intended victim, in a position in which he or she must carry out certain tasks that usually result in death by the same means the victim used in committing his/hers own wrongdoing.Unlike other Horror/Crime films the police , and/or authorities play a very background role in the investigation. Most of the dialog , and scenes are between the victims themselves. Even the killer makes only brief appearances. The killer unlike Hannibal Lecter is not as resourceful, or intelligent.My summary , yes this film is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Jaw-dropping, bloody, shocking, great horror fun!","OMG! This was a genius of a horror movie: bloody, shocking, and jaw-dropping...everything a horror movie is suppose to be about! Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel, who is also the co-writer of the film) are two men who have never met before and both wake up chained on opposite ends of an abandoned bathroom with a corpse in the middle of the floor holding a gun and a tape recorder. Each find an envelope with a tape, but Dr. Gordon's envelope also comes with a bullet. They play their tapes and find themselves at the hands of a serial killer called the ""Jigsaw killer"" who sets them up to play a game in which Lawrence is to kill Adam by six o'clock or his family will die. As the two men struggle to understand the situation they are in the serial killer is somewhere watching. What is so frightening about this film is that the serial killer doesn't technically kill his victims, but instead finds ways for his victims to kill themselves or each other. The situations are grisly and gruesome and emotionally raw. The Jigsaw killer targets victims who are not grateful for living or self-destructive in some way. Be prepared to watch this film and be even more prepared for the ending that is only seen in the most terrifying of all horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Here is something you can't understand. How I could just kill a man.,"It's a bit odd to say that the thing I liked best about Saw was that there was true suffering in it rather than detached horror movie gore, but that was the case with this movie. I am reminded of some of Wes Craven's early films like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, which were essentially about people doing horrible things to other people. It's a lofty effort for a couple of first time filmmakers and is very good as a debut horror/thriller/crime film, and the almost universal comparisons to Seven are to be expected. They are, after all, perfectly justified. The problem is that Seven never stops being interesting, while Saw makes no sense on a second viewing.My roommate watched the movie after I had already seen it, and I sat and watched parts of it and was reminded of the supplemental documentaries included with the Vista Series edition of The Sixth Sense, in which it is explained that they went to great lengths to make sure that they were making the movie honestly, that you could go back after you knew about the ending and see that the movie still made sense. This movie has no time or interest in that, because while the twists and turns are great during a first viewing and it is tremendously successful at making almost every single character look suspicious at some point or another, if you watch it when you already know the end the entire thing falls apart.Adam and Dr. Gordon wake up to find themselves locked in a filthy restroom of sorts, each chained to opposite sides of the room with a dead body between them holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. They each have tapes in their pockets, and once Adam gets a hold of the tape recorder (by using his shirt to help him reach it, and at Dr. Gordon's suggestion, which will become important later in this review), they listen to the two tapes and are given instructions by the killer. Adam is a voyeuristic photographer, his job is to prevent his own death, while Dr. Gordon's job is to kill Adam or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left there to die.Thus begins a lengthy series of ever more complicated events set up by the killer which are very convenient for a structured screenplay but make no sense in reality. Then again, the application of logic is a great way to dismantle a movie like this, and it should be noted that the movie is, in fact, highly entertaining during that first viewing. I like to think that it's not until the second viewing that you realize how much you have been cheated.(spoilers) Because of the shock of the ending, for example, you forgot that Zap, the hospital orderly, at one point holds a stethoscope to the daughter's chest while he points a gun at her mother's head, listening as the child's heartbeat speeds up in fear. Was he enjoying himself? Kind of cancels out some of the sympathy you felt for him after he got killed at the end despite not being the kidnapper, didn't it. Then there was the issue of the objects just out of reach. Early in the film, it is Dr. Gordon that tells Adam to take off his shirt and use it to reach the tape recorder in the man's hand in the middle of the room, then later in the movie Dr. Gordon finds himself unable to reach the cell phone, which is ringing, so he takes off his shirt anduses it as a tourniquet to cut his foot off. What?? Given that the phone was about 8 inches out of his reach on linoleum, he may have been able to save his foot had he used his shirt to get it, like he suggested to Adam earlier. He must have been under a lot of stress.There is a good scene early in the movie where Adam finds the two saws and tosses one to Dr. Gordon and they both start sawing frantically at the chains around their ankles. Adam breaks his saw and Gordon soon gives up, realizing that it's not the chains the killer wants them to cut through, it's their feet. Reminds me of a great short story by Stephen King called ""Survivor Type"" where a man is stranded on a desert island and quickly finds himself with very, very little to eat.All in all I enjoyed the movie, it had a good surprise ending despite the fact that the path leading up to it was heavily and clumsily manufactured. It is an entertaining horror film, not a great one. Cary Elwes provides a bit of star power, but sadly delivers the worst performance I've ever seen him do, it was even worse than Liar Liar. If there is one thing I learned from this movie, it is that Cary Elwes can NOT cry on film. WOW. His emotional scenes were some of the worst I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood can cry better than this guy, and he makes Samuel L. Jackson look like a care bear. Schwarzenegger can cry better than this guy, for crying out loud. Maybe that's why he was so convincing in The Princess Bride, because Wesley was completely devoid of all emotion for most of the film.Whatever the case, this is still an interesting film. Fans of the great thrillers like Seven and The Sixth Sense may find themselves unimpressed if you go into it expecting more of the same level of quality, but horror fans are sure to get a kick out of it. At least the first time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Bad Acting, alright plot","This film looked very good from the trailer, but the acting just wasn't convincing. The people they hired could act in small roles, requiring a limited range of emotions; but for a person locked in a room with nothing but a saw, a foot, and a choice, the acting just didn't have me convinced.The story-line was good, as were the different methods of murder/torture seen throughout the film. In fact the movie itself played upon a lot of my key inner fears. Despite this, I found most scenes less frightening then I first expected. I think this is mostly due to the poor soundtrack. If you ever watch a scary film, and it gets too much for you, simply turn off the sound and it is nothing. There were never any tense violins jerking as the killer got closer, or bass music building up as something bad was about to happen. I suppose if they had spent more then 18 days filming it, then they may have made some better choices.Overall I give it a five because while there is technically nothing wrong with it, it is still lacking something to make it a good film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'll never look at a tricycle the same way again!,"I got to see this film at a screening tonight, and had the added honor of having the filmmakers there for a Q&A to introduce and follow the movie.The acting wasn't stellar, and the movie itself was admittedly a little rough around the edges, but none of that really mattered. It was one of the most intense and disturbing movies I've ever seen. It became pretty clear why that was so during the Q&A. The filmmakers mentioned that they had been approached about just selling the script, but since they had worked so hard on it for so long, that it was their project and they were going to hold out until Wan could direct and they would maintain control over the script. And thankfully, Evolution gave them the funding and left them with creative control of the project.The result is that the whole movie has a level of internal cohesion that can only come when the project is a labor of love from concept, through development, and ultimately into production. Despite the faults of the movie, it still worked amazingly well, and had such a profound effect, because it was made by people who intimately knew every nook and cranny of the script, concept, and plot.My fear is that this movie will go the way of Blair Witch (about which I had very similar feelings.) This movie will benefit from some very well deserved positive word of mouth, but it's just too intense, and too much of a niche film to live up to the mass market's expectations. This is NOT a movie for the general movie going public. This is a movie for people who appreciate the art of film-making, and want to be scared and frightened by a challenging work. If the average popcorn muncher makes it through 45 minutes of this one, I'll be impressed. For those who go -- and I recommend it highly -- be ready for a unique experience that one can never truly be prepared for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One Of The Most Disturbing Films To Come Out In Recent Years,"What sets SAW apart from the usual slew of horror films is that this one gets into your mind. It puts you into the situations themselves and makes you wonder what you would do yourself. And, of course, a steady pace of creepy images such as scary clowns and spine tingling figures does not help you feel any better that you are watching a scary film of this magnitude.Cary Elwes plays Lawrence Gordon, a doctor who wakes up trapped and chained inside a rundown, cracking, dirty bathroom with a younger man named Adam, who is played by SAW's screenwriter, Leigh Whannell. A dead body lies between them. As soon as Gordon comes to, he receives clues from his captor, saying he must murder Adam before a certain time or his family will be murdered. Elwes acts well enough in this movie, although in some scenes he tended to over act, or try too hard in some of the more terrifying scenes. Some takes would come off as forced, like he was trying very hard to impress the crumbling walls just how wonderfully he can play the part of a scare But it's not the acting that makes SAW work.What DOES work are the filming techniques and camera work. The film's picture is grainy, shot with hand-held cameras to give a more realistic feel to the film's dirty, claustrophobic set. Visual style is something that has not been seen since David Fincher's Se7en, with outrageously mind numbing images. This is a wonderfully filmed picture, with a great score to intensify the mood.SAW is one of the most disturbing, scary, psychologically draining films I have seen in quite some time. Compared to the other horror films being chucked out by Hollywood these days, SAW is for sure a horror film that will be remembered for some time and is very much something I would recommend.MJR",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling tale let down by OTT performances,"Two men wake up in a room chained to pipes with a body on the floor in a pool of blood, and no recollection of how they got there. They soon find a tape instructing one of the men, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) to kill the other (Leigh Whannell) within 6 hours, or his wife and daughter will be murdered. Dr. Gordon quickly realizes that they have become the latest victims of a serial killer known as ""The Jigsaw"", whose trademark is to put his victims in situations where they kill themselves, or each other. Neither of the men can reach the gun in the middle of the room, all they have been equipped with are saws too flimsy to cut through their chains, but strong enough to cut through flesh and bone...With an intriguing central premise, 'Saw' proves what can be achieved with a small budget and a big idea. Much like a cross between 'Se7en' and 'Cube', flashback is used to show us the fate of earlier victims, while most of the action is confined to the dark underground room where the men are being held (ala 'Cube') providing a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere.The earlier part of the film is where 'Saw' works best, with the initial introduction to the serial killer and his victims both chilling and gripping, while the predicaments faced by both men heightens the sense of desperation as they work against the clock. Paranoia and suspicion are inevitably drawn in to the equation and through these plot convolution's we begin to 'piece' together the mystery of ""The Jigsaw"".While hitherto displaying what can be achieved with a minimal budget, one area 'Saw' trips up is in it's casting. Instead of plumping primarily for unknown actors, the cast is comprised of z-list actors Cary Elwes, Monica Potter and Danny Glover. And z-list they will remain. Porbably the films greatest splurge is it's greatest flaw. Potter is just fine as the suffering wife, but this role could've been pulled off by anyone with breasts and a good pair of lungs. Glover hams it up as the cliché ridden obsessive cop while Elwes, at times cringe-inducing, overacts to the point of melodrama, though not helped by a script hampered with dire exchanges and misplaced dialogue. The central plot work well enough, and if the film had been perhaps somewhat improvised with an unknown cast (as in 'The Blair Witch Project) it could've brought a heightened sense of realism from which the film certainly would've benefited. The set pieces (with creepy masks and terrifying weapons aplenty) and premise are terrifying enough on their own, it's a shame we're drawn out of this by hammy acting and plot holes that don't stand up to repeat viewings.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"pacing is a problem, visuals are not!","I wont add a review of the films storyline as i would presume most people visiting this page have seen it, however i will concentrate on other aspects of the film. One thing that annoyed me was the pacing of the film, and a common problem of a lot of films-slow middle third. The film opens at breakneck pace, bombarding us with images and the merest of back story. When the film reaches it's middle third, it is mainly told in flashback, which is maybe not even needed for this type of film, this would enhance our fears and our attachment to the characters predicament instead of giving us choices in deciding if we feel sympathy for them. i am not all out for gore and torture, but if the film begins in this quick edited, quick visual style then when it slows down it becomes very apparent(whereas a film like Se7en, keeps pretty much the same tempo throughout) and hinders the films style. As has been said Cary Elwes is very poor in this movie, and his performance really spoils the dark oppressive nature of the film. Visually, although MTV style in parts, is very impressive. The torture scenes are more suggestive than you think, and looking back you realise how little actual gore you have seen, but thanks to some great production design and editing you are jolted into feeling real sympathy for the victims. Despite a few flaws this is still an excellent entry to the the thriller/horror genre and refreshing to see that it doesn't resort to any sly winking at the audience. I could see elements of Fulci and Argento in there, so it can't be all that bad!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"sick and weird, yes, but also fascinating","I have watched this movie with a mixture of fascination and disgust. The plot is quite intelligent and although I guessed who it was from the beginning, it still surprised me in the end. Nasty twist there.But what bothers me - apart from all the gore and the unnecessarily bloody details - is this: How sick must a mind be to think up a plot like this ? Go see a shrink Mr. Wan, please.Of the 10 possible points I immediately deduct 8 for unnecessarily violent and gory pictures. And another one for the ghastly music. The intelligence of the plot and the astonishing fact that I didn't turn it off after the first few minutes and actually watched it to the end merit 5 stars. And I have to add another one for the even more astonishing fact that I do not totally discount the possibility of ever watching it again.So, all in all, this is the most points I have ever given a horror movie (excepting The Fog of course). And I still wonder why.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Still good!,"While you can nowadays notice the limitations of a budget Wan and Whannell had to work with, fact remains that Saw is still a great thriller/horror movie with plot that keeps you interested from it's confusing beginning to it's shocking end. Gruesome scenes aren't just thrown in for the shock value like in later entries and the whole investigation process really grips you and doesn't let go. However, when I watched the movie for the first time, I thought action scenes are really far-fetched and out of place and I still think that they are, but even so, ""Saw"" is still a great movie that I recommend to everyone who can stomach it! 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It was a masterpiece in its time,"Areh, which was prepared with a budget of less than 1,200,000 dollars, went on to sell 103 million dollars in the world. A figure that placed ""Saw"" behind ""Scream"" in the second place of the most profitable horror films in history. Since the film's initial budget was only $700,000 and the shooting time had to be completed in less than 18 days, James Wan's hand was not open to taking many impressions. He only had the opportunity and budget to get a few takes from each actor. As a result, although Wan initially intended to make ""Saw"" in the form of Hitchcock's filmmaking, but since playing Hitchcock does not work in short and tight filming schedules, the final result is a film that is crooked and dark due to lack of time. And it looks messy and messy. Something that was not the intention of the creators at all and happened out of compulsion. Although James Wan himself later said that this film was not exactly what he had in mind, the interesting point is that the atmosphere of ""Saw"" is one of the best parts of the film, which became one of the signatures of the series. That is, the subsequent creators of the sequels not only did not improve the chaotic and low-budget state of the first film with their larger budgets, but also stuck to it. The only movie that did not stay true to the appearance of ""Saw"" is ""Jigsaw"", which happened to be criticized for this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Breathes new life into domestic horror,"In a time of tired gore and predictable thrillers that are anything but thrilling, Saw brings youthful creativity and exuberance that has long been missing from the genre.Equal amounts of time are spent in a claustrophobic bathroom and in flashbacks that give context to their predicament. The aesthetic choices made by James Wan recall the spare, grating minimalism of Cube, the frenzied cinematography of The Cell, and the dark grit of Se7en. These elements are masterfully combined to create an altogether immersive, disturbing feel. The protagonists are largely straight men, but manage to come off with some type of depth. The psychopath, while not really a developing character, is brilliantly conceived. He places his victims in situations designed to make them decide (or perhaps realize) how much they want to live. In a sense, the serial killer is something of a apolitical Tyler Durden. At one point in the film we are acquainted with someone who survived one of his orchestrated tests. Cognitive dissonance has brought her to 'appreciate' what the psychopath did to her. At the same time, it's not entirely clear that in the absence of the experience she would be better off. Brilliant!Wan has gone beyond Rob Zombie's boring caricatures of inbred southerners, beyond gimmicky blair witch devices. He's created a singularly engaging film that breathes new life into domestic horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Most Intriguing & Beautifully Done Thrillers I've Seen,"I've seen so many horror and thriller type movies. I love to be scared. What I love even more is a thriller that has a real psychological element to it as ""Saw"" does. The premise is amazing and was well thought out. The cinematography is beautiful. There's a gritty, over-processed look that lends to the fear that exists in this one room. Although, I had to watch the entire franchise to really get inside the psychological mindset of the perpetrator, the original ""Saw"" is a masterpiece in itself. It's an epic thriller that can stand on it's own without the sequels if it had to. I actually wasn't even going to see it, originally, but was brought to see it my someone else. I would have missed out on one of my favorite movies. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys their heart racing as they sit on the edge of their seat to see what happens next. Of course, you have to enjoy the creep factor as well. This definitely isn't some teenager scream fest; it's above and beyond that.

A gore filled mystery,SAW is a movie that isn't big on the overall budget for locations but that actually works for the movie as the eerie bathroom sets a perfect view into a horror series that will send a shiver down your spine. the cast was a lot of unknown actors but they prove that an experience of being kidnapped is terrifying and A list actor like Lethal Weapon star Danny Glover as a detective completely obsessed with the jigsaw case he brought a new dynamic element to the story. I personally found that the original SAW was a unique story with some great new gory elements which would set up the future of the entire franchise.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but not completely satisfying,"James Wans ""Saw"" is best described as a psycho thriller with some elements of horror movies. The name suggests a hack-and-slash ""ten-teenies-and-a-killer-in-a-house-movie"" but it absolutely isn't. Althougth it isn't a great movie, it still has it good and bad sides. Let's take a closer look.The movie begins good when Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) find themselves in a room, chained by one foot. In the middle of them is a dead body, with a gun and a little tape recorder next to it. Both find a tape in their trousers pocket. When they play it, a creepy voice sets Dr. Gordon for a choice. If he doesn't kill Adam within eight hours, his woman and little daughter will be killed.Then Dr. Gordon recognises the situation. The moment when they discover they are victims of a serial killer who likes to do sadistic psycho logic experiments told by flashbacks of the victims is thrilling and reminds me strongly of Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"". The main theme of this experiments is, how far would you go to save your own life? The way the victims react in the different situation is very realistic because it represents pure fear and so humanity. Moreover did the custom designer a awesome job by making the bad guys mask. It can be described as defying, sadistic and evil, which perfectly suits the content of his experiments.But then, there are a view scenes which don't add anything to the whole story and contains crappy acting. The middle of the film feels like they rushed through it and never shot a single scene twice. This is a sin, because the starting of the movie promised much and I was expecting the same fear-factor in the next three quarters.The ending compensates this a bit. There are a few scenes which are very realistic. The faces of terror and the disturbing footage gives us a good impression of mens will to survive or their will to protect their loved ones. However, the last scene isn't satisfying and logic at all. It gives you the feeling that the script writer hadn't enough time to finish it properly.This movie isn't bad, but it deserved more then 18 days of filming and such a low budget. When they had chosen to use an ending with a little bit more logic and if they had discovered the benefit of crossing out some scenes in the middle of the movie during the cutting process, this movie could be one of the best in it's genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Very Good Thriller,"This movie is the best and most exciting serial killer movie that i've ever seen. It starts with two guys stuck in a very dirty bathroom. One of them is a doctor and the other one is a photographer. There is also a dead guy in the room with them in a lot of blood with a gun in one of his hands and a tape recorder in his other hand. Both men are tied up in chains and are given two saws but are meant for them to cut their feet off not the chains. The doctor soon realizes that it's the jigsaw killer that put both of them in the room to solve a puzzle. Then there is a flashback to other victims like one who has to crawl through a lot of barb wire to get out of a room, another with a man who has to figure out the combination to safe and the combination is on the wall but he has a candle but the stuff on the wall is flammable and he is walking on glass.

An original and smart thriller/horror film,"I rented Saw last night and got to watch it today. It is very rare for me to like horror films because mostly all of them are pretty bad but Saw wasn't one of them. It was a huge thrill ride all the way till the end and never kept me from being bored. The whole idea of this movie about a deranged killer who plays a game which other people are involved who have to play the game to survive out of the terrible situations this serial killer puts them through. It just blew my mind how original and smart the movie was. The only negative I can give to this movie is that in some scenes, the acting was a little careless and were offbeat from the movie.

Every Peace Has A Puzzle,"Well, I was really expecting this movie to make me think, and it did not. I expected a very amazing ending, and to me the ending is linear, boring, and predictably disappointing. The acting was terrible, in fact some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. It feels like the story had potential but lacked creativity, so lapses into predictability all the time. And yes it does feel like a rip off.It's disappointing to me, because I love Danny Glover, and I loved the possibilities, but it leaves us saying, ""okay... now what?"" ""what was the point?"" I thought it was a nice twist that Zep or Zap, whichever his name, was not the killer, but just another victim in the game. But, sadly, the story lacked any true depth, at least in my opinion.Some of the camera work was a lot of fun, nice effects there, and the caped man reminded me of the Allan Moore graphic novel hero from V for Vendetta interestingly enough... but, I wold have rather seen this microcosmic game effect a larger microcosmic level, and this movie sadly stays within the box.While I enjoyed Saw I and Saw 3 somewhat, I hated Saw 2, so was pleased when Saw 4 redeemed the series somewhat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Master of Suspense,"Intro:
""Saw"" is a masterfully made movie, and a film that understands building tension and keeping the audience in constant suspense.Pros:
This is a movie easily deserving of a spot up there with some of the best horror movies ever made. ""Saw"" has a shockingly original premise of two people chained in a bathroom. Being forced to either cut through their feet, or both die. The movie lives to it, by building tension to the point that you can't wait for the ending. And the twist ending satisfies. The movie is mostly set in one location, and I love one location movies, because it allows the writers to be creative. And while it doesn't stay in that location the entire time, it doesn't take away from the suspense. As the movie goes on, both of our main characters learn more about each other. And that there's more to it, then them just being there by chance.Cons:
The only issue I have with the film is the acting. The performances on the part of our two leads are pretty bad, they both have really bad reads. But I can forgive the film for it's big flaw.Conclusion:
I love ""Saw"". It's one of my favorite horror films. Many critics might call it a gore fest, but the film doesn't focus on the gore, it focuses on the story. It's interesting, it's suspenseful, and it's a great watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Oh come on... SHOOT HIM!!!,"Saw: two men trapped in a room, with 6 hours left to save a family in a ""Homo homini Lupus"" situation. And a serial Killer who likes to play with his victims. A cop (Danny Glover) chasing him. Probably not the most original plot in the history, but still an intriguing one. The killer's riddles are very interesting and well acted, and the story has some moments. BUT, and I'm very very tired of this... for God sake, if you have the killer in front of you, and your shotgun points towards him... look at him! shoot him! this film is full of this stupid clichés, evident sign of a poor script! There are so many bloopers in the film that is very difficult to count them! And they aren't simple bloopers like Pulp Fiction's hamburger's bite, they are real script awful errors! Hollywood' thrillers have had a great time some years ago, and Saw tries to renew this times... but with no ideas. At all. But if you think that the 007 cliché ""talk-before-kill"", and all this stupid script solutions... you might enjoy it. But I would not be so proud of.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Far more fascinating that you'd expect it to be,"Most horror films base their existence on having you jump in your seats a few times and then tie up the knots for an (at least fairly) happy ending. Saw doesn't follow that path. It wants you to squirm and dodge as it unveils a story that is far more fascinating that you'd expect it to be (or even want it to be). It is a completely unpleasant experience. And it is damn good.The filmmakers are two young Australians: James Wan in the director's seat and Leigh Whannell with the pen and one of the leads. The story is co-written by the two, both fresh out of film school. And the talent conveyed here is apparent from the word go. Wan directs with a delightful simplicity and realizes that creating good horror isn't about making as many things as possible unexplainable, but rather to leave them unexplained. There is a major difference.As Saw sets off, you get the feeling that if this material is handled well, you could be in for a treat. The premise is clever and simple: We meet two sympathetic characters trapped in an abandoned restroom, chained to the walls with a dead body between them. Their challenge is primarily to get out of there and secondarily to find out why they were put there. It is clear that what we're dealing with is a criminal mind who likes to play puzzles, but what are his motives? Who is he? Where are our protagonists at? And how are they going to get out of this predicament?Wan tells his story semi-chronologically - we simultaneously follow our two men's situations in their cell as the two think back on previous events in their lives in order to figure out the mystery. In style and form, Saw is somewhat like Memento, and Wan doesn't lack neither Christopher Nolan's grace nor cleverness. Throughout, the filmmakers avoid being tempted into making this into a simple splatter, a messy twister or just the down right silly horror you see in nine out of ten films in the genre. Whannell's script is creative and well-crafted and Wan keeps it interesting throughout. The horror is to a certain degree explicit, and Saw has its share of graphic images, but the real horror here is the gruesome and brutal nature of the story. It is offensive much in the same way as Pet Sematary was. And it doesn't change its nature to suit the viewer. A thoroughly autonomous, harrowing and artistically fulfilled piece of film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I urge you all to play the game!,"Based on a short film of the same name, Saw is now known as one of the most successful horror movies known to date. The story was very gripping and cleverly written and you couldn't wait to see what Jigsaw had up his sleeve, the characters were brilliant as the movie focused mainly on Lawrence and Adam who were played by the very talented Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell. The acting was brilliant and the cast made you believe their characters and the one scene that stood out to me was Amanda's Reverse Bear Trap with a brilliant performance from Shawnee Smith. The direction was fantastic and the cinematography was brilliant as it kept that eerie feeling that you weren't really safe. The script was cleverly written and the ending was such a surprise and it wasn't obvious which I love in a movie. The special effects were great and it doesn't let up on the blood or gore so if you're squeamish, you might not want to see this.Saw is one of the best horror movies I have seen for quite a while now and I think that it's brilliant. Everything from the music to the story is a scary thought and it manages to keep the realism that so many horror movies lack. I liked seeing the characters interact and working as a team to try and figure out and escape from the situation they were in. I believe that Saw is a very cleverly written and very gory horror movie with many twists and turns to keep you interested in the movie. Any movie fan who likes either a good story with twists or bloody and gory scare scenes would love this film. Armed with a clever story and script, a few good scares and a great ending, Saw really raises the bar for horror movies out there.

See saw,"The first and the best, Saw is bloody great fun. Two guys (Whannel) and the ever great character actor (Elwes) wake up in a decrepit washroom, chained up. Their reasons for being there become evident later as they try to figure an escape. On a mini tape recorder, is a dark, simulated voice we'll come to know as Jigsaw, much like Seven's John Doe, who makes his victims realizes of their actions, where a minute number of survivors appreciate life much more and the rightings of their wrongs. The story goes and forth to how to how they ended up in this mess, where we see some more examples of Jigsaw's work, the different ways their victims die, where they do have choices. Very violent this film is, that really questions censorship in this country, Saw has some uncomfortable moments of violence, but the movie has a lot of suspense and intrigue, plotted brilliantly as a first class horror thriller that rivals the superlative Seven. Elwes, such a great unappreciated character actor here, again doesn't disappoint, as an unfaithful doctor who's wife and daughter, neglected, become hostages in this game of Jigsaw's. We too have that creepy little guy from Person Of Interest as one of Jigsaw's accomplices, bringing a real creepy piece of work here, minding Elwes's family who will die if Elwes doesn't deliver. The most insane of choices has Elwes either shooting Whannel, to get the key to unlock the chain around his ankle or cut his own leg off, and you can pretty much guess from the title, Elwes preferance. Saw too has a great shock ending, and like all the Saw films, not a nice one. Whannel the writer of this, another good performer here, and James Wan have created a horror masterpiece, that will live on in cinema history for at least the next hundred years. One of Jigsaw's surviving victims in this, becomes another of his assistants too. Danny Glover is solid here too as the obsessed detective,while Monica Potter, no not Julia Roberts, is solid as Elwes's wife. For horror ala Seven fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It reminds me of teenagers sitting around and saying, ""Hey, I can think of a REALLY sick way for someone to die."" That's precisely what this film is - filmed sickness. That Cary Elwes and Danny Glover (Danny Glover for God's sakes!) are in this movie at all speaks, I can only assume, to economic distress on their parts.

"It's sick, but not slick","When this movie started it looked like it might be a gritty adrenaline pumping nail-biter. It opens well with two guys waking up prisoners in a room. How did they get there? Why are they chained to a wall on opposite sides of the room and who is the stiff in the middle of the room lying in a pool of blood.Sadly the film, which is innovative for the genre in several ways, lets itself down by some plodding performances, poor pacing, mediocre lighting and mirth inducing scenes where the action is sped up.So what's to like? The gory deaths are inventive and there's one effective suspense scene where a character illuminates his surroundings using a camera flash while searching for an intruder. I also liked the bizarre jaw breaking device which looked something out of an Edgar Alan Poe tale of Gothic horror. The obligatory twist ending did catch me completely by surprise and almost made me forgive the movie's shortcomings it was so well done! (oh - the score was good too - as was the acting by the younger prisoner who wakes up in the room at the start.)The movie shows a lot of potential so let's hope the director's next project has better performers, cinematography and tighter editing. To come up such innovative ideas in a genre that's this old means the creative force behind the movie certainly has more to offer.6 out 10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
First Saw is a smart horror/thriller. Sequels just torture porn.,"The quality of this series seriously declined as time went on, but this first film really does stand apart as being smarter and not simply a torture porn gore-fest. Similar to ""The Cube,"" this film has a can't resist premise of two men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) waking up in a dank disgusting basement, chained to the wall, with a dead body between them, and no idea how they got there or how to get out. This film, unlike the others, unfolds much more like a mystery, as the two men flashback to the events leading up to their imprisonment, while at the same time a team of police detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are hot on the trail of the madman who put them there. Even without the elaborate head-smashing traps and terrible choices, this would have been an exciting thriller. In some ways, the sensationalistic traps and terrible choices detract from the film, although I think it was those elements that really hooked audiences (that was the focus the the film's marketing at the time), but this entire film could have worked fine without that. However, the sequels seemed to almost exclusively focus on those extreme elements and the mystery and thriller elements took a backseat, which is why the subsequent films are nowhere as good as the first. This first film also stands out because it has a stronger cast than any of the sequels, which also includes Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Although this film is clearly going to be repellent for most audiences, it's undeniably compelling if you are a horror fan and can stomach the many stomach churning moments in the film.

Epic Thrill,This film has a well excecuted strong premise and leaves you on the edge of your seat for the entire duration.

A simple yet effective horror film,"Like many horror films, Saw was the film that started a franchise, and the first of many franchises started by James Wan. Saw had a simple premise where two men wake up chained to a wall and need to figure out why they were there. It was a short film premise expanded to a feature.Saw was a thriller as much as a horror film because there was a mystery driving the story. Because of the setting of the room and the non-linear approach Saw came across as the Reservoir Dogs of horror films.Saw was violent but the violence was used more sparingly than the later films and torture porn movement of the 2000s. The most notable moments were when someone got shot to pieces by a shotgun trap and when someone had to cut off his own leg.The film was edited like it was made by a crack addict because of the rapid cuts, but it did add to the intensity and to hide the budget, like during the film's 'car chase,'",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Culture of Morbidity. (spoilers),"If there is one thing that American filmmakers seem to possess little talent with these days, it's horror films, sometimes trying to replicate the unmatched genius of Japanese cohorts (although in this case, the reverse has happened with one segment of 'The Three Extremes' trying to copy 'Saw'). The result of which is often an abundance of amazingly bad remakes and other failed efforts, plenty of which were produced in the past five years alone.But 'Saw,' although not it's sequel (which refuses to experiment further in novel elements), actually manages to accomplish an effective amount of suspense. It may be the instincts of young Malaysian director, James Wan (who hails from Australia), who may have immersed himself in Asian horror film-making and therefore, fine-tuned his own craft accordingly.True, the story of a rather vigilante dying man who is ""playing god"" by personally endowing punishment on those who he believe is worthy of it is nothing new. Several of the psychopath tales, especially of psychopaths with sophisticated torture trials, has been done in the past quite a few number of times.Here, the Jigsaw (aka, the psychopath) has imprisoned two men (among others) and forces upon them an elaborate game whereby one must kill the other by a particular time or risk the death of his family. Despite the extremely grotesque show (made more acute by green tinting and Cary Elwes increasingly pale and almost zombie-like complexion), the undying suspense does not come from cheap scare tactics trying to reinvigorate bored audiences as say, films like The Ring does. Rather, it is all authentic suspense that continues with the never-ending action and uncertainty on-screen. The audio elements provide much of the thrill as well, particularly in the climax of the film where the men's screams are coupled with pounding overdrive chords and other arrangements intended to churn your stomach and get your heart racing just a little more.If you are in the mood for a good, American horror film, but are skeptical based on so many laughable and embarrassing productions to have come out in recent years, I would suggest giving this one a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Build Up,","Saw is a fantastic movie with a well developed plot and a great cast. The movie is definitely a horror, and it's not one of those ones that look scary but end up being disappointing. It is frightening and nothing for sensitive people, jam packed with gore, violence and suspenseful scenes from beginning to end.It does not have a whole lot of character development for David Tapp, which would be my biggest complaint. I get that he was a detective that we are not meant to learn much about, however, I think it would have added so much to the movie if they gave Danny Glover more big moments to shine.Jigsaw is a brilliant character and will leave your with goosebumps all the way through. The movie's build up is fantastic, I will not spoil what happens for anyone who has not seen it, but once you finally get to it, you will not be disappointed.A thrill from beginning to end.

Extreme?  Don't make me laugh,"I'll get right to the real reason I hate this film, which is not necessarily because of the concept, the acting, the directing, or a lack of genuine scares. I hate it because it convinced a bunch of idiot kids that they had seen the gut-wrenching of the gut-wrenching when it came to horror films, when they have in fact seen only this, the whitewashed version.I have heard a lot about how ""original"" the movie concept was. It's not. There were dozens of movies with ""everyone plays everyone else"" themes made before this, many of better conceived. I've also heard a lot about how intriguing the villain was. Persosnally, I can't believe they have now made five full-length films centered around this fellow. He's nothing special; Michael Myers and Norman Bates are more frightening, Regan MacNeil and Damien are more shocking, and Annie Wilkes, Jack Torrance, Lord Summersisle and Hannibal Lecter are all more psychologically mind-numbing.But more than anything, it bothers me that people have the gall to refer to this as ""extreme cinema."" It tries very hard to be, but it fails; the director and writers are too afraid of what the censors might do to them, and it shows. Saw would be fine and marketable as a good watch on Halloween, but this effort I've seen to paint it as some kind of horrific moral treatise is downright insulting.Cannibal Holocaust is extreme cinema. Salo is extreme cinema. Mondo Cane is extreme cinema. Irreversible is extreme cinema. In the Realm of the Senses is extreme cinema. Requiem for a Dream is extreme cinema.

Throws in every single genre cliché imaginable,"Saw (2004) C-100 min. D: James Wan. Leigh Whannel, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Mike Butters, Michael Emerson, Monica Potter, Ned Bellamy. The millionth serial killer movie since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS throws in every single genre cliché imaginable (how many times are the main character's wife and daughter going to be threatened in a movie like this?) not to mention surprisingly bad acting (except Glover) and an twist that is obvious from the opening minute. A doctor and a photographer are chained to pipes on opposite ends of a filthy torture chamber, victims of the Jigsaw, a serial killer who plays games in order for his victims to kill each other. Of course, the doctor's family has been taken hostage and time is of the essence. More gruesome than scary, with the all-too-familiar Hollywood shootout climax (isn't this supposed to be an independent film?) but there are some tense moments here and there. RATING: 5 out of 10.

Clichéd Script and Unlikable Characters Sink this Un-scary Film,"*1/2 out of ****Two men, a doctor and a photographer, wake up in the most disgusting bathroom in a dank underground Cavern. They are chained to the wall and have mad the gross discovery of finding a dead body in the room with them. They soon find out that they have been kidnapped and have to play a game in which the doctor must kill the photographer or the kidnapper will kill his wife and child. Soon they begin to collect clues and information about each other, but will they be able to escape, not only with their lives, but with the doctor's family's? The concept of this film is scary. The ideas are somewhat clever. Unfortunitely, those two things are the only things that are able to carry this film. And thankfully, they carry them a long way, but not through to the end, sadly.This could have been forgivable if we were to care about the characters, but we can't. These kind of films should have more character development, but instead, SAW pushes that aside and layers the film with buckets of blood and guts, neither of which particularly grossed me out since we, again, could care less about the characters, especially the photographer(Leigh Whannell) who goes over the top to make the viewers surprised that the doctor(Cary Elwes) doesn't immediately murder him.Speaking of which, the normally brilliant Cary Elwes doesn't do well here. He begins too wooden and then tries to be emotional and then gets even more wooden and it just doesn't work. However, I understand that if an actor is British and must switch to doing an American accent, it won't be easy. It wasn't easy for him, and it won't be easy on the audience when he begins doing unrealistic whining noises as he and Leigh are getting chopped to pieces! What wreaks the film the most are the amount of flashbacks that occur nonstop and detract from the plot. The film could have been a good grisly time, despite the flaws, if it just centered on the one room that the two men are tortured in. The flashbacks are annoying and feel like an excuse to just talk about the killer and his sick ways, which eventually accidentally turn themselves into plot devices.However, the film, despite being really bad, has good points. The plot is intriguing, and the violent torture acts are great fun for gore fans. At one point, a woman forces herself to cut open a man's stomach and find a key to unlock the door in his intestines. And the last fifteen minutes of the film is a create montage of disturbing insanity and depravity that I must recommend to those who like sick stuff. And the twist ending works great and really ends the film with a disgusting BANG!!! The bad out weighs the good this time, but for those looking for a lot of grisly violence will have a good time here. The film manages to just about deliver the gore, but the film has a long way to go to being as good and gory as SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I hope they get it right next time.Rated R for strong grisly violence and language",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great idea...but flawed.,"SAW is without a doubt one of the most original horror movies I have seen in a long while.It starts off simple. Two guys who, at first, seem to have no connection to each other wake up in a squalid industrial bathroom. They are chained to either side of the room, and a dead body lies between them clutching a Dictaphone and a revolver. Using clues that their kidnapper has left for them to find they soon figure out what is happening. They are the victims of a known ""serial killer"" called Jigsaw. One man is a surgeon with a family, and his mission is to kill the other guy in order to save his and his own families life. But chained to a wall how is he going to get to him? With the help of a rusty hacksaw that seems only to be able to cut through flesh and not metal.From here we are greeted with a series of flashbacks that explain just how Jigsaw works. Here's the original part: Jigsaw isn't actually a serial killer. He has not killed anyone directly. Instead he puts his victims into a situation where they have a chance of living. They are given a task. If they complete it, then they go free. If they don't, then they die. I won't go into too much detail but some of the ways his victims suffer are very gory indeed.This movie keeps you guessing right up until the end, and even then it knocks you for six with an ending I don't think anyone saw coming.Now come the flaws. Ten out of ten for the idea and the set up of the idea, but the film is let down by, at times, appalling acting, sketchy dialogue and THE worst car chase I have ever seen committed to screen. Sadly you can tell when watching this movie when the budget started to stretch, and from there on it goes downhill, but the surprise ending makes up for some of it.If you like mystery films and gory horror then this is a must see, but don't expect too much of the acting. Ten out of ten for the idea, but only seven out of ten for the final product. Entertaining, but not outstanding.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A lot of excitement at the end,"Production and direction teams lost themselves a great chance to win more than an Oscar or at least nominees.The story of the movie is great and new. The movie starts with 2 strange guys finding themselves alone in filthy bathroom without knowing how they could get there? . And one of them is required to kill the other before a specified time or he will lose his wife and little child.The movie contains some hard and violent contents but they really serve the idea. The movie also has a great and wondering end more than you can imagine. The soundtrack may seem to be hesitating and lowerfull but Charlie Clouser the composer ended the movie with a master piece (Hello Zepp).These are some good things about the movie. What about the drawbacks. The acting of the 2 main characters (Bathroom guys) was more than awful. And really am sorry to say that (Total Crap). I think they paid everyone of them only 100 $. The makers of this movie lost themselves good chance cause the script is really good.. An idea of a movie like this would put under pressure to get the best of your acting. For me i am not professional of this part but i didn't like the direction of the photography. Moving between some frames was awful. The decoration seems also to be so cheap and poor. Dany Glovar was not that awake and free minded as always but anyways he put some taste to the movie.The movie went so boring for me until the last 20 minutes it turned out to be a master piece.Finally this movie deserves to watch it even it has drawbacks as mentioned before.And Thanx for Listening""Some PPl Are so ungrateful to be Alive""",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fairly effective, but more a collection of original ideas than an original movie as a whole...","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsTwo complete strangers, a doctor (Cary Elwes) and an apparent waster (Leigh Wannell) awaken to find themselves in a brightly lit room chained by the foot in close proximity to each other. They soon find they have been placed there by a sadistic psychopath who wants one to kill the other in a battle to come out alive. As they sit around waiting for their time to run out, the doctor starts recalling in flashback events that may have possibly led up to their present predicament, the waster does the same and before long they are piecing things together as their sanity gradually deteriorates that lead up to a shattering final revelation. Whilst recounting events, the doctor also leads onto a story of a detective (Danny Glover) who became obsessed with hunting the killer down and may still be playing a part in events as they speak...There is one original angle of how the killer isn't technically really a killer after all and there are some interesting slants on how he selects his victims, but the movie as a whole actually borrows ideas from other, superior movies. Many have compared it to Se7en, but I actually think it has more in common with movies such as Cube (the concept of them waking up in an unfamiliar place with no idea how they got there!) and Phone Booth with the killers reasons for selecting those particular people.It's a fairly slick effort, genuinely suspenseful and with a great central performance from Elwes, not to mention having a well developed plot. But it's downfall is that it has aspirations of being a really high concept film when really for the most part, it's ironic that the killers name is 'Jigsaw' since that's what it's really like in terms of piecing all the bits it's stole from better movies together. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's different, and watchable because of it","I will admit I have spent the past ten years or so developing a healthy intolerance for the modern thriller/horror movie. Gone are the days of movies like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (I'm talking about the original here) where we never actually saw Leatherface run the chainsaw through any of his victims... the true horrors were left to our imagination, the scariest place of all. No, it's all been replaced with buckets of fake blood and CGI heads exploding or whatever in the name of ""realism"".So it's a pleasure to finally come across a movie that actually has the ability to creep into your mind and tell you something, staying with you after the credits begin rolling, rather than cheating you out of the admission fee by hacking up random bystanders for the sake of gore.As a movie, Saw covers little or no new ground but it teaches us chilling lessons about ourselves, about life, about other people around us and how what we do with our lives will eventually come back to face us one way or another. You don't get that from your average serial killer movie; not even those that supposedly develop the character of the killer and make you feel like there might be a method behind his madness. The motives of ""the Jigsaw killer"" are out in plain view; his victims are punished for disrespecting their own lives by being placed in situations where they must endure the worst just to get out. In doing so, they find a new appreciation for the life that they have... at least, that's the idea.The greatest thing about Saw is the way the story all comes together at the end. Of course, I'm not going to spoil it by revealing any details but even if you, like I did, find the first half of the movie laborious and the acting by most of the cast teetering on B-movie quality, there are no plot holes left and nothing but a very real sense of knowing exactly why it all happened the way it did.Saw is not mind-blowingly brilliant, but it goes in a very different direction to every other piece of trash Hollywood has turned out lately with the tag ""thriller"" or ""horror""... and for that reason alone, I found it worth the skepticism I swallowed when I finally decided to rent the DVD after purposely missing the cinematic release.Watch this movie expecting to be thinking about it - and yourself - long after it's over.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

a great yet flawed thriller,"When two men who seem to have nothing in common find themselves trapped in one of the worst bathrooms, (one that rivals the toilet from trainspotting), they come to realise they are at the hands of the serial killer Jigsaw. The irony of Jigsaw is that he isn't really a killer; he hasn't killed anyone. Instead he sets up 'games' which will either kill the victim or they have to fight to survive. Adam and Dr. Gordon are chained either side of the room and in between them is a dead body. Not long after they find their messages from Jigsaw and the game has started. The aim of this game is for Dr. Gordon to kill Adam before 6 o'clock; if not his wife Alison and daughter Diana will die. There are clues everywhere for them to escape, they have to figure out the clues to survive.The idea behind Saw is great. It's twisted, macabre but overall its a step away from the mainstream thrillers. The idea though was brought from the draw back of having a small budget, yet stripping it back to a simple one location and a small cast makes to more focused and the concept can flourish for it. You can see though that there is a mix from other films that have influenced Saw. The killer teaching people the preciousness of life; Seven. People waking in a strange location and need to figure out how to escape; Cube. People thrown into a situation to fight for their lives at the cost of other lives; Battle Royale. Though Saw has a very solid foundation, it does have its flaws, which does effect the overall impact.The acting is the least desirable factor. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover are so way under par; its nowhere near their best job. Danny seemed really rigid and Cary was to over the top in the more dramatic scenes. Being his first major role, you can see Leigh Whannell doesn't have a lot of acting experience yet he still does alright. Monica Potter while having a minor role just walks through the steps without much enthusiasm.The intensity of Saw has a problem of keeping it at a constant pace. There are times when the intensity blows through the roof and you find your hand is searching for something to grip onto; Amanda cutting into a mans guts to find the key to her head trap and Paul stuck in the razor wire trap are very intense, but then it falls flat and takes awhile before it starts to pick up again. The feel of Saw though is very dark and bleak. There isn't that sense of hope that lies within many thrillers. All the games that are quickly looked upon in flash back are some of the most macabre situations ever. Though it would have been so much better if they were developed and fleshed out more; adding more dimension to the world of Jigsaw, instead of the quick glances.The biggest problem with Saw is due to the small shooting schedule that James Wan had. He had only eighteen days of shooting and not a lot of time in post production. Give that if he had more time, he could have made those touch up and been able to fine tooth the over all product. Yet credit has to be given to Wan and Whannell for getting this done on such a short schedule and a small budget.Though it has its flaws, Saw is still a great watch. It has one of the best twists that comes right out of left field and punches you so hard that it resonates in your mind for days.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
See Saw,"It is understandable that when people think about the Saw franchise now, images appearing as snuff and torture cloud their minds. Speaking from someone who has seen the first, second, and final film of the franchise, I can definitely see where the series began and how differently it ended. To me, it was a film that could've stood perfectly on its own. It never needed a sequel, let alone six, leaching off of its coattails.After the astonishing success of the first film, grossing over one hundred million at the box office, it almost became a yearly tradition to release a Saw sequel around Halloween. Hollywood had successfully turned Saw, a suspenseful and intriguing psychological thriller, into a shameless, inept cash-in for the season of fright.At least we have the first film to remind us that this series was once destined for greatness. The film begins with Adam (Whannell), a voyeuristic photographer and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes), an oncologist, awaking in a dilapidated basement to find that they are chained at the ankle to opposite ends of the room, with a bloody corpse in the middle of them. They find that they each have tape-recordings that, when played, reveal the ominous voice of our antagonist. Call him the ""Jigsaw Killer."" He informs them that they have, in some way, taken life for granted and that Dr. Gordon must kill Adam in six hours to be set free.Meanwhile, the film is intercut with scenes of detectives trying to piece together the explicit tracks left by this notorious killer. He is constantly kidnapping people who take life for granted and have it all, but choose to dispose of it in a careless, unorthodox manner. A drug addict woman and a man who enjoys inflicting self-harm on himself are among his victims. Detectives David Tapp (Glover) and Steven Sing (Leung) continue to breathlessly map out his killings and try to figure out where his notorious tapes are being shot. The Jigsaw Killer, himself, is obviously a real person, but is voiced through a creepy puppet with stringy black hair, swirly red cheeks, and always riding on a tricycle.The film knows how to create atmosphere effectively. Many scenes are unsettling, but I found the most fun to come out of the scenes between Adam and Dr. Gordon. Saw compliments my rule of claustrophobic filmmaking perfectly which is, when you limit characters geographically you must make up for it with dialog and subtleties to properly convey tone and development. Both Elwes and Whannell do great justice to their roles and play them convincingly, and the flashback scenes never seem to derail the film or make it stumble without direction.I feel some have written off the film as being ""too gory,"" when in reality, Saw doesn't have as much as gore as I remember. It's more of a clever, tricky, psychological thriller perfectly complimented style and dialog. The last five minutes of the film are fabulous, and don't become winded and lazy. It actually becomes quite mysterious, brutal, and above all, intriguing, with the intro to the credits being actually somewhat depressing. This is a well-written horror film, reminding us that PG-13 can't do justice to the genre physically or mentally.Starring: Leigh Whannell, Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, and Tobin Bell.

One of The Greatest Horror Thrillers ever,"I've only just watched this film for the first time and am just realizing now on what I missed out on all of these years. It's quite simply fantastic. The casting is excellent and the story had my full attention from start to finish. It has the scare factor of a horror film, but also provides the mental stimulation of a murder mystery . Seeing as the movie was produced in 2004 this seems to have triggered the publics interest in escape rooms. The movies twists and turns all work well right up to the end. I've heard that the sequels following this one aren't as good but I will certainly explore them to form my own opinion.One thing I will critique about the movie was it's marketing. When I was younger I wasn't particularly into horror movies as jump scares without plots didn't really do much for me. I had impressions that this movie was just another one of those horror movie, but as I said I've learned that it's so much more than that . The ""Saw"" aspect is such a small part and even the picture of the cut off foot as the cover photo probably doesn't capture the extent to all that's included in this spectacular movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A more Brutal Phonebooth,"Saw is essentially about a man who captures his victims based on their lack of appreciation of life. In Phonebooth the killer bases his victims on their lack of appreciation towards their spouses. Both killers play a ""game"" or test their victims and if they pass they are set free. The difference between the two is the amount of gore presented in each movie (SAW being the ""gorier"" of the two).The movie goes back and fourth in time slowly revealing what the real story between the two main characters is and obviously, near the end, the identity of the killer. This is done with great style and perfect pacing that doesn't leave the audience shifting in discomfort. The killers way of ""testing' his victims is very creative thus keeping the audience interested as long as you are not queasy. It's disturbingly pleasurable. However, at some points in the movie the acting - especially that of the doctor - is somewhat questionable. It was rare, but I sometimes found myself not quite convinced of the character's emotions. But beyond that, 95 % of the time, you really do fear and feel for the two men. There was also one scene where you hear the doll laugh and that didn't quite have the effect I think the director wanted. This is probably what separates Phonebooth and Saw. Throughout Phonebooth you are in constant fear for Colin Farell's character and the acting is superb. There are just a few glitches in Saw that aren't present in Phonebooth.In all I recommend Saw for anyone who is a Horror buff or is interested in psychopaths like yours truly.

There are plenty of surprises and twists, but I felt uneasy throughout the movie and that grew to disgust and by the time the movie ended I just plain hated it.

Great watch for horror fans,"I assume that today most people that like watching films know about the Saw franchise. After watching the franchise while at a young age, I decided to give it another shot with a fresh mind, and much more knowledge (about life and the films).I'll cut straight to the point. I like the Saw franchise. It has its share of fails as the franchise progressed, but I like how all the films connect in the end. Anyway, let's focus on the first film of the series.A low-budget B-movie turns out to be a great watch for horror fans.Saw (2004)focuses on two mundane characters with their share of secrets: Dr. Gordon and Adam, the private photographer, as they have just waken up in a small room trapped to pipes by large chains in their ankles.The film is graphic, and the characters' acting is good in giving you the chills. At the time this film came out, some people criticized the screenplay. Now, 17 years later, I get their point. Some scene segments are kinda all over the place, like a compilation of quick 2-second shots, and some spinning shots. It can become nauseating. Films likeSe7en (1995)proved that you can cause thrill without those effects.The film's plot is good. It is not convoluted at all if you consider only this film. We know by now that, as the series progressed, the plot became somewhat convoluted. But put yourself in my shoes and consider only this picture: a serial-killer murders people based on how little he thinks those people cherish life. The keyword here is ""he thinks."" Remember, this is the first installment, and we know nothing. The information we have is that the serial-killer wants people to reconsider their life choices, but his motives towards Gordon and Adam are, at least, questionable. Maybe, he is only a self-pretentious person who thinks he is the ultimate heavenly judge.With some minor complaints, I would definitely recommend this film. I'm sure some people won't like it, especially because of its slow pace and psychological thrill, but people who like or accepts horror will enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Why do I mention Se7en a lot you may ask??? Well, this movie is often compared to Se7en or called ""the best psychological thriller since Se7en."" Let me just say this, Saw is ripoff of Se7en. The killer's motives and method of dispatch are almost identical. There is a major difference, though, Se7en is a thrilling masterpiece. Saw is nothing but an average at best thriller that doesn't really go anywhere or provide any decent twists or thrills.The basic plot is this: we open with two guys chained in a bathroom. They have absolutely no idea where they are or who the other person is. Neither do we. Slowly, we unravel who they are and what they're doing there. Through a series of flashbacks we discover more about the killer and some of his victims.People may ask why I don't really like this movie and I always give them these reasons:1. The acting is terrible. I hate to be picky but there was no one in this movie that could really act.2. The annoying MTV feel the movie had. The editing was sloppy and quick, accompanied by MTV style rock music and lots of flashing which really got on my nerves.3. It was nowhere near as original as claimed. Se7en anyone?4. The gaping plot holes (which I won't go into because they contain spoilers and there is nothing worse than spoiling a movie).5. Although people like to think it is gory, the gore is very minimal.However the movie did keep me fairly entertained and it wasn't a complete waste but I felt this movie had extreme potential to be a classic.2½/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw,"6/10 - I'm not sure if this modern horror classic deserves all of the reverence it gets, but it makes for an interesting enough one time viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A flawed classic, 20 years on.","I got through most of the Saw sequels around this time last year, watching them for the first time and largely enjoying them, even though they're heavily flawed in many ways. It felt fitting, then, to revisit the first, which I hadn't seen in about a decade. Whether I go through and watch all the sequels again, I'm not sure. Probably not on my own, as I feel like they'd be more fun to watch with people, much like the Fast and Furious series.This first movie is also flawed in some ways, like the sequels, but I really respect what they were able to do with a budget that barely exceeded $1 million. The sets are all very limited, and you can tell in some of the chase scenes that they didn't have much room to play around with. I think the only time it's laughably bad is when they didn't have the budget to do a proper car chase and they try to show fast-moving cars that obviously aren't moving. It's also kind of charming, in all honesty. The same goes for some of the melodramatic acting. You kind of just accept it as part of the Saw series.It was fun watching this knowing how it ended (the final couple of scenes are still such an adrenaline rush), and seeing some seeds sown for later films was also fun. There are lots of moving parts to Saw, and though it's a little choppy at times, they all collide rather spectacularly by the time the film comes to an end. It's such a simple set-up, too, and instantly engaging. Plenty of suspense, even on a second viewing, and I do quite love how tasteful this is violence-wise compared to the other films. Not that I'm squeamish; it's more just that the over-the-top gore gets old after a while, whereas the intricate plots and unceasing plot shake-ups never do.I love Saw when it's being a soap opera with non-stop twists the writers have to keep juggling. It's so entertaining how convoluted it all gets. And though the series got more violent, that hyperactive melodrama was set in stone right from the start, and I like when the sequels double down on all that wonderful goofiness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"IF you're dissapointed with recent thrillers, this is what you're looking for!","For years now i've been a fan of the horror/thriller genre but have been extremly dissapointed with any and all of the releases this genre has offered in the last half decade.  I had the great fortune of catching a screening of ""SAW"" recently at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and must say it has fully restored my confidance that the ability to create a movie with the ability to make people lose sleep is still alive and well.  James Wan has done a masterful job at keeping any and all viewers on the edge of their seats from begining to end and if you're easily scared or even the slightest bit jumpy you definatly won't be able to handle ""SAW""!!!

"An experiment, and a mostly successful one at that","This is without a hint of doubt the most sadistic film I've seen in quite some time... possibly in all of my life. Quite cynical, as well, if not beating the DC ending of The Butterfly Effect at that. Being an independent film that aims high(possibly too high?), it has to cut a few corners to make due... a chase is filmed with only two angles, to give a quick example. The plot is interesting, as is the way it develops(if not particularly original). The film opens with a 'bang'... not unlike Dawn of the Dead, which I saw the day before this. However, unlike aforementioned horror masterpiece, in this film, it's not particularly effective... I found myself not being terribly interested in it. That says a lot... when a film manages to lose you before it has actually begun. The main difference is that in aforementioned film, it creeps up on you, slowly drawing you into the terrifying world, creating atmosphere... here, it just throws you into the situation, as if pushed into a cell. I'm quite certain this was intentional, but it just shows director James Wan's (disturbing?)lack of faith in renowned cinematic values, such as build-up and mood. You can't create terror just by showing a situation, you have to build up to it. And you can't expect the mood to come from seeing a person in a room in any given situation... you have to create that. Create. Something Wan doesn't seem too good at(except for, of course, sadistic, cynical scenes and machines). The pacing is somewhat daft, the film loses momentum half-way through. The acting is half-decent, but that's easily explained... take one look at the Trivia page for the film: ""The rehearsal takes were actual footage for the film"". So, Wan not only disregards established values of film-making, he also underestimates the importance of solid acting, which has a grounding in thorough rehearsing? It's no secret to anyone who's ever acted that if you're unsure of your lines or how the person you act opposite will react to them, your performance is hurt by it. The special effects are solid. The cinematography is lazy, but usually works. Too few shots result in a dull pace for much of the film, and a sense of watching a movie, rather than experiencing it. The stylized tone is overdone at times, producing a noisy and visually assaulting final product. The characters are well-written and credible, and much of the psychology in the film is quite accurate, something which is definitely to Wan's credit, presumably Whannel's(Leigh, co-writer) too. Something not to their credit is that the film breaks quite a few of the rules it establishes. I realize that few movies manage to avoid this entirely, but this one just breaks too many to let it go. I can't point them out here, as they spoil important parts of the film... but I doubt anyone will miss them, even on the first viewing, even if they aren't looking. Then there's how the film seems to take place in our 'world', with a fair amount realism... but there are details that just don't work out for real, that are too cartoon-y. A blade pops out of a character's sleeve at one point. Yes. Seriously. Think Kroenen from Hellboy. Very cartoon-y. It was in that film, too, but that was a comic book movie. This (supposedly) isn't. The film relies heavily on twists, gaining almost all of the thrills from this. The biggest has to do with the identity of Jigsaw, and it's practically the easiest one to figure out, though I must admit I did not see the final twist coming, and there were some surprises, due to fairly good execution in that area by Wan. The twists, obviously, lose all effect on subsequent viewings(I've only seen it once, but I have no desire to do so again, plus, a friend who highly recommended I watch it watched alongside me, and didn't seem to enjoy his second viewing in the least). Yes, I know, I know... that was the main shortcoming of several, if not most, of Hitchcock's pictures as well... but he did keep people guessing and entertained throughout the films. Compare this to Psycho and you'll see that it's no contest. Wan may possess some talent, but he lacks experience. Come on, James... prove you've got more than a somewhat perverted mind, a partiality for sadism and a truckload of cynicism. Writing is fair, with somewhat dubious plot points, too many repetitions and dialog that is almost painfully bad at times. All in all, the film is a mostly successful experiment in film-making... but that's the problem, only 'mostly'. When you mess with values in film-making, you need something solid to keep it going... Memento had it. This film doesn't. The film is entirely based on the theme of fighting to survive, the self-preservation instinct, something I like to use a lot in my short films as well, but a theme even I realize you can't base a whole film on. You need more. Oh, and then there's the idea of nearly dying to start appreciating your life... again, kind of thin. The old ""you don't know what you've got until it's gone"" isn't enough to drive a whole feature. It should be noted that the film contains quite a lot of gore, very graphic stuff. Make sure you've got the stomach for it before watching(nowhere near as extreme as what is seen in Dawn of the Dead, though). Finally... what can I say? James came, he made Saw, and judging from the public reaction, he apparently conquered. But in today's world of movies, by today's quality standards... does that really say that much? I recommend this only to huge fans of horror-thrillers, and I urge most true fans of horror to think hard before even considering to watch it. Go back and re-watch one of the classics instead, says I. Not to watch more than once. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This film is possibly the worst film I have ever seen!,"When I heard about this film I was anticipating that it would be scary, but it's just not. The acting in this film is appalling. To be frank I've seen better acting in a Primary school play.The plot was abysmal, whoever dreamed that one up should be tied to the town square so he can be publicly humiliated.The way it goes is that a couple of guys waken up in a bathroom chained to a wall, and they have to find a way out before they die. There are two cops investigating these weird murders where other people have found themselves in similar situations and died.One of the cops is the Mel Gibson's partner in Lethal Weapon. There are a couple of other recognisable faces, like the other cop was in Red Dragon and the doctor guy was Hot Shots. But the performances they give are so bad it made me want to kill myself. If you think Keanue Reeves is a wooden actor, wait till you see these guys, oh boy.The direction was crap, the screenplay was crap, the scripting was crap, the acting was crap, the plot was crap, this film was just crap. If you don't want to be scared, and you like a plot with more holes than a dead gangster then this is one for you. In fact I recommend it, because it's so bad everyone should watch just so they can say they've seen perhaps the worst film ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The Best of Times, the Worst of Times","I found this to be a mix of 2 movies, one I liked very much, ""Seven"" and one I didn't like much at all, ""Phone Booth"". This one ranked right there in the middle but probably should be closer to the latter. The idea was nothing real new here but some of the concepts were. However this film had one major problem and that is it wasn't scary which I'm pretty sure was what it strides for. Whereas ""Seven"" was beautifully rendered and flowed like poetry this just became downright stupid in some parts. It could have just pertained to my audience but a lot of them were laughing at parts especially during the second half. This was good in one instance that was supposed to be funny however I'm quite sure that the others were actually very serious but unfortunately didn't get perceived as such. The acting wasn't anything to write home about either. Another goal that didn't get reached was the audience was supposed to stop and think both during and after the viewing about their life, kind of like ""Seven"" did, in the whole 'what would you do if you were in this spot' mode. Sadly this didn't happen as I left the theater disappointed in a few ways. The gruesome factor wasn't that bad either and most people will be able to handle it without any qualms.

"With Some Doctoring, Saw 2 Could Be The Next Se7en","Ah, Saw. From the buzz, I was hoping this would be my gory ray of sunshine. It was supposed to be the successor to Se7en. Now, Se7en is the ultimate in detective movies. Nothing of the genre could stand up to Se7en. Could Saw be what I have been waiting for?Plot: 20/25: The killer is loose. They call him the Jigsaw Killer, because of his calling card; a piece of skin cut from his victims in the shape of a puzzle piece. He isn't your typical serial killer. He puts his victims in extreme situation where, if they don't complete his outrageous challenges, they will end up killing themselves. If they make it out, they have a much bigger appreciation for life.His current victims are photographer Adam (Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes). They wake up in a small, broken-down room chained to pipes and with a dead body in between them. They also find a pair of saws. They are each left a tape explaining what they must do. Gordon must kill Adam, and Adam must survive. If Gordon fails to kill Adam, his wife Alison (Potter) and daughter Diana (Vega) will be killed.As they race for their survival, Gordon tells us the story of Jigsaw killer. Gordon was a suspect himself for a while, due to them finding one of his personal belongings at the scene of the crime. We learn of the previous victims, including one particularly nerve-racking one involving a reverse bear-trap attached to someone's head. We also learn of Detective David Tapp (Glover), a cop who becomes obsessed with Gordon and the Jigsaw killer.The plot is better than most other horror movies around. There are some holes and it isn't exceptionally difficult to figure out the twist, but it keeps you interested.Horror: 17/25: This isn't your everyday horror movie. It doesn't attempt to outright scare you. There are very few pop-outs. This one tries to unnerve you through gore and outright creepiness. In my humble opinion, it fails.The movie is basically advertised as excessive gore city. In reality, this movie is no gorier than movies like Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill. In fact, it is significantly tamer than those. The reason this one is usually called gorier is because it makes you think about what you are witnessing. However, when you take a look at it, it really isn't too gory.As for creepy, this movie can be creepy at times, but really, how scary is a robot on a tricycle? It's not scary, it's just weird and stupid.This movie isn't nearly as unnerving as Se7en. In fact, it is only slightly unnerving. Maybe I'm just desensitized, but this doesn't work too well as a horror movie. It is more intense than most other horror movies today, so I give it credit for that, at least.Acting: 6/25: To start off, Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) has gained a lot of weight. This guy needs a job. Unfortunately, this movie just won't look good on his resume. He is TERRIBLE. He should really stick to comedy. Whannell (The Matrix Reloaded) is below average as Adam, as is Monica Potter (Boston Legal). The only good performance is that of Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) who is given the only real character as an obsessive detective. The acting, overall, is the main weakness of the movie.Entertainment: 16/25: Saw has an interesting concept. What would you do if you were placed in a situation where your life was a pawn in someone's sick game? Would you run? Would you cry? Would you just accept it? Looking at it from this perspective, Saw is a good movie.Looking at it from another perspective, Saw can feel very boring at times and the acting ruins the believability a movie like this desperately needs. The directing is obviously trying to be Se7en 2 (or would it be 8ight?), and it doesn't measure up. The movie is obviously going for unnerving rather than flat-out scary, but it isn't as creepy as it could have been. This movie is an underachiever.Total: 59%: Saw could have been a lot more. I could see the potential just oozing from this movie. The plot was good, and it had a creepy style to it. Unfortunately, the acting prevented a lot of the horror from coming to life and the movie holds few surprises. With some doctoring to the formula, Saw 2 could prove to be what Se7en fans expected from this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good,"The structure is ingenious, the performances are all really strong, especially from Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes, the ending is one of the best endings ever, and John Kramer's voice performance is top-tier, it's cool that they intrigue us with all the storylines and don't just try to please us with the brutal bloody deaths, like some of the later sequels, it's also got really well-directed set pieces that make them just as interesting as Jigsaw's philosophy and every storyline, but I will say, the bathtub trap in the beginning is super bad and unwinnable, I know it's explained in Saw 3, but still.Rating: A or 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A masterpiece with some very minor plot holes,"Easily one of the best horror movies off all time. The movie is consistently tense and unlike most horror movies has very likeable characters with very in depth traits and issues, the characters actually grow and change as the movie delves and the camera reflects the type of person they are. The traps are very satisfyingly messed up and clever, you can tell all of them are very possible to survive but very painful and hard to manage it. The acting can be cheesy at time but is still very good at conveying the emotion of each scene and horror. The movie also chooses a non linear format with lots of flashbacks, this is a perfect decision as instead introducing a character and expecting you to immediately care about them it instead shows you the scenario they're in and slowly building the characters as you care about them, this also leads to lots of plot twists and intrigue as you slowly piece together the complete story. 10/10 movie has some plot holes but are very minor and is overall so tense and enjoyable, the gore is also relatively mild compared to later entries so it makes it a lot more of an easier watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"good, original, but has unforgivable plot holes","Saw is a new and fresh kind of horror movie that I haven't seen before. I really liked the film, but there are 2 critical plot holes that can not be explained or forgiven and that keep this movie from being truly great. Firstly, Zep is the one person that stuck up for jigsaw and showed that he valued life. for jigsaw to involve him in one of his sick games ruins the reason behind the point of the entire film. OOPS!!! and just as ridiculous, Zep taunting Dr. Gordon's wife and kid while he has them tied up. Why? Seriously, even if it was part of Zep's instructions to cruelly play with the wife and child, HOW WOULD JIGSAW KNOW? he was laying on the floor the entire film. He didn't know what Zep was doing. He had no control over Zep at all. It was just pointless and illogical tormenting that was used to ""fool the audience"" into thinking that Zep was jigsaw. Not only do cheap tricks like that not work, but they end up ruining the logic of the film as a whole. Saw may be clever, but not clever enough to save itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

God bless the writers and the director for creating another horror icon. This guy is just brilliant when it comes to killing people. All the different ""games"" he likes to play with his victims. And his motive, wanting people to care more about their lives, is ironic, because the entire time, the victims are trying to escape his traps.Overall, ""Saw"" is a great horror movie that is best enjoyed with company and late at night.

A Good Start To The Franchise,"This is the first installment of these horror series. For a first movie it was pretty good. Had an interesting plot, the whole investigation process with the cops was decent. Same sort of structure is followed in the later movies.There is a red herring making you think someone is responsible when they are actually just a pawn. I liked that there are two survivors in this one, even though this is the first movie it establishes the series really well.You understand that the purpose is to survive and the tasks are not impossible which then in the later movies you start to recognise when they are and are able to piece the twist together before it is revealed to you. I like that these tools are given to you as a viewer in order to be able to figure things out.My favorite part about these movies is that there is always a reveal and a twist in the end and it is always really good and fits together. Then it continues on to the next movie from where the last one left it.As a first movie it is still pretty low on action as it is trying to tell the story and establish itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
How far the horror genre has fallen,"After seeing Saw, which played at the Sundance Film Festival and actually has received some glowing reviews, the absolute best thing I can say about it was that it wasn't boring.It also wasn't even in the least bit suspenseful, looks so much like a bad heavy metal video during the thriller sequences that you would swear it was directed by a member of Spinal Tap, and features a script that not only completely squanders a fairly nifty premise but also becomes embarrassingly stupid after a while, filled with lapses in logic and gaping plot holes that are pretty unforgivable when you consider that the movie barely even has a plot to begin with.The simplest way to sum up the movie is this: Saw is to Seven what Urban Legend was to Scream.The best part of the movie actually was the trailer at the beginning for the French slasher pic High Tension, which is supposedly coming out for Valentines's Day. High Tension is the genuinely visceral, squirm inducing movie that the makers of Saw wanted their flick to be, so in that respect, at least, a theatrical viewing of Saw gives horror fans some reason for hope.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A competent, though slightly hollow thriller/horror.","Despite being such a high profile ""horror"" title, the fact that Saw is lacking an underlying sense of dread and tension is remarkably surprising. There are pockets of tension dotted throughout the film (in particular the trap sequences), just not to the extent you may imagine.The cinematography is well executed, and is most notable in moments of aggressive editing ( the trap sequences) where it is used to great effect to create tension.Saw deserves praise for its non linear plot structure, featuring an abundance of flash backs and multiple story lines.The leads deliver modest performances, however the supporting cast are a little more mediocre.One minor complaint is that protagonist Adam sometimes behaves like he's in a completely different environment to the hostile death trap he's been plunged into, including spouting cringe worthy pieces of dialogue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Most of the torture scenes seemed like a lame NIN video. And the jittery editing when Danny Glover was driving frantically was nauseous. We walked out the theater before the twist ending.

A lukewarm execution,"Having see ""The Grudge"" a couple of days before, I welcomed the opportunity to watch ""Saw,"" as a more psychological, rather than supernatural, thriller.Although I did not think the film was great, I liked the main idea, and didn't find most of the twists and turns to be predictable to the extent that I groaned when they'd occur. At the least, I wasn't spending my viewing time thinking about what would ""obviously"" happen next, because there were definitely some surprises in there.But while the idea of two men waking up trapped in a dingy bathroom while a puppetmaster pulls their strings was a good one, the performances were generally not that good. They were passable, but the dialogue is very poor, and no one was going to parlay that crappy script into an Oscar nomination.The psychological thriller styles itself after ""Se7en"" and ""The Cube"" but the execution pales by comparison. (although the dialogue in ""The Cube"" wasn't exactly fresh).

A new era of horror begins...,"""Saw"" is the first movie of a new era in the horror movies and it is also the first movie of the Saw series. In this movie we have a serial killer who's been nicknamed as ""Jigsaw"" and he kidnaps people who as he/she says does not deserve their lives and he/she wants to make them chase and win their lives back again.I liked this movie because I believe that it's a really unique movie and it was the first movie that I watched with this kind of plot so I was really surprised with this and I was not expected nothing else than such a great movie. I also think that James Wan did a really great job in the direction of this movie and that was obvious throughout the whole movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A true sleeper,It's not very often that a true 'sleeper' movie hits the theaters. More often than not the sleeper movies are just clever marketing by the production companies. I think Saw can be rightly labeled a sleeper movie though.I would recommend that anybody who intends to see this movie goes and sees it and stops reading this review now. The less you know about the film the more enjoyable you will find it. It obeys the primary law of the best horror/thriller movies in that the things you don't see are much more frightening than the things you do. The film borders on being a black comedy and is very entertaining from start to end. The film is well acted and nicely directed and keeps up the pace from start to finish. Saw is one of the best movies of the year and will be well worth a second viewing. 8/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Inspired start to this horror franchise,"""Saw"", on its release, was a refreshing change from the genre offerings available at the time. James Wan's unpredictable and twisting tale still stands up to repeated viewing and it remains the strongest of the series.While it fails to hit the heights of ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", the film delivers the goods and should leave horror fans satisfied.Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes are excellent as Jigsaw's latest victims but it's the scene with a terrified Shawnee Smith that stays in the memory once the end titles have finished scrolling.8 out of 10. Worthy of a viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good plot at least in balance with horrendous acting,"The plot of this film has immense potential. And the film is worth watching. Great story, very original, stands out. But: I caught myself hoping for a remake soon. I can only blame the director for the appalling performance of the actors. I have seen many movies with bad acting, and usually did not finish watching unless the movie was unpretentious horror, so as to be funny. The acting in this movie is just about as bad as I've ever seen in my life. I live in Holland, and us Dutch can take a real beating when it comes to this: the Dutch are inherently terrible actors. The fact that I (we) sat this one out, is due to the perfect story/concept, and technical end product. It's a plot you cannot ruin apparently. Even if you are a mediocre director.So watch it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My jaw was dropping at the end of the movie,"Never understood how this first one never resonated with critics, especially compared to other thriller/mystery films, but this has to at least go down as one of the more influential thriller films of all time. It's pretty self contained, creepy, and if you're stomach can handle it obviously, quite gory. Not the biggest fan in using gore to push your movie, but Wan actually makes it feel like it's in the background, unlike the others. On top of that twist, Saw borderlines on a classic for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sawful Clever,"OK, as was probably the case with most horror fans, I have been looking forward to this since the early days of the Fangoria teasers and interviews.I went in hoping for another indie classic and was pleasantly surprised.Granted, it wasn't a classic, but it was a very clever film to say the least. All of the bad reviews on this page have obviously come from folks who cannot seem to follow the one simple rule that every horror fan must be held accountable to, and that is the requirement of suspending disbelief. If one can't observe this simple commandment, one shouldn't be watching horror movies.Now, to the movie. As far as acting goes, I give it 1.5 out of 4 stars. Elwes and Whannell are simply atrocious. Even the staunchest supporters of horror films, which are notorious for bad thespians, cannot possibly justify the casting in this movie, although Whannell was the screenwriter and probably conned his way into his role. They just weren't convincing as characters. I simply couldn't connect with them. Danny Glover was the one high point, and his part was so small that it couldn't lift the others from their acting stupor.The film itself was very original. A serial killer who, in the midst of a struggle between life and death himself decides to play God with his victims, allowing them the opportunity right their wrongs while coming to appreciate the value of life, is not the most original concept. However, the way he provides options for his victims seems to show us a sort of macabre compassion for his fellow humans. Each victim is given an option and clues as to how to escape his horrific puzzles, but it lies within each to determine down which path they will proceed. With nods to Argento (music and style) and some of the realism that we've come to expect from a Tobe Hooper film, the film seems to be another brick (albeit not quite a foundational support) in the rebuilding of the genre as a whole. It is films like this, which come out with balls to the wall suspense and no regards for the squeamish, that are going to be the savior of our beloved franchise.Granted, we have a ways to go, but if little gems like this keep popping up every three or four months, and they continue to improve on each other's mistakes, then the future looks very bright indeed.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Imagine putting yourself into these situations...,"In the commercial for Saw, it was declared the ""Scariest Movie of 2004"", and it's not true. Even though 'The Grudge' was considered the scariest movie of 2004 also, which it might have been, Saw wasn't as scary as it was sought out to be.This movie can't be considered a Horror film, but in the commercial, they compared it to SE7EN (Seven) and Silence of the Lambs. I agree with this, because it was entertaining and hard to follow too, which agrees with both these movies.The plot is mainly head games. Even though we don't really find out who the main culprit is, 'he' puts his victims into mind-boggling situations that cause them to panic, and fail their task. For example: A woman named Amanda was locked up with a metal contraption on her head. This was attached to her upper gums and lower jaw. In a certain amount of time, the machine would rip open her mouth and her head would have basically torn apart (yay). The only way to get it off, was to cut open a dead cell mates stomach, to find the missing key.Although it may seem extreme, this movie is worth owning. The more times you watch it, the better you will understand. The ending for Saw was better than the ending for The Grudge, so be happy. I didn't expect what I saw, and it made the whole movie that much better.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gut wrenching short and sweet but a few plot holes.,"Well i had heard a lot about this movie and i finally ended up seeing it. I must say that i expected the world from the movie and even then it met my expectations.The editing and storytelling is cutting edge the action starts right from the beginning and grips your attention throughout the film.The acting in the movie is top notch and I'm happy to see Cary Elwes an actor whom i have liked from the time i saw him in"" Robin hood men in tights"" have such a significant role i really feel he is a talented actor and he should be in many more movies. Other than that the acting of Liegh Wankel was also worth a mention as both of them were the main characters and carried of their roles brilliantly. The rest of the cast were great in whatever roles they had to play.I however seem to have a problem with this movie being slotted as a horror because somehow i didn't quite see it as one maybe i am from the old school where horror always implies some otherworldly elements.The only problem with the movies are the plot and character holes some of them are:- 1)The detectives who are obviously trained to think on their feet and are probable well versed with detaining criminals behaved in a matter most inappropriate to their training, even a normal person would have behaved in a manner that would have much better outcome then what we saw when trained professionals confronted a known possibly armed murderer.The circumstances had to be different and more difficult for the outcome to be the one we saw.2) The ending though thrilling seems unbelievable in otherwise a believable movie.3)Also the intelligence and resourcefulness shown by the protagonists throughout the film was absent and could have easily have prevented what was another memorable scene. Again the circumstance could have been different for what had happened to happen.(however these things though annoying were important in the movie and don't harm the movie much) Save for this everything about this movie was brilliant and although i am not a great fan of the brushed up versions of such films i thoroughly enjoyed the R rated version.A movie that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, its not one of those high brow , arty festival premium release movie that it has been wrongly positioned as.Do watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Let Down,"I have to say after all the hype, after all the hoopla - when I finally saw this film I was terribly disappointed. It was supposed to be this smart, scary film, and instead it went for shock value and plot twists that made absolutely no sense at all. As a shock film, it works, but on any other level it just doesn't.Let's start with all the elaborate traps (which if you haven't seen the film you can see them in the trailer). These things are a forensic expert's dream - there's no way not to leave trace evidence behind somewhere. The police act with predictable stupidity for these kinds of films: the two detectives close in on a known serial killer - who they already know has a proclivity for booby traps - WITHOUT backup? A doctor who apparently doesn't know the first thing about actual first aid and can't tell... well, no spoilers here.I think if the movie had just been two guys locked together in a room, and left at that, this would have been so much better. But by the time the third victim is trundled out it becomes clear it's all about the body count. The puppet's creepy, but it's the only original thing here. The pacing is good in places, and in others ruined by predictable plot clichés and unnecessary exposition that only further underscores the incredulity of the overly-complicated premise.So why six stars and not lower? Because for the kind of viewer who likes this thing, there was nothing wrong with it. And if it hadn't been for all the hype, I probably wouldn't be so harsh on it, either. But for everyone who hailed this as the second coming - and all the films that followed in it's wake, it's just not worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I give credit to James Wan and Leigh Whannel for making a good modern horror movie,"I've said this before and I'm saying it right now, there are not very many horror movies which I consider good. ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" ""Darkness Falls"" are examples of how pathetic the horror genre has become. This movie is different. There's no cheesy immortal killer, no huge name actors who you KNOW are gonna make it out as the 'Big Hero'. This movie has no bias toward any character, each one can be killed at any time, can only do so much to survive this, and only knows so much. Writer Leigh Whannel was good as the paranoid, crazy, pessimistic Adam. Cary Elwes wasn't half bad as the observant, intelligent Dr. Lawrence Gordon. And of course my favorite actor in this film was Danny Glover. He was very well cast as the determined Detective Tapp. Over all, I recommend this movie to anyone with a taste for good horror, by that I Don't mean The Ring, The Grudge, 2003 version of TCM, etc. This movie is not for the weak minded/stomached.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SAW ROCKS!,"I went to ""SAW"" last night and REALLY enjoyed it! After being disappointed with ""The Grudge"" and ""The Forgotten"", it was refreshing to see a thriller/horror movie with actual bite! If you like a movie that makes you actually have to think a bit to figure it out, this one may be for you. There was a lot of violence, some intense, so be forewarned. But if you liked Se7en, you'll love this! I was sure I knew who the Jigsaw Killer was right up until the last 10 minutes, but NO, NOT SO MUCH! And I bet that almost NOBODY who sees this will figure it out until the very end. I would be very surprised and skeptical if someone told me that they had. All I can say is CHECK THIS ONE OUT!

Not that good!,"Saw (Review by: William Newman) The film is very efficient, dark, gory, the film's Characters are very focused expect the character ""Adam"" the whole film seems to focus on his past he knows Dr. Gordon who is chained to a pipe in a gritty bathroom with ""Adam"", Now I have much to say about the Character of Jigsaw, I think it's very wise on how you can get the feeling of what Jigsaw is with out even seeing his face, the character of David Tapp played by the best of Danny Glover, the role ties into many problems of the film, his partner and him Believed they could end Jigsaw's games before the film even started I'm serious watch the film to understand, as he and Sing thought they found Jigsaw and could get to him before he got to them Jigsaw's hidden traps could save a life by taking away one, the Character of Jigsaw is very Blunt of course he will look like a godist in later films, it takes a fool to not know what a small budget film can do.

Post Modern Horror Fun,"The movie Saw is a ""horror"" movie, featuring a serial make-other-people-kill-other-people killer. So, technically, he's never killed anybody. Nice.Anyway, it's a perfectly entertaining whodunnit which posits a villain so clever that he can orchestrate elaborate do-or-die scenarios for his captives to accomplish. I won't spoil it because I recommend it, at least inasmuch as you overlook the plot contrivance that would require the master villain to be a person of immense wealth who also has the ability to Excel spreadsheet all the various possibilities of his plan and account for them, down to the insanely small possibilities.The basic premise is two guys chained to pipes on opposite ends of a bathroom, one charged with killing the other by six o'clock, the other charged with preventing his own death. Why? so the serial non-killer can show the value of living. Blech. But, still, it's well done, well acted, even though all the while you're saying to yourself nobody could concoct such a Bondian method of killing the protagonist. You have to ignore the realities that would intrude, and you can do this, since the plot tries to be true, but then at the end of the film, when you get the gotcha moment, you realize it could never have really happened.And not just because the writer/director fooled you with all the misdirection, which I liked because that is good movie making, but because it would have been physically impossible to do. It's good because it's not predictable, even though you're predicting it. It's got all the ""if you've seen a horror movie then do this"" moments in it that the characters don't do, and at one point I was talking to the TV saying, ""Shoot him now. Shoot him now. Don't ask a question. Shoot him. Maybe in the femur, but shoot him."" I mean, if you've ever seen, say, 19 horror films, you know that once you get the gun from the bad guy, you don't do anything else other than subdue him. For sure, you don't call someone on your cell phone. Puhleese. He might get the gun back. Shoot him in the leg, at least.All this was intentional, I'm guessing, which would make this a post-modern horror film since the characters surely recognize they're in a horror film and try to do sensible things, at least for a while. I mean: the film does end with a gotcha.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Negative review, No Spoilers, See the film only if it will save a life.","Please pass this review on before Friday and hopefully prevent mass suicides and psychotic breaks in fans who have been looking forward to this film.By all that is holy if you have not seen the complete piece of over-hyped crap that is SAW save your eyes and mind the torture and never, NEVER see it. This will be the movie people will pass around as a gag gift in a few years. It is the morning after I caught a much anticipated sneak preview and I find myself more p***ed and disgusted than disappointed in the film. Jon Favreau noted on Dinner for Five once that you can take a chance on the script, the director or the lead actor in a project and still have things turn out all right. So we have a first time director, first time screenwriter ( he is also in the film and gives himself the only cool line in the entire movie) and Cary Elwes. 3 strikes and you are out. The thing that p***es me off is that the story is good. The base idea behind this film, a guy who gets his victims to kill themselves in a variety of horrible ways. Definitely up there with Se7en, wait a minute, that was the story from Se7en, so never mind. By the end of the film you WANT every one to die horribly just so that it will end.A previous review commented on an overly giggly audience, they were laughing because this should have been a comedy. Not a single moment of the film was scary or even creepy. All of those scenes were telegraphed horribly and executed with boxing gloves on. There are simply no spoilers to give away. Danny Glover tried but he had nothing to work with, not sure why there were even police in the story line as they provided no advancement of the plot, and didn't even provide any interesting death scenes in their search for the killer. Dina Meyer has all of 3 or 4 lines and never even takes off her clothes, which could have redeemed to film somewhat. Monica Potter is the best performance of the film and that because I think the confusion and anger that her character showed so well on film was drawn from her own emotions at being connected with this project. Cary Elwes should never be allowed to work on any film, anywhere, ever again. I would have rather seen Jake Lloyd or Hayden Christiansen play the role because they could have given better performances. There was also none of the grisly violence that was promised, I think they either showed a different cut to get the R rating or they paid to get it. ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a more grisly, horrific and scary film and they were TRYING to be funny. This not only deserves no starts on any reviewers scale it deserves to be the baseline of a whole new scale of just how bad a movie can be. I give it 5 out of 5 thrown handfuls of monkey excrement. In the immortal words of J. Jonah Jameson, ""Crap. Crap. MEGACRAP! Save someone's life and print this review.

It is the best in the horrors and it is the best scenario.Actors are not popular but they were perfect. Especially the scene which the doctor was cutting his own leg was very very realistic.

Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.,"While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment. I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over. Saw successfully accomplished this task. While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments. It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions. What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films. That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode. I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality. That is what pushed this film from your average ""serial killer"" film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was. I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering ""B"" to ""C"" grade actors of our generation. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability. After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights. So, you are not dealing with the crème de la crème of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment. While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched. You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing. I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.Outside of the acting, this film impressed me. The originality of the story shocked me. I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans. Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed ""killer"" is doing to his victims. The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window. While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open. Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time. Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence. To me, it worked.I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning. Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job. Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good. I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film. Those films are a waste in my book. Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking  wow, but what does this mean? How did this happen? Where are we going from here? Yada yada yada  (did I just yada yada yada Saw?) I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed. Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book  and Saw earned it.Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film. While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about. Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.Grade: **** out of *****",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A Gruesome Game of Morality - ""Saw""","""Saw,"" directed by James Wan and released in 2004, is a film that redefined the horror genre with its gritty, intense, and often shocking take on the classic psychological thriller. Known for its intricate plot twists and brutal traps, ""Saw"" is both a captivating puzzle and a brutal test of its characters' wills. While it's not for the faint of heart, it certainly leaves an impression.The movie centers on two men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam Stanheight (Leigh Whannell), who wake up chained in a dilapidated bathroom with no recollection of how they got there. They soon discover they are pawns in a sadistic game orchestrated by the infamous Jigsaw Killer, who forces his victims to make horrific choices to survive. As the plot unfolds, the two men must piece together clues to escape while their captor watches their every move.James Wan's direction creates an atmosphere of dread from the very beginning. The claustrophobic setting of the bathroom and the grimy, washed-out cinematography effectively immerse the audience in the characters' terror and desperation. The film's low-budget origins are evident, but they work to its advantage, adding to the gritty realism that makes the horror feel more immediate and visceral.The performances are solid, though not exceptional. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell do a commendable job portraying two men pushed to their psychological limits, though some of the dialogue and emotional beats can feel forced. Tobin Bell, as Jigsaw, is chilling in his limited screen time, delivering a performance that would come to define the franchise.What truly sets ""Saw"" apart is its intricate plot and the moral dilemmas it presents. The film's central theme revolves around the value of life and the lengths people will go to survive. Jigsaw's traps are not just physical but moral tests, designed to force his victims to confront their own sins and shortcomings. This concept elevates ""Saw"" beyond mere gore, adding a layer of psychological horror that lingers long after the film ends.However, the film is not without its flaws. The graphic violence and gore, while central to the film's identity, can be overwhelming and off-putting for some viewers. Additionally, the dialogue can be clunky at times, and the pacing occasionally drags, particularly in the flashback sequences that attempt to provide backstory but sometimes feel like unnecessary padding.The twist ending is undoubtedly one of the film's strongest elements. It's a shocking and cleverly executed reveal that recontextualizes everything that came before it, leaving audiences with a sense of unease and a newfound appreciation for the film's narrative complexity.In conclusion, ""Saw"" is a flawed but influential horror film that successfully blends psychological tension with graphic horror. Its inventive premise and shocking conclusion make it a memorable entry in the genre, even if its relentless brutality and uneven performances may not appeal to everyone. For horror fans, particularly those with a taste for the macabre and morally complex, ""Saw"" is worth watching-but it's certainly not for the squeamish.Recommended with caution.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"All in all, an OK film","Well, I must say that I am not a great fan of this genre but saw really does well to make me involved in whatever little way it has.Some average acting and good direction has made this film watchable and also grows on you.It has a good story revolving around it and the unfolding of events is also quite good.If you enjoy watching movies having violence and a lot of language,chances are saw will please you.Mystifies at times,makes you want to look away from the screen at other times, saw can please your appetite for violence and mystery.A good watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good but still requires buying into some illogic,"This is a pretty good movie, it moves along from the beginning and keeps going. Not as gory as I thought it might be but still quite a bit of blood. It suffers from the same illogic of most of these kinds of movies, i.e. when the bad guy is *almost* captured and could be either quickly killed or disabled, they don't shoot him but talk or otherwise allow themselves to be distracted and of course the bad guy regains control. Also, how does the bad guy manage to get access to all these spooky gvt abandoned places AND why is someone still paying the electric bills to keep the lights on in buildings that appear to have been abandoned years earlier? Still, you expect this kind of illogic in a SAW style movie and as long as you can put that aside it's a lot better movie then most of the blood and gore flics that pass for suspense nowdays.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.""","Despite the disgustingly atrocious editing and diabolically abysmal dialogue (which in turn had a knock-on effect on the already uninspiring acting), this is still a fantastic horror mystery, as the tense mission of solving the elusive identity of The Jigsaw Killer keeps us on tenterhooks, and that ending was just insane, oh my word. Up until then I was planning on giving this a 7 but that final scene shot my rating up to an 8, that honestly could be one of the best endings I've ever witnessed.

Looking Forward...,"This movie seems like it's a puzzle its self. It's really interesting. After watching the exclusive clips at yahoo.com, it made me look forward to the movie. This movie is more like a Action, Suspense, Mystery, Puzzling type of movie. It COULD be put into the category of Horror, but it's more like a action/mystery/suspense.I like what they mean of ""The victims are finding a way to kill themselves."" or ""How much blood will you shed just trying to stay alive?"". In the movie, there's a mastermind serial killer that doesn't kill YOU. YOU kill yourself. The killer sets up something, but no, he doesn't kill you. Then he tells you what to do, and you try to get out by doing what the clues he's telling you. BUT, when your trying, your in great danger and very close to DEATH. So is the killer killing you or are you killing yourself???? Tough decision....",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Morbid, Sick, A Good Thriller Movie!","Well, after I saw the trailer in the theater for this one I was instantly hooked. I mean, how gruesome is a killer who tries to get people to cut their own legs off in order to escape?! I was surprised to see Danny Glover and Cary Elwes in it and their star power further persuaded me to watch ""Saw"".This film isn't just simple horror gore. It is known as a psychological thriller/horror, kind of like Silence of the Lambs or Seven. It has their gore too. Strangers are abducted and put into dire situations (kind of like a lethal contest) where they must play some psycho's (Jigsaw's)sick games that he thinks eradicate evil. There are a couple of weak areas: Glover and Elwes' characters toward the end and shackles with electrodes in them. But mostly this film gives good shock therapy in surprising the audience and in making them repel from the horrors on the screen.The ending...well, that's probably the best and most shocking part. Anyone who spoils it for you probably just gave away the main reason for watching. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good, not brilliant","Keeping it short, I have to say that there are many good things about this film. The storyline, the plot twists, the scares - all spot-on. If you like horror films and thrillers, you'll really like this regardless of what I'm about to add... there are just two things that let the film down:1) Cary Elwes - Despite seeing him in a number of films, I still don't know how to pronounce his surname. Generally he's good in most films, (especially Glory), but in this his limitations really are shown. At the end of the film I was laughing because he had such trouble acting scared, which really detracted from the film. The fake stuttering is the worst part. It's not his fault, not everyone can act scared, but if you can't do it then you shouldn't appear in this kind of movie.2) Cary Elwes' makeup - Maybe they wanted him to look like a distinguished doctor, who knows? To me he looks like someone threw a bag of flour over him. Rather than treating patients, it's easy to think that he actually spends most of his time baking cakes...So overall, a very good film, but sadly let down by some minor (but in my opinion important) issues.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I want to play a game!,"Two men wake up in an isolated room only to find themselves chained by their feet to walls from a distance from each other. Neither of them have any idea where they are, how they got there or who might have kidnapped them. Soon they discover clues as to what they need to do to survive this sick test, designed by a maniac who is referred to as the ""Jigsaw"".Saw grasps you from its very first moment until the end. The idea that a killer designing traps in where he places people so they will end up either killing themselves or escape with serious bodily injuries is quite horrifying. And yet, it still has a message: Jigsaw is trying to teach his victims the value of life. The story is structured very well. As two men (Adam and Dr. Gordon) start talking to each other they discover certain connections between each other and their relation to the Jigsaw. The story is two-fold, past and present: we go back in time to see the victims' past connections and we also see them co-operating to get of the situation they are presently in. But all those connections are revealed gradually serving very well to the building suspense.As you might expect, there are some gruesome scenes in the movie but they are not gratuitous. Even though we are used to seeing some many twists at the end (it seems ever since ""The Sixth Sense"", every thriller/suspense movie must have a surprise ending), SAW still manages to surprise us at the end with a shocking ending.

Jigsaw not happy.,"A fiendishly clever idea--for a 22 minute episode of, say, The Twilight Zone. But for a feature? Nope. Not without engaging characters, decent dialogue, a plausible story and a convincingly motivated villain. Saw plays out more as an assortment of potentially cool demo scenes strung into a threadbare and implausible story. Even the money scene--the reverse bear-trap--is marred by overly frantic camera movement and editing. The director has watched too many music videos and not enough Hitchcock. Basic storytelling and film-making skills are absent as is any command of actors, dialogue, mood and logic.Unfortunately, none of that seems to matter any more as this film has already spawned a sequel and looks well on its way to becoming a franchise. The director/writing team are rich, successful and no-doubt convinced that they are the future of edgy film-making. Too bad, cuz now they'll never have the need to master the craftmanship necessary to add style and substance to their high-concept ideas. What a waste. Jigsaw not happy.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
See saw.,"Though its reputation has been sullied somewhat by its increasingly gruesome sequels, 'Saw (2004)' simply isn't the 'torture porn' many believe it to be. In fact, it's actually rather tame for what it is, preferring implication over overt gore, and is a much more cerebral experience than you may expect. It's an enigmatic, evolving thriller which focuses on a pair of men who find themselves chained up in a dirty bathroom with little more than a dead body between them. The picture is at its most successful when it's in this room, depicting its increasingly desperate characters coming to terms with their situation and trying to unravel its mystery before their time runs out. It isn't just confined to the one room, though; through flashback, it explores the lives of its central characters in the days leading to their current predicament. It also spends time with a pair of detectives trying to find the flick's antagonist, the elusive jigsaw killer. These segments mainly exist to fill in the gaps surrounding the killer's motives, which become increasingly obvious as the cops get closer to learning his true identity. The stuff outside the bathroom isn't bad, but it isn't as compelling and it's where the picture's ultra-low budget is most apparent (see its odd, almost disorienting car chase). The whole thing also has a grungy, early-2000s aesthetic that's more bemusing than scary and hasn't aged well. Luckily, the plot is relatively clever and layered, culminating in a constantly surprising finale that subverts expectation with each and every twist. The narrative is satisfying and engaging; it's what makes the experience as successful as it is. Of course, it is sometimes slightly laboured and it does get a bit silly now and again. However, it's an interesting and unexpected take on its genre that never fails to entertain. Overall, the movie is rather enjoyable. It isn't massively scary, but it has some fairly frightening ideas and edge-of-your-seat sequences. It also has an appropriately frustrating ending that provides little in the way of comfort. It's a solid horror-thriller that shouldn't be overlooked simply because of its sequels. 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Awful,"As a 17 year old I have to say that this is the worst horror film I have ever seen, almost as bad as Wolf Creek. Cary Elwes has no place in Horror films.

"Saw is good, not great, but good.","I went into Saw half expecting it to be horrid. Most horror movies these days, the ones that promise to scare you, often leave you leaving the theatre in fits of laughter, wishing you could have your time and money back.Saw is a psychological thriller. Though it has been compared to Silence of the Lambs, it's really an unfair comparison, with a lesser budget, and less talented cast. Saw doesn't offer jump-out-of-your-seat-and-scream shock therapy like other movies, such as The Ring or The Grudge. Instead Saw tries to get into your head. Is your life worth living to you?

sets a new standard for the genre,"Unrelenting, unforgiving, and most certainly unlike any viewing experience I can remember, ""Saw"" is quite possibly the best thriller in modern cinema. I pity the fool who happens upon this film thinking it will be ""just another Hollywood fright flick"" because it truly is in a class by itself. This is a thriller that will take your breath away in the first minute and not give it back until the end credits roll. It is a gruesome, grisly, and utterly evocative depiction of the darkest recesses of the human mind. What makes this thriller a cut above the rest?A good thriller scares you. As a grown man (and horror fan), I rarely see a film that accomplishes this task. This one had me flipping on every light in my house...and sleeping that way as well. I'm actually embarrassed to admit that I kept thinking the killer was going to jump at me any second.A good thriller delivers an ending that you don't expect. For ""Saw"", this would be a gross understatement. This is an entire film of one unexpected event after another, so much so that I actually gave up trying to guess what would happen next.A good thriller stays with you afterward. There are several times during this film where the tension was so unimaginably unbearable, I found myself wondering whether or not I really wanted to continue watching. Not because it wasn't good but because it was almost too good for its own intent. The horrific scenes of torture the killer puts upon his victims were made impossibly more shocking by the schizophrenic style in which they were filmed. This is not to be confused with the ""MTV-Style Flash-Cut To Infinity"" style seen in so many thrillers today (which thankfully was absent here). This was a series of frantic zooms and close-ups along with swooping high-speed 360 shots of the victim. Throw in some music that effectively makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up and you have the work of a brilliant (if insanely twisted) director.Films like this don't come along often so don't miss it. Even if you think it is too gory, too sadistic, or too intense, you would have to admit it is an excellent piece of independent art that makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" look like a fairy tale, swims circles around ""Open Water"", and pretty much cuts any Hollywood studio picture completely in half.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Better than Se7en,"I had read that this movie was a poor man's Se7en, so it was a genuine surprise to find that Saw is actually a very good, well-made thriller which keeps the pace moving frighteningly brisk throughout.The movie begins in darkness and creates a tense mood right from the start. It is a relief when the lights come on and you can gain a sense of the scenario - two men on opposite sides of a room chained by a leg, with a dead body lying in a pool of blood in the centre of the room. Through a series of flashbacks, a little at a time is revealed of the situation they are in and how it came about.There are some similarities to Se7en in that the movie concerns a serial killer who selects his victims with a macabre purpose. In this context, Saw compares favourably with Se7en and sheds more blood more graphically. This in itself does not make it a better movie, but it sustains its dark mood throughout as it continues to build up tension with a series of twists. Perhaps the final twist is beyond the pale but then in any movie of this type you need to suspend reality for best effect. And the ending does tie up a loose end that was barely even considered throughout the rest of the movie, that is, whose is the dead body lying in the pool of blood?If you like your movies fast-paced with plenty of thrills, chills and gore, then this is for you - if you are prepared to suspend logic and go with the flow (of blood). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Original and Shocking Horror Movie with a Twist Ending,"Saw is the first installment in the successful horror franchise, directed by James Wan in 2004. The film tells the story of two men who wake up in a room, strapped to chairs. Between them is the dead body of a man holding a cassette tape. The tape contains a message from a man who identifies himself as Jigsaw and claims to be their captor. If they want to survive, they must play his game.Saw is an original and shocking horror movie, distinguished by its atmosphere and twist ending. The film is shot in a minimalist style, which further enhances its dark atmosphere. Wan has managed to create a claustrophobic feeling that draws the viewer into the story and doesn't let them go until the end.The film's plot is simple, but still effective. Wan focuses primarily on the character of Jigsaw, whose motivations are gradually revealed.

Pushing the boundaries of horror,"But that's a bad thing. In society, there are certain lines you just don't cross. In some cases, ('South Park' comes to mind), barriers are crossed with humorous and usually well-intentioned results. 'Saw' has none of these though, and crosses some barriers with such a mean spirited savageness that I practically walked out.Cary Elwes leads the cast as Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Brilliant oncologist, but less than stellar family man, Dr. Gordon awakes one morning to find himself chained to a pipe in a horrifically disgusting bathroom with a young man named Adam (film's co-writer Leigh Whannell). Between the two men is a dead body, and from there begins the twisted game of a killer the police call Jigsaw. Once Lawrence and Adam figure out what's going on, the killer's previous exploits are told in flashback (and poorly done). The always reliable Danny Glover plays Detective David Tapp, whose obsession with catching Jigsaw leads him to be removed from the force after a breakdown following his partner's death (Ken Leung) at Jigsaw's hands.Monica Potter is good enough for what little screen time (not to mention dialogue) she gets as Alison Gordon (wife), Dina Meyer reappears briefly as Kerry, another officer investigating the crimes, and Makenzie Vega chips in as Diana, Lawrence's daughter.OKfirst off.an open note to all directors, especially those of you raised on that cultural void we call MTV. STOP THE JERKY CAMERA AND SPED UP FOOTAGE. Much like with 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', the scenes of Jigsaw's victims are sped up and herky-jerky, making them practically unwatchable. This form of film-making was dead in 2000, quit beating this dead horse.This film is probably the most repulsive, vile, repugnant piece of trash I have sat through in my 33 years. In fact, this movie is lower on the 'lowest common denominator' scale than 'House of 1000 Corpses' was. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Using a stethoscope to examine a child's heartbeat while a gun is held to her mother's head is appealing only to those of us in the community who should probably be under observation anyway. **OVER** There are films that are brutal and a test to watch ('Texas Chainsaw', '28 Days Later', etc) but when you walk out of them you don't feel like you've just been violated.Clearly director Wan and writer Whannell have a brilliant idea, with potential far eclipsing that of 'Seven', but instead allow (either by lack of writing skill or overabundance of depravity) themselves to basically do nothing more than test how much they can get away with just to see what that point will be.An outstanding concept that quickly descends into a sick example of excess. You two should be ashamed.0 out of 5 and I'm sorry for having plugged the potential of this movie the past few months.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The cop played by Danny Glover is easily the best part of the movie, especially near the end. Though I wouldn't say the actors are as bad as reputation dictates, Glover puts everyone else to shame.

A surprisingly inventive idea well executed,"There is a serial killer out there. His name is Jigsaw, and he is possibly the most deadly and cunning primate descendant since Hannibal Lector.This is how he kills. He abducts his chosen victims, dumps them in the bowels of his lair, and he sets a trap upon them. This trap could be a cage full of stretched barbed wire, or it could be an explosive helmet strapped to one's head. After setting the trap, he starts the countdown, then sits back and watches his victims try to escape before time runs out and he leaves them to die. In trying to escape, the victims subsequently kill themselves in gruesome ways. Jigsaw there fore does not get a drop of blood on his hands. It is all a game, and horror fans will love it. Well, they already do.The film is engaging from the beginning, because there is no introduction to the story. The curtain rises on an event which has already begun. In a rusty old bathroom, two men Dr. Lawrence Gordon and Adam Faulker wake up to find them ankle chained to the piping. They have no idea where they are and why, but they soon figure out that they have been kidnapped. The body of a dead man has been dumped in the room, and in his hand is a cassette player on which to play the instructional cassette which their kidnapper has left them. The instructions are for Dr. Gordon. He has until 6:00 to kill Adam, or his wife and child will get it. Gordon must think fast to outsmart the killer who is watching them ready to spill Innocent blood.Someone recently asked me why these films appeal to so many.

I want to play a game,"By Shawn-Thomas FranklinWritten September 2024Rating: 4 out of 5""Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.""Saw is one of those movies that you need to see twice. The first time through to experience the grisly traps and ingenious twist. But on that second viewing you'll see things your brain didn't quite catch the first time. For example, notice how close salvation lay next to Adam (Leigh Whannell) during the opening scene. Then down the drain it went. Oh well.""Two men awaken to find themselves in the opposite sides of a dead body, each with specific instructions to kill each other or face consequences. These two are the latest victims of the Jigsaw Killer."" - IMDbImmediately we are thrown into a dank, dark, rather disgusting room with three others. At first glance not a one of the three appear to be enjoying themselves. This assumption is quickly solidified, concreting into fact. Specifically for the poor fella with his brains lying on the floor next to him and the pistol he gripped. We soon discover the two surviving members are Dr. Lawrence Gordon, played by Cary Elwes and Adam, played by Leigh Whannell. Leigh also holds a writing credit alongside director James Wan. Both men are the latest players in one of the vicious serial killer, Jigsaw's games. The third dude took the easy way out.Saw is James Wan's baby and his feature directorial debut. Writing alongside Leigh, legend says the pair wanted to make a movie directly after graduating from film school. However, they had a typical college student, freshly turned graduate's budget. With that, they challenged themselves to write a movie that tells a story in one room. Saw was the product, or at least the short film James and Leigh originally created was. Without doing the adequate research but based on the allegation, we can assume the rest of the story was pieced together later. Which in my opinion, if true, would make it even more impressive how well the story flows.Saw is most likely the tamest of the series, but that doesn't mean it's timid. This beast holds no punches in the violence department. With grisly traps that can make even a tenured horror fan squirm. Cary Elwes and Danny glover deliver strong performances accompanied by solid back ups from Ken Leung and Dina Meyer. Playing Detective Steven Sing aka Glover's partner and Kerry aka Dr Gordon's wife. Leigh Whannel acted his heart out but, in the end, he probably should have remained alongside Wan, behind the camera. On the other side of the coin, we got incredibly lucky that Tobin Bell was cast as Jigsaw, giving the iconic character some acting prowess to lean on. With 1000 sequels, that's a huge blessing to the viewer.There are times we are reminded that this project comes connected to a couple amateurs. The dialogue wasn't anything to write home about, Cary and Adam's make up, slowly became sloppier as the movie went on and some of the camera work borders on silly. At the same time, where the dialogue is lacking, the story picks up the slack. Not since David Fincher's Se7en have we had such a calculated killer, captivating audiences across the globe. One of the most fascinating and terrifying aspects of the Jigsaw Killer, is the fact he doesn't technically kill any of his victims. To me, having life and death both available to you but both accessible through horrifying means, makes the tension all the more suffocating.Saw does well to deliver a grisly, mysterious, and truly thrilling horror flick. Even if you have to cut through some cheesy dialogue to free yourself.I would recommend this gem to any fan of horror or psychological thrillers.

One of my favorite movies,I have heard about this movie from a lot of people who really enjoyed it so I did watch it at 3am one morning in pitch black and I really enjoyed it.I had heard of it before and had planned to watch it but didn't get around to it for a long time.It had a lot of very good twists and a very good plot.I think the director did such a good job of this movie.It also scared me because it is one of the most violent I have seen.I think it is underestimated cos I know several people who despised it but I did not see why.I have seen all the 5 Saw movies I thought it was so good I bought it on DVD and have watched it half a dozen times.It is definitely my favorite Saw movie out of the five. 10/10 stars is my rating,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cutting Edge Horror,"Saw, directed by James Wan, is a groundbreaking psychological horror film that redefined the genre with its inventive storytelling, intense atmosphere, and unforgettable twist. The story follows two strangers, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell), who wake up chained in a dilapidated bathroom, victims of a twisted game designed by the infamous Jigsaw killer. With limited time, they must unravel clues to survive while facing horrific choices and dark secrets. Saw stands as a masterclass in suspense, innovation, and horror, leaving a lasting impact on audiences and the genre.Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell deliver gripping performances, effectively conveying the desperation, fear, and psychological strain of their situation. Elwes brings depth to Dr. Gordon, capturing his emotional struggle and resilience, while Whannell's portrayal of Adam adds rawness and vulnerability, grounding the intense narrative. Tobin Bell's portrayal of Jigsaw, though minimal on-screen, is hauntingly effective, establishing a villain whose philosophical motivations blur the line between punishment and morality.James Wan's direction is sharp and visionary, utilising confined spaces, close-up shots, and practical effects to create a claustrophobic atmosphere that amplifies the film's suspense. The cinematography, combined with gritty visuals, immerses the audience in the unsettling environment, while Charlie Clouser's haunting score intensifies the tension, particularly during the film's iconic final moments. The film's limited budget is used creatively, with each scene packed with tension and dread, showcasing that minimalism can be one of the most effective tools in horror.Beyond its gore, Saw delves into themes of survival, redemption, and the value of life, making its horror both visceral and thought-provoking. The film's twist ending is legendary, recontextualising the entire story and leaving audiences in shock. This narrative complexity and the depth of its themes set Saw apart from conventional horror, making it a unique blend of psychological thriller and horror.In conclusion, Saw is a brilliant, genre-defining film with inventive storytelling, strong performances, and an intense atmosphere. It is a must-watch for horror fans and a timeless piece of cinema that continues to inspire. As both a terrifying experience and a thought-provoking story, Saw remains one of the most influential horror films of the 21st century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Saw (2004),Once you watch this you will have to watch the sequels.Saw has to be one of my favorite film series. Its just so good. I know you are probably thinking how can a girl who hated Hostel like the Saw movies. It might be because i saw Saw(ha ha)first but it might be because Saw has a story and isn't a piece of crap that should be burnt ASAP.The twist was amazing. I didn't see it coming. When the twist is revealed you will be sitting there like OMG.Unlike the twist the acting was not so amazing. Cary Elwes was great but he had moments of over the top acting. Actually he had a lot of moments. Leigh Whannell was pretty crap. He looked like a guy who was pretending to be surprised at a not surprise party.Two men wake up chained in a bathroom only to learn they are apart of a madman's game.My only complaints are the acting and some of the scenes could have been shorter.No worries the twist more then makes up for my complaints.6/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"smart, good,cool but cheesy acting.",Saw was smart cool and good and the ending was awesome but the acting was really cheesy the guy who played Adam was bad Lawrence was bad and the only good actor was the black cop. This movie is just cool the jigsaw crimes were pretty dam cool. The only scary parts were when Adam got back to his house and that the guy in the costume with a jail suit on and a horse mask. The clown was so creepy he just creeps you out. Everyone that I know that has watched this movie said it was dumb stupid or gay when i watched it I thought they were really wrong. You will like this movie if you like gory smart movies. This is a movie that you don't go to see in theaters its just not good enough. The type of movie you should go to see in theaters is Sin City Coach Carter million dollar baby or the Aviator. So I give Saw a 6 out of 10.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Awesome horror film,"First time seeing this, I was hooked to the screen and was terrified.The story is extremely clever and the characters are really connective. This movie has got a few nasty gore scenes but not a lot which is a good thing because it doesn't need it.The traps are gross but cleverly done. If I was in that situation, I wouldn't know what to do.This is my number three favourite horror film. I highly recommend it.

Decent Movie,"Rating: 6.5
Overall, for a movie with such a low budget, the creators were able to develop the most from what they could as they created an iconic story line that is a mainstay in the horror franchise, even though it may not be the best in its presentation.Pretty Bad Direction (Direction for traps and plot elements was good but was horrible besides that (especially with dialogue and interpersonal scenes)), Terrible Acting (), Great Story (has very iconic elements to it that are filled with twists and turns that are not expected), Very Bad Screenplay (Though it does had iconic lines and moments at times), Great Score (Iconic score with an iconic theme), Great Production Design (Captures a dark, dirty, and scary environment), The buildup to the climax was gradual and fine but the actual climax really was not carried out well (Though post climax/ending was very well carried out and iconic in showing the twists of the story), The trap scenes were very well executed to show the fear in the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Positive Reviewers, Exactly What Movie Did You See?  Because It Wasn't Saw.","Shamelessly derivative, sub-music-video level hogwash from start to finish. Even the gore is lame. Perhaps I've been desensitized by one too many serial killer films (and there have been way more than one too many already, Se7en and Silence of the Lambs serving as the most prominent inspirations for Saw's blatant imitation), but the only moment in this whole movie that provided any visceral impact was a beating with a toilet tank lid. And if the best your horror movie has to offer is a big, blunt object, you have categorically failed in your attempt to make a horror movie.Besides the numerous logical inconsistencies I'm not going to bother to spoil (they'll do that for themselves if you are unlucky enough to find yourself sitting through it), Saw is chock full of wholly unnecessary flashbacks, often to scenes that happened less than 20 minutes before. No new information is revealed through this repetition, no previously innocuous details highlighted and made important, whole scenes are simply repeated, as if the director expects us to have forgotten we just watched them. If only.The success of this film can only be attributed to external factors: effective marketing, a well-timed Halloween release date, and the continuously diminishing standards and memory spans of the movie-going public. Unsurprisingly, immediately following a tally of the opening weekend receipts, a sequel was greenlit, which begins filming in January.

"I ""Saw"" it...","I'd never imagine I'd ever watch a film from the Saw Franchise, but now I have. I understand to a degree why this movie is talked about.The plot follows two men, trapped in together in a bathroom, and are put to several series of tests that could mean the difference between life or death. As a premise and a concept, it's really interesting. Execution, is another matter...The Acting, I'm not gonna sugar coat it, it can be pretty cringe worthy. There are times the acting comes as a bit campy, but I think watching it now I get a kick out of it. For all that it's worth, Carry Elwes, and Leigh Whannel did a pretty solid job leading the movie. Both did a great job showing a mixture of terror, confusion, anger, and sadness.Obviously, since this is a movie showcasing a series of traps, there were some that definitely were standouts. I will say that I was expecting a bit more gore and violence from this, but there were definitely some really violent moments.Aside from that, the score was pretty sick. Can't get enough of the Hello Zepp theme. Shoutout to Charlie Clouser.I did enjoy this film, I really did, but not as much as I wanted to.

Much more than gore,"Let's start, I love the direction of this film, it is very careful and interesting, as well as the photography (those dark green colors give the places a dirty feeling and make the scenes more tense and the montage, despite the montage being uncomfortable, these two aspects are the ones that make the film the most unique, along with its concept. And its production design is extremely iconic, the reverse bear trap, the billy doll, etc... the gore effects (which made the film be criticized) they don't fail either, they are greatThe traps/games are my favorite part, they're so unique and simple, and it leaves you feeling like you're in one of those traps.And the ending, THE FINAL, I DON'T NEED IT, THOSE WHO SEE IT ALREADY KNOW.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good but over-rated,"I can't believe this movie is considered to be in the same league as (or better than) The Ring or Final Destination according to the ratings here on IMDb. It shouldn't even be in the same class. When I read that this was originally going straight to video, somehow I wasn't surprised. I agree with the filmmakers in releasing it to theaters because it is a little better than the usual straight-to-video flicks, but just a little better.The story is interesting and the puzzles are clever. But somehow this film is missing something. Maybe it's the casting. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Cary Elwes or Danny Glover, and after seeing this film, Leigh Whannell either. I don't find Cary Elwes interesting to watch. He just seems bland. Danny Glover is again playing the role that made him famous, although without his partner, Sgt. Riggs. Because I still identify him with that role, his presence just lightened the mood up too much in this film. Leigh is a little irritating, but that could be due to his character and the script. But somehow I doubt that. The casting director should've spent more time looking for more interesting actors to watch.Then there are the scenes that are too unbelievable and Hollywood-sy that they lessen the suspense even more. I would've like to have seen the story more dark and tragic.All in all, this film is above average but falls short of being great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
great mystery thriller,"One of my favourite horror movies, a great mystery thrillerthis movie is very similar to films like SE7EN and shutter island with the main theme of wondering who jigsaw actually is. The acting is great from stars like Tobin Bell and Cary Elwes. I personally hold this film up with other detective thrillers that i have seen. The story is very good and the graphic content inside of the movie is pretty mild making it an easy watch for anyone. The traps in the first film are pretty simple for the small budget of the film. This film is a very good commentary on society and completes its gritty, intense atmosphere well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A strange film, one that switches from being brilliant to being unbearable","I had low expectations going in to this film - a franchise that spans over 3 films is something I'm always wary of, especially when each film is essentially going through the same motions. It started out great; two people in a room who have no idea who each other are or how they got there making for an extremely engaging first act. They have been placed there by a murderer who places people in situations where they have to escape from precarious circumstances or die. Flashbacks give us more information on each character and it assumes that kind of format of switching from outside the room and inside.If I'm going to praise anything, it's the plot - specifically when involving the murders and how they challenge their victims, those are genius. Otherwise the plot is kind of average; there are brilliant twists and turns you don't expect, but the rest of them of a bit stupid. You can tell it was written by two people because the quality of writing soars and then dives in alternating scenes; some sequences are fascinating and well thought out, but others that focus on the characters are horrifically unrealistic and far-fetched and it detracts from the experience. Generally though, the writing is OK; when talking about the murderer it's excellent, but the writers clearly know little about character building - as they spurt clichés and illogically change emotions. This may account for the films biggest problem, the acting.It's been awhile since I've seen a popular title with such terrible acting - and it only declines as the narrative progresses. Some scenes are unbearable to watch because of the terrible delivery, especially characters become emotional and frantic, as they just start mimicking what they've seen in cartoons. In one scene, a character is shown pretending to die and I honestly thought it was a joke at first. Normally I would've laughed, but I was enjoying the film so much up to that point, that I was just disappointed. So don't watch this after something like 'The Social Network'.About 5/6 of the way in, the film completely messes things up before finishing brilliantly - it's clear that there were set pieces that were really well thought out, but filling in the gaps turned out to be an exercise in crap. I nearly stopped watching it, it turned into so much of a pantomime, but I was thoroughly rewarded for my perseverance.Overall, very good directing, turbulent (in terms of quality) story, suspenseful, terrible acting, awful characters and a good ending. However I was all ready to give this film a 9 or a 10 at some points, but then it dropped to about a four. I would've given it 5 if not for the ending, so be warned - IT GETS BAD.I was disappointed by this film, but there's a lot to be learnt from it. I'm not going to watch any of the sequels, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Amazing movie,"""Saw"" is a movie that was originally scheduled for a straight-to-DVD release. After positive reviews at a test screening, the green light was given for a theatrical release. The rest, as they say, is history.The plot is simple. Two strangers awake from a drugged stupor to find themselves chained in a decrepit, unused warehouse bathroom. With them are instructions by a psycho killer, which they must follow if they want out this room alive.The twist at the end is so amazing I think it makes the whole movie memorable.The only flaws I can see with this film is poor dialogue (sporadic -- not all the way through), bad acting (most notably from Leigh Whannell) and poor editing. But, we should cut the film makers some slack because they had a tight budget, and their result is something they should, and will be, proud of -- regardless of these flaws.Not so much of a horror movie, as some people tend to call it.

"High Potential, disappointing yield","This is a thriller genre flick that is full of unintentional humor. The transitions in this film were awkward, the plot flimsy and worst of all the acting was miserable (in the pathetic to the degree of hilarity sense.) I am not often a critic butcher of the films I see, but I simply do not understand the rating of 7.4 for this amateur hour joke. The surprise ending was a novel approach, but by no means worth $9. It is worth renting if you feel like aching with laughter at the unconvincing cries of Cary Elwes and Co. Basically this film is a cheap attempt at capitalizing on the success of films like ""7"" and Silence of the Lambs. Don't buy the hype!

See Saw,"Let the games begin. And so they did in the original 'Saw.' Crafty, original, simple and suspenseful this mystery/horror 'Saw' was. The unfortunate biggest flaw was not really the movie itself, but the torn-porn trend Hollywood jumped on and since, produced dozens upon dozens of imitations and far less quality pictures (including 'Saw's own sequels.) Aside from that, I was quite pleased, though disturbed (with the violence and gore) with the concept of a serial killer that doesn't kill. In 'Saw,' two men wake up in the dirtiest of scummy bathrooms, chained and armed with a mission (rules, if you will) to not only put all the pieces together on how to survive, but how to decipher on the reasons behind their imprisonment. Multiple flashbacks and exterior shots, whether presently or in the past, make the viewer actually think for once and try and solve their dilemma as well. I'm simplifying this, it was a great concept, and despite the low budget, excellently made. For those not used to horror, or in the trend previously mentioned: ""torture porn,"" this is not for the squeamish. It's enormously gruesome and hard to watch at times. However, I liked the message, though it was a rough ride to get to it. And the message? Simple: Appreciate life. If one can get past the gore and really listen to what the brains behind the operations – Jigsaw, then you'll get it too. In fact, take this as a lesson and go out to enjoy life now, before something like this happens to you. I'm kidding – I certainly hope this never happens. Years after Freddy, Jason, the 'Scream' ghost, Hannibal, et al, Jigsaw stands amongst them and played beautifully by the actor playing him.

See Saw,"Of course you can't beat the original, so why can't they leave it alone, instead of adding a chain of sequels. Films like this, whether being Hostel, Wolf Creek, or even The Hitcher, that 86 road movie masterpiece, how more memorable, desired, or talked about, would those originals be. Here is just another brilliant premise that works beautifully on the screen. I haven't heard screams coming from an audience (this coming fro m a pack of girls) like this in years. Elwes and Whannel pull of great performances, where I consider Elwes one of those great character actors. Here these two strangers awaken in what Whannel, perfectly terms ""a actual shithole"", that being a dungy washroom, where their arms have been chained. They're separated at both ends of this capacious room. As fate would have it, they're here for a reason, to atone or suffer for their sins so to speak. Some brilliant and clever psycho, the introduction of another evil great, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) The story flashes back a lot to establish how our two out of lucksters got here. Elwes, a doctor apparently neglects his family, and is doing a younger Asian inturn as well, where poor pathetic soul Whannel, has been paid to sneak pictures of em', where this history comes into play much later on. So meantime, we have our minds working up a lot of curiosity to why they're here. Inevitably one of the two has to make the big cut, using the saw they've been left with, and yes we have an unavoidable cringing scene, where some blood is shed. In flashback, we see some of Jigsaw's other victims, including a surviving one, (Shawnee Smith) who became a favorite in the next couple of pics, the sequel to this, having her settling a score with a cop, where she's actually thankful to Jigsaw. When viewing his reasons for becoming the monster he is, one can minorly sympathize. Saw is bloody two, and will have you wincing at some scenes, while you have the squeamish, just screaming. Too, as in flashbacks, concerning the victims, it's filmed in a lot of dungy green that works splendidly. Wan and writer Whannel have pulled off some special here, a real horror show, where Bell, though not really seen in this one, has been magnificent as the psycho Jigsaw, while bringing a human depth to him too. My Dad, a hard critic liked Saw, which I couldn't believe. He liked Seven too.

tension and tight direction,"Just as I thought that the horror/thriller genre had been put to rest due to the multitude of crap recently being offered by Hollywood, I have come across this peach of a film.Two men find themselves opposite each other chained to metal piping in a dilapitated toilet and just for good measure their is a dead body right in between them. They are mice in a trap waiting to be played with by their tormentor.This is a great concept and a solid foundation for the fun and games to come. The dynamics between the two men are great to watch. They know that they have to communicate with each other to escape but at the same time they know that their interests are not necessarily mutual.This is a genuine thriller to the end as it does not fall into any particular mold for too long because of the plethora of twists and turns. The tension throughout the film is thick and the direction is tight.If you liked Seven or Silence of the Lambs you are sure to like this film.

But, I really didn't see what Danny Glover's character had to do with the overall plot. I could have done without him. It's kinda graphic and gory, but nothing too over the top, all of it has its place in the movie. There was only one plot twist that I coudn't see coming from a mile away.

"Truly sick, demented, and awesome","I have to preface this review by admitting that I have not seen any of the 5 sequels (to date) that have turned this truly thrilling and original horror ditty into a ballyhooed franchise. Though I'm sure I will get through them all someday, I'm fairly convinced going in that none of them will do anything for me but detract from the power and mystery that surrounds the macabre events that unfold within this film's 100 minutes.Watching how expertly each piece of Jigsaw's puzzle falls into place, it's truly amazing to imagine that a first time film-maker is responsible for this modern classic. Both the premise and its execution are startlingly original, and the brilliant performances by all the actors involved here are especially great when you consider that this cast of largely seasoned pros were taking their cues from a rookie.The first time I watched Saw was a couple of years after its release, and I had managed to avoid learning anything about the plot or its intricacies. Going in cold made this film all the more horrifying, thus I'm not going to ruin that same rush here for those reading this who have remained insulated from clues to the movie's happenings by including anything resembling a spoiler in this write-up. All I knew going in was that Saw was a new type of horror film that sparked legions of would-be film-makers to crib its elements for a series of diminished clones, and that the ending was a real doozy. That assessment turned out to be absolutely right; this can arguably be called the first film of the modern horror era, much the way Scream kick-started the genre in the 90's.Without giving anything about the film away, it's hard to identify exactly why Saw deserves every bit of praise thrown its way. In a general sense, much of the genius here derives not only from the shocking and brutal horror contained herein, but in the way that horror is not the sole impulse driving the film. Horror films are not pornography, and too many film-makers (especially in the modern era that Saw helped spawn) seem convinced that a series of money shots are enough to build a movie around. Yes, you can make a good horror film by simply delivering the horror. But making a great horror film requires a bit more. A captivating and solid story surrounding the grotesque elements, which Saw definitely has, certainly helps. In fact, that seems to be the main ingredient that separates Saw from its inferior homages. We are immersed in the mystery here just as our characters are, and since we then identify with them, it lends even more weight to the gruesome fate that may or may not be in store for them.Certainly, other films since have outdone Saw in the gross-out department (probably even the other Saw installments... I'll let you know when I see them), but gore for gore's sake is sometimes not as potent as the shocks generated by the glimpses of carnage we see here. In fact, compared to what has come since, Saw is almost restrained in what it reveals. But, smart film-makers know that a viewer's imagination can conjure much worse than a film can show. That discipline is well-applied here.Many of Saw's copycats have utilized a strong sexual element to augment their violence, thus birthing the ""torture porn"" phenomenon. Though Saw is often pointed to as the flagship of that movement, such a comparison is both unfair and completely erroneous. There is absolutely no sexual component to Jigsaw's psychotic mind-benders, and that actually makes them more horrifying. After all, if there were sexual undertones in the equation here, that might give some motive to the wickedness. Not clearly knowing why a deranged killer does what they do makes them that much more unpredictable and frightening. We're given a vague idea of Jigsaw's motivation in the film, but ultimately the conclusion we come to is that the killer does what he does because the dude is just completely twacked in the head.Twist endings only work when they, well, work. In Saw, the final ""gotcha"" is so masterfully played that most viewers are going to want to start the disc over again to see how the film snuck up on them. The sense of dread and unease that this film left me with is one of the main reasons I haven't been clamoring to see any of the follow-ups. The story is so precisely crafted on its own, that the idea of adding anything else to it seems like it would detract rather than add anything substantial to the minor mythos explored here.I'll reserve my final judgement on those until I see them, but Saw stands on its own as one of the best horror film thus far this century, and the previous one too, for that matter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A bit of alright, I guess","'Saw' is a good film, if you haven't seen 'Se7en', that is.It has a promising story but the execution of its ideas is sub par. Creators Whannel and Wan have borrowed heavily from the far superior film 'Se7en' and this factor is incredibly annoying - paying homage to a film is fine, but not for basing the core of your plot from.The acting ranges from incredibly awful to mediocre - Adam reminds me of Ferris Beuller and I was waiting for him to admit what a big mistake skipping school was. The 'big' names (Danny Glover, Monica Potter, and I use the term 'big' loosely) seem bored and Glover doesn't seem to really give a f*** except to get paid whilst being worried.Despite many peoples thoughts, I found the ending to be a bit of fun, wasn't mind-blowing as many people are making it out to be.Hire it out but don't expect anything amazing.

The film grants you pieces of the plot like you're solving a jigsaw puzzle, as me begin to learn about the Jigsaw Killer, witnessing his various traps, all relatively simple for this first film, and you're trapped trying to figure out who is behind it all before time runs out.Cap it off with a twist of peak Shyamalanian proportions and you may have one of the best horror films of our time.

But wow, does it go downhill fast. Cary Elwes delivers one of the single worst performances I've ever seen from an actor over the age of 8. Some of his moments are laugh out loud funny, he's so egregiously bad. He should be embarrassed, given all the acting experience he's had. Leigh Whannell, with much less experience, is better, but only marginally. Some of his moments are also laughably bad. Together with a plot that quickly becomes insipid, and dialog that sounds as if it were written by a high school dropout, Saw is a pathetic example of its genre. More than that, the favorable reviews of it here on IMDb are an example of how idiotic the movie watching public has become. I can't believe Danny Glover associated himself with this.

These would be movie that are not only frightening but have depth and something that most so-called horror movie don't have: a plot! It premise is simple: two guys who don't know each other are shackled in room and don't know why they are there. From there the movie leads you on a downward spiral all the way to its surprising conclusion. Many horror movies think they scare you showing as many murders as possible.

wishes it were Sev7n but not nearly as clever,"This film was basically an expression of a writer's ability to come up with really twisted ways to kill people. There was little in the way of back plot, motive, or anything really substantial. It started to get deeper in the sense of character development but never really took that road anywhere.Overall Saw is just a poor imitation of Sev7n without much of the redeeming qualities. 'Saw' did have an interesting surprise twist at the end, however the more I thought about it, the more flaws and plot holes I found with it. Overall this film wasn't all that entertaining. While the suspense kept it going, its dependence on shock value as opposed to good writing and film making (some of the camera shots were ridiculous, e.g. a particular car chase) hurt it more than its twists helped.As a horror film I'd give this a 7/10. In general its a 5/10. Certainly not Silence of the Lambs, Sev7n, or The Ring caliber.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Movie choice,"Though the movie wasn't anything worth watching once a week, I must say that anyone with a name that alludes to Casablanca should NOT be watching a movie with obvious gore and/or gratuitous violence.The movie had a consistent story-line that didn't go too far ahead of the audience. At the same time, rhetorical situations like ""You can do this, or die,"" allow the audience for further participation VIA deciding if they would rather gut someone or die.The gore, albeit over-done, was tasteful. Though the masses are fairly uneducated in the fields of medicine, they know well enough that a romp through barbed wire can surely tear ones insides out.The situations were just odd enough for the average person to understand. One person may not know what it feels like to be cut with a scalpel, while another surely knows how it feels to walk through glass.A movie for someone who doesn't mind gore, and can see past it well enough to take in the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw Sucks,"Can someone please explain to me what the fascination is with this stupid film? It wasn't scary, the acting was sub-par at best (even veteran actors like Danny Glover and Cary Elwes looked like high school drama students), the dialogue was insipid (and at times, just plain stupid), and it was FULL of plot holes. Example: why was that Zep guy listening to the heartbeats of his victims? He wasn't kidnapping them for the joy in torturing them, but rather to save his own life. Why was he getting off on listening to their frightened heartbeats? Am I supposed to believe that the pawn that the brilliant Jigsaw used in his zany plot just happened to be crazy? Lame! Do gory scenes and clever little mind games and scenarios make up for all of the problems in this film? I don't think so. This is a tolerable film at best, but after watching it twice (I though maybe the first time I missed something; I certainly gave it more than a fair chance), I just don't get it. Can someone please enlighten me here?",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original Horror that will definitely keep you guessing!,"SAW was the final film of the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness program, and the most anticipated. I think it was the first, though not the only film to sell out Ryerson's huge (1200+ capacity) theatre. My hat, if I were actually wearing one, goes off to Colin Geddes (Festival Programmer) for always knowing exactly how to end the film fest.This film has everything you want from a horror movie. It has a few laughs, it's scary, extremely original, with interesting characters, a wicked soundtrack, and enough gore to make some audience members turn away. There aren't many films that have ever kept me guessing, and this is one.The first feature film from Australian director James Wan (written by himself and buddy Leigh Whannell, who stars in the film as Adam) was completed incredibly with only 5 days of pre- production and 18 days of filming. The, also Australian, Spierig Brothers (UNDEAD) even sent the SAW team a letter congratulating them and telling them they were in good hands with the Toronto audience. Australia is quickly becoming known for creating some of the best cult films in the world.I've also never wanted a movie prop, the reverse bear trap headpiece, so badly in my life. Too cool.SAW was so unbelievably good that it left me wanting more, and luckily the creative team hinted at a sequel featuring the twisted ventriloquist dummy that appears throughout the film. Hopefully, the big budget version of THE PUPPET MASTER that I always hoped for.DO NOT read or listen to anything about this movie, or someone might spoil it for you. See this movie as soon as possible! (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It was still a pretty good movie though. I wouldn't paid the 7 or 8 dollars to go to the cinema and see it. I'm kinda glad I only spent the 2 dollars to rent it.

Where Every Choice Cuts Deep,"Good evening, everyone! I'm Mr. C Reviewer, and tonight we'll be diving into the film Saw. I had the opportunity to watch the movie on Netflix. This movie originally premiered on January 19, 2004, and has a runtime of 1 hour and 43 minutes. It is rated for viewers aged 18 and older. Notably, parts of the film were filmed in California, USA. The estimated budget for Saw was around $1,200,000, and it grossed approximately $104,004,218. As someone on the autism spectrum, I found subtitles to be incredibly helpful, greatly enhancing my ability to follow the dialogue throughout the film. The film was directed by James Wan, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Leigh Whannell.Summary: In a dilapidated and forsaken bathroom, two unfamiliar men, Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon, regain consciousness, each bound to opposing walls by heavy chains. The only other presence in the grim setting is a lifeless figure sprawled between them, gripping a revolver in one hand and a tape recorder in the other-an object that holds the crucial information regarding their terrifying circumstances. As they grapple with the reality of their predicament, both individuals uncover tape recordings tucked away in their pockets, revealing that they are mere pawns ensnared in a sinister game.Review: -I found the opening sequence of the movie to be both intense and captivating, serving as a powerful introduction to its central premise. The film commences with a disorienting scene in which two men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon and Adam, awaken in a filthy bathroom, shackled to pipes. This immediate sense of entrapment creates a tense atmosphere that immediately grabs my attention. I appreciated how the film intricately weaves a complex tapestry of themes such as choice, morality, justice, psychological trauma, and societal values within its horror narrative. I appreciated the film's pacing, which maintained a brisk tempo that effectively sustained suspense throughout its intricate narrative. The swift transitions between shocking revelations kept me thoroughly engaged and on the edge of my seat. I appreciated how the film utilized flashbacks to enhance its pacing and tension, revealing crucial details about the characters' histories and their ties to Jigsaw. These sequences effectively built suspense, deepening the narrative by providing context for the protagonists' dire situations. They allowed viewers to piece together insights into Jigsaw's philosophy and methods, which significantly heightened my engagement with the story. The casting for the film was impressive, featuring a concise ensemble that enhanced the storytelling. The performances were strong and convincingly portrayed the characters' desperation and fear in a harrowing situation. Notably, Dr. Gordon's character arc illustrated a compelling shift from control to vulnerability as he faced overwhelming circumstances. Additionally, the actor playing Adam effectively captured the panic and confusion of being trapped while offering insightful glimpses into his character's psyche. The film's soundtrack resonated deeply with me, perfectly complementing the scenes and enhancing the intense atmosphere. I particularly admired the track ""Hello Zepp"" for its eerie melody and powerful crescendo, which effectively underscores key moments, especially during the climax when crucial plot twists unfold.-I appreciated the costumes and make up in the movie, particularly how they incorporated elements that made the clothing appear worn and dirty. This attention to detail enhanced the film's realism. Many movies often overlook such nuances, focusing instead on ensuring that actors look polished and tidy on screen, while avoiding a more gritty or grim aesthetic. I found it refreshing that this film chose not to shy away from that authenticity. The film's gore appeared quite realistic, though there is room for improvement; it was decent but not exceptional. I enjoyed the film's cinematography, which employed a variety of shot types to enhance its narrative. The gentle lighting established a nuanced atmosphere that I found appealing; however, while all the essential elements in each frame were distinctly visible, some parts could have benefited from additional brightness. Personally, I often adjust my screen's brightness for a better viewing experience, which proved particularly helpful during this film. The film's set design effectively establishes a claustrophobic and unsettling atmosphere that enhances its horror elements. The main setting, a dilapidated bathroom where the characters are chained, is grimy and oppressive, significantly shaping the film's tone. This environment amplifies feelings of despair and entrapment central to the narrative. The film's editing effectively employs rapid scene transitions that amplify the chaos and desperation felt by characters ensnared in Jigsaw's lethal game. Additionally, the dynamic camera movements during moments of distress heighten the intensity of each scene.-I appreciated the way the characters were introduced in the film and enjoyed uncovering their backgrounds. However, I felt that some aspects of character development were somewhat overshadowed by the focus on plot progression; still, this did not significantly diminish my overall enjoyment. As a child, I found the puppets particularly unsettling, as they had a creepy quality that left an impression on me.-While I found one or two elements somewhat predictable upon my initial viewing, I truly appreciated the ending. The film culminates in a surprising twist that caught me off guard and suggests the possibility of future instalments, some of which have already been released and are on my watchlist.I rate each film I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it a 9 Remember this was what I thought about the movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Trend-setting original!,"The 'Saw' franchise started out as a mystery thriller, as opposed to the gory, blood-soaked films that were to follow. The only real horror here was the suspense, and how the unknown gnawed at you.Mysterious from the very beginning, the film became more intriguing as it progressed. This is a very interesting investigative story, and exciting premise we haven't quite seen before. Throughout the film there were so many twists and turns to make you doubt everything. As more was revealed, more questions begged to be answered.'Saw' has a very clever, very original script that keeps the viewer engaged and guessing until the finale. Speaking of the finale, the third act is a roller coaster ride of fear and suspense. It is fast paced and cringe worthy - in a good sense! It's a heart pounding finale bound to keep you on the edge of your seat. There's a great twist ending you won't see coming. The film is so much better the second time around. Once you know the story, you'll know what to look for, and will be amazed at how well everything is set up.'Saw' was followed by seven sequels. Sadly, these were not nearly as captivating, and concentrated more on blood, guts and gore to shock the audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gave this one a chance after many years,"The horror genres has had it's ups and downs. The Universal Monster Movies and even the Hammer Horror films dominated in the 30's, 40's, and 50's. The 70's saw the beginning of the big slasher craze which went to dominate the 80's. By the time the 90's came around, the horror genre was stale. 1996's Scream rebirthed the horror genre and ironically by the time Scream 3 came out, the genre became stale yet again. It would not be until 2004 that the horror genre would experience another rebirth and it is all thanks to Saw. Saw started life as a script and after failed attempts to get a producer, a short film was made simply titled Saw or retroactively known as Saw 0.5. The short film caught the attention of producers and a film was made and released in 2004 and was a huge hit. While not a huge critical success, it made a lot of money. It had a small budget of only $1.2 million. Which was interesting because this is a Hollywood film with a really really small budget. The film was directed by James Wan who has went on to direct the Insidious movies and the Aquaman movies as well. The film stars Leigh Whannell who also produced this film and even went on to direct 2020's The Invisible Man. The film also stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon series) and that is only naming a few. The film was so popular that it went on to span a whole franchise of films and for the longest time had a movie released every year on Halloween.Two men wake up in a dirty room and they are chained to a pipe by the foot. They don't know why or even how they got there. But the person who left them there has left them instructions. One of them has to be dead by a certain time...... that is the game......I should first start off with my experience with the Saw franchise. I was first introduced to the franchise around 2006 or 2007 at a very young age. All I remember was people dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. It certainly left a mark on me to the point that years and years later, I refused to even watch any of the movies. It was only until my interest was peaked by someone talking about the franchise that I decided to give the series or at least the first film a chance. Let's just say that I am somewhat glad that I did. Despite people comparing this film to Seven, which to be fair there are some similarities, Saw is a really unique film. First off, the story is a really interesting story which would make for an interesting viewing. What makes it even more interesting is the low budget. Sure, I can obviously tell that this film was produced on a low budget whereas a film like Friday the 13th, I cannot tell. With that being said, there are some things that I will probably nitpick about but not take off much due to the low budget and short time that this film had in being made. With that being said, there are a lot of goofs but there is a sort of charm. The whole low budget feel is rather charming in fact. The hard metal music video style of editing is not my cup of tea and feels dated but is apart of this film's identity. There are extensive uses of flashbacks within flashbacks. This is can be confusing. For me, only a little. For the average viewer, very. But it works with the whole mystery aspect. It is all over the place but in a way that makes sense in the end. From what I gather, this all continues in the sequels. Which leads me to talk about the ending which does have a big reveal and a rather good one too. The reveal gives us just enough and leaves the viewers with a lot of questions which would be answered in the next film (from what I gather). The horror aspect of this film is very psychological and I really dig that. It is done very well in this film when it is present. Sure, there is a whole cop plot and stuff which is not as interesting but the horror is pretty good. Something about being locked and chained in a dirty room with a complete stranger is really scary. The setting is really good for this film and I really like it. The whole Saw franchise is famous for it's traps and this film has a few good ideas but mostly not shown in great detail. The focus is not on the traps but rather the game between our two main characters which I think is fine. But the kills are done fairly well despite not showing too much which is not a bad thing. Leave it up to the imagination. The acting is not great. At times it is pretty bad and maybe even laughable with some line deliveries. But there are some moments where it is really good and believeable too.Saw changed the horror genre. Despite it's overall reputation in the series, it is definitely something to check out if you have not already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Every puzzle has its pieces,"I would think everyone knows the movie Saw (2004) and how much it left an affect in the genre of horror movies, especially since it is very brutal and gory. I can understand why there are certain people who do not like this movie or this whole franchise, but I like the first movie Saw (2004) and think it is a good horror/mystery thriller. Also, director James Wan did a wonderful job directing the movie and giving the movie a dark and creepy feel to it so you can take it seriously and get invested.The acting is good, and the performances from the actors were believable when they were panicking and trying to figure out how they got into a situation like this. Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes as Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon who are the victims stuck in this game the Jigsaw killer has made for specifically for them; both main victims have something to do with the game because of their past or what they do to others or themselves which builds on the mystery on who the Jigsaw killer could be when certain things are revealed.No spoilers for the people who have not seen this movie, but the Jigsaw killer's reveal was interesting and disturbing, and the well-known puppet on the tricycle that shows up at end or beginning of the trap has a creepy design, along with the traps by the Jigsaw killer being creepy and disturbing with it also being brutal. The setting with it taking place in this rundown dirty bathroom is disturbing, when there is gore, it is brutal, and the mystery to the movie is good on trying to figure out the Jigsaw killer is and how he would know his victims and what they do.There are a lot of people who like this movie, but I understand why there are people who do not like this movie; the movie is not liked mostly because they cannot handle the gore and dismemberment that comes from the victims in the traps. Saw (2004) has a good mystery and it is suspenseful whenever these victims are in these traps, and the Jigsaw killer is a good antagonist for a movie like this along with there being traps that weirdly designed. This movie might not be everyone's favorite, but I liked it, and I am sure there are people out there who agree with me, considering this movie is a well-known horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
See Saw?  DON'T!,"I am quite impressed with the amount of good reviews on this website in regards to SAW. Usually people are much more cynical with their opinions on a horror movie.... Those reviewers who say SAW is a psychological movie are half right. Psychologically there's a lot to discuss, like how stupid would someone have to be to look over the obvious plot holes to say this movie is ""good"" entertainment. How A.D.D. are we as an audience that instead of a movie moment with true suspense we instead get a Nine Inch Nails music video interlude inappropriately thrown in. First things first: the acting is beyond terrible. Even for Danny Glover, but to his credit is working with a cheesy and laughable dialogue. Cary Elwes is downright terrible, the worst acting I have seen this year. An evil bad guy who broods about saying in dark cartoon voices ""I AM SICK OF THE DISEASE OF THE WORLD"" is scary? The actions of nearly all the characters are flat out illogical, even with a hearty amount of suspension of disbelief. I find it amusing that people justify this flick by accusing bad reviewers of being brainwashed by constant eye candy from high budget studio pictures, when clearly ""SAW"" tries to disguise a bad movie with exactly that, loads of technical eye candy. This movie would have been much better had it just stuck to a simple story. It was an original idea that went to waste with complicated & unnecessary ""plot twists"" and poor execution from a freshman writer and director. Its a shame that such a promising movie became such a complete waste of time & money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie is another example of low budget turned big boy horror, just like with Halloween and Friday the 13th. The main criticism for this movie is Leigh Whanells acting, which can be a bit bad in some scenes, but I think he did well overall. His acting really shines through at the end. That leads me to my other point, the ending! The plot twist in this movie is one of the best in cinema history and no other Saw film will probably ever come closer to it!

The best horror seems dominated by Japan with such masterpieces as Audition and The Eye, but the French are creeping up steadily with original films like Irreversible, In My Skin, Trouble Every Day and Switchblade Romance.

But I feel that Hostel, one year later, is more representative of the horror movies of of the decade. I am not denying the impact this film had, but now it is an odd film because it feels old and not in line with this type of movies anymore. I felt the acting was fake, as well as the make-up.

Great Movie,"One of my favorite movies of all time, as in the movie some things were obvious but flipped around to something completely different that you wouldn't expect.

Although not one of your traditional blood-bathed movies of it's kind, it's stands out completely of the genre which is one of the factors that makes it so great.

"thrilling, but...","I just finished watching Saw and wasn't exactly amazed by the movie. It did one thing very well- it was scary. It had everything people in this day and age are afraid of- from the idea of rotting alone in a dark room to creepy dolls to the suspense of a killer lurking just around the corner. However. The acting was sub par to say the least. The actors who were well known (Glover, Potter, Elwes) gave possibly the poorest display of acting in each of their careers. Having Elwes in a serious role for one thing... I had to contain my giggles throughout most of the movie. In my head I kept envisioning him rolling down the side of a mountain screaming ""as you wishhhhhh..."" The unknown actors (Whannell for example) bothered me from the beginning with his strained and obviously forced fear. Also, the movie contained too many twists to follow. I myself am a big fan of subplots and twists, but it seemed that right around every corner was a new twinge in the story, connecting more of the characters together. It got to the point where you were tired of trying to figure out ""who done it"" and just wished it would be over and the good guys would win. Despite the harsh words, it is worth seeing if you have 4 dollars to blow at Blockbuster... and the stomach for extreme bloodshed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Flashbacks indicate the entire investigation, in which one of them was a suspect, leading all the way to the present.Filmed in a very creative and clever way, dealing with the crazy and insane mind of film making, using fast forward crazy camera zooms and techniques to make every scene intense as ever. Every scene puts you on edge.Scary not in a visual way or jumpy way, but a psychological way, dealing with scary ideas that will keep on your mind for a long time. Deals with a different scare that other movies could never carry on, (besides the others).Can get a little cheesy at times, like some of the acting performances by Leigh Whannell, who may not have been taking this seriously. Some actors act a little goofy, but only when things are calm. As soon as things heat up, no more playing around.All together, a beautifully filmed thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Hard to not enjoy if you're into being scared the crap out of. Definitely one of the scariest of the decade. Followed by Saw II, and a bunch of other pointless sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing horror film,"Here it is people: the film that jump-started the entire torture sub-genre of horror films. One of the best horror films to ever grace the cinema in all of its existence, Saw creeps up unexpectedly and really gets to you when you're least expecting it. I wasn't expecting much from this first movie in a series. I had heard buzz about it at school, lots of things from my favorite websites online months before it came outit sounded like it would be a decent movie. Little did I know, Saw would completely blow my mind and become one of my favorite films of all time well, at least until I saw the sequel, which was superior in ever way, shape, and form. I viewed Saw a week after it came out in theaters, and I was so far from being disappointed. I went in with very few expectations, and I came out shaking, moved, scared. Saw is an amazing movie.Saw is written by Leigh Whannel, who also starred in the film as Adam, and over the course of three movies has managed to become one of my favorite actors. This guy can really write, too! He knows what scares people, and he really uses it to his full advantage. The dialogue is top-notch and really hits hard, especially in the final act. The ending is, by far, the best ending I've ever had the good fortune of witnessing, and it is probably the best twist ending in a movie ever. James Wan is behind the director's chair in this picture in collaboration with Leigh, and they do a sensational job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Two men fall victim to and try to outsmart a psychopath trying to teach people a cruel life lesson by having them fight to stay alive.,"There were a couple problems that should be pointed out. The acting, for one, it's a bit underdeveloped. Also, there are several minor, yet distracting, details left out of the movie.I think that if this movie had been thought through just a little bit more it could have been quite the horror film. Danny Glover did a wonderful job, but I the other actors left a lot to be desired...They didn't really tug at the audiences emotions as much as they could have. There is no doubt that this film could have gone a lot further than it did.That being said I can't really deny the creativity of this movie. Overall I thought it was pretty imaginative (in a very morbid sense). Obviously this movie isn't for the faint of heart, but if you like gory horror flicks or just horror movies in general this would be a very good movie to see.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Only if it wasn't filmed in such a B-Grade setting,"I remember Saw being one of my first movies ever. And I've always remembered this movie as an exploitative torture film. But upon my review, boy was I wrong. I actually kinda liked it. The cinematography was a little too chaotic for my choice, but it was right on the theme.Now, the fact that this movie raised a cult following of people who treat torture horror as porn, is hysterical considering this film actually preaches a nice philosophy.

One of the best horror movies,I really loved the mix between mystery and the horror,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Bark, no bite","You can believe a certain amount of the hype surrounding James Wan's shocker. It's gory, gruesome, garish and does succeed in plummeting the audience into some butt-clenching scenarios. There is also a semi-interesting narrative, as various character arcs dovetail. But Saw doesn't have the courage of its convictions. Finally, it's a damp squib of horror flick with a promising start.The Jigsaw killer has evidently taken inspiration from Seven's John Doe. He's never directly 'murdered' anyone  depending on how you define murder. Instead, he places people into a revolting situation: if you don't undertake the unthinkable you die. To escape a gory, grotesque fate, you must do something horrible. I could give you a detailed example of Jigsaw's plans, but I'll just throw these words at you: razor wire, slow-acting poisons, important items that have been force-fed and (my personal favourite in the best bit) jaw-breakersSome may be enticed with the film's ballsy stance. I was, certainly. It's been a long while since cinema, whether it be mainstream or independent, has truly gone for abject horror that is not simply gore, but thematic. I'm talking about something revolting, something prepared to send the audience reeling. Something that rejects taste and intends to appal. I wanted to see a film like that. He he he he he There haven't been many really go-for-the-gut-and take-the-head-for-afters horror flicks since the '70s. Well, that's what I think, and I thought Saw could fill the void. I was wrong.The first third of Saw is promising, to say the least. Jigsaws actions are introduced in a neat flashback technique, and the opening moments are the equivalent of kick to the head. The film forces you against the wall with a battery of editing, flash images, monstrous carnage and some terrifying moral implications. AND THEN IT BACKS OFF!!!Saw becomes tiresome. The twists and turns aren't particularly surprising, not do they add to the film's impact, and slowly but surely, Wan trivialises the monstrosity of his set up, resorting to classic race-against-time plotting and an unimaginative ending. The film's cinematography and production design are fine at the start, but they fail to build on the urban Gothic themes, so what you see in the first act is about all the film has to offer stylistically. The characters are your stock types, and all credit to the actors for having real gumption: they look the part and manage to portray unthinkable suffering very well.But ultimately Saw is not a film that'll haunt you, because it loses sight of its terrifying premise, failing to make it really possible to the audience. You won't come away thinking: 'that could happen to me'.The films feels sealed inside a bubble, unable to escape into the auditorium, which is what films like The Living Dead Trilogy and Rabid (to name but a few) did. In short: maybe enough for a night out, but nothing to take home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great thriller,"One of the best thriller/mysteries to come out in a while. This film just trapped me n engaged me from the beginning. The performances were first rate, the plot was perfectly crafted, screenplay was written pretty carefully and crafted perfectly. I liked Elwes a lot in this film, just shows how much of a talented actor he is. Wan did a great job with this project, this is one of my favorite thrillers ever. The screenplay is what shocked me because it was perfectly written with great funny parts and good story telling scheme. The cast delivered and the suspense was exhilarating throughout the film. This is one of those films a lot of people liked and i thought would be regarded by me as overrated, however i was wrong, its worth the recognition it receives. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Mindblowing, unique, one-of-a-kind horror MILESTONE","Of all Saw movies, this is, by far, not only the BEST in the series, but it's also the least graphic, and therefore most ""tame"" entry, and the best to show anybody, even your parents, as long as they're ok with a bit of gore and a not-so-happy theme.I'm really trying hard here not to totally geek out over this film, and spoil any surprises. In summary, the acting is fantastic, the writing is superb, and it leaves little to no imagining to how, or why, there have been SEVEN sequels, with another (and who knows HOW many more) in the works.Looking past its grim atmosphere, it's beautiful. If you love to analyze movies, this one's for you. If you don't give a crap about a ""deeper meaning"" to a film, and rather just be entertained, this one's for you. Gore hound? It's the least gory of all Saw movies, but it's still for you. Love stories? Surprising endings? Character development? Something relatable?

I just SAW one heck of a movie!,"Finally! Its about time i got a horror movie with an actual plot. I've been watching all the classic slasher movies, but now i found the one that deserves some respect. This movie offers a lot of fun ( in a sick way),for people who want to see some truly horrorfying scenes, this is the movie. A common issue i keep hearing is that this is so fake, and it is, but it has such a well thought out plot and an creepy intelligent villain: Jigsaw! I do have trouble sometimes with keeping up with the plot, trying to understand what characters say. what's going on, and then i have to watch the movie again to figure out what is going on. I do think that this is all about the torture traps, I don't see how these traps can truly help a person with their problems, but i care so much about the victim, I just want to see what happens to him/her. Overall, not that bad. It's not something to watch often or on family movie night, but it's great for parties and friends.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Dear James Wan, Please don't make a second Saw!","Mullholland Drive, Terminator 3, Shanghai Knights, and Speed 2 were the bottom of the chum barrel for me. Then along came this movie and wow! It was conceptually a good idea. But the execution was awful. Actually awful would be a compliment. Our theater was in an uproar of laughter when the film was supposed to be at it's scariest and most intense moments.To explain how horrible this film was is almost impossible. It's almost worth renting to see how to NOT make a movie. I joined IMDb only to put in this review. People need to know what's up before they waste $1.99 at the Wherehouse.I'd compare watching Saw to rubbing wasabi in your eyes while drinking pepper spray when walking on shards of glass in a room filled with agent orange. I know it's a horror and the acting is supposed to suck... But Carey Elwes reached a new low. His performance was so brutally bad that it made is role in ""Robinhood: Men in Tights"" look Oscar worthy. His accent kept changing throughout the film like Madonna's did in the 90's. He was just so bad. I love Danny Glover but he was so miscast in this p.o.s. that it was unfair to him as an actor. His part should have been played by Beetlejuice from Howard Stern or Bobcat Goldthwait. Then maybe it would have been believable.This brings me to James Wan. Is his dad the producer? Who would look at this movie and go, ""Yep! We got a masterpiece!""? The editing, directing, and acting were super sketchy and it is James Wan's fault. He needs to not make a movie ever again. Now someone is producing a sequel to Saw for him to direct? If you want a scary film see the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Winnie the Pooh's Heffalump Movie. If you want the side splitting comedy of the year get Saw. I'm going to go swallow some thumb tacks now.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Ending Ever,The ending by itself with that twist plus great acting and music makes this movie the best thriller/horror film of all time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
YES,"Okay so, currently hyperfixated on saw so I can go on a whole rant. This movie is such a good start to the franchise as it presents the ideas further enforced in the later movies even if it's only on a surface level. Even the traps present in this movie really shine through with the reverse bear trap being iconic and even then, such a good trap I love it.Not to mention, this movie only had a small budget, which yes can be noticed at some times like the distinct less blood and gore that in the following movies but, the movie does really come together to be something great in the end, greatly utilising everything they can.The characters in this movie are great too! The dynamic between Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom is really something interesting and that alone should be a good reason to watch the movie if you've yet to see it.The plot twist at the end is just... AMAZING! It's such a shocking event if you go into the movie blind so if you've managed to stay away from hearing anything about it, go watch it please and experience it for yourself.Even though after a few watches the twist loses it's shocking nature, the film has really good re-watchability (for me at least, i keep noticing things i didn't see before.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"One of the best horror/thrillers since The Shining, and possibly the best ending ever-----8/10","Saw crept up on us like Jigsaw creeps on his victim. Completely out of nowhere but not easily forgotten. The movie starts of in a large bathroom where two men are chained up and a dead man is lying between them. They don't who each other is or how they got there. The script by Leigh Whannell (who also plays one of the captives) is ingeniously clever and very twisted especially when showing different victims in various booby traps and deadly. My favorite is the guy that is locked in a room with numbers all over the wall. A taped message tells him there is poison in his veins and that the antidote is locked in a safe in the room. The combo to the safe is hidden in the numbers on the wall. However, the room is dark and he has to use a candle, but his body is smeared with a flammable goop. Oh and there is broken glass shards on the floor. Now only a truly sick individual can come up with something like that. The movie really isn't as gory as many people believe, but it wouldn't make a difference in a movie that actually relies on mystery rather than horror. The whole movie is really solid, but the part that makes the movie a highly rewatchable classic is the brilliant ending. I promise you will be shocked at the ending. Even after the third viewing it had my heart pounding through my chest. This movie also kicked off an interest in me for independent films. They seem to be made with more TLC than most Hollywood stuff, but of course since this movie made big bucks at the box office it is turning into a franchise with two sequels in two years. Neither will be as entertaining as the original and not too many movies have the ability to make you watch it over and over. Bravo! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Disappointed that I didn't watch this sooner!,"I know I'm pretty late to the party here, but there's a reason for that that I need to explain for other's that might have been in a situation like mine.I've put off watching this for so long due to hearing so many things about the Saw series and how they're just torture porn with no story and I generally like a really strong storyline or I'm not interested.Turns out Saw (2004) is not much like it's sequels and actually has a strong storyline along with its gore.This one in particular plays out more like a pycological horror/thriller/mystery instead of gore for no reason (it's honestly not as gory or scary as you'd think at all and isn't every two seconds)It's sequels were lacking the surprise and story that the original has, the only one I found better than the rest was Saw 5, due to being more coherent. It's frustrating that the rest just threw continuity out the window and got more absurd each movie and imo disrespected what made the first one so good.The twist at the end really was as good as I've heard! I really do wish I would've tried this one sooner.So if you've heard about the Saw franchise like I have and aren't interested in gore with no story, I'd advise trying this one out, it really is different than the rest of the movies you hear about!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Above Average Horror Film,"In general I have one genre that I just don't like and that is Horror. I find a lot of them dull and predictable riddled with jump scares that are cheap at best. But I thought with the new Saw film Spiral coming out next month I would take this time to watch this franchise through for the first time and that starts here with my review for the first Saw film. The premise of the film sees two men locked up in a room when they realise they a part of a serial killers twisted game.Main Character
Leigh Whannell and Carley Elwes play the two men who are locked up and I think they did an alright job. They both sell the situation they are in pretty well and you do feel for them and want to see them get out of this whole situation. The film also does a decent job of exploring their outside lives and the possible reasons that they are in this whole situation. But at times I though both of them leaned into horror film genre 101 and just started screaming and being all over the top and it just didn't work. I think they were meant to be serious but they came across as a little bit funny.Supporting Characters
Danny Glover plays a detective on the hunt of the killer and he is good here. Glover is a pretty big name so he does stand out in this film, his character is interesting enough and at least for me it got to a point where I had to start question his motivations. Michael Emerson has a smaller role but plays it well enough here. But the rest of the cast just aren't given much to work with, it's not that they are terrible it's just there is no reason to really care.Story
The story is really interesting, the film does a really good job of putting the audience in a similar situation to the main characters as to knowing what exactly is going on. It also succeeds in showing the backstory to both of these characters and the killer themselves so it isn't just a simple horror film but one that stands out more. Also there is a twist at the end of the film that is fantastically done and I legitimately did not see it coming which doesn't happen that often these days.Script
The script is fine, it has some decent dramatic moments and dialogue to it and as I mentioned that twist which is really well realised. But there are also some cheesy horror trope moments that don't quite work and there is no escaping that there are certain parts of the film that do feel a bit generic, at least to me.Style
The film is really good at creating a very intense atmosphere and feeling of suspense. There isn't as much gore as I was expecting which is fine by me and the jump scares are at a minimum which is a good thing. But I did feel like the film was a little long, maybe 10 to 15 mins could have been chopped off as I though the 2nd act dragged itself out a little too much. Also this film hasn't aged that well, there are some pretty outdated filming techniques and sound issues that are noticeable.Overall
Overall, Saw is an above average Horror Film. I had a decent time watching this film and felt pretty engaged by its plot and lore that is created. I mean it isn't a film that is that revolutionary but if you like horror then this is one for you and if you aren't then this isn't the one that is going to convert you in my mind.Rating - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's enduring legacy for 'torture porn' is unfair aswell as overstated,"I watched ""Saw"" for the first time just over ten years ago. I was very underwhelmed by it, and only ever watched one of its sequels after that as a result. Re-watching it last night with a fresh perspective, two things were evident. The first was that this is a far better film than I had originally given it credit for. Two, its enduring legacy and reputation for 'torture porn' has been unfairly overstated over the years.'Saw' is more like 'Se7en' than anything else, with its thriller elements far outdoing the surprisingly minimalistic gore that is presented. But in finding the film's reputation to be unfairly overstated this also means that I find it to be overrated aswell. While it has a lot going for it - the aforementioned 'Se7en' traits are its high point, the film also boasts a superb brooding and uncanny atmosphere. The shots are well-lit in how dark they are and serves first-time director James Wan very well. I detected a few Noir traits in certain scenes with Danny Glover's character sitting in dimly lit offices and rooms, obsessing over finding the serial killer Jigsaw. Which brings me on to Tobin Bell's performance as the titular killer because he absolutely steals the show. His legacy as one of the best and most iconic horror villains up there with Myers, Voorhees and Kruger is certainly not overstated now that his first appearance is almost 20 years old.Unfortunately, what hinders ""Saw"" for me is just how much it tries to do. There is an awful lot going on here, and the action switches between many scenes and even through time to the point that it becomes a little daunting. The editing is sharp, however, but the lead performances are just a tad overwrought and some of the script needed trimming to get rid of the bad dialogue and talky points. As ten years had elapsed between my viewings, the infamous twist ending, I can say, has caught me out twice, so I tip my hat to 'Saw' for that...",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent Thriller,"Pretty low-budget and filmed in just a few days, James Wan's controversial debut ""Saw"" quickly grew out to be one of the more successful horror franchises of the 21st century, even though all its sequels, with no exceptions, are dread-awful, uninspired gorefests, whereas the original actually has a lot of suspense going on for it next to all the creative torture. The twist at the end (the reveal of Jigsaw's identity)'s quality is debatable, but I found myself very intrigued and satisfied by it. Doesn't make it the big leagues (Hitchcock! Kubrick!) quality wise, but it's no doubt worth a watch if you want to see horror done right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Saw has an interesting fresh story, but it's very unrealistic.","The Saw series has really come impressively far with 4 sequels in just a minimum of 4 years. They mostly got worse as they went along but never mind that for now. Saw is about 2 men who wake up chained to pipes at different ends of a dirty abandoned warehouse bathroom. They cannot reach other but in the middle of the room is a dead man, with a gun with one bullet in his hand. One is named Dr Gordon (Cary Elwes) and the other is a young guy named Adam (Leigh Whannel). After finding tape recorded messages they realize they are being held captive by the elusive Jigsaw killer. Dr Gordon is told he only has a few hours to kill Adam or his wife and kid will die. The Jigsaw killer is explained in the papers as kidnapping people he finds undeserving of life, and puts them through grisly tests which they can survive if they try hard enough. While Adam and Dr Gordon try to work out their game, 2 other stories are occurring at the same time. Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) is a discharged cop obsessed with finding the Jigsaw killer, and his main suspect is none other than Dr Gordon. Meanwhile Dr Gordon's wife and daughter are being held captive in order to interlock with his game. As the hours tick down and time gets shorter, the two strangers must fight for survival before it's too late.Saw is a grisly film with a script full of twists and turns. The plot itself is original and kept my interest, but if you ask me there's no imaginable way something like this could happen in real life. The characters become more developed and shady as the film progresses. The actors playing these characters are not great, in fact some of their acting moments are down right laughable. This is probably Danny Glover's worst performances since I was shaking my head at some of the lines he had to say. Saw is not very scary relying more on suspense and shock moments. However the Jigsaw villain is quite interesting as with a sinister motive and a mysterious allure. Now for the blood and gore levels. The movie is really not as gory as it was made out to be, but that does not mean it doesn't have its nasty moments, because believe me it does. The traps are intriguing and creative, but not realistic at all. Jigsaw would have to be an engineering mastermind and have lots of available money in order to create them. Since he's constantly on the run from police and is such a shady person, it is very hard to believe.The writer of the film Leigh Whannel, who also plays the role of Adam, shows talent in the horror genre. His story creates an eery situation with more going on than meets the eye. The one most believable point of the movie is the two men chained up in the room, who react exactly how anybody would if put in a situation like this. However I don't think Leigh Whannel should have been a main character because he's not very good at acting, he's okay in some parts but when he has to scream and yell I'll bet anything the theater laughed their heads off. The director James Wan also seems to be very talented. With the help of the cinematographers he creates an extreme, and I mean extreme, sense of style to Saw. However it really starts to get annoying after a while. For instance every time we get a flashback to one of Jigsaw's past traps the camera changes angles at lightning speed, spins around the victim real fast, and flashes bright lights and colors in your eyes. I thought I was going to go blind which obviously meant the editing and cinematography styles went way too far over the edge. It would have added a lot to the creepiness if they kept everything still and relaxed, but instead the filmmakers abuse this technique style and ruin any scary aspect of the film, at least in my opinion.Saw was very suspenseful to the point where I had to see it to the end. It draws you in with its strange atmosphere, and the characters evolve to the point where I got pretty interested in how it would all end up. Believe me the climax of the movie is really fulfilling and a true ""I never saw that coming"" moment. Although the movie is not great it will still please horror lovers. I give Saw a 2.5 out of 4. I expected blood and gore but got more than that. The sequels however are a whole other story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Disturbing / Scary ~ Not bad all round film.,"Well I viewed saw because I was looking for a random movie to watch. Surprisingly I don't actually recall too many scares in this film. Then again that's also probably cause I've sorta gotten acquainted with the Thriller/Horror etc genre now.It's a lot better than Seven, which was just 100% disturbing and causing you to either puke or turn away before you're naturally inclined to. The film as most have already said is one of those intellectual (""We drop 500 hints which most of you won't piece up till the end when we do it for you"") puzzles. There are a few scenes and events which will make you think: ""Yea saw that one coming"" Especially the final twist ;)You can't blame the film however, it does a pretty good job overall and through some good effort manages to steer clear of ending up with too many ""i saw that one coming"" style bibs & bobs.

I've heard a lot of people complain that Cary Ewles acting seemed over the top in this but I didn't notice it. Overall this is a pretty solid thriller.

Surprisingly good,"Imagine waking up in a strange, dirty room with your foot in a shackle, a stranger in the same predicament across the room, and a bloody, dead body in between the two of you. That is the situation Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) finds himself in, along with Adam (Leigh Wannell) in James Wan's surprisingly good second film, ""Saw"". Gordon and Adam soon discover that their captor is a now-notorious psychopath who puts people into horrible situations as a masochistic life lesson, the results being that most of them have died, with the exception of a drug addict who wakes up to find her head encased in a huge metal helmet that will blow her jaw apart unless she takes the key to the device out of the stomach of the dead man on the floor of the room. The real trick comes when she realizes that the man isn't dead after all, but has to kill him anyway in order to ensure her survival. The two present captives now have to follow the clues given and try to trust one another, even though Gordon's instructions are to kill Adam in order to A) Survive and B) Ensure the safety of his wife and daughter, both of whom are being held at gunpoint at their home. Trying to track down the killer is detective David Tapp, a man who has become obsessed with the case (as they usually do in these films) and, because of circumstantial evidence, believes the killer to be none other than Dr. Lawrence Gordon.""Saw"" begins abruptly, when the two men come to in the strange room, leaving the audience with no idea what is going on. This was an excellent move on director Wan's part because we know as much as the victims know at that point, and for the most part, with a few exceptions, throughout the film. There are no real scary moments, but there is a lot of creepiness that brings to mind the film ""Se7en"", though it isn't nearly as fantastic. The tag line for the film states ""Every piece has a puzzle"" and that is definitely true about the film. It is intricately done and really made me consider and reconsider several theories, because once you think you know the answer, it turns out that you probably don't. The cinematography was very stylish and flashy, (I wouldn't be surprised if Wan honed his skills as a video director before making feature films) and the pacing was very tight. The only real complaint I had was Danny Glover's performance; not that he was ever a fantastic actor, but I've seen him do so much better than in this film, so I don't know if it was an issue of direction or he's just kind of hit a wall in his craft, but I found myself rolling my eyes a bit during some of his scenes.Overall, I enjoyed ""Saw"" though it's one of those films that you really don't need to see a second time because once the shocks are over with, there really isn't a whole lot more to experience upon repeat viewings. I think the fact that I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of the film pushes it to a 6/10. I look forward to seeing Wan's future work.--Shelly",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interestingly frustrating!,"This film left me mad and frustrated, if that was the intention then well done! But i didn't like the fancy camera work, it didn't fit in with the rest of the film i thought. I also thought the two guys acting was a little suspect. As for the comparisons to Seven i couldn't really identify it. Although this was a psychological horror of sorts it wasn't in the same vein as Seven. It definitely wasn't particularly gory or as scary as it was hyped up to be either, i went in expecting to see some pretty horrific things and didn't. It was also full of flashbacks which weren't confusing but it added to my frustration with the film.The little twist at the end though did leave me a little stunned for a second, which was obviously the intention!I just feel it could of being a lot better than it was, but it definitely left an impression on me so they did something right!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A One-Time Watch,"Saw is highly regarded as one of the most influential horror movies of the 21st century. If the role of the movie is to disturb the viewer and make them question their own actions, then it succeeds in its goal. However, any movie even if it is a Horror flick, must have characters which you can root for, who are able to enable the viewer to feel the emotions that the characters are feeling. Due to budget constraints, the filmmakers decide to lock the two leading characters inside a room which ensures a claustrophobic atmosphere that complements the paranoia engulfing these men. Due to its short run time, the characters feel underdeveloped and because of that we can never truly feel any sorrow for them. A common problem to all the movies to the horror genre is that most of the plot is filled with clichés which have already been done in other movies. Saw is no exception and it can get a bit irritating to see things that you have seen in countless other horror movies. The movie is not very simple to understand and will confuse some viewers. I did not particularly enjoy watching this movie but everyone should watch it and form their own judgement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Salt in the bleeding wound!,"To start with I'd like to recommend this flick to everybody who's searching for a mentally gripping horror movie. Here it is.But to say it aloud I don't really recommend it in every sense. Again it succeeded to open a mental wound and stray salt in it to gain such a hype around a low budget movie which was in fact solely entertaining but sometimes not consistent in its meaning.In my opinion the idea of setting up such a scenery is something innovative but in order to scare the viewer it should have stuck more to rational sense of logic. For instance the scene where Detective Sing shotguns Jigsaw in the back, the killer slams to the floor, recovering and then continuing his escape from his hideout. The irrationality of it, is firstly that Jigsaw had sustained a serious wound in the back which should have restricted him in his plans, secondly that this hideout was from this point on known to the cops but as we all know was later reoccupied by him or Zeb in one later scene.Well, at least for me it has decreased the dread-factor of the movie along with some other twists which appear rather illogical to me.Why do I rate this movie 6 then?Evidently the message of this movie is ""what would you do to survive?"" or better formulated ""Do you appreciate your life? If you can't answer this I have to show you how horrible it could be by exposing your weaknesses to depict how beautiful life can possibly be.""At the end of the movie I thought ""Hey this movie conveyed a true message, we all live like numb primates and have all individual weaknesses without knowing them."" And with this insight despite all potential plot twist which are a matter of opinion I admit that SAW fulfilled it sense lately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An amazing start to a new movie series.,"The plot is very well thought up, but way to little gore :(",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Being different...,"I was truly looking forward to see this movie. It was one of the most talked about films from the last months. Some consider it as one of the best movies of 2004; some think it's a terrible movie; some didn't get it; some were amazed by itOne friend of mine, who loves movies, or so I think, told me: ""It was too weird for my taste""; and another friend said it was great. Maybe I'd explain ""Saw"" from the first idea (although I won't), but I would never start from the second one.The movie is different in its own good. Different is great, and more when it comes to horror movies (wait, ""Saw"" is not exactly horror, but I'll explain later). It's one of the bravest movies in the genre I've seen in a while. It commences with James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who are probably close friends and workers. I imagine they had this incredible idea that could step out of everything we watch every day, and developed it. Later, it became a phenomenon. What they got with the project? Recognition and probably (although not luckily) success. Wan has an eye for this stuff. His style is riveting as it is exuberant and in some way trapping. He got his team, he worked hard and that's why he generated what he generated.The special effects in the movie seem exaggerated but unforced at the same time, so they can seem realistic. Julie Berghoff, for a first important job, did an outstanding job designing the production. Excellent visuals in this piece. Mysterious sceneries and characters wander through the set; prepared for anything. When Wan uses the typical compilation of scenes with strong sounds, so everything seems scary and freaky (then we can say ""weird"" here); or when we sense the problems the movie has with time, because during most of the film you can't tell if a thing is happening or if it has happened We just keep watching, and don't care about it, because he has done the rest so well (but we still can't forgive him everything).Don't say about the narrative. Both Wan and Whannell managed to create realistic characters that are also quirky. I mean; quirky is common in movies from the genre, butRealistic? Not common at all. Then he drives us to his unbelievably original story, which involves the ""weirdest"" villain mask since ""Scream"". This plot is extremely intelligent, dealing with the issue that a crazy sadistic killer bastard might have the purpose to save people trying to take their lives away. It could be. Even when we don't see him, he says phrases: ""People are so ungrateful to be alive"", or ""no one appreciates their blessings"". That's why this man invents perfectly detailed games for people to kill themselves. Anyone can call him the ""Jigsaw Killer"", but Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) explains: ""Technically, he is not a murderer. He's never killed anyone"". These games you'll see; I won't even say the most important one of the movie, because is one of the great things the movie has. What the hell has happened? This is what Dr. Gordon and Adam (Leigh Whannell) are wondering when they wake up in an isolated room. A whole movie ensues in there.Performances are adequate and precise. Without risking too much, actors level up with the complex material. Even Leigh Whannell gets his acting chance as Adam (writing has benefits). His performance is alright; he could have done better when he wrote the screenplay and new more than the rest. Cary Elwes remains unrecognizable in every role he does. I hadn't seen him since ""The cat's meow"", where I didn't recognize him either. He stands out, and made me forget about the stupid character he played in ""Liar Liar"". Danny Glover, away from movies since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", plays Detective Tapp as he only can. It was good to see him again. I can also talk about Monica Potter (Alison) who had clearly been away since ""Along came a spider"", where she was as unnoticeable as she is here.It happens to me, as I see some movies of this genre, that I notice a certain complexity. I recently saw ""My little eye""; I'm talking about movies when not everything is blood and death. There is also an amount of persons, who have their own personalities. It's not, I told a friend, ""the guy with the gun"", ""the other man"". And that's another adding to the movie's stand out originality. It's not horror; I would take a chance to say. It's suspense, and even drama. You won't jump off your seat. You get what I'm saying? But what is it that makes this a regular movie, if there are so many great things about it? It's about taking the risk of finishing the challenge; about not falling into the abyss of cliché and ordinariness. This film's triumph would have been achieved if they had written everything with the same intelligence. But they arrived at the ending and met the dilemma. Did they finish the challenge? No, they didn't. And it doesn't matter what their objective was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Relatively so-so,"SAW is rather unique, and the Jigsaw character can be compelling (And even likable at times!)However there is something just generally missing within the plot. It wasn't as grand as I thought it would be, nor as creepy. Some of the scenes skip back and forth, so if you are not careful you could get confused with the plot.I suppose I just thought this film was only average, and it instead just seemed more depressing than freakingly appealing.

Above average,"I had a few preconceptions about this film, going into it I thought it would be a 100 minute character study of two people put in a pretty bleak situation.WHen the first flashback happened I thought it was alright as i guess it showed how brutal jigsaw can be.Then the film became pretty much fully flash backed or scenes from somewhere else and very very small amounts of the film were done in the actual basement room with the two lead roles.COmbine this with some very mismatched acting from Dr. Lawrence, who was good in some scenes but just awful in other (it's almost like sometimes he just had bad days and they went with it).The action not completely in the basement and the bad acting from the lead role have stopped me giving this film a higher rating, but it is definitely worth seeing, especially if you liked Se7en.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Uhhh...thank you M. Night Shyamalan for making Hollywood forever think it will create the next ""Sixth Sense"" ending","The movie tried, I'll give it that. It went for the psychotic thriller surprise ending, with a final dramatic music score to boot. The only problem is I was already asleep by the finale and had stopped caring how the movie ended. There's something incredibly annoying about a serial killer who thinks he's going to teach the secrets of life to his victims when they're not screaming and begging for their lives. But I'll tell you what the biggest drag of all was in this average horror flick. Not ten minutes into the film and we already know who the killer is! If it isn't obvious by the pointless but eerie five second cameo he makes in a victim's background story, it becomes even more apparent during the brief head shots as we see someone watching a security camera. Showing the killer so early means that either: 1) this movie is incredibly lame because we've already figured out who the killer is, or 2) this movie is incredibly lame because we know that no screenwriter would be dumb enough to reveal the obvious killer this early and it was just a tease to warn us of a surprise ending. And boy did this movie try to brag about its clever surprise ending! I think the obligatory ""Sixth Sense highlight reel"" that showed us all the clues we had missed lasted almost two hours! The only problem is that I had already been warned of a surprise ending by the movie itself and the hostages in this movie were so uninteresting, I was ready for Mr. Jack the Ripper to quit playing his games and finish them off. I mean... really, could there be a dumber set of victims? At least in ""Friday the 13th"" we get hot co-ed babes jumping their camp counselors before they are murdered. Apparently, in the world of ""Saw,"" cops no longer call for backup and women have the guts to get into a fist fight with their abductor but freeze when they have to fire a gun. I think I saw this movie ten years ago, only it was called ""Seven"" and it was a heck of a lot more interesting, and that's my recommendation: Rent ""Seven"" first and then give this rip-off a shot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A VERY GOOD STORY BUT DIALOGUE LACKS,"i had chance to watch this movie just two weeks ago at the cinema. i must say my expectations was very high before seeing this movie. if you're going to say why, well because many of the people i bumped in to where i've gone to they really gave good criticism. so i decided first thing to do is to go and watch this scary movie. while watching the movie the first 20 minutes of the movie gave the sense to many of the audience that this film kinda sounded like a typical horror movie we've seen back in the past. The film started with the sequence of answers and later send the questions to the audience. while we try to find out who really is behind the set up, the events take place inactual fact very differently then we all expect. if we could split this film in to three different parts as the start, the middle and the end then we can easily identify the up's and downs the film SAW. SAW had a good start i think. because the director gave you the responsibility to find out really what's happening to these characters. Coming to the middle part of the film, well disappointing for me, because the film was jumping events one on to the other in a very quick pace and while the film director should give more chance to understand the characters the film went back to how and why things got there. i also thought there was use of very bad dialogue. I thought the dialogue was too simple no sense of deep conversation and lack of feelings to release itself to show what they really felt like at that moment. coming to the end of the film i thought all the answers at the start came flashing back and some great twist in cinema term came to make this movie look too good. film SAW obviously will attract the young adults. in conclusion like with all typical ending comments, i advise you to watch this movie, i think you probably like it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A surprisingly effective, visceral experience","With only around two scenes of extreme gore, ""Saw"" deserves a bit more recognition than dismissal as 'torture porn'. Although it's not hard to see why this was originally going to be released to DVD before test screenings, right down to James Wan's directorial style (which would be pushed to its limits with Darren Lyn Bousman's ""Saw IV"", which somehow manages to look cheaper than all the rest of the movies in the series in spite of having a much bigger budget), which is to put it mildly not to my taste. Still, I credit Wan for creating a really claustrophobic atmosphere here, and the one or two action scenes are quite well-done. The cast is fairly good thanks to the several better-known actors here, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, and Michael Emerson (the latter two ended up on ""Lost"" eventually), but the two leads trapped in the room are quite poor unfortunately. Jigsaw is a wicked villain, the film ultimately creates a visceral experience without resorting to unnecessary gore, and the end product is an entertaining and effective thriller.7/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very good,"Two men (Whannell and Ewles) wake up in a disgusting bathroom, chained to pipes, and separated by a corpse holding a gun and a tape player. They soon find out they are victims of the serial torturer ""Jigsaw"". Jigsaw finds horrible ways to make his victims kill themselves or each other. Soon, they find two saws in a toilet, courtesy of Jigsaw's advice via the tapes they found in their pockets. The only obvious means of escape is to cut their feet off. (Yes, they try cutting the chains, but it doesn't work.) Larry (Ewles) has five hours to kill Adam (Whannell) or his wife and daughter will be killed. They both try helping each other while secretly trying to win the game. This movie will keep you guessing until the end.Excellent movie, great acting and a fantastic plot. Some of the flashback torture scenes are excruciatingly gory and may be hard to watch for the feint of heart - perfect for fans of the genre.

"Not very scary, rather predictable twists","I remember reading that this movie was supposed to make the grudge look like a Disney movie a few days back.

It didn't have the same constant unnerving atmosphere that the grudge had, and with extremely predictable plot twists, I just felt a little short changed. Granted, the movie was ripe with gore and a few camera shots that were very cool (like the camera flash to illuminate the apartment, and the time lapse shots of the victim in the razor wire)the whole ""mental"" horror if you will, was just not there. Don't get me wrong, It was a very good movie (especially considering the recent lack of good horror in America), but i just didn't find it to be as scary as the grudge.Oh, and the acting for Dr.Gordon (actors name escapes me at the moment) almost ruined this movie for me.

Scary,"Have to say this film was extremely good except the choice of actors. This film has everything to scare you and has just the right amount of gore not to make it look cheesy. The plot is excellent and could not see anywhere were they could have improved in terms of it. Again the only thing I see which could have been changed was the actors and though this does not make it a bad film, it doesn't make it fantastic. Worth seeing if your a fan of scary/mystery, as I am. This is not a copy of seven, saw no similarity between the two as it had a very different storyline and Saw was a lot more gross, in your face and had clearly no intention of being sensitive to the audience. This is great and what any horror fan loves. Even if you aren't a horror fan but can stomach gore, this film has a lot more to it. If you took out the blood it would still have enough to make a decent movie and this is what makes it fantastic. Worth watching.

Surprisingly enjoyable and watchable,"This movie must have been made by people who like old-fashioned adventure PC games (like the King's Quest series or Simon the Sorcerer). Well, without the sense of humour, of course.The premise is simple. Two men wake up, chained by their feet to pipes in different corners of a disgusting bathroom. Between them is a dead body, and they soon discover that they are the stars in a very twisted game. The game isn't limited to their little arena, and soon a wider picture is drawn, showing that quite a few lives are in the balance here.This is not really a serial killer film in the traditional sense. We aren't following an investigation trying to find the killer. We're seeing two people in a tightly controlled situation, and more than anything, we're following their quest. The ""killer"" is just the backdrop for the character interactions, he is the element that brings them together, but otherwise a fairly passive entity. Think of it as a mixture of Cube, Panic Room and a dose of Seven for good measure.However, the film does have its fair share of plot holes. It's the kind of film which you can watch (maybe) once before realising that, on the whole, it does not make a lot of sense.

A 'See-Saw' Of Tension,"Having read various comments and reviews on this movie, I was somewhat skeptical about watching this movie. Fear not. If you like your horror loaded with dark, sinister images and spattered with just the right amount of viscera, 'Saw' is your ticket to the dark side.Admittedly, some of the acting was flawed and the time device a little ragged - but the overwhelming sense of claustrophobia and tension more than makes up for these anomalies.The ending has to be one of the trickiest, most devious I have ever watched, and the way the movie builds to what seems to be its apex on the hour, only to settle you into a false sense of security before the final pieces are put into place, is a testament to the director's understanding of the genre.'Saw' IS flawed as has been pointed out on these boards, but don't let that puzzle you.

'Intelligent' horror-thriller looking for gullible audience,"Put Seven and The Cube in a blender and make an audience drink the dribble that comes out.There is a clever twist near the end of Saw, but it is hard to enjoy if by then you have lost all interest. This movie wants us to believe in a madman with not only superior intelligence, but also unlimited resources and time to create a world full of electronic gadgets, props and puppets that Q would be jealous of. His opponents/victims are either incredibly stupid, or turn from rational beings into sobbing idiots at the snap of a director's fingers.Movies like Seven stand out for a reason. It is not hard to think up stuff that shocks and upsets. A good plot twist is a little harder to invent, but anybody can do it. The real challenge is in trying to construct a plot that an audience can believe in. It is like walking a tightrope: set one foot wrong and you're dead.

Decent horror film,"I'm a little late in hopping on the Saw franchise train considering there's somewhere around fifty other Saw movies out now but hey, better late than never. And now that I've finally seen this twisted little flick I can say that I'm glad, because it's not a particularly terrible movie. It isn't great but it is slightly better than your middle of the road horror flick. Saw opens up to two men who wake up in a disgusting old bathroom, each of them chained to pipes with a dead body in between them. They quickly find out that they are part of a twisted game of life and death being orchestrated by the serial killer named Jigsaw. The two men must find a way to escape this evil trap before going insane and killing each other, or even themselves. Saw is a sadistic, cruel, and evil film, but it surprisingly has a little more to offer than the average serial killer flick.The idea behind the way Jigsaw kills people and the way he chooses his victims is the entire point of the Saw franchise. The idea behind it is that Jigsaw picks his victims by determining who needs to suffer. He chooses people who have done terrible things in their lives and who he feels no longer deserves to live. Through his torturous and somewhat symbolic punishments he causes his victims to suffer to the point of death or they will survive and, as Jigsaw puts it, appreciate life much more. These are ideas we've seen stressed in film and literature before, but never quite to this level of violent sadism. This seems to be that defining aspect which sets Saw apart from other films which fall into the subgenre of ""torture porn."" Unfortunately, these ideas and motifs could have been articulated a little better than what Saw accomplishes. The problems with this film stem from the writing and acting. It has a great story; one that keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times, never knowing for sure where the film is going. However, the dialogue leaves something to be desired. It is terribly cheesy at times and a lot of the banter between characters is absurd and sickeningly unrealistic. The melancholy melodramatic delivery of this dialogue from the actors doesn't help either. It is also a fairly shallow movie when it comes to characters. It thinks it is much more profound than it is. It wants to be a horror film that psychologically transcends the genre, but it most certainly is not. It is nothing more than an entertaining story with a fun and interesting idea. If Saw had toned back some of the silliness and absurdity it would have been a much better film.I commend Saw for its themes, its story, and its fantastically unexpected twist ending that wrapped up the film in an extremely satisfying way. But I have to call it out on its many flaws that keep it from being a great film.

It is a well thought out, and extremely well written film with a lot going for it. I love this film and I revisit it every Halloween.As I was saying, this movie is best if think of it as its own film and not the first of a franchise. The story is one of the most brilliant and intricate things I've seen in recent years. The acting is definitely rough but it didn't take away from the movie for me. I also love the score, it adds a lot.Saw is a good movie, the Saw franchise sucks. Stay away from the sequels and just see Saw. The sequels honestly ruin it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Wow!! In my language - ""zajebisty film""","Everything I write here It will by not enough to express how magnificent that movie is. I have never seen such a amazing movie like that.Some of you will say that you can notice some similarities to well - known ""Seven"" by Fincher. Of course I see them too but It cannot be treated as a charge. I thing that ""Saw"" may not have such a dark atmosphere as ""Seven"" but scenario, music and especially astonishing end of the story, we can compare to ""Seven"". After watching that movie can I assure you that ""Saw"" will join the group of my favourite movies. Highly recommended",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It left me thinking about it for hours.  I was telling all my friends about it!!,"I give this movie 9 stars because it is shocking, clever, and I've never really seen anything like this before. Maybe the closest thing to this would be SEVEN, also great movie.Two people wake up, trapped in an old bathroom of some sort, and have no idea how they got there. LET THE GAMES BEGIN! I love the mood and colors of the film. It is grimy, dirty, and fits with the story perfectly. I don't want to give away to much, but if you are a fan of horror or suspense movies, I feel this is one of the best modern horror movies of the last ten years.

"Terrific, terrifying... just go and SEE IT before reading any more reviews...","The only good advice is to go see this movie, especially if you like thrillers. DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS and try not to know anything about the movie, except for the fact that the genre is horror. Follow this advice and you won't be disappointed.There is nothing much left to say because if you follow this advice, you already SAW the movie.So stop reading now, don't read any other reviews and just trust me on this.Stop!Okay, because I have to write at least 10 lines; here's my personal opinion without spoiling the plot: EXCELLENT, gob-smacking, jolly good, marvelous!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
loved it,"This is an great movie. I saw it for the first time yesterday and once more today, this is definitively the best movie for the hole past year (2004 and 2005 so far). One of the things that are great with this movie that it isn't totally brain dead almost the opposite you need to be concentrated to 100% and see small details always trying to guess everything out. If you like this one as much as I did I think you should see ""The Cube"" I think there are many similarities between this one and ""The Cube"" but ""Saw"" are still a class better. I hope you all liked this one as much as I did, think I'll go and see it on cinema soon too. A definitive 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Simply brilliant,"Well, what can I say? The movie is simply a reinvention. With all the crap being thrown at us from the Horror genre it's very hard to tell whats decent or not. All horror movies these days are just hack and slash, poor dialog, poor execution, token hot people and flashy camera's. Oh yeah, and the occasional girl screaming. What you get in Saw is excruciatingly painful scenes that will have anyone averting their eyes at some point. Coupled with this, the means of torture, both physically and mentally, are excellently crafted and incredibly imaginative. There is a genuine unnerving feel about the inventiveness of the various instruments used to bring his victims to insanity.The superb thing about Saw I feel, is that it actually has a great plot, one you don't expect and particularly NEED in a horror, but Saw delivers a brilliant one anyway. The psychological killer behind the whole thing, AKA Jigsaw, doesn't simply torture his victims, but uncovers their deepest flaws, exploits them, and punishes the person for them. They are given choices, often both ending in some sort of tragedy, but the sheer cruelty is just mind-blowing and a breath of fresh air to the boring, formulaic route most Horrors these days take.The fact is, Saw is clever. Saw is psychological. Saw is thought provoking and Saw is excruciatingly hard to watch at times. Saw is a classic horror of our times and coupled with a great twist, well, it simply makes Saw one of the best Horrors ever. You must watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Awesome for a newbie.  Awful for a pro.,"I saw a free screener copy of this film after having seen the trailers. What I got from the trailers is that this film was going to break new ground in suspense and shock-value.It didn't. It's no more suspenseful than ""Psycho"" (1960), and less shocking than Wes Craven's ""The Last House on the Left"".What worked for this film enough to get it sold was the original concept. It breaks the typical barriers of they cliché' serial killer genre. In this case, the villain doesn't kill. He forces people to kill other people or themselves. There is a reason the killer does this, and it will actually make sense to the audience. He's not just simply crazy. That would be bad ""cop-out"" writing, otherwise. The directors are not afraid to show disturbing images, and knows when to cut away from them before it becomes cheaply gratuitous. The mystery unravels itself cleverly, keeping the audience guessing at what's going on, and just when the audience is sure the mystery has been solved, it turns out there's more to learn.However, this is a new young director and it shows. It shows terribly. The editing is paced far far too slow. There's probably 5 minutes of film that could be cut out, where the audience is not gaining any new knowledge, and there's no anticipation for anything. For instance, there's a scene where one character asks his partner to come over and look at something. It takes the guy a good 10 seconds to get over and have the audience look at it. I was tired of waiting by 7 seconds. Gotta shorten this stuff, guys.Also, we see a car chase (or race) in which everything is in fast-forward, MTV style. Why? It's distracting from the story, and it looks laughably silly. There's other parts of the movie that do this fast-forward technique, as well as a circular track around that does nothing logical for the audience's intake of information. It's just silly, and obviously done for style, and the style is NOT subtle enough to get by without the audience questioning the director's decisions. A good director is taken for granted while people watch the film, and are appreciated after the film is over.Ever notice in some films that an actor who is usually great is suddenly a bad actor? That's when a film has a bad director. Well, a bad director as far as directing actors or finalizing the editing ADR dialogue. This film manages to make Danny Glover suck. The dialogue is at times trying too hard to be colorful and creative. It tries so hard that the audience can hear the writer in an imaginary flashback, talking to himself about how to make the dialogue more fresh. A true master can keep it colorful, yet natural and logical.6/10 Good in originality. Poor in technicality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This was by far the best of the Saw series.,"A well-made thriller with one of the most shocking plot twists of all time made capable by even better performances.

Pretty original... definitely worth seeing.,"No doubt, today's horror genre is filled to the brim with tired, worn-out clichés, predictable plots and settings, and ""scare"" attempts that frankly, would put me to sleep faster than a tranquilizer dart to the jugular vein. I'll be honest, I'm not a big horror fan. Usually, the only horror films I REALLY like are the classic masterpieces---The Shining, The Exorcist, Misery, etc. I was much more of a horror fan when I first saw this movie (almost exactly two years ago, when it was in theaters), so the fact that it still retains a certain degree of respect from me and a special place in my heart really says something about it. I'm giving this movie seven stars, although I would give it a 7.5.I have now viewed the entire ""Saw"" trilogy---I just watched the latest installment last night. And now, I feel compelled to write reviews for all three films.""How much blood will you shed to stay alive?"" was the tag-line for this movie. And indeed, it was applicable in many places throughout the film. Would you hack into the stomach of a living (albeit heavily drugged) person to save your own life? Would you shoot someone you barely knew in order to save yourself and your family? Would you sever one of your own limbs if it was your only means of escape? These are situations that are explored in gruesome detail throughout the movie.The story is that there's a unique serial killer out there who puts unsuspecting hapless souls into desperate situations whereupon, by their own action or inaction, they become victims of some truly gruesome endings. There's a lot of flash-backs and secondary stories, but the main course of the movie involves two men who wake up in what appears to be the scummy remnants of some abandoned restroom, chained by leg shackles on opposite sides of the room. There is a body resting face-down in a pool of blood between them, clutching a revolver and a tape recorder. Both men discover audio tapes in their possession that feature a dark, raspy voice telling them the rules of the ""game"", and also warning them of the consequences they face should they fail to fulfill their objectives.Strangely, unlike many horror films involving psychopaths, the mystery of the identity of the killer is not the only thing that keeps us glued to the screen. Of course, we wonder about it (as do the characters on-screen), but many times, it is treated as something of almost secondary importance. This is not to say that the movie doesn't tease us about it, but it relies on much more than a stupid guessing game to keep us interested. As we come to know the characters more and more, we come to sympathize with them, at least to a degree, because the situations they are forced to endure are things that most of us wouldn't wish on our worst enemies.The film doesn't focus so much on the killer and his inner self as it does on the story and lives of the victims. Don't get me wrong---the killer has his places in the movie, but he's more or less a masked phantom figure that chooses only to observe the situations he rigs into place, rather than directly interact with them.In real life, the situations that are masterminded by the killer in this movie (and in the succeeding two films) probably wouldn't play out as smoothly to his liking or prediction as they do. However, that almost goes without saying; in the movie world, the unlikely becomes very plausible.Also, unfortunately, the acting is quite sub-par in certain parts. Cary Elwes, in particular, is kind of... well, lame. There's scenes where the acting makes you go ""Uughh, come ON."" That's the main weakness of the film. If you can withstand those certain scenes of rickety performances though, it's quite easy to enjoy the rest of the film.This movie definitely relies on some of its impact through gratuitous bloodshed---even though it doesn't come anywhere near the level of grotesque gore of the succeeding two installments, that is definitely where some of its ammunition is stocked. Part of it is also the sheer sadistic creativity of the traps that are placed for the characters on-screen. One thing I really like about this film is that it relies on very little of that annoying ""having things pop up on the screen so we can get the highly strung audience members to jump up in their seats"" technique. Oh yeah, and part of the impact comes at the end, which features a huge, unexpected twist. Frankly, I thought that said twist was ingenious.In any case, this is definitely a horror film that deserves recognition, because it is certainly far better than many of its competitors, and in a genre that is so filled over-the-top with lame excuses of celluloid crap, that is always a relief.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE!!!!!!,"I am not real sure when people that didn't pay real attention to movies started using IMDb, but not thanks to them I wasted 16 dollars, and I suppose part of my girlfriend's time. Saw seemed to be on a very low budget because the acting was horrid, and the use of special affects were even worse. The trailer really got my attention but I should have known better because the movie was produced by twisted pictures which is a company I have never even heard of before. Therefore, this no name company could only afford horrible actors and cheap props, ""exit wounds,"" etc. EVERYTHING was cheap. Carry Elwes and Danny Glover should have known better than to take on the roles for a first time director who would end up ruining the entire film. Not to mention, their performances were sub-par. The movie was clearly intended for modern day teenagers that wouldn't know any better. Sadly I sat with all of them and almost walked out of the theater because of my disgust. Those of you that have seen this terrible movie should all go out and rent Se7en, and see what it takes to make a real movie. The movie is NOT worth a 7.5, and I can not believe it is ranked that high on a most respectable website. I'm rating this movie lower than House of a 1000 corpses. For those of you who are still curious what that means, it would mean a one. I beg of you, Please join in my efforts to bring this rating of 7.5 down as much as possible. Thank You!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If not for Cary Elwes terrible acting this was a 10,"I've always been a huge fan of horror but you have to look far and wide to find one that has great characters and acting while also coming off as satisfyingly clever.Saw in its time was by far the most clever horror movie in the genre. The gritty cinematography, the terrifying tone of Jigsaw's voice. The clues on the tapes, the riddles the viewer and the characters had to solve. The information the viewer knew, that the characters didn't know. It all combines for a truly complete and wonderful package of suspense and white knuckle chair gripping entertainment.It is truly an immersive film with an incredibly epic twist that finishes in a way that leaves you both satisfied and dying to know what happens next.It was always destined for a sequel and following up such a masterpiece is never going to be easy and some would argue, you're better off leaving it as it is, to not tarnish the brilliance of the original.My only criticism of the film was the lackluster performances of one of the lead characters, Dr Gordon played by Cary Elwes.Almost every scene he appears in, his acting feels forced and inauthentic. In what should have been the most gripping scene in the movie in the last 5 minutes of the film, his exaggerated dialogue and body language almost come off as comical rather than as serious and desperate as they were intended. His co-star Adam, played by Leigh Whannell is far more convincing.Still, while his acting is sub par, fortunately the dialogue and the story hold up so well that you can force yourself to look past this minor blemish and appreciate this horror masterpiece for what it is.If you haven't seen all the sequels, I love them all and I highly encourage you to continue on this wonderful ride in the Saw universe that unfolds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Perfect combination of grisly and intellectual elements,"Despite its limited budget, the participation of numerous amateur actors and the Australian writers' first attempt at creating a script, Saw became an unexpected massive success that has sparked a total of eight entries in the franchise so far. While other popular horror franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street had their share of significant ups and downs, Saw is one of the most consistent franchises of its kind. It represents horror cinema of the new millennium like nothing else.There are numerous reasons why this first film of the franchise is nowadays considered a contemporary classic. The bleak settings get you into the film right from the start. The plot gets increasingly complex, surprising and twisted as it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The acting performances are surprisingly solid and intensify the movie's grisly emotions. The sinister special effects touch a profound survival instinct in the viewer that is repulsive yet inherent. The haunting soundtrack blends in perfectly. The camera work is calm and precise as it can be interpreted as an antithesis to the highly emotional story. A particular element of this film and the franchise in general are its concise flashbacks offering important background information adding continuous depth to the story.For those not familiar with the movie's content, the film revolves around a photographer and a doctor who get kidnapped and awake in the restroom of an abandoned building. They soon realize that they are being held prisoners but are offered clues in order to find out why they have been imprisoned and how they can find a way out. The protagonists also realize that the person behind their fate is a philosophical serial killer known as Jigsaw. Meanwhile, the wife and daughter of the doctor also get involved in this deadly game. Frustrated police officers as well as a desperate private investigator try tracking down the anonymous serial killer separately before time tuns out for the two victims.The combination of desperate survival instinct and grisly gore elements on one side and the detailed film-making and intelligent plot on the other side make Saw completely unique. Splatter film enthusiast and supporters of intellectual psychological thrillers will be equally drawn to this film and its ensuing franchise. Saw even deserves a better reputation than it has as it's often reduced to its visually shocking elements which neglects one of the best stories one could ever witness in a horror movie. No matter what kind of cinema you prefer, you should know that Saw should be considered the type of movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime. Having hesitated a long time to give this franchise a chance because of its unjustified stereotypical reputation, I have ended up discovering a modern cinematic masterpiece and the greatest horror movie franchise ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant for its time but now seems trite & incoherent,"When this film came out, it was the first of its kind in a major motion picture. I've seen at least a few people say it was a bad ripoff but as someone who watched a lot of horror over many years, this film seemed pretty edgy. Perhaps in some underground cult there were similar themes. But for the average horror audience it was cutting edge in the manner of Exorcist, Alien, and Hostel. It was in my personal library for many years.But watching it now in 2021 it seems very amateur and poorly acted and seemed to move faster and end sooner with a lot of jumbled threads interwoven.Saw II was the best of the series although normally I'm more a fan of the initial film in any franchise.Some films still are gripping years later, like Wolf Creek, The Thing, and Cape Fear. But this time, Saw just didn't do it for me. Choppy, cheap, incoherent. Still a shocking premise, though. And thought provoking.If you've never seen it, I think it will be a definite treat. It delivers tension and gore. And while some reviews have said there are too many similar films, I can disagree. Saw is still one of a kind as far as the underlying story. But you could just go straight to Saw II and get a better edge of your seat experience.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw (2004) ***1/2,"The one that started it all! I'll never forget how impressed I was with the novel concept of this horror film when I first discovered it via a risky DVD rental: a man dying of cancer decides to play elaborate games of potential death on people who foolishly do not appreciate the value of life and take their health for granted. In this opener of what was destined to become a hugely popular franchise, two young men awake inside an unknown dilapidated building, each one helplessly chained, and find themselves the targets in a crazy game of survival by the unique serial killer nicknamed ""Jigsaw"". Danny Glover (LETHAL WEAPON) co-stars as the detective following the case. Despite the gruesome nature, and thumbing my nose at those viewers too sensitive to watch such a film and realize it's only a movie, this is one of the freshest horror movies to come along in the 21st century, exceptionally written and executed by the young team of Leigh Whannell (who plays one of the doomed prisoners) and James Wan (who directed). ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Enjoyable fright flick, even with some poor acting.","I put this disc in expecting no more than the average slash flick that seems to be in mass production during the last few years, but was pleasantly surprised at just how much this movie not only surprised me, but at how much I enjoyed it. Right from the start you get thrown into the plot and are caught up with each character's situation or background through the trusted flashback. Containing some interesting ideas, well paced, and some moments that should have you looking around the room wondering about that odd noise from down the hall. My only major gripe with the film lies directly with the overacting (or lack of) by some of the major actor(s) in the film. This problem, not enough to wreck the movie, but enough to remove some of the tension/emotion from some of the scenes can be distracting. Most likely a rental for most, but worth at least worth one watch by anyone the least bit interested in the genre. (7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A twisted - suspense thriller,"This feature combines; suspense,chilling psyche & a followable story outline.

I would label it as an "" Adult Past-Time for the horror film genere "" The film offers an ""inside of the mind"" within a very twisted individual the view is (a third person perspective). A riveting plot to follow. A future classic, perhaps. In the vein of such films as : Copy Cat, Seven & The Bone Collector. Very compelling & quite disturbing.

Most people are so ungrateful to be alive,"What I revere about is that the two creators thought of the cheapest script by just chaining two men to their opposite sides of a prehistoric bathroom with a dead body in the middle of the floor and he is the reason they are locked in the room.Interesting turns were when it is revealed that Zepp was another victim following rules to obtain antidote for a slow-acting poison he was given.
And as Zep's tape ends, corpse rises and is revealed to be Joe Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer.Jigsaw chooses his victim under these principles:
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.
Sick of people who don't appreciate their blessings.
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.I read about the fact of how Leigh Whannell came up with the idea for the character Jigsaw, juggled between his tumour and MRI scan. Sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, ""What if you were given the news that you had a tumour and you are going to die soon? How would you react to that? And thus he imagined Jigsaw giving his victims in the literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.Notable lines:

"Saw, psychological....makes you think.","The film itself was a low budget film. Yet I found that the psychological levels of the film were higher than originally expected. I found that it got many people thinking through out the film. Placing the viewer in the same situation of not knowing of what is actually going on, unlike so many other movies. Also the main line that Jigsaw does use in the film, ""Those who do not appreciate the blessings and lives they are given, are not worthy of that they are given"", It really opens people's ears and make you think. Is Jigsaw onto something for our day and age, giving this dark, yet truthful saying? I think so in certain aspects. Minus the brutal mind games and killings.

One of the greatest horror films ever made,"For my 500th review I have decided to begin my 'Saw' series of reviews leading up to the October release of the eighth installment 'Jigsaw'. Back around 2004 the ""situational horror/thriller' genre was quite a big thing, however it seemed no one could quite nail it. They even tried making a main stream one in 'Collateral' which admittedly was a pretty good film. Other than that though it seemed no one could seem to quite get it right. Then along came James Wan and Leigh Whannell with a little project they called 'Saw' and the rest is history.So what made 'Saw' so great? Firstly, was how clever it was. Other similar films always felt like they were trying to be clever, but could never quite pull it off. 'Saw' had a genuine motive and a genuinely intriguing premise. It was incredibly simple and incredibly intricate all at the same time. Secondly, was the originality. Never before had we really seen anything like this. The situations these characters were being put in were not only thought-provoking and captivating to watch, they also were unlike anything we had seen.It was a low-budget production obviously so it's far from a perfectly put together package. The acting for one thing is quite shocking in a few moments. It wasn't until the sequels where the budget obviously increased that they became very fine and well oiled machines. Nonetheless though 'Saw' is one of the best horror films ever made and is proof that storytelling will always be where the true strength of any film lies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great movie.,"Two men Dr Gordan (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel - Scriptwriter) find themselves chained to some pipes in a dingy bathroom, with a body, a gun, dicta-phone and two hacksaws. They soon realise they are victims of the serial killer 'Jigsaw.' One of them has to kill the other before 6 o' clock or they will die, and the hacksaws aren't for the ankle-cuffs...The horror genre has been a little weak with movies like The Grudge and Godsend. Saw puts them to shame. With Leigh Whannels excellent script and James Wan's (Director) energetic verve, its a teeth-grinding slalom between lock-jaw tension and sadistic horror. With a twist you WILL not see coming. This is a great turn from these young Aussie film-makers and maybe they will bring back some good films for the horror genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disturbing,"Yes, disturbing that I seem to be the only one who guessed the identity of the mysterious and killer as soon as he/she/it (don't want to spoil it) appeared. Never mind ""Aw yeah!

Am-Dram at best. Leigh Whannell performs better but not much. I always find Danny Glover a disappointment; he hit his 'peak' with the Lethal weapon series (Don't even mention Predator 2) I say 'peak - more of a small hillock really.Yes, the twist was both unexpected and shocking.

The characters and story aren't good enough to take that much time and the details weren't put together well enough yet (just two examples: the whole ""Jigsaw isn't technically a murderer"" is just dumb coming from anybody that isn't Jigsaw and Zepp's ""trap"" is just... dumber than it should've without going into spoilers).But a great third act makes the whole thing worth it and good, besides the many flaws it contains, and it starts the construction of the best horror slasher ever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Starting off as a claustrophobic little horror film promises intensity and intrigue, it starts off well as a mystery, as both the viewer and the characters figure out where they are and what is going on. But when the film steps outside of its primary location - a dirty basement cellar - it tries to become a 'Se7en' style murder-mystery, going off at random tangents, introducing many new characters and spreading out its story over several locations, with images of ever-more gruesome murders, dead bodies and extreme trap situations. Some of them are clever, some scary, but others become silly and way over-the-top, both in the scenario and in the script. Anyway, it's still worth waiting around to find out what the hell is going to happen. Definitely more interesting than most horror films have been for a long time, and if you forgive the cheesy script, it's definitely worth watching although the detective part of the story lets it down (is it a horror film or a detective thriller ? - please choose one category - don't try to be both). This is also very gruesome, quite disturbing, and perhaps unique as it introduces the viewer to some disgusting images that have never been seen before in cinema. Go and see it. You may even want to see it a second time as it is crammed with a bit too much for its own liking. Would have worked better if it stayed as a tight, little claustrophobic horror film but it tries to be far more than it really is. Anyway, very ambitious and promises many more things for the director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I saw... Saw,"When I heard about Saw, I heard it was a terrible movie. So when I went to go see it at the movie theater I didn't really know what to expect. To my amazement this was one of the most unique and interesting movies I have EVER seen, and trust me when I say I have seen pretty much everything. I have watched this movie 3 times just today, call me sick but I love it. I pray there will be a second one that is just as great as this. The only part that I didn't like about it was at the end when Lawerance is reaching for the cell phone, why didn't he take off his shirt and get it like he had suggested to Adam. That just seemed stupid to me. But the ending so made up for it. My jaw dropped when I found out who it was. If I had to pick one word to describe it I would pick AMAZING!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Great Thriller!,"There are two plots of this movie: One is that two people stuck in a bathroom and must find a way out by clues a person named Jigsaw has given them. Between them is a dead man and they are locked by the ankle on a pipe.The other is a detective, who is looking for Jigsaw who is the kidnapper of the two men. He's looking for him because he killed his partner, Sing, who died when both were looking for him when a bullet shot him through the head.This is a unique film. The killer's motive is interesting. He puts people up in situation which they can die if they fail or which they can live. After seeing Se7en before Saw, I see why this is like Saw. Jigsaw locks people who are unworthy and if they pass their task, he'll know they'll care about their lives instead of using them for something sinister.This film is really not a horror film but more like a crime thriller. For those who don't want to see it because they think it's scary, it's not because it's no even a horror. Well, the acting is kinda good as for their first rehearsal during the shoot of the movie. During the movie, we see part of the face of the killer. I ask why would they show it to us since they don't want us to know who the killer is? The question will be answer at the end of the film where the huge twist occurs.This film is entertaining and ingenious. It's clever, like Se7en, but really better than Se7en. I was disappointed in Se7en but this movie is Saw and not Se7en so I'll say nothing about that. Go see Saw!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I do respect Elwes, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he's strapped for cash. However, the acting was pretty bad, overall--even his. Many, many inconsistencies in the plot. The ending is totally unconvincing. There are a few interesting turns--it kept my curiosity peaked for about 2/3rds the way through, but after it was all over, I was just irritated.

One of the greatest horror/thrillers of all time,"Most people who haven't seen this masterpiece of a movie, 'Saw', think of it as a horror film. How sorely mistaken they are. It does have scary moments, but the true allure of 'Saw' is the fact that it is a heart pounding psychological thriller that is near unpredictable. The thing that makes the film so good and horrifying is the fact that it is so close to reality. It'll make you wonder if the things that happen in the film actually do occur. Known for notoriously mediocre acting, the amazing lighting and sound, writing, and direction make up for this 100 percent. If you have to see one horror/thriller, make 'Saw' your choice.The plot goes as follows: Adam (writer Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a room that he has no recollection of ever being in or how he got there, soon discovering that he is not alone, for a doctor (Cary Elwes) soon awakes to a similar fate. All the while, a paranoid detective (Danny Glover) attempts to track a mysterious serial killer who likes to play 'games' with his victims.The thing that adds to the shock and awe of 'Saw' is the incredible lighting and sounds. The lights are so effective, and you really notice them. They add to the horror and surprise so much. The sound does as well, but this is not one of those 'when the sound gets crazy, something's about to happen' films. The music is just great. Like every good film in the horror category, 'Saw' has its fair share of blood and guts that will satisfy the horror fan in everyone, but it's the thriller aspect of it that makes it so damn good. The suspense is absolutely incredible, and when the ending rolls around, you will gasp in shock. The writer of the film is coincidentally Leigh Whannell, and as it's his story, no one can do it better. His writing is simply phenomenal, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. James Wan, Whannell's friend, is the director of the film, and he is just as good at his job as Leigh is at his. He manages to make the film extremely dark and edgy, yet keep the flow going so you're never bored. The acting is simply mediocre, but it doesn't really matter. The best performance is probably from Danny Glover, which is no surprise.Full of twists, blood, suspense, and daring entertainment, 'Saw' is a real winner that any fan of thrillers will love and want to see over and over. It remains one of my favorite movies.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
High Voltage...,"After a long long time, I came across a heavy duty thriller...called ""Saw"". Not just another serial killer movie: this one had a heavy dose of thrills indeed! The whole atmosphere is excellent..., the movie begins with 2 men waking up chained in a dirty bathroom with a corpse lying between them...and then there's no looking back..its a fast paced thriller full of surprises! On the acting front there's not much to write about.I've read a lot of messages bashing the movie for various reasons, but understand that its a thriller...and for thrills, there's gotta be certain situations which may not seem the most practical.So go and rent this movie NOW if you haven't already seen...watch it alone for better thrills!:) Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Normally I love horror, but this was just inane","Few films have had a more negative effect on the horror genre than Saw. It's inexplicable success led to the genre being flooded with even worse (which one wouldn't expect to be possible) imitators, creating a period where virtually nothing interesting came out in the genre. The problem with this type of film is simply that it just isn't interesting. It's not scary, it's basically just a long boring catalogue of ways that people can be injured, with no suspense or speak of. Despite the superficial similarities to the slasher genre, the two styles are worlds apart, in that slasher movies build up tension between the deaths, while torture films are flat and unengaging. Also, the whole aesthetic style associated with genre (lots of rust, muddy camerawork, annoying soundtrack) is ugly, I much prefer older horror aesthetics, with their lurid colours and unconvincing effects, which still manage to be more frightening than the tedium of post-Saw horror. We need a return to the style of real horror directors like George Romero and John Carpenter (ideally with exclusively practical effects, none of the CGI rubbish that dominates the industry today; a VHS revival would be nice too) instead of the ridiculous claptrap that gets marketed as horror today (there are a few good directors working now, but my point still stands).",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Exceptional Movie,"My dad brought this movie home one night, nobody in the family knowing what to expect. What we got blew our minds (literally in one certain scene). We watched this movie in pitch black, at 11:00 at night. This was the first movie I have ever seen to actually scare me.This, to me, is nothing like anything I have ever seen. It mixes the horror and the suspense/mystery together nicely to make a good, scary, whodunnit picture. If you are like me, you are a horror movie junkie. I have seen it all. But this, is exceptional.This is the first part to an astonishing series. But in order to fully understand the series, you MUST watch them in order, from the first to the last. DO NOT WATCH THEM IN MIXED ORDER!!! Although Tobin Bell doesn't get much screen time in this movie, he is still considered by me the best movie villain of all time. His brief performance is excellent.If you are looking for a good horror movie and still haven't see this, you need to watch it. But don't watch it alone... I highly recommend this movie.10/10 Carlito",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The best film I have seen in my life... EVER,"Saw first came to my attention on a rainy afternoon during the school holidays, where given the choice between ""Saw"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", I chose it. I haven't stopped thinking about it ever since. It is the most well written film I have seen in my life, the mixture between physiological horror and a bloody good thriller makes it simply fantastic. Adam (Leigh Whannel) wakes to find himself submerged in water in a subterranean bathroom. With him is Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Neither captive has any idea how they got there or why- but the killer has left them two hacksaws. Not strong enough to cut through their steel shackles, but strong enough to slice through flesh and bone.It is the most amazing piece of screenplay I have seen in my life- I just can't understand why some people dislike it! Leigh Whannel is excellent in this film, as is Cary Elwes :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SEE SAW!!!!!,"When you get sooooo excited about a movie, it's hard to tell people how good it is. Words just can't describe how thrilling it was to find a movie like SAW and have it be such an amazing surprise. There have been so many ""horror"" movies lately that critics call the the scariest movie of the year, that end up being huge disappointments (""The Village""? ""Open Water""? I rest my case) So I was setting myself up for the same disappointment when I saw SAW at the Toronto International Film Festival last night. And I have to say the film blew me away. It's what true horror should be: Gory, clever, surprising, and terrifying on a very primitive level. This is a film that rarely has pointless ""jump"" scares (you know, a loud music hit then a cat runs by) but achieves a fear that stays with you in a way that you could see someone walk down the street, and it's scary. My heart was thumping the whole time. The images are truly disturbing, and that's a good thing. It creates more fear. Director James Wan is probably the best thing to happen to horror in a long time. Some of the visuals he creates in this film will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. And writer/actor Leigh Wannell has created such a cool premise for a horror story that it's so refreshing to watch, because you've never seen it before. Whichever one of the two thought about using a camera flash to light up a room when the power goes out (you'll understand when you see the film), my hat goes off. That scene is one of the scariest I've seen because of the pure suspense and fear that they've created. If I had to point out something bad about the film (and there's not much bad about it) it would have to be the acting. Now, I'm not saying it's community theatre acting, because there are some amazing talents here, and throughout most of the movie they all shine, but as an actor myself, I pick up on some of the weaker moments. And there where some lines that were said that weren't totally believable. But that being said, horror isn't really an ""acting"" genre, so it's easy to look beyond. Anyway, in closing, this is one of the most original movies, not just horror movies, to come along in a while, and truly one of the scariest. You have to go see it whether you like horror or not because it is such a thrilling movie going experience. It deserves to be up there with ""The Exorcist"" as one of the scariest movies of all time. I cannot wait to see what Wan and Wannell do next. They definitely have a successful future ahead of them!! SEE SAW!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original and clever,This is a good and solid horror film. It is original and clever. It pretty much checks all of the boxes making this a scary and entertaining fearful movie. The premise is set up early on for a thoughtful thriller with lots of twists and sadistic killing. The biggest surprise from a horror film is that the fundamental reason for the murderer is that he is trying to teach you the value of life. This offers one of the best original scares from beginning to end with many confusing plot twists and flashbacks. Everyone has something to hide.

"The influential horror film that defined the '00s era of horror and started a long-lasting series, Saw is as brutal as it is effective.","In a dilapidated bathroom, two men Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) are chained on opposite sides of the room with a corpse in the center of the room of man who has apparently committed suicide. As the two look for clues around the room they find cassette tapes left for them by their captor (Tobin Bell) revealing that the two have been abducted by The Jigsaw Killer, a serial killer who arranges traps for his victims to kill themselves under the pretense of being a puzzle or game. As Adam and Lawrence try to find a way out, they look over the events leading up to the present in the hopes of finding a clue to where they are and why.Saw is the 2004 directorial debut by James Wan and writing and acting debut of Leigh Whannell. Both Wan and Whenell had been inspired to create a low budget feature inspired by films such as The Blair Witch Project and Darren Aronofsky's Pi, with the two deciding on the concept of two men trapped in a room being the most financially viable premise to work with. After developing the concept in their native Australia they found little success attracting producers and instead produced a short proof-of-concept short based on the Reverse Bear Trap scene in the film and brought their pitch to Los Angeles. Impressed by the short producer Gregg Hoffman showed the short to Oren Koules and Mark Burg and the trio formed genre label Twisted Pictures and gave Wan the $1 million budget needed to film. The strength of the short attracted many actors including Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Michael Emmerson, and Shawnee Smith. After a tight production schedule, Saw was released by Lionsgate who had initially planned to release Saw direct to video, but positive reception at Sundance gave the company the confidence to position it as major release. Upon release the film became a sleeper hit earning $18 million on its opening weekend and along with the Film's of Eli Roth and New French Extremity, is credited with establishing the ""torture horror"" genre craze of the '00s (though with some inaccuracy on that part). Despite Saw's legacy being somewhat muddle by the follow-ons and imitators that came about in its wake, Saw remains a unique and intriguing limited location locked room mystery.Upon revisiting Saw one is struck by how much less bloody the film is despite the title and the theatrical release poster that prominently featured a severed hand (that's not even in the movie). Saw despite being labeled ""torture horror"" isn't focused on the torture and is instead focused more on the investigative and procedural aspects that align the film more with something like Seven. Both Whannell and Elwes are solid in the roles of Adam and Lawrence respectively and they mine all they can from these characters and scenario despite the limitation of being chained on opposite sides of the room. The movie uses a non-linear narrative structure with flashes to different points of the timeline. The movie does a good job of throwing the audience off including its build-up to a very surprising twist ending that feels earned and memorably bleak. The movie isn't perfect as there are some distracting directorial flourishes and editing techniques that remind you ""yes, this was made in the early 2000s"" and some of the reveals of certain scenes will feel like cheats to the audiences. Despite that this is an impressive work for a low budget film and you see the craft and technique that would be define Wan and Whannell's follow-on films.Despite Saw's legacy being complicated by various follow-ons and imitators Saw remains an impressive and tension filled exercise done with limited resources. In terms of filmmaking Saw gets the maximum amount from a minimal location and remains engaging throughout. Some of the editing flourishes and filmmaking techniques feel distracting in hindsight and some of the reveals don't hold much water, but there's a reason so many tried to imitate this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

bogus,"Definitely one of the weakest horror/suspense thriller ever seen; I don't mind low budget, but I do mind inconsistency and idiotic scripts. it is unexplained why two people in a room need to be tortured and why they can oversee a man lying for a couple of hours on the floor in between them (supposedly dead) but never see a bit of motion and him breathing (which he'd need to in order to get up in the ending as the villain. And why is this guy even there, nothing gives us a clue about the characters and their oh so wrong lives? And why don't our 'heroes' question his presence and why is one sawing of his foot instead of using the saw for grabbing the cell-phone and why do cops act like everyday farmers handed a gun for the first time in their lives and why, why...? Aesthetically the film is consistent: Seven-ish grind and industrial music; with visual reminiscences of Dave McKean's comic Mr. Punch this film has not anything which would make it worth watching in the 21st century. Mr Wan and his screenwriter should eventually spend more time on really working on a story instead of going with the first idea which comes to mind ... let's do a movie about two guys locked up in a room. That's NOT a story, that's a scene-description!!! But alas, the viewers are probably satisfied with averageness and long for Saw2.

Great movie to start off the franchise...,"I sat down to watch the 2004 movie ""Saw"" again here in 2023, making it the third time I've seen it since 2004, I guess. And I will say that the movie actually still is entertaining and watchable, despite of knowing the storyline already. And this time in 2023 it was the unrated version I got to watch.The storyline in ""Saw"", as written by James Wan and Leigh Whannell, is a rather unique storyline, that sort of takes the audience and locks them in the small room with Adam (played by Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (played by Cary Elwes), while it lets the audience go through the torment and anguish that the two imprisoned men go through. And at the same time the audience is left totally in the dark as to what is really going on, whom can you trust and thus. And that makes it an enjoyable movie to sit through.The acting performances in ""Saw"" are great, especially Cary Elwes, he was phenomenal in the movie and carried it quite nicely. The movie also have some familiar faces on the cast list aside from Cary Elwes, with the likes of Danny Glover, Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith and horror icon Tobin Bell.The movie is rather interestingly shot, feeling like you are right there in the room with the two men, as if the audience themselves were captives as well. And there is a good amount of visually interesting things going on throughout the course of the 103 minutes that the movie ran for.If you haven't already seen this 2004 thriller from director James Wan, it is about due time you do so, because it is a rather good and entertaining movie; one that started off a very gory franchise.My rating of ""Saw"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A pretty good movie with an INCREDIBLE ending!,"This is a very good suspense thriller. Great acting, great idea for a story with some OK writing and directing. I am a person that really likes character development, even though most movie-goers like a plot that moves, and moves quickly. So I was a little dismayed for the first 30-45 mins where I was hoping that we would get to see a little depth put into the great characters that they had created, but instead was treated to a fast-paced plot. Not really surprising since all producers edit their movies to remove character development in order to have a quicker moving plot (just watch any DVD's deleted scenes and the director will tell you that the reason the scene was deleted was because people were saying that the movie was dragging a little long and the plot had to get going).The direction was good, but it always felt a little like a really bad David Fincher rip-off. David Fincher has a really great, unique directing style, and I don't mind if a director uses him as inspiration to develop their own style, but in SAW, he just wasn't able to pull it off.And about the ending. Don't worry about it. It's not about any surprise. It is just a really cool ending that put all the pieces of the movie together.Without the ending I would give it a 3/5, but with it, it gets an easy 4!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Poorly Made Amalgamation of Secondhand Style and Story... Yet Irrefutably Influential.,"Saw is okay... It just gets far too much credit for what is essentially a poorly directed amalgamation of secondhand ideas ripped off from better films. Hear me out...PART I: Firstly, Saw is a poor attempt to copy and paste the stylish grit and brutality of elaborate murder ala SE7EN, a film that despite being made a decade earlier, is so goddamn stylish, its virtually ageless, and looks 10x more modern than Saw did and ever will. Seriously, I'm still more impressed with the opening credit sequence to Se7en than I am with the entirety of Saw. Combine that with 1997's low budget death-trap masterpiece CUBE, a film made for 1/4 the budget of Saw's, and what are you left with?PART II: Saw is an even poorer attempt at re-writing a century old concept, conceived by Agatha Christie with her classic, And Then There Were None. A story about ten strangers invited to a secluded island, where they are each confronted with their ""crimes"" via a recording (each of them being directly or indirectly responsible for a murder) by an unknown millionaire with a bloodlust, before being killed off one by one in an elaborate game based on a children's rhyme.Look, Saw's not terrible, but it certainly wasn't good enough to justify spawning as many sequels as it did.The biggest issues with Saw are how one dimensional the characters are, but more so, how truly horrible the acting is, with incredibly flat and unconvincing performances by Danny Glover and an absolute career worst by Cary Elwes.Oh Cary Elwes, always charming as the english gent (Princess Bride, Robin Hood MIT) but on the flipside: never anything but god-awful in thrillers, consistently giving one of the worst American accents ever set to screen. I don't know which is worse, Elwes in Saw or the early 90's Alicia Silverstone vehicle The Crush. ""Cheyeeenne!""However, I can recognize Saw's role in ushering in the new wave of more extreme U. S. horror films, although most of it would soon be typified as torture-porn. Still in my opinion, vastly inferior to the artsy French darling, High Tension, from the year before, Saw really did help pave the way for more extreme Hollywood horror films (such as Hostel) to break into the mainstream. And for horror fans like me, who became desensitized at an early age by realistic slashers like Scream, I welcomed that new frontier with open arms.Thankfully, despite its shortcomings, Saw II improved upon Saw's core concept, with a better script, stronger cast and bigger budget. I may be in the minority, but I'd take any of the sequels over Saw OG, simply for the fact that the budget allows for more fun to be had with the Jigsaw traps. And let's be honest, that's really all these films have going for them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Was thrilled I SAW it!,"Hands down, the best psychological thriller I've ever seen! Saw makes Silence Of The Lambs look like a Disney family movie. Not so much for the blood & guts, but for the powerful brain tease and it's ability to tweak and twist your most feared thoughts. Want to have your clue solving mind tested? This flick is the ultimate head trip. Not for the weak kneed or faint of heart, the ultimate mind game.What a surprise that this so posed direct to VHS/DVD, low budget, shot in 18 days thriller was so fantastic. This sleeper should be up for an award! I can't stress enough how this film will mess with your mind up one side and down the other..............(evil grin)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stomach churning and truly terrifying,"Saw is by far one of the most genuinely frightening films I have seen in recent years. Director James Wan slowly cranks up the tension as slowly but surely the pieces begin to slot into place right the way up until the jaw droppingly climactic final scene and the shocking twist.The one and only reason I did not give this 10 out of 10 was that I believe the film suffers from one weak link, Cary Ewles. He lets the side down by delivering a melowdramatic and childish acting.Overall the film has some truly memorable moments and a fantastic villain played chillingly by Tobin Bell .See Saw NOW! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is really a great movie!!,"I've seen a lot of films in my life and horror is one of my favorite flavors, but there's a lot of crap on the market. This is not crap! The feeling that strikes you is right from the beginning of the film. Two men chained in a cell with a dead body in the middle, you just want to know what is happened to this men! And then the story unfolds for your eyes, but the ending is never suspected!! I thought it was a really great, original movie and after just seen ""Dead End"" (who also surprised me) I never thought I could get surprised twice a year, but it happened! The sound on the DVD was really great and creepy and a real surprise was Danny Glover! If you like a creepy, scary evening, rent or buy this movie! It's worth your money!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not even entertaining,"First, the acting in the movie was terrible. The actors did not go a good job of giving the viewers a sense of urgency or suspense. I found myself laughing at many points in the movie because the reactions by certain characters were just not realistic. Second, the whole premise of the movie was way to far fetched to even be remotely scary. The ending of the movie was not shocking at all. In fact, it just made me mad because of how unrealistic it was. I live in a college dorm and my entire hallway watched this movie together. All of us agreed that this movie was not worth the $1.50 that we spent to rent it.Suck it",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Intense and original!,"Take away the gore.
Take away the horror element, this is a solid film!Considering the original concept of how James and Leigh came up with the story idea, made a short film and got a chance to make this movie, the story is pretty well written, acting is fun and the ending closes with a bang!There's definitely more flashback scenes than I would like but still serves the story well.This is definitely the best Saw movie out of the franchise and if you haven't seen this one or scared to watch it, grab some friends and you won't be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"Saw was the craziest, most awesome movie I have seen all year. There were twists and turns. A great ending that no one saw coming. This was the most fun I had at a movie in a long time. I can't wait for the DVD. I was so into it, that I was holding my wife's hand tighter then she was holding mine. You wouldn't know that this was Wan's first movie he directed. He looked like a pro. Danny Glover is always great and entertaining. This movie by far was the best I have seen in a while. Go see this movie!Man, I have seen some crap the last couple months. This restored some faith back in the movie business. Saw is awesome. It is well worth the 10 bucks to go see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is Art,"Gyes, I'm really hopeful to see more movies of, at least, similar quality, suspense and genuinely written scenario in the foreseeable future. In fact, this film should work as a basic guideline for all people who are in the horror/thriller film industry, and I mean all of them, starting from script writers and ending with those who invest their capital in these beautifully worked out pieces of art. It would be my honour, frankly, to congratulate, and thank, those who wrote the most original and brilliant thriller scenario I've ever encountered in my entire ''fim absorbed'' life, in person. It's unbeatable, unspeakable, inexplicable, indescribable. There are no more words to tell about it. It's just that those who haven't seen it yet should do so rather sooner than later. Thank you James Wan and Leigh Whannell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
great,"i found this movie to be nothing short of brilliant. the only downer was in the acting but i found it very easy to look past the acting and be entertained by the plot. the twists and turns kept me guessing throughout the movie as i thought i knew the plot and where it was going 5 or 10 times only to find out that there was more. i was also reminded of the movie Seven throughout this entire movie, which is another movie i thought was outstanding. anyone who enjoyed Seven at all should consider Saw a must see. i wouldn't consider Saw a must see for anyone however, as there are many graphic scenes. i recently saw Texas chainsaw massacre and i considered this movie to be just as graphic so if you have a weak stomach you might want to pass on this movie but otherwise i would highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
