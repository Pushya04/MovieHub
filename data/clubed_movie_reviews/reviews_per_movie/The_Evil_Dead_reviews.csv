"""Join us""!","Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a very original splatter flick for it's time that would be a great start to a series and very influncial to loads of other filmmakers. Pretty serious in tone, 2 couples rent a cabin in the woods and discover The Necronomicon and awaken The Evil Dead. Very different for its time this gory fright film delivers on both scares and horrific make up f/x. This has very little comedy and moves at a slower pace than the other entries in the series. I must admit, I prefer Evil Dead 2 with more Bruce Campbell, the introduction of splatstick comedy. Evil Dead 2 is pretty much a reimagined version of the 1st film that does everything the 1st film does better. But, that is only my preference and opinion. Having said that, The Evil Dead is still very good and the most pure horror movie of the lot. A classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Marvelously putrid.,"What more can be said of Raimi's legendary cult-classic that hasn't already been beaten to death like a puss-oozing zombie that crosses paths with Ash? Possibly nothing, but I'll try.Before Spiderman and before the countless spin-offs of this movie were made or even conceived, Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun, and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoe-string budget, The Evil Dead delivers what it promises, the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it's mild budget and sometimes shaky acting, TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact, just run for your girly life.There are several reasons this film succeeds. First, Raimi's camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film, where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of, perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it to stop for it's unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it's way. Truly magnificent technique, however they did it.TED also succeeds because it's self-aware of the fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy, cheesy, revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone, one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you're not put off by mannequin ultra-violence, then you should find yourself on the supporter's side of the fence. I think some don't like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts, although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it's sometimes cheesy, there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point, the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one's spine. And let's not forget the unforgettable tree love scene, ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.Last but certainly not least: Bruce Campbell as Ash, the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash, period, and always will be.In my opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy, and although there could have been more of the chainsaw, this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it's sequels due to it's increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It's blood, gore, camera work, and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you've ever liked any horror film, this is an absolute must-see.Love or hate it, there it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You don't need a big budget to make an accomplished film,"Sam Raimi's feature length debut ""The Evil Dead"" is truly one of the greatest horror films of all time and the start of a magnificently entertaining trilogy of hilarity and some real scares. Made on a budget of only $375,000, the film is surprisingly accomplished on a technical level. The effects, although they do look fake by today's standards, hold up a lot better than you might have expected, and the stop motion sequence at the end, which looks a lot faker than anything else in the movie, was accomplished for its time and budget.""The Evil Dead"" is about a group of young adults who travel to a cabin in the woods and discover a 'book of the dead'. No prizes for guessing what happens next as each character is possessed (except for Ash) and disposed of via an intriguing variety of methods. Considering its budget, unknown director (at the time), and typical slasher plot ""The Evil Dead"" would almost certainly seem headed towards forgotten B-movie status, and yet it has stood the test of time and remains one of the most widely acclaimed horror films of all time. Why? It's simple. Although ""The Evil Dead"" is nowhere near as funny as its sequels, it's still a humorous self-satire while also being terrifying despite its age. This odd combination (only perfected in this film's sequels and ""Creepshow"") works because Raimi crafts a tense and moody environment, puts his characters in there, and then ruthlessly disposes of them, sometimes doing so several times for the same character. What's worse is that there's nowhere to go. Raimi creates a claustrophobic feeling in anyone watching, he wants you to think about being in a situation where you're trapped with nothing but death and destruction surrounding you. For most people, he probably succeeds. As far as acting goes, none of it is really very good but Bruce Campbell is instantly likable as Ash, who just has to be one of the most memorable horror film characters of all time.Gory, desolate, hopeless, and still funny, ""The Evil Dead"" is a horror masterpiece that isn't quite the strongest entry in the series, but is shockingly accomplished and entertaining despite its low budget and inexperienced cast and crew. This is a film everyone must see, along with its sequels.9/10",,Anonymous,Horror
The ultimate in terror,"It's the early 80's, what do you expect?  This is a scary scary film.  And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead.  And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
My teenage self would have loved it. I didn't.,"A group of friends spend the night in a cabin in the mountainsand it doesn't go well.Starring Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly.Written and directed by Sam Raimi.I think my age has a lot to answer for.I'm guessing that if I'd watched this as a teenager I would have loved it or at least enjoyed it more than I did now as an old bloke. It definitely had lots of creepy moments and funny moments.But from an old gits perspective I was actually a little bored watching this. I suppose when it was first released this movie would have been cutting edge and the ultimate horror flick. But I got that bored feeling in my stomach that I get when I'm reading a really boring book that I can't wait to finish so I can start the next one. It was all so repetitive. One demon possessed person attacks and then another and then another and then another. there was nothing new here and it's all been done before.The acting was okay but a bit hammy and the special effects ( although probably brilliant in 1981) showed their age.I'm giving it a 6/10 but my teenage self would have given it much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie everyone should respect !,"A few nights ago, a couple of friends and myself watched The Evil Dead again. It was like the 68th viewing for me ( I think...lost count somewhere around 50) but it still only means one thing to me: PARTY !! Many feeling can occur when watching this delicious masterpiece by Sam Raimi. You can either adore it, be frightened by it or be disgusted by it. But it always leaves a big impression on you and I can't imagine anyone would hate it.And there is ONE feeling that everyone should have towards this movie...RESPECT ! Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will, actually. No, when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film, you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great, but at the time, he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit, his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actor-list of many B-movie fans...And I'm one of them.Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the make-up. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word ""gore"" and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close.The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity, they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one, they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called ""Within the Woods"". It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great B-movie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy, it's certainly worth searching for.Anno 2003, Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was, but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi.A fun trivia element to finish this review with : If you're watching the end credits of the Evil Dead, you'll see Joel Coen is credited as Assistent Editor. Coen now is a famous director as well and may be considered as the best director alive. Back in 1981, he and Sam Raimi were close friends and even shared a studio when they were in collage. Joel Coen made his debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. One of the best cult movies ever made...Join us....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horrific Masterpiece,"Sam Raimi proved to the world that he could not only direct a movie but that he could create a product that was not only original but that could scare the hell out of you. Since the 1981 release, Bruce Campbell has found work on many film projects due to his break out performance in the Evil Dead. Raimi, has gone on to direct many films. Both have earned much of their career based on this little horror movie, that has been re-produced / recycled by thousands of ""wanna-be"" film makers world wide. This is not your typical ""zombie"" film, let alone your garden variety horror movie as well. The Evil Dead is one of those black comedies / horror movies that overwhelms the audience to either be scared out of their wits or won over by the movie's story and over the top characters. The Evil Dead is what most, if not all horror movies should be, very real and powerful.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A marvel what some college film students can do on a shoestring budget,"SPOILER(S) POSSIBLEThe first ever full-on film project by budding filmmakers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert(then called Bobby Tapert)would prove to be a work of endurance and love and also one of the more entertaining horror films made in the eighties.The plot is painfully simple: Five young adults from Michigan drive off into the woods for a camping vacation,using a seldom-used cabin as their haunt. They uncover a tape recorder and a crusty,dusty and blood-and-flesh-coated ""Book of the Dead"" or ""Necromonicon"",inadvertently incant the chant that awakes a limitless supply of malevolent spirits in the woods,and then one by one get picked off until a lone survivor is left to fight to escape. The story isn't much of an accomplishment:it's the whole physical undertaking that's the real accomplishment.On a small budget that was probably getting smaller as the shoot continued(I don't know the exact amount of time of filming,but it probably lasted at least a year),the filmmakers and stars(all of 'em,most famously budding star Bruce Campbell as the conflicted but can-do Ash)had to make the most of a limited set,claustrophobic settings,gallons of viscous fluids,endless supplies of cakey make-up,a limited amount of lighting(probably NOT an accident,there) and probably a mass-produced amount of fog to create something that has both the feel of a creepily eerie film about the undead and yet had the effects to back up the type of slasher horror pic that the producers were aiming for.The first of an intriguing trio of horror/comedy films that Raimi,Tapert,Campbell and company would crank out over a period of just under fifteen years(and,after seeing this film in full,I'm not sure if anyone involved originally intended to make any sequels),the atmosphere and noticeably cheap effects may turn-off your pickier horror film snobs,but anyone with a sense of adventure and high tolerance for gore will be reasonably pleased--if not greatly impressed--by this first effort film. A keeper,not a renter,not only for repeated viewing but also for the extras.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
lower expectations make for greater enjoyment,"With 365 other reviews at the time of this writing I find it hard to believe that I have anything new to add but here goes.No movie is ever going to be liked by everybody but I think the fact that The Evil Dead gets so much positive hype from its fans that fewer people in the future will enjoy it.  Hype brings with it a twisted like/hate ratio.  A movie with lots of positive hype will receive fewer positive critiques from future viewers and vice versa, negative will bring more positive critiques.With that said I admire what The Evil Dead brings to horror.  When I first watched this movie as a teen it and it's sequel scared the hell out of me. It didn't help that I watched it in my basement alone but that's part of the fun of horror movies.  I watched The Evil Dead again last night and it still packed a punch for me.  Of course not nearly as much as it did 15 years ago but I still found it enjoyable.The Evil Dead is an uneven movie but that is to be expected being made on such a meager budget.  But it does have enough suspense, shocks and creepiness to it that The Evil Dead can actually claim to be a horror movie. A lot of nay-sayers of The Evil Dead say it's a ""stupid"" movie, which in and of itself is a brilliant critique don't you think?  I for one think it's anything but.  Unlike many horror films it has a story which is easy to follow and for the most part fair to the viewer.Given that The Evil Dead was made for somewhere around $350,000 many of the aspects of the movie are remarkable.  The special effects are nicely done even if at times obvious.  Sam Raimi's camera work makes otherwise dull moments interesting to watch for the viewer.  Raimi knows his way around a dollar and in The Evil Dead he gets everything he can out of every cent he spends.So if you are looking for a good horror film, The Evil Dead is a perfect choice, if viewed in the right frame of mind.  Just remember, it was made on a very small budget, it was made by a first time writer/director and amateur actors.  With this in mind you should have yourself a good time watching The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead rates a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Join us!"" ""The Evil Dead"" is gruesome fun!","Before ""Spider-Man,"" Sam Raimi started off as the director of the classic fright film ""The Evil Dead,"" which, to this day, is one of the hippest horror films ever.Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, and his friends Scott and Shelly head out to an isolated cabin in the woods for some fun. But right from the beginning, strange things happen. Cheryl hears voices howling ""Join us!"" And then, Ash and Scott find a recording of a ritual from a book called The Book of the Dead. Too bad for them, because that ritual releases soul-hungry demons who possess everybody in the cabin. The only way to stop the demons is through the act of bodily dismemberment, and it's up to Ash to return the demons to their resting place. However, it's not gonna be easy.""The Evil Dead"" can be very scary, but it's mostly great fun to watch due to its shameless amount of gore. This movie goes so over the top, it sort of becomes comic, and I dig that.Bruce Campbell has created such an icon out of Ash, a character who has lasted through 3 films. Campbell is a master. The other cast is very good with Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Hal Delrich as Scott, Betsy Baker as Linda and Sarah York as Shelly.""The Evil Dead"" is a movie done with so much love for the genre, and a movie like that only comes once in a while.

"The whole thing is a tad overrated, but this is still an atmospheric creeper","I'm sure by this point nobody cares what somebody like me has to say about this movie, or indeed, this *franchise*, but I'll do it anyway. I saw the next two instalments (the remake given the name Dead by Dawn and the loose sequel), and I was glad to finally come to this one. I thought all three movies were somewhat entertaining, but also given an undue amount of cultural weight. This is my favourite of the bunch because it really does contain a weird, morbid atmosphere, and is not played for laughs.Those only familiar with the other films (and I think there are a surprising lot of you) might be surprised at how hard Sam Reimy works to create an atmosphere of genuine dread and hopelessness. It works well, up to a point. The problem is that the characters are non-entities except for Ash, and the story feels like it was written by a nine-year-old. Of course, we are all only really in this for the mayhem, and it does start pretty quickly. I like how this movie really pushes the case for the environment itself being malefic; that it's not just the playing of a tape waking the dead (or demons as the case may be), but the entire woodland they are in being riddled with evil and malignant spiritualities. It added an unexpected almost folk-horror element to proceedings, even though it was rather understated. Not much dialogue of interest in the film at all, so really not a lot to think about.The demons seem to be able to possess whomever they want, whenever they want, so the rules of the world are nebulous and don't seem to make sense. Why'd they go back to sleep after the professor made the tape and spoke the incantations? Look, I'm fine with ambiguity in horror; in fact it's largely preferred to having everything explained, but here it just seemed like none of that stuff really mattered, and that's a bit iinsulting.But hey, this is a really well-made movie with some nice quirks that was created by people who clearly really enjoyed what they were doing. Everyone plays it up to the hilt and I appreciate that. It's a lot creepier than the other instalments and does contain one or two genuinely disturbing scenes involving trees. it's also just over 80 minutes long, so the time will fly by.

"Scary back then, unnerving today","'The Evil Dead' has a reputation for being a cult classic but, like many older horror films, it certainly doesn't have the same impact today as it would have done at the time of release. Sure, there are some moments that make you jump, but the general horror elements are really quite tame compared to the modern horror.That said, the film does have its moments. There are a few scenes that are successfully unnerving, even with such dated special effects. The absence of any real story probably works to the film's advantage, with the focus being on unleashing as much terror on the innocent group as possible.'The Evil Dead' isn't as effective today as it probably was in the 80s but is still as successfully unnerving horror film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interestingly good...,"For a film that was made on a budget that would make Steven Spielberg die laughing, ""Evil Dead"" was one for the most interesting pieces of horror cinema I've ever seen. I watched the series backwards, so ""Army of Darkness"" was the film I saw first, then ""Evil Dead II."" While ""Evil Dead II"" is probably still my favorite, it was interesting to see where it all started.The camera work is incredibly good, and the fast motion sequences showing the demon's approach was pretty well done, if not completely original. Though also interesting, and kinda funny to note is that we see the characters running away, but when the camera switches away from the demon's view, we don't see the demon, and that seems like a touch of genius...we know it's there, but we can't see it, and while it probably was a limitation of the budget, it actually proved to be a great method of suspense.The special effects are as laughable as they were in the rest of the series, but there's something to be said for a film that takes its chances and goes to the extreme in lieu of lacking resources. People complain about this a lot, but I have to say to them ""get a sense of humor."" The whole point of the ""Evil Dead"" series was to mock horror films and show how campy they were and that they could get even worse. It's humor is in that the film tries to take itself seriously, but the lack of a big budget makes this not only impossible, but even funny in spite of the fact that it could conceivable be a serious film.The acting is also terrible, but again in that way that it's so obviously bad that it's hard to tell were the actors just plain bad or were they doing that deliberately to serve the purpose of mocking the genre. Bruce Campbell's introduction into the world of abused heroes is interesting since his character is actually less of a chauvinist in this one than he ultimately became famous for. But it works, and the horror on his face when his friend has no reservations about chopping up his possessed girlfriend is actually believable.Overall, this movie is a great piece of cinema. It's humorous, but serious as well, and its greatest strength is its ability to draw the line between being part of the genre and mocking it. There are plenty of moments of original horror (I don't think anybody could keep their composure during the ""Tree Rape"" scene, which they repeated to lesser effect in ""Evil Dead II,"" but let's face it that movie was supposed to be a rehash and extension). Give the film a chance and don't take it too seriously. Otherwise you're missing the point.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil are very gory when they are Dead,"Sam Rami gives us a gory good time in his first, feature-length film.Cult-favorite Bruce Campbell gives the performance of his career as Ash Williams, also starring are Ellen Sandweiss, who plays the best deadite, as Sheryl. To round out the cast are Hal Delrich playing Scott, Theresa Tilly playing Shelly, and Betsy Baker as Linda, Ash's girlfriend.These five teens go to a cabin for a weekend getaway that Scott bought cheap (Gee, I wonder why?) But while exploring the cabin's basement with Ash, they find three objects, a shotgun, a tape recorder, and an ancient book bound in flesh and written in blood. Yeah, that's a good sign. Well, in true dumb teen fashion, they play the tape, which makes something evil come from the woods. Later that day Cheryl decides to check something outside, she thought she saw. But when the trees rape her. Yes, rape, I know. The evil manifests in her, and she becomes a deadite, now Ash must fight off his friends and sister who are becoming deadites, one by one.I must give this film a ten because it has a great premise.

The scariest piece of horror ever!,"Until about 3 years ago, my favorite movie was Halloween 2.

The previous missing 12 minutes of blood and gore (that the Swedish censorship had cut) were back, in the full uncut Swedish version.I bought it with another film, 'cause there was an offer to buy 2 movies and only pay 100 crowns (about $11/£7 today).I saw it, and I was scared beyond recognition!

That movie has introduced him to mainstream filmgoers, no bad thing in itself, but to many of us Raimi is already a legend, because he created 'The Evil Dead', without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Made on a shoe string budget as a labour of love, it still remains Raimi's best movie. He has subsequently worked on bigger projects with bigger names but it is arguable whether he has ever surpassed the invention, thrills, energy and sheer fun of this. And why Bruce Campbell never became a genuine movie star after his debut here, and not just a much loved cult figure, is a complete mystery to me. 'The Evil Dead' is a modern horror classic and absolutely ESSENTIAL viewing for any self-respecting movie buff! It doesn't get much better than this!",,Anonymous,Horror
"The only horror movie, make that movie period, you will ever see a possessed tree limb act as a dildo.","While that first line might be a bit of a stretch, it gives a bit of mind about what to expect from Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, a horror movie so vulgar, so gorish, so unexplicably twisted, that it's incredibly ingenuous until the last shot.  Even for a low budget film noticably shot practically on a shoe string from a corpse, it's balsy.  The story starts off, and in times steers towards, the area of horror cliches, and yet by the time(s) we see the demonic characters, and the blood that goes along with it, it's accepted with the territory.The Evil Dead is to me one of those horror pictures like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or or Night of the Living Dead that goes to show that within the muck of endless B horror films that those with little money to spend can concoct something that shows craft (and good old chills) triumphs over money every now and then.  And if you happen to view this as a comedy, it goes for laughs in certain spots as well, albiet twisted to a crazed T. A+",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is still an intense and powerful movie.,"Today we have an enormous revival of the horror genre. I guess there isn't a month in which no new horror production is released. Even though this genre seems to many young people as something new and exiting, the ""older"" people (starting with people in their late twenties and early thirties) know better. We grew up with horror classics like 'Halloween', 'The Evil Dead',...The story starts with the five youngsters driving to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. In this cabin in the middle of the woods, they find the Necronomicon and the taped translation of the text. Of course they are curious and they start playing the tape, not knowing which evil this will release. One by one, the teens become deadly zombies, except for one. Now it will be up to him to survive the night and to battle the evil dead.Even though I'm not a huge fan of gore, I still appreciated this movie. Especially the beginning of the movie is still very intense and powerful. Most of the time these movies haven't been made with a large budget, but that doesn't mean that they don't offer any good fun. 'The Evil Dead' looks rather amateurish, but that's exactly what makes it more believable and good. It seems like these five young people have filmed their own adventures. The only remark that I could have is the special effects. I know that this movie was shot in 1981 and with a small budget, but the special effects sometimes really look pretty bad. Still, this is a classic in the genre and nice to watch. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I first saw this film when it was first released on video back in the 80's during my final years at school. It was the ""in"" thing - the movie to watch and the most talked about movie amongst us teenagers who were scared to death watching it.When I watched this the first time, I made the huge mistake of watching it alone. Right from the beginning, with the eerie, spine-chilling music and the sense of dark evil in the woods I knew that this movie was going to be unique in the amount of atmospheric terror it would strike into my very soul.Nearly every single scene scared me to death - the most frightening moments for me were when the camera was zooming around the steamy swamps, through the woods and approaching the cabin at break-neck speed, only to retreat quickly back when the poor soul running from the darkness made it to safety and slammed the door behind them.The zombies were excellent - the best I have ever seen (or ever likely to see) in any horror movie and their voices were deeply disturbing.After viewing it I told my friends at school how I felt about it and they all agreed that they were deeply disturbed by the whole experience and to me, this will always be the ultimate in scary horror - no other film before or since has come anywhere near the mark for heart-striking terror for me.Even to this day I have to pluck up the courage to spin this disc in the DVD player - the effect it had on me back on the 80's lies firmly planted within me and even when I hear anyone mention the title of this film today it strikes me full of terror.It just goes to show that you don't need a huge pile of cash to make a fantastic, chilling movie.Evil Dead is the best horror film of all time, and with the rubbish they produce today I think I can confidently say that no other movie could ever scare me again as much as this one does.Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite good but not as great as i'd hoped,"Being a big horror fan i was really excited at the thought of this film. Up until last year i had never seen it, just seen clips and heard people discuss it in enthused tones. It seemed to be at the top of most horror fans lists. So when i bought a copy on DVD i couldn't wait to get home and watch it. And i did. And to be honest, i wasn't quite as impressed as i thought i'd be. OK, so first off, the film isn't really very scary. I suppose when it was released it would have been as people weren't so much used to that extreme amount of violence and gore. But now it's just really funny.i wrongly thought it was meant to be one of, if not the scariest film ever. Which it's not. Nor does it pretend to be. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed watching the film but i just wasn't scared which i want to be when watching a horror film, otherwise i don't see the point. Anyway, i can see that the film has acquired over the years a sort of spoof status which is indeed what it looks like at times. The acting is terrible, the script laughable and the plot patchy at best, but i think (or at least i hope) that is how it was intended to be. I admit that i was creeped out a few times and did jump on occasion. So overall, i can appreciate the film for what it was. A funny film with a few scares and a lot of gore. Just not as good as it's meant to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, even if gruesome at times","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although it got quite disturbing at times. Probably the most gruesome movie I have ever seen, but it is well worth it. Sam Raimi's directing style is so unique that it feels entirely different than other horror movies.  I would reccomend this movie to people with a strong stomach, or people who like violent movies.  If you are unsure,(don't worry about it) watch Evil Dead II first to make sure you can handle the gore, and if you can, sit back and enjoy the best horror film ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
But was it scary?,"If you're expecting a truly scary movie, you will be disappointed. I just bought this movie because I remember it as being a classic from the 80's when I grew up......There are certain movies that stick in your head as being scary, for me these to name a few would be: The Shining, The Changeling, The Omen, The Blair Witch Project ( I got caught up in it )..... to name a few.I suppose for me it's what you don't see, or when you let your mind get the best of you and you start to see shapes in the living room...... that is truly scary, and then you know the movie has worked.....Bruce Campbell is good, there is no doubt there... You have to take this movie for what it is......gore! The opening scenes in the forest are scary....the reminded me of the Blair Witch Project, and everyone can imagine that type of scenario...when the gore starts, it loses all reality and then becomes a comedy.....it simply doesn't scare you.Maybe that is the intent......more a comedy than a horror.....its just not scary.

STILL THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE!!! A HORROR CLASSIC,"I grew up watching the BRILLIANT evil dead trilogy & love all 3 movies, my favourite was probably Army of Darkness but now i would say NOTHING beats the terrifying & gruesome 1981 original Horror MASTERPIECE!!! 
The original is pure Horror & is a gritty low-budget gross demonic possession flick before it went all comical, Ash was more of a terrified coward here but he was more real & full of fear like anyone would be!!! 
The setting is scary as hell & the atmosphere is full of dread & it's all very well made on that tiny budget.
A true scary old school Horror classic that used to terrifying me as a kid & still today it's scary as well as being crazy disgusting fun. 
Evil Dead (1981) really is a true Horror movie with amazing monster fx done with a tiny budget so this really is a Horror CLASSIC & the brilliant director Sam Raimi's MASTERPIECE",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy as hell,"when I first saw the movie i was expecting it to be a splatter movie with no scares just gore, I was very glad when the i was about half-way through the movie because it was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. The sounds the possessed make and their empty eyes,the cheap yet good make up effects,the thick fog and darkness.This movie also features some great camera work, and some of the shots were pure genius. It might be a little nasty with the trees raping women and the gallons of blood and gore but in this case the gore is not just filler to make the movie more repulsive so it wont need to be scary, no this movie really is scary.Every horror movie fan should own this.But I'm not giving it 10 points because of the silly FX in the final scene with the book and the demons.The plot is not a masterpiece but it's alright and nothing really bothers you, and as for the acting lets just say that although the actors would never win the academy awards they are much better then Saw's actors could ever be.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Low-budget cult horror classic has a great first half, but a redundant second half","RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Evil Dead"" chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues.This is a cult classic movie and the famous director's first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there's a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl.The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students' arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It's atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it's basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don't get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it's too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It's just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other.This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn't work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Morristown, Tennessee, with additional work done in Michigan.GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Franticly Satirical and Endlessly Innovative Gorefest Which Launched A Thousand Ships,"Infamous for a variety of reasons, The Evil Dead remains a landmark for cinema as a whole. In 1981 the film was banned, cut or had a delayed release in many countries as it was deemed both sadistic and gratuitously explicit. In the UK the film was originally released cut like in many other countries, yet when the film was due to hit video it was banned by the BBFC. It became notorious for being one of the first ""video nasties"" and it was not until 1990 that the film became ""unbanned"" by the BBFC. Fortunately, when released on DVD in 2001 all the cuts were waved, and since then the film has been widely available in its uncut and intended form. When viewed in the new era most of the film's material is fairly tame in comparison to the content of today's horror films.The premise of The Evil Dead is one which is so basic that it enabled Sam Raimi to create something so blissfully unique and absurd. The film kicks off with introducing five friends who are journeying to an isolated cabin. On arriving, they find a mysterious book (The Book of the Dead/Necronomicon) and a tape recording from a professor. Out of curiosity they decide to listen to the unsettling recording, which reads out an ancient curse. This results in ""the evil dead"" being released and wreaking possessive havoc on the innocent group of friends.Though The Evil Dead follows a simplistic story, and one which might even seem clichéd to viewers today, it was still a glaringly unique film for its time and has spawned influence across cinema. Arguably, the lack of a complex or even recognisable narrative structure acts as a way of making the film focus and succeed in all its other areas. Due to the lack of narrative, Sam Raimi is able to emphasise the ""exploitation"" side of the film and let his astonishing array of imagination flow through the picture. Some might dispute that The Evil Dead should not follow a story anyway, as it is a film whereby the aim is to depict survival through ""gruelling terror"".When you break-down The Evil Dead (analysing each area of the film); I find it hard to comprehend how anyone could refuse to respect the painstaking effort which went into achieving the best out of a tiny budget. The attention to detail in factors such as make-up, camera-work, animatronics, editing, lighting and atmosphere remains an astonishing achievement. Sam Raimi litters the film with B-movie flourish and classic horror references. This is a mark of respect for the films which helped to inspire many areas of The Evil Dead.The use of quick-cut editing focusing on tiny details is something which became extremely stylish in the sequel, yet not quite as raw. This is an example of how The Evil Dead is supposed to be scary at times. One of the film's most famous factors is the first-person camera shots of ""the evil"" rushing through the woods and around the key set-piece (the cabin). This has become a trademark style for the series; The Evil Dead is both amusing (yet this became much more apparent in the sequels, which ultimately became self-parodies) and fairly creepy. Yes, some moments may seem horribly corny and dated now, but it is something you should expect from such a film. My favourite aspect of the film is Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash, which although extremely cringe-worthy at times is indisputably bursting with panache and charm. Bruce Campbell established himself as a cult favourite due to the series, and rightly so. He honestly is one of the finest character-actors of all-time, a genius of physical comedy and an expert in the art of exaggeration. His acting talent is something which improved as his career progressed, but he is still widely recognised for being the lovable imbecile and protagonist of The Evil Dead.The Evil Dead kicked off a cult following and introduced what was to become one of the greatest trilogies of all-time. There is no denying the sheer fury and excitement The Evil Dead carries with each viewing. Ultimately, it is the low budget that enables the film to still pack an unnerving jolt of exhilaration.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not sure why this is a classic,"Good concept (for 1981), great camera work and you have to be impressed with how much they did with so little. But what Raimi needed more than money was time: time to write the script, think about the characters, and rehearse. The acting is wooden, as if the actors are still blocking out where they will be standing in each scene. Their actions and reactions are implausible, with the impressive exception of Ash's vacillation over what to do about his girlfriend. You share his moral dilemma as he weighs whether he would be slaying a demon or murdering an innocent girl. With so many horror movies that are executed so much better, this movie is only useful as part of Raimi's biography...and perhaps the history of the genre. Good for film students; not a priority for anyone else.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cult classic!,"Sam Raimi's original cult classic is probably one of the better zombie movies ever made. THE EVIL DEAD, becoming legend in the horror genre shocked audiences around the world and became a phenomenon. Who would have thought that a simple independent horror film would become such a hit? Certainly not Sam Raimi or film star Bruce Campbell, who was pretty much the only actor who went on to bigger and better movies.If you are a fan of zombie movies and horror films in general, then this original cult classic will satisfy your appetite for horror and gore.The acting is pretty good and the film's premise and story are somewhat original, especially for such a low-budget movie.

The horror genre's greatest roller-coaster ride!!,"Inventive, startling, and always-packing energy, Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a true testament to the power of talent over budget! It has became a beloved cult classic and stands as one of the most influential horror films of all time!Five young adults go off to a mountain cabin, where they unknowingly unleash evil, possessive spirits that reek havoc upon everything!The Evil Dead is perhaps the last of the great drive-in horror classics. Director Sam Raimi, who has since gone on to films with much bigger budgets, made his debut with this wildly terrifying genre masterpiece. Raimi's crafty direction builds a thick atmosphere of dread and isolation through out the film, using the woodsy setting as a great back drop. He uses some nicely inventive camera shots. The movie does indeed play out like shocking roller-coaster ride, as the scenes of in-your-face horror and gore hit hard and fast, only to be followed by eerie lulls of tension. It's the most effectively gripping style that any horror film could use! Raimi also makes the most out of using dark humor in the film, making even the most scary sequences strangely funny. The makeup FX are truly gruesome, even with a low-budget there are plenty of freakishly-good FX to drive the thrills.Raimi also creates some nicely bizarre and memorable sequences, like the vine-rape scene with Cheryl, the demented singing of a possessed Linda, the 'bleeding' cellar pipes, and that grand finale with Ash having to make a stand to survive! Not to mention the knock-out final shot of the film, which is probably the greatest closing image to any horror picture ever! Also worthy of mention is the great music score by Joe LoDuca. LoDuca's music is a perfect match to the film, building plenty of tension and playing off the shocks very well.The cast is as good as one would expect from a B picture, but they do hold their own. Of course the real star of the show is square-jawed B movie hero Bruce Campbell. Bruce does an outstanding role, playing terror to a T, and enduring the physical hardships of a grueling low-budget film. He deserves his B movie king status!The Evil Dead has gone on to become one of the biggest cult films of all time and it's not hard to see why either! It's an outstandingly awesome horror ride that should be taken by all horror film fans! If they're anything like this horror fan, Evil Dead will quickly become a big favorite!Followed by Raimi's comical Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of Darkness (1993)**** out of **** (horror perfection)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creating originality,"There's something about this film that really resonates; moreso than the perfected comedy and cinematography of the more acclaimed Evil Dead 2. There's a special place in horror (and in my heart) for the entire film series all the way through Ash vs Evil Dead (which I advise anyone reading this to watch all seasons). But, seeing the initial product of Raimi's vision still satisfies in ways none of the others do. A specific view that's been copied over and over and yet this film still buries all that try to emulate this look; a much darker forlorn aspect that even the remake (the Mia one) can't match.

This Film Will Scare You,"The Evil Dead is a film that scared me. In fact, everyone I spoke to has been scared of this film.It really is a horrible film. You feel sorry for the characters in it.

A Horror Classic,"The Evil Dead made such a impact on me as a child, it engaged my love of film making and fueled my love for horror.I remember the day I watched it as clearly as I see my computer screen before me.Our neighbours two houses down, the father had hired The Evil Dead on VHS, us neighbourhood kids gathered around the television set, the mum on the sofa. My friends dad (who hired it) had already seen the film, so he excused himself to do work outside.Everyone enthralled, scared to death and just as that pencil went into the ankle, the dad grabbed my friends mums ankle and she let out an almighty scream. We had all been so engrossed, we had not noticed that he had snuck in the back door and managed to secure himself under the lounge, laying in wait for the perfect time to pounce.That to me is what horror is about, The Evil Dead captured the audience's imagination and delivered what will always be one of the greatest horror films made.

Been watching it for 6 years and it still scares me,"I thought for a budget of $50,000, they did a damn good job of making a scary movie. The Evil Dead has become one of the most popular cult classics of all time, especially to horror fans. I remember how I accidentally came across this movie, I just had a gift certificate for Blockbuster Video and just bought this previewed, I thought at first it was kind of cheesy, but it did terrify me. I showed my friend this movie and we went on the internet and couldn't believe all the websites dedicated not only to this movie, but I found out there were two other sequels.5 friends go on a camping trip and are just looking for the most part to just relax, party, and have a good time together. But there is something wrong when Ash's sister is hearing and seeing horrible and scary things in the cabin. She is loured out into the woods by a creepy voice and is raped by the spirits in the tree's, sorry, I don't know how else to say it. But when the guys decide to have a little fun and play a tape from the previous owner who studied spirits and demons, they raise The Evil Dead. One by one the friends are possessed and kill each other.This is an incredibly disturbing and fun gory flick to watch. I couldn't believe it when I found out that this movie was made with a small budget. Who knew? I bet Sam didn't and he probably didn't expect the success he has today.

Raising the dead,"The Evil Dead (1981) is a horror film considered a classic by many people, and called a great movie directed by Sam Raimi. I do not think this movie is perfect, but I admire this movie for going all the way with its plot, effects, and certain moments that makes it an entertaining movie.The acting is not fantastic or anything, but it is not bad, and I like Bruce Campbell. Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams was a good character and can kind of be relatable because he acts like anyone would if you were in a situation like this, by being scared and slowly going insane from the undead creatures, along with developing as the movie goes on.I do love the practical effects they show off throughout the whole movie, even if it can look silly from time to time. There was good makeup and effects, and a lot of practical gore effects that was impressive because the fact that they put in a lot of effort in the effects and looks of the undead shows how much they wanted to make this movie.Particularly good stunt work with the actors, and the cinematography is cool. The camera shots can look weird enough to fit what is happening, and the way they shoot these locations are in effective ways, along with weird camera angles and movements of the actors and the undead creatures that makes the movie entertaining to watch.The Evil Dead (1981) is at least worth watching for the effects, look and feel, the performances, and the gore if you can handle it. This movie does not take itself too seriously, which makes this movie creepy, funny, and entertaining to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A pretty crude and rough, but undeniably effective little 80's splatter horror shocker","Okay, we all know the plot to this one backwards and forwards, so I'm not going to bother with an unnecessary synopsis here. Instead, I'll just give this endearingly ragged early 80's splatter horror indie landmark all the props that it deserves. Granted, Bruce Campbell's acting leaves a bit too be desired (he's much better in the second one), the make-up f/x are pretty primitive, and the production values are a tad chintzy and cheesy, but there's no denying the sheer infectious abundance of pure brio, passion, energy and enthusiasm which permeates every last gloriously gonzo frame. Sure, money can buy slicker production values and fancier special effects, but all the money in the world can't and won't compensate for a severe dearth of heart and soul. This is the secret to this admittedly scrappy movie's remarkably enduring cult appeal and grungy charm; you can tell everyone involved in this deliciously demented delight put their proverbial all into the film. Moreover, the roughness of the film itself gives the movie a substantial raw, rattling, unrelenting power and intensity that a bigger budget and slicker execution would have only detracted from. Yeah, it's got its faults, but said flaws aside it still does the kick-you-in-the-gut jolting and startling trick to this very day.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good for the budget.,"I've heard great things about the evil dead and it's sequels. I don't think it is as good some people say. It is really good considering the budget, the effects are great and so is the music, set design and cinematography. The use of POV shots was brilliant. But the characters were a big let down for me.The characters were exchangeable with one another and didn't really have that much about them. Ashley was by far the best character, but I still think he wasn't great. Linda, Shelly and especially Scott really annoyed me, they weren't even very funny while they were human. I have a couple more issues, one due to having a tiny budget and one due to the dialogue. The ADR is bad sometimes and really bad when characters are laughing, and dialogue between characters wasn't ever interesting.I enjoyed the rest of the movie a lot. The makeup and effects were fantastic. I loved how whacky it got for the third act, I loved the last half hour. The cinematography got so weird and unique during the finale, the scares were great during this part as well helped by the shot composition. The music was awesome and appropriately used, the end credits music was funny and it sounded good too.I would highly recommend you watch evil dead, I heard the sequels are even better so I'm excited to watch them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An execrable, forgettable piece of all-around poorly-made trash.","SPOILER: I'm at a loss to understand a lot about this movie: the people who say they were scared by it, the fact that it wasn't forgotten immediately after release, the fact that it got a release at all. Basically, this movie must appeal to those that don't believe a good horror movie should have any of the things that make any other movie good: actors that can maybe act a little. A plot. Something faintly resembling adequate cinematography, or at the very least, shots that Camera-work that looks like the cameraman had the visual sense of a at least a seventh grader.This piece of forgettable trash has none of that. I have no problem with low-budget horror. But this doesn't just look like a student film. It looks like a film made by talentless students who didn't know how to write, direct, set lights, or act.I first saw it in the theaters as a 13-year-old horror buff, with a friend with similar tastes. As a 13 year old, I found it laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary. Now, 27 years later I gave it another chance. And you know what? It's laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary.This is an execrable mess. It's that lousy. These people who are giving it 10 stars... I don't know what movie they were watching, because the one I saw certainly wasn't worth the hour and a half of my time. If I could have watched the whole thing in 15 minutes, it wouldn't have been worth the 15 minutes.I dunno, I guess if you like wooden, ham-fisted lack of acting ability, or are scared by completely fake-looking special effects that are clearly made of poorly animated stop- motion clay, or enjoy weak plots full of logic holes you could drive an 18 wheeler through, there'll be a lot to please you here.

From the humor and make up, to the animation and Bruce Campbell in action, from the nice frame about the poor Sumerians to the end and, sure, the fight scenes, all is seductive, making The Evil Dead a classic.

Required viewing for horror fans,"""The Evil Dead"" is really quite an achievement. With very little money writer/director Sam Raimi and company created a movie that will live on for quite a long time (it already has). When I first saw this movie it scared me. I don't get scared any more but I marvel at the humor, the gore and the inventive storytelling. It's a shame Raimi went Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A relentless, gory masterpiece.","Sam Raimi may be working with mega-budgets and A-list stars these days but, in my opinion, nothing he has done has surpassed the brilliance of The Evil Dead. In terms of originality and verve, this movie certainly surely tops any of his Hollywood blockbusters.The premise is simple: five people vacationing in a remote Tennessee cabin are attacked and possessed by ancient spirits. Despite this simple plot, the movie manages to be thoroughly engaging from start to finish and delivers plenty of scares along with tons of inventive special effects.Raimi spices up the visuals with a bagful of directorial tricks including improvised steadicam shots and unusual POV angles. Such techniques can become tiresome if overused, but Raimi keeps a tight rein on proceedings and uses these shots where they are most effective, rather than just for the sake of them. Great editing and imaginative sound design add to the overall brilliance of the film.The gore effects are, for the most part, very good. The more outlandish and extravagant gags towards the end are the least impressive (the Plasticine stop motion is kind of shonky) but, considering the budget, this can easily be forgiven.The cast are uniformly excellent, with a special mention going to the young Bruce Campbell as Ash, whose brilliantly physical performance carries the latter part of the film pretty much on its own. He convincingly portrays a character that is pushed beyond snapping point, but who claws his way back to fight the evil forces that surround him.In the early 80s, The Evil Dead was caught up in the whole 'Video Nasty' debate, and subsequently banned in the UK. As a teenager, I treasured my beat up old pirate copy of the film, but have since bought the full uncut version on DVD and the original Palace VHS release (which features great cover art!). This brilliant film never deserved to be vilified in the manner it was, and is thankfully now recognised by cinephiles as the highly influential and truly marvellous movie that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
First time watching The Evil Dead in 2021 and..,"Kinda late to the party I know, but yeah, I finally watched The Evil Dead for the first time ever in 2021 aaaaaaand I enjoyed it, This movie ain't this loved and well praised for nothing, and while yes, I had a fun time watching it, I really expected a lot more outta it.. Like I can see why so many people love it and say it is the best horror movie ever made and how it changed horror movies forever and yade yade yada, and yeah It has a lot of great moments here and there, Amazing make up work, Great practical and gore effects, Very cool and creative camera angles that make the cabin seem larger than it is really, but other than that, Is this movie really THAT good..I really respect and appreciate Sam Raimi for making such an ambitious movie (especially for the time) with such a small budget, Like.. this man and his team are a living definition of doing so much with so little, But you don't need money to write a good story and characters and that's basically my biggest problem with movie, The characters, I felt like the characters were basic, Way too basic infact I couldn't for the life of me care for them, Even for a horror movie, Like the only reason we should care about these characters is just because they're the main characters and that's it, I wish they had a little bit of depth to them, so we could actually care when something bad happened to them.The acting is.. kinda questionable (let's just say that) Let's keep in mind that this was Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's feature debut, so I guess I can forgive them about that, but the thing that I can't actually forgive and not gonna lie kinda annoyed me is the tree rape scene, yes THAT tree scene.. Was that scene even necessary, Like I kinda understand why it is in the movie, It is to show how evil and messed up this forest really is but I felt like there was like a hundreds thousands other ways you could've implied that and I'm not saying this because the scene disgusted or disturbed me or anything (I'm kinda numb to these type of things because of how much horror movies I've watched) but yeah this was just kind of outta nowhere and really clashed with the tone of the rest of the movie, I'm really happy that Sam Raimi admitted that regrets filming and even thinking about writing a scene like this saying in a recent interview: ""I think it was unnecessary gratuitous and a little too brutal... my goal is not to offend people. It is to entertain, thrill, scare... make them laugh, but not to offend them... I think my judgment was a little wrong at the time."" I think the movie would've been a lot better without it but oh well..So yeah, this was overall a pretty fun and interesting experience, I think with time and more rewatches (especially with friends) I would love this movie even more and maybe give it a higher rating but as if now, I'm pretty satisfied with my rating, and I'm pretty excited about watching Evil Dead 2 and especially excited about the fact that they embraced the goofiness and wackiness of the first film, so I already know I'm gonna enjoy it even more, So yeah, The Evil Dead gets a 7/10.Edit: Not gonna lie, I feel kinda bad for giving this movie a 7 now, After watching other classic horror movies, I've changed my mind, this movie easily gets an 8/10, I don't know why I get so critical sometimes lol.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"I live In Morristown, TN","I live in Morristown, TN. This movie is awesome!!! Maybe I can fill some of you in on a few things..One of the local backers of this film was assistant producer Gary Holt. He and his family own a location called Renaissance Farm. It was a horse training farm. A Big red barn in the far western part of Hamblen County, Morristown, TN. Later on it was a flea market, for awhile. Now it is some other business. Note at the starting of the movie, on the screen, Renaissance Pictures. The local locations of the film are in Morristown and surrounding areas. At the first of the movie, when the yellow Oldsmobile is traveling down the gravel road, and met head on with the red truck, notice the concrete bridge in the background.. that bridge is non other than Old Highway 25 E in Grainger county. The Highway, 25E is now being widened into a 4 lane highway, they have been working on this road project for years and still are today. It is right on the border of Claiborne County, near Tazewell, TN. The dirt and gravel road sits directly on the other side of the Clinch River.... To access this gravel road, go straight across the bridge, take a right turn and go under the bridge and that will take you right down on the gravel road and on down to the river... Also, filmed in Grainger county, the scene directly after this one.... Where the car horn is being blown and you see the 2 men walking (fisherman I think). Look directly in the background and you will see the opening that was cut into Clinch Mountain for the HWY 25E widening project back in the middle to late 1970's. That part of the mountain is visible in 2 scenes. The road that the 2 men are walking on is the OLD HIGHWAY that was a 2 lane, winding road. As this movie was filmed a long time ago..... the trees have all grown up in that area now and you cannot see the top of the mountain from that area anymore. That road they are walking appears to be at the starting of what is left of the old road that runs near the Poor Valley area. If you are going to go north on HWY 25E from Bean Station and Morristown and upon the mountain, that road will be the first road on the left as you are starting to go up the mountain. The actual cabin where the movie was filmed is (was) located in west Hamblen County, Morristown, TN in the same general area as Panther Creek State Park area...just a bit of the way up from the park.....I have never been to the house....but I have heard about it.....It is not visible from any road. It sit (s) far back up in the woods. Some people make the mistake and get it mixed up with another old ""haunted house"", The Murrell Melville Home, that is in the area and sits near the road... THE EVIL DEAD CABIN DOES NOT, DID NOT SIT NEAR ANY ROAD. The entrance is in an unmarked driveway that enters a field. The cabin sat way back in the backcountry almost in the woods. This is plainly visible in the film. I will not give directions to the cabin or cabin site... they are posted on other Evil Dead websites, they are not 100% accurate though. Anyway, the reason I know all of the above information is that I am a lifetime resident of Morristown, TN and I remember this film being made. Mr. Holt is well known in this area. Anyway, that is my 2 cents worth.... I hope you enjoyed reading it....EVIL DEAD LOVER",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genre Defining Classic,"Evil Dead got banned in Germany in 1985. This probably contributed a lot to its infamous reputation it enjoyed here during the second half of the 80s. Among teenagers it was _the_ movie to bring to a party and devide the guests into those who were ""brave"" enough to watch it and those who weren't.I remember one such party, I think it was 1990 already, were the movie was playing. I caught only about half of it (not including the gorier scenes at the end) because I was too busy experimenting with other stuff you tend to be very much interested in at the age of 16 (won't tell whether it was sex or drugs)... or maybe I just wasn't brave enough?Anyway, time moved on, the ban on the film was lifted in 1991, and you can now rent and buy it on DVD in various incarnations. So, I rented the ""full uncut"" UK release (PAL, Code 2, 86 min).OK, the violence in this picture is excessive but presented in a slapstick/comic book manner that makes it easily watchable. Acting is as bad as everyone is saying, but still it's hard to not like Bruce Campbells performance.I also liked the much acclaimed camera work. From the first minute on camera angles and movements are used to create suspense and the sense of some immaterial threat lurking in the woods.There are other very nicely done low-budget effects such as a mirror liquefying when one of the characters tries to touch it, which curiously reminded me of similar scene in The Matrix (done in CGI) that alone probably cost about as much as the complete Evil Dead.I'm not sure though whether, after 20 years, this movie is still scary. The Sixth Sense, for example, scared me much more (don't laugh).Still I guess it is a must-see for any fan of the genre. It is wonderfully campy and bits of it actually can pass as rather smart filmmaking, especially considering the highly limited budget.7/10 (this includes a bonus point for being the influential cult classic it is)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One of the greatest best 80's horror films of all time the most terrifying ""Evil Dead"" is still the first one my personal favorite","The first Evil Dead is still the most terrifying bloody scary movie from the 80's of all time. It is one of the greatest horrror films of all time my personal favorite it is in my top 10 favorite horror films. Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead to me is the best of best masterpiece terrifying terror on a widescreen ever. I saw this film on VHS when I was 9 years old and I was so terrified that I have not watch this movie for over 20 years.Sam Raimi and his roommate friend Bruce Campbell from college invasted their saving money in to making ""The Evil Dead"" movie. This movie was made on alow budget money Rami and Campbell could not effort better a big group of actors, or better effects, but with super low budget this movie works.""We're going to get you. We're going to get you. Not another peep. Time to go to sleep. ""I love this movie to death it was shot in Tennessee in the early winter 80's in the cabin, the cabin in which the movie was shot is burned down. I love, love this movie to death. It is a personal horror film of mine. There were three movies made: Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness and remake. My favorite will always be the first one, because it is more scary, has no humor. Really believable everyone making this movie did a good job.Bruce Campbell's acting performence is the best of the film,I like him more in this movie than in the sequels. In this movie Ash Williams is not a super hero with a chainsaw and a shotgun. He is a normal human being, he cares about his friends, he is not a selfish tough guy like in the sequels, he is a normal guy. He dosen't know what to do and he has to fight for survival against evil demons and spirits posessing his friends. Just like in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood when Tina accidently releases Jason from his cell and now she haa to fight to put him back there where he belongs in his cell. In here Ash, his sister and his friends accidently unleashes evil demons and spirits and now Ash has to fight for his survival to get them back there where they belong in the cell.The story is a basic cabin in the woods story about a group of college kids who get more than they bargained for when they accidentally release a few demons on their trip to the country. As you might assume, all hell breaks loose and Raimi really proves himself as a director combining horror and comedy elements that both work. The horror is genuinely creepy. Not to mention how well the film is shot with great framing and tremendous high speed demon POV shots that fly through the woods around the cabin with reckless abandon. It's a fascinating first effort, impressively well crafted and holds up very well despite its age.I love how the film was shot the filming locations I like the other cast beside Bruce Campbell. Ellen Sandweiss was excellent as Cheryl Williams love her performence I did not know Cherly was actually Ash's sister because she was never mentioned in the sequels later. Richard DeManincor as Scotty friend of Ash and Cheryl was really good. I like DeManincor's performence, I love Scotty he was a bad-ass in this movie. Betsy Baker as Linda was a babe she was really good as Ash's girlfriend I am wondering why she did not come back for the sequel. Theresa Tilly was a babe as Shelly I love her.I love the effects, the blood, the creepines in this movie, the gore, death scens all are excellent. Evil Dead II and The Evil Dead are the best in the series I will still go for The Evil Dead as my favorite in the series. I love this film to death I recommend this film to any horror fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No budget, no problem.","The Evil Dead is one of those films that will stand the test of time on many levels; special effects(crude but vicious), shock value and controversy, acting, directing, and music. Each of these traits, along with very nice pacing and suspense keeps the original ED leagues above the filler that Hollywood regurgitates every year. Bruce Campbell, the every man's man, stars as Ashley Williams, a guy who decides to bring his girlfriend and some other pals to a remote cabin in the woods for some rest and relaxation. Through some bad luck, demons are evoked from an ancient slumber and begin to wreak havoc among the group; pitting friends against friends, and then eventually, everyone against Ash. The acting is great, especially by said Campbell, whose square jaw and rubber face ensure him as the horror genre's Jim Carrey. Sam Raimi's film is a compilation of stop-motion gore, claustrophobic terror, and innovative camera angles, and realistically, never has someone done so much for the genre with so little. Of course The Blair Witch Project was well done, but it hasn't had the success and constant imitations that Raimi's little film has. A fun time all around, especially for movie goers who aren't afraid of a little blood and hurt. It's a cult classic, but with such huge notoriety and fame, this film has evolved into mainstream status. And for good reason.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Evil Dead (1981) Little money, a lot of quality","Sam Raimi, in his early career as a director, didn't have that much money to develop his film, but without letting that get in the way, he went there and created a very good horror film. It was here where it all began and he was able to show all his genius as a director. The way he used to create the first-person scenes, the makeup, the sets and everything that appears in the film is just another proof of his ability. Even without that much money, he was able to create a very engaging story in a really interesting setting. As much as the film has its faults, it still remains a great horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The House where Evil Dwells,"**SPOILERS** Shocking and terrifying horror movie that uses it meager $350,000.00 budget to the fullest extent to scare the living hell out of it's audience. Far better then the many multi-million dollar slasher/splatter films that it's, or their, constantly compared to.Five college students take a ride out in the heavily wooded wilds of Tennessee to spend the weekend at a cabin that they rented and things start to go bad even before they reach their destination. Crossing a creaky bridge the car almost falls through the rotted woodwork and barley makes it to the other side. At the cabin the students brother and sister Ashley or ""Ash"" and Linda Williams, Bruce Campball & Besty Baker, together with friends Scotty Cheryl & Shelly, Richard DeManincor Ellen Sandweiss Theresa Tilly,find the place a mess. Cleaning up the place they unearth a book and tape recordings, together with a reel to reel tape recorder, that belonged to the cabin's previous owner.All this time we get to see and feel that there's something evil in and around the cabin that's just waiting to get unleashed. It's the strange book and weird sounding tape recordings that the new occupants found there that serves as the trigger or linchpin that set. the evil spirit, it into motion. Reading from the book that seems to be a hand-written copy of the notorious Satanic Book of the Dead, Necocomicon, the students then play back the tapes, that they found along with it. The tapes has the owner of the cabin explain what happened to him when he deciphered the books mysteries that must have drove him either out of his mind or in his grave or both. The former cabin owner gives out, on the tape, this eerie and blood-curdling Cathulhu chant that activates the evil that surrounds the cabin. That brings the forces of hell out of their long sleep and into the open taking over the bodies and minds of the unsuspecting students. One at a time it turns them on each other until the cabin, and the area immediately outside of it, turns into a mind-numbing and horrific slaughter-house.Not for those that are weak of heart ""The Evil Dead"" has an unrelenting drive to it that's never-ending. Not giving you a chance to catch your breath even once the unearthly and evil action once it's starts going and never ever stops. Even the ending, when the horrible night in the cabin is finally over, it sets you and the lone survivor of this massacre up for a nasty surprise with a jump-out-of-your-seat final.Even though some of the scenes with the Evil Force taking over the students bodies may be a bit overdone, especially in the make-up department, they still jolt you right out of your skin. You start to get the feeling, like those in the movie, that there's nothing on earth that can stop the Forces of Evil unknowingly released by the students. That's until those who released them are overcome possessed and finally consumed by them.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can accomplish a lot with so little,"The Evil Dead still holds up pretty well even All these years later, at least, it does story wise. The central premise/lore behind it is simple but also very capable of being very rich and you can easily see how the filmmakers have been able to last so many decades. The acting can be a little silly as well as the special effects but most of the movie is actually pretty good and it's kind of surprisingly when you look into how cheap and messy the production was. I would definitely recommend this, if anything, it's a great showcase into what you can accomplish with a very small amount of resources.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unforgettable Horror,"""The Evil Dead"" (1981) is a true masterpiece of horror that still manages to terrify audiences today. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, the film follows a group of friends who unleash an ancient evil while staying in a remote cabin in the woods.Raimi's direction is nothing short of genius, and the practical effects and use of camera work add to the film's overall terrifying atmosphere. Campbell's performance as the lead character, Ash, is iconic and adds to the film's enduring legacy.From the eerie setting of the cabin to the gruesome and creative practical effects, ""The Evil Dead"" delivers on all fronts for horror fans.

Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell introduce their signature style in the first Evil Dead film that exudes style,"Five friends Ash (Bruce Campbell), Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Ash's girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker, and Shelly (Theresa Tilly) and Scott (Richard DeManicor) go on vacation to a cabin in the woods. The group eventually stumble upon artifacts left by the previous owners which unleash Kandarian demons upon the group over the course of a hellish night.The Evil Dead is the theatrical film debut of writer director Sam Raimi and its star Bruce Campbell both of whom had worked together from a young age making Super 8 films. The two eventually decided to make their approach to commercial filmmaking through horror and Raimi's love of H. P. Lovecraft would serve as the basis for Book of the Dead which would be retitled Evil Dead. Made from money borrowed from friends, family, and anyone else they could interest, the film was something of a ""rite of passage"" for Raimi who had only turned 20 shortly before making the film. Eventually the film came to the attention of producer Irvin Shapiro who'd been responsible for distributing landmark horror film Night of the Living Dead and helped to distribute the film worldwide with further investment from Raimi where it garnered significant critical praise including from Stephen King whose rave remarks helped garner interest from New Line Cinema. The Evil Dead is pure passionate filmmaking that creates an engaging experience using minimal resources.The Evil Dead is about as simple a premise as you can get with five kids going to a secluded area only for something to come attack them and certainly fits well within the 80s zeitgeist with contemporaries such as The Burning and Friday the 13th. But it's all the little details that give the film its identity with the various Lovecraftian artifacts littering the Cabin's basement, the shrill cackles emanating from the demons, or the unseen spectre that chases our characters that is only conveyed through a series of fast moving POV shots. While the Evil Dead has a similar setting to many other 80s woods set horror films, there's a style and energy in the guerilla style filmmaking that makes The Evil Dead one of those movies you could easily identify scenes from out of context. The effects work used to create the possessions and gore effects look very nice with clever mixtures of prosthetics and stop-motion with the amount of splatter dialed up to darkly comedic levels through the sheer amount of excess. While the movie doesn't feature quite the same level of humor that would be present in later entries, it is still there even if it is playing into more conventional horror tropes of the time. Bruce Campbell remains the standout in the film and despite being a little green in the performance you can see his trademark physicality that is uniquely his and the seeds of his charisma such as in the last 30 minutes where it's basically a one man show.The Evil Dead is a great debut for both Raimi and Campbell. While it doesn't have the polish of later entries in the Evil Dead series or follow-up projects for the director and star, it is a solid showcase of their talents. It does allow some scenes to run a bit long and there are certain sequences (such as the tree scene) that I'm not a fan of, but you'd be hard pressed to find a debut film made with this much passion and energy where the crew put themselves all into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic with some flaws that really show.,"This film is an impressive marvel due to its budget. It really solidifies itself as a classic horror movie among fans of the genre. The scares are decent. The characters are passable. The gritty cinematography really adds to the films atmosphere. The end scene is a real classic (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet). The sequence of events is fine, however it does drag sometimes. There was a certain scene that really dragged on and I'm not sure wether to sit there in silence or laugh at how awkward it was. The scene that has the stop motion is very cool. The makeup is very cool aswell. However, the impressive camera work and effects can't exactly save it's at moment mediocrity and kinda weird moments. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wish I knew what the point was,"I wish I knew what the makers were going for. I saw Evil dead because of all the positive reviews and I hated everything about it. I'm not even gonna analyze it, I'm not gonna pan it as I don't see the point. The simple fact is that I hated every single aspect of this movie and I haven't the slightest clue what the they were going for. So afterwards I was reading reviews and I noticed something funny. With the positive reviews there are two kinds: the ones that love it because it's terrifying and the ones that love it because it's hilarious. So which one is it? Was it supposed to be funny or scary? Or both? I'll say right now, both doesn't work. Being scared and laughing are opposites IMHO. I can't be scared and laugh and I can't laugh and be scared. So horror comedy doesn't work, a parody on horror movies does. Except for the famous tree scene (which I didn't find remotely funny nor scary) I don't see anything here that could be meant to be funny. The sequels and Ash vs Evil Dead are definitely more like comedies. So here's what I think. I think this original was either never meant to be a comedy (it was in no way billed or promoted like one and IMDb doesn't list it as one). I think the audience thought it was funny and that's why they decided to make the sequels into comedies. That also explains why Evil Dead 2 feels more like a remake then anything else. I know it's just speculation, I have absolutely not basis of proof but it's an interesting thought nonetheless. You don't have to think so, I think it's an interesting thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A rather well-made low budget horror film.,"The Evil Dead is the 1981 directorial debut of Sam Raimi, and it's certainly a fine film. The camera techniques are easily this first film's high point, it was just done in such a creative way that still leaves you guessing how it was done. But the weak points are in writing and acting. Bruce Campbell is a great actor, but in this film, he's mediocre at best, and the writing certainly doesn't help that one bit, and he's the best of our five cast members. But despite the detractors, it does invest you into it. As stated earlier, the camera floats around in an inventive manner that is rather impressive for a first timer. Another positive is the tension, which is helped by the music. It has this really good and creeping atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Really check this out, but do note that this is the weakest of the three, although if you aren't too much of a fan of comedy, this one might be your favorite, yet that isn't my opinion and is certainly not the opinion of most. And for all of you, this is legally on YouTube for free, so you all can watch it.",,Anonymous,Horror

Because of this you get a timeless classic horror film that has many techniques throughout that has been copied by other filmmakers to this day.I highly recommend this film for any horror film lovers, not just as a good film but what I consider the foundation of horror movies today.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

No expense is spared in splashing as much fake blood as possible... for a low budget movie. There are some good moves, but the plot is fairly minimal. There are two interesting things introduced. The first is the Book bound with skin. It's a good looking prop. The second is the tree rape scene. That has to be the most memorable scene from this movie.

"Not the ""scare"" so many claim it to be...","While I can see the entertainment value in Evil Dead, I find it laughable that anyone would refer to this movie as ""scary""...especially in comparison to the Exorcist.

For example, the camera shots with the ""demons"" chasing and following through the woods had its potential.  Unfortunately, it was linked with a bad script and even worse acting.  Sam Raimi did well with never actually showing the demon, but spoiled this with his cheesy not-so-special effects of the friends-turned-demons inside the cabin.  It just didn't go over well.I've heard the ""it pokes fun at the genre, all the while taking itself seriously"" argument.  That doesn't fly well with me...at least not when so many try to claim this film is ""scary"".  It simply isn't so.  Had Sam Raimi consistently used the scare-by-imagination route, this film probably would have been a more successful scare.  Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's as if Raimi couldn't decide what he wanted to do; and in the end, made an awful attempt at horror...even campy horror.  Sure there was blood and guts.  But to be successful, one has to actually *believe* that it is blood and guts we're seeing...not ketchup, corn syrup, or colored water.  Oh, and let's not forget the squirting milk that seems to be the chemical make-up of the demons.I understand this was made on a shoestring budget, but that doesn't mean it had to be horrible.  It *is* possible to create a good scare with little money and, like I said, had Raimi continued the assault on our imaginations, the Evil Dead would have been more successful in the fear department.Now, the negative aside, I can see why this movie has become a ""cult classic"".  It *is* indicative of the horror genre of the time period and does have its moments of sheer fun.  By no means would I recommend watching this if you're actually looking for a good scare.  However, for entertainment, a hearty laugh, and some good fun the Evil Dead does deliver. You simply cannot watch this movie without a sense of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great horror movie don't take it too seriously,"Evil Dead was made in 1979 by a bunch of students out of Michigan on a shoestring budget, drive and a lot of guts. They froze, ate crap, got beat up and cut and burned themselves out.The end result, after $350,000 and 3 years of post production was an awesome, gorefest, filled with silliness, great scares and eye-popping scenes.It starts off slowly enough with the teens going up for a weekend of supposed getting' it on and after reading a forbidden book tapped on a tape recorder, well, all hell breaks loose. The lone pretty girl is lured into the woods and raped by malevolent trees (awesome scene!), she comes back and begins to butcher her friends. They begin one by one to turn into monsters and attack the lone survivor who uncovers the only way to defeat the evil in the woods...or did he? Anyway, 10 on 10, hat's off to Raimi and his crew and may this never be remade. It's perfect the way it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good low-budget entertainment,"I've said this before and I'll say it again, I always feel more of a connection to films that are made on low budgets than the big studio flicks, because I'm an aspiring filmmaker myself.  Watching a movie like this inspires me, especially since I've always wanted to make a horror movie. Is it a great film?  Of course not.  Once the movie hits the 20-minute mark, the notion of plot completely disappears.  But I loved the special f/x, which immensely surprised me, knowing the budget was only $375,000.00.  I didn't expect the gore to be so elaborate.  That's right, there's tons of gore (some say that to today's standards, the gore would be considered tame, but I say it's still quite extreme), and it doesn't look cheesy at all. The blood looks real, the make-up effects are great.  I could tell Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert put their hearts and souls into this project.I'm so glad I purchased the DVD, because it (along with ""Evil Dead 2's"") contains one of the most amusing and insightful commentaries I've ever heard.  Sam and Rob both have an incredible sense of humor.  And I was fascinated by the way they described the production of this movie.  First of all, I assumed it was shot in either 2 or 3 days.  This movie proves that continuity is for sissies, because it's packed with continuity errors and I didn't notice a thing.  The film was actually shot over the course of many months.  They seemed to have lots of fun making it, though it was a grueling process, since there were no stunt people (actors were getting scrapes and bruises all over the place), they'd stay awake for hours and hours and it was freezing cold outside.""The Evil Dead"" contains a few scares and the gore effects are often fun to watch (this was before the invention of CGI and I felt impressed knowing that not one effect was genered via computer), but I still wish it could've had more plot.  After all, we're basically watching one character after another get killed and come back alive again, and all that changes within the repetition of this pattern is the way they get killed.  The film needs a little more closure.  But at least Raimi doesn't pretend this is a work of high art.  In the commentary, he actually pokes fun at a lot of the film's peculariaties.  But he experienced much joy in making the film, and watching ""Evil Dead"" allows me to share some of his joy.  This is truly the work of an earnest, committed filmmaker who luckily went on to direct bigger movies like ""Spider-Man"" and ""A Simple Plan.""My score:  6 (out of 10)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible movie!,"Bad acting, plot with no purpose that spins around and around forever, too long. I can believe the high ratings, was everyone watching a different movie?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suspenseful gorefest,"My review was written in February 1983 after a Times Square screening.Filmed in 1980 on Tennessee and Michigan locations as ""Book of the Dead"", ""The Evil Dead"" emerges late in the horror film cycle as the ne plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effects. Neophyte Detroit-based filmmakers Bob Tapert, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell have built a better horror picture, which despite the crudities of its blowup from 16mm and low (under $400,000) budget, should clean up in the fright marketplace. Currently poised for domestic release in unrated (and uncensored) form, question is whether ""The Evil Dead"" can attract a wider audience.Story premise has five youngsters (in their 20s) holed up in a remote cabin where they discover a Book of the Dead. Archaeologist's tape recording reveals it having been found among the Khandarian ruins of a Sumerian civilization. Playing the taped incantations unwittingly summons up dormant demons living in the nearby forest, which possess the youngsters in succession until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left intact to fight for survival.While injecting considerable black humor, writer-director Sam Raimi maintains suspense and a nightmarish mood in between the showy outbursts of special effects gore and graphic violence which are staples of modern horror pictures. Powerful camerawork (simulaing crane and Panaglide shots) suggests the lurking presence of huge-scale demons in the forest, reminiscent of the scary first-person camera of Daniel Haller's ""The Dunwich Horror"".The possessed youngsters are presented in makeup (replete with green pea soup effusions) derived from ""The Exorcist"", while the level of explicit eye-gouging, dismemberment and other mayhem exceeds that of the higher-priced competition. Very effective in the final reel is Bart Pierce's stop-motion animation, integrated with the ongoing makeup effects to present the victims' disintegration when the Book is thrown into the fireplace.Although the 35mm blowup is grainy and color mismatched in spots, film boasts atmospheric lighting, pro crosscutting and excellent pacing. Cast is functional, frequently called upon to venture into a spooky cellar or threatening forest in order to evoke a superior felling audience's warnings. Dynamic sound is overbearing.",,Anonymous,Horror
A look at the series before it turned humorous - and it's the best!,"Stephen King named it the most ferociously original horror film of 1981 and it topped the video rental charts of that year  but then censorship reared its ugly head and Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" was brutally chopped and heavily criticized by the more conservative folk of the times. In the UK it lay at rest for many years, considered ""dangerous"" and unsafe for viewing due to its excessive gore and infamous tree-rape sequence. In the US (where distribution seemed less controversial  see also ""A Clockwork Orange"") it faced a similar but less consequential fate. Nevertheless the cult base grew and today ""Evil Dead""  released on DVD tagged with an NC-17 rating  is hugely popular amongst film and horror buffs. Its star, Bruce Campbell, was as unlikely a hero as cinema had ever had  a fearful, cowardly guy who doesn't have it all together and isn't a big macho, gung-ho leader type. It is hardly surprising then that Campbell would be the only actor to establish a successful career afterwards.Filmed on a $350,000 budget with a cast of no-names, its influential directorial work, excessive violence and infectious attitude would proceed to inspire a legion of upcoming directors  even Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez paid their respects to the film with their cheeseball vampire flick, ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" which is a lot like the ""Evil Dead"" series  both start out as serious, dark films, and later turn into comedic self-satire.""Evil Dead II"" was less a sequel and more a remake  made with a larger budget and what Campbell himself referred to as ""splatstick"" humor, it referenced the Three Stooges whilst still maintaining the gore level of the original. Then ""Army of Darkness""  the most commercial and childish of the trilogy  became almost totally humor, Campbell's character ""Ash"" Williams turned into a chainsaw-wielding one-line-spewing tough guy-comedian, and the grim nature of the original seemed lost in the chaos.Suffice to say no one can criticize the ""Evil Dead"" series for lack of creativity or imagination. Looking at ""Army of Darkness"" it's hard to imagine it even relates to the original at all  ""Evil Dead"" is a serious (to some extent) horror film whereas ""Army of Darkness"" involves time-traveling and the concept of having a chainsaw for a hand. Groovy.The plot is too familiar  a group of lovestruck teens head out to the woods for a bit of alone-time. Once there they stumble upon a mysterious tape recording and the ""Book of the Dead""  once the passages inside are cited aloud, the undead will rise from the earth. So how unfortunate that the tape recording conveniently cites the passages and all hell breaks loose.The plot doesn't make much sense. We're led to believe these demons that lurk in the woods are at rest yet when our heroes arrive at their cabin, strange goings-on occur before the Book of the Dead is even found. There's also something else that makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever, but revealing it might ruin part of the story.Doesn't matter. This isn't a thoughtful horror film. Continuity is not favored either  shots rarely follow each other in a cohesive manner. The greatness of ""Evil Dead"" is not its professionalism  instead, the opposite - that for such a low budget, Sam Raimi was able to construct such a chilling and gruesome horror tale unlike any other (at the time, anyway)  he didn't shy on the comic book-style violence, nor was he willing to sacrifice keeping the audience unsatisfied by slowing down the pace. This is a fast, brutal movie. Bruce Campbell is admittedly more comfortable with himself and the character of Ash in the sequels, but the overall scary nature of the film  its serious horror and lack of over-the-top humor  is more to my personal taste than watching a grown man playing Three Stooges with a couple of skeletons in a graveyard. That's not to discredit the sequels (""Evil Dead II"" is almost as good as this) but if I could only pick one, I'd go for the first  and best  of the bunch. A must-see for film buffs, horror aficionados and anyone who likes a good, creepy, unique film. (It's the only time you'll see someone raped by a tree - honest!)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is why Sam Raimi deserves a star on the Walk of Fame.,"ALRIGHT! This is what started it all! From the moment that Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his friends are attacked by the title characters, you know that you're in for something cool! I loved every scene in this movie. Continuity errors, you say? WHO CARES?! The point of ""The Evil Dead"" is to have the evil spirits tear people apart, and then to have Ash turn his chainsaw on them. Granted, you probably shouldn't let just anyone see this movie (that scene with the roots is particularly inappropriate for little children), but for anyone mature enough, this is THE movie to see. It's probably the only horror flick besides ""The Shining"" that has pre-WWII music for its soundtrack, and I would like to assert that it puts Bruce Campbell on the same level as Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A timeless classic...,"""The Evil Dead"" is one of those movies that are important to the horror genre, and it would be a sacrilege if you enjoy horror movies and isn't familiar with ""The Evil Dead"".And while the effects, for most parts, are primitive and crude then the movie transcends time and will always be an important milestone in horror and a movie that can be watched again and again. If you have grown up with only grandiose CGI effects then you will most likely not see the charm in the effects in Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"".Story-wise then it is one that is easy to follow and one that is interesting from start to end. It is about a group of young people who venture into the woods to stay at an old cabin. Here they find a grim book and unleash an ancient evil by reciting the passages in the book.It is also no secret that this is the movie which made the face of Bruce Campbell a household face, well or at least amongst fans of the horror genre.I have watched ""The Evil Dead"" countless times and will be making frequent visits to it in the future. And yes, this original 1981 version is far better than the 2013 remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Film Student's Dream,"Five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.While I am not going to dispute the greatness of this film, and I would not deny it is a modern horror classic (among the very best of the 1980s), I find that the best way to critique the film is as though I was watching it at the time.At the time, Fangoria wrote that the film ""might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films."" They were right. Watching it as though it had just come out gives you that feeling that these guys (none of whom were known at the time) really brought something new to the table. Stephen King saw it, the horror community saw it, and there it was.And you have to give Raimi and friends credit. This was ultimately a gamble. Sure, they made a test version (""Within the Woods""), but here they laid it on the line and maxed out their credit to see their dream work (not unlike Kevin Smith and ""Clerks"" a decade later). It could have flopped, and they could have spent the rest of their lives waiting tables to pay off their debts. I think they deserve credit for that.But there is another way to see the film, and that is through the lens of thirty-plus years. In retrospect, the film holds up well with critics. Martyn Glanville says it is ""one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values."" True. And yet, I feel like it has lost a bit of something.There will always be an ""Evil Dead"" versus ""Evil Dead 2"" debate, and while the atmosphere of the first is more dark and horrific, the second has a good pace, equal or better effects and a ramped-up sense of humor that has made it the bigger film... and done in such a way where you can watch it without seeing the original, perhaps making the first film obsolete. Throw on the franchise addition of ""Army of Darkness"" and now the 2013 remake, and the brand might have lost its luster (just a tad).What is perhaps most interesting is the cultural impact the film had, even for those who never actually watched it and probably never will. Bruce Campbell launched a successful acting career (and an almost stalkerish legion of fans), Raimi made other great movies and was given the Spider-Man franchise. And then you have the Coen brothers, who got their start on this picture in the editing department. Few directors have had a bigger impact on film over the last few decades than the Coens. And they have this film to thank for that.So, for me, I recognize ""Evil Dead"" as the classic (both ult and otherwise) that it is, despite my preference for the sequel. Where I really see the film's strength is not in its horror, though, but as a homework assignment for film students -- any cinematographer who does not learn a trick or two from Raimi is not even trying.

Impressive but not for me,"A simple enough film with an impressive behind the scenes story. The behind the scenes work with how they funded it, created and filmed it is really impressive especially for the time and how they went about it. I don't get the hype beyond that part of the film, a lot of the film can be boring and not much happening or a rinse and repeat of demon after demon. The horror elements are great with shots and creating an eerie atmosphere, the violence was also quite good. There is one scene which is quite the controversial scene involving a tree which is a little odd. It's goofy and it's acting is okay. It's got good horror in parts with a lot of boring filler and same scenes repeated. Overall the best thing about the film is the story behind it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This self-awareness allows the films to be enjoyed on multiple levels, as both sincere attempts at horror and as tongue-in-cheek parodies. It's a delicate balance that not all horror films can achieve, but when done right, it makes for a truly entertaining viewing experience.Now, returning to The Evil Dead, this was very entertaining. A plethora of blood and impressive prosthetics contributed to the creation of some of the classiest body horror works of that time in history.

This movie is not up to the mark. It makes your mind heavy with the absurd sounds and bad dialogue delivery of the artists. Also there is no emotional sense to it.

Still Works After All These Years,"The Evil Dead (1981)*** (out of 4)Sam Raimi's groundbreaking horror film about a group of friends who go to a cabin in the woods only to have their fun turned to pure horror when they uncover an evil book. THE EVIL DEAD has become one of the most loved and worshiped films of the genre and while my love for it doesn't go that high, there's still no question that it's a rather marvelous achievement considering what the filmmakers had to work with. What impresses me so much about the film is the fact that Raimi could have just delivered another slasher film set in the woods but instead of that he went for something different. That something different turned out to be a way to mix scares with humor and for the most part it works. I think there are some very funny moments here and not all of them are directly in your face. One of my favorites is when they're going over the dangerous bridge, momentarily get stuck and we see Bruce Campbell stick his head out and his reaction is just priceless. Once the horror elements kick in the viewer is in for a bigger treat. Raimi does a very good job at building up a terrific, creepy atmosphere and this here really carries the film. Once the possessions come into play I think the film loses some of its scary impact but that's not to say these scenes aren't effective because they certainly are. All five of the cast members are decent in their roles but there's no question that the real stand out is Campbell. He would certainly go onto much better performances but even at this early stage of his career that comic timing is still here. THE EVIL DEAD is quite a unique little picture and even after all these years there's still a freshness about it.",,Anonymous,Horror

For such a low budget film, the effects really are quite impressive, and if not impressive, at least innovative. The sequels are genius as well, but the first is easily the best.

I wondered how funny will the first two Evil Dead movies be. This one is not really funny. It is a horror classic, with young people going up in the woods, fighting demons resurrected by ancient Sumerian incantations (from an audio tape).For an 1981 movie it's not bad.

The Epitome Of Horror... And Ingenious Film-Making!,"There are good Horror films, there are great Horror films and then there are masterpieces that every Horror fan, no, every film fan MUST see. Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" of 1981 definitely belongs to the latter category. If a survey was held among true Horror fans, this film would certainly be one of the most frequent titles in the top ten. And for good reasons, as this low budget masterpiece is one of the most awe-inspiring, creepiest, scariest and simply amazing Horror films ever produced. The amazing fact aside that Raimi and his crew shot this with an incredibly low budget, ""The Evil Dead"" accomplishes what hardly another film has. This is easily one of the scariest, creepiest, simply terrifying Horror/Gore films ever made. Even though this is one of the films that epitomize the term Horror, however, it is also witty and hilariously funny at times, which is something unique for a film as scary as this one. At the time of its release, the film was heavily bashed by critics for its extreme violence and gore, and censored and banned in several countries. If anything, however, the repulsion of censors and some critics helped the film achieve an instant cult-status. Director Sam Raimi instantly became known as a Horror master, the leading man Bruce Campbell became one of the most celebrated Horror/B-movie cult-actors, and ""The Evil Dead"" has since long been recognized as a milestone of the Horror genre.""The Evil Dead"" takes place in a world of the all-mighty H. P. Lovecraft whose amazing literary work has been the base of many brilliant Horror films. And nothing does the man's genius more justice than a cinematic masterpiece like this film. The film follows a group of friends (two guys and three girls) who want to spend a fun weekend in a remote log cabin in the woods. When they find a tape in the basement of the house, they play it out of curiosity and subsequently awaken evil spirits which possess them one by one...I do not want to give away too much, but I will say this: ""The Evil Dead"" is an absolute must see for everybody even slightly interested in Horror. As mentioned above, this film epitomizes the term ""Horror"" and is extremely creepy and purely terrifying from the beginning to the end, and yet it is also funny - a combination which is, at least to this degree, extremely rare. As opposed to most films, this film's extremely morbid sense of humor does in no way lessen the constant suspense, but goes perfectly in hand with it. The gore is not only extreme, but also extremely well-made. By the time of its release, this was one of the goriest American films ever, today it proudly stands as one of the most celebrated Horror/Gore films ever made. Bruce Campbell is the ONLY choice for the leading character Ash here. Campbell has long become a cult-figure and one of the most popular Horror actors, and while the man is great in every role he plays, he will always be Ash to his fans. The film is impressive in all regards, especially visually (even more so regarding the low budget). The brilliant cinematography contributes a lot to the films incredible scariness, the makeup is incomparably creepy and the gore effects are amazing. The film's sound effects, the voices,... there is simply nothing about this film that is not scary and simply fantastic. The film spawned two sequels so far, which are both very good, but for me this terrifying and ingenious original is still the greatest. Another sequel is planned for 2010. I've personally seen ""The Evil Dead"" countless times and I sure intend to see it countless more times. I could on praising this film forever, but I'll end this comment with a recommendation: If there is a poor soul out there who hasn't seen it so far, do so immediately. ""The Evil Dead"" is an ingenious masterpiece, and no one interested in Horror or film in general can afford to miss it. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unequal - The evil dead,"Sam Raimi's directorial debut, ""The evil dead"" (1981) is a commendable effort by a promising director. In the grand tradition of ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" (1974), Raimi shows in the first half that good direction can be more powerful than any kind of visual terror, something not always understood when making thrillers (see, or rather don't, ""The Amityville horror"" (1979)). We follow a group of friends as they accidentally summon some demons and try to survive their attack.This premise, to which isn't done justice by my blunt description, is excellently brought to life through the well-paced, full of feelings direction by Raimi. With his camera, he managed to create a sense of constant horror, this feeling of continuous chase by the demons so intensely felt by the heroes themselves. The haunting music by Joe Loduca helped the most. While we do see some gore, most of the horror comes from the sense of danger prevalent in the atmosphere, as created by Raimi's directorial skills.Unfortunately, in the second half, the director has a change of mind and suddenly decided to fill his movie with all the gore imaginable, scenes that, if grouped together, could be - and this could be no exaggeration - be named, ""The decay and utter destruction of the human body"". The human body reduced but to a pile of entrails that are there for us to see and want to vomit ours.""Vomit"" is the perfect verb that could describe what Raimi wanted us to do in the second half of this movie. As if having lost faith in his direction and thinking it didn't make the film scary enough, the director decided that bloody spectacle is the recipe for a good horror movie, and put in his one everything imaginable, emphasized and reinforced by his direction. To me, this changes the whole movie. The feelings that are now caused are not those of fear and terror, but of disgust and repulsion. The movie becomes hard to see not because it is horrifying, but because it is disgusting, so stinking with bodily fluid and entrails that it pushes you away. It also becomes kitsch, in the sense of the hyperbolic.In most horror movies, we don't really see the horror, but the reactions of the protagonists, which, if directed well, are terrifying by themselves. Raimi may have thought that this is a sign of cowardice on the part of most directors. But it is, to my mind, a way worse move to show this horror, because this way one only turns to easily-produced feelings of disgust to make their film memorable. Maybe I'm the one whose sensibilities are offended, but I don't think so. I just think that ""The evil dead"" prefers to show us how repulsive it can be rather than how frightening,even though it happens to be so that through disgust,we become desensitised to horror. It simply leaves our mind.I believe that good thrillers, be they the ones who haunt us (""Don't look now"", ""The shining""), or the ones who frighten us (""The Texas chainsaw massacre"", ""Driller killer""), are the result of good direction. Visual spectacle matters next to nothing (Cinematography is another thing). Too bad that ""The evil dead"" preferred to use this method at the end. Because it was, indeed, something.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore-fest horror spectacular and archetypal Video Nasty.,"The horror genre has always benefited from low-budget movies: in 1968 George A. Romero independently produced the seminal zombie flick ""Night of the Living Dead"" and in doing so invented the zombie apocalypse genre as well as marrying incisive sociological commentary to evisceration; and in 1978 John Carpenter reworked some of the tropes found in ""Black Christmas"" (1974) and effectively suburbanized horror in the consummate slasher movie ""Halloween"" (1978). Both were low-budget efforts done out of love and both immediately and irrevocably changed the way we think about horror. In a similar way, Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", although not quite in the same league as the aforementioned films, nevertheless was born in similar low-budget circumstances and was able to transcend these financial limits with sheer creativity and craft. And in doing so, created such a furore upon its release and spawning such a robust legacy that it can rightly said to be considered a classic.However, having given such high praise, it remains to be said that the movie cuts an unusual figure among other ""classic"" horror movies (low-budget or otherwise) in being possessed of a definite self-awareness in its employment of horror clichés that have led some to consider the film a parody and not to be taken seriously - a kind of horror version of ""This is Spinal Tap"". Chief among these is, well, the whole plot: a group of young people head out to a remote cabin where they find an ancient book which they shouldn't read from but do and allow demons to come into this reality and wreck havoc. This kind of plot barely cut it back in the day, let alone these days (even though it was remade, quite well in my opinion, in 2013). And yet, despite an undeniable campy quality (with patchy-at-best acting augmenting the thinnest of plots), when it unleashes itself it can create a lurking sense of claustrophobic dread more penetrating than ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974), demons which pose a genuine threat in their sheer malevolence, gore that would make Lucio Fulci blush, and a very real sense of hopelessness.So, even though the film has its camp flourishes (like the ridiculous and equally horrifying ""Tree Rape"" scene) and knowing nods and what-not, it seems that the distanced self-awareness that ""The Evil dead"" demonstrates is the very thing that allows the film to venture into the realms of excess with its gore and nihilism that allow it to ultimately stand above the tropes and genre conventions it employs. As such, being so bleak and such a gore high watermark, it's no surprise that the movie wound up on the list of official Video Nasties drawn up in the 80s; a list designed to remove from circulation movies which were considered morally corrupting. To be honest, a lot of the movies on the list haven't aged well and one wonders what all the fuss is about, but with ""The Evil Dead"", while morally corrupting may be pushing it (especially given the depths of recent movies ""The Human Centipede"" (2009) and ""A Serbian Film"" (2011), it still retains its ability to creep you out, make you squirm, and damn well entertain you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What gives with the negativity??,"I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).I think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror films ever made.,"The 1980s was the best decade for horror films. There was AN American WEREWOLF IN London, CHILD'S PLAY, POLTERGEIST, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and lastly there was THE EVIL DEAD. What made these horror movies so great was that they were very creative pictures that were cleverly directed and had generally impressive writing. Out of the five films mentioned above, THE EVIL DEAD is easily the most shocking and disturbing. We see a woman get raped by tress, hacked up limbs, and gore galore. Still, for those people with strong stomaches, THE EVIL DEAD is considered a classic and rightfully so. It contains all the key elements a well made horror flick should: a believable performance from the lead actor (Bruce Campbell), effective music, fantastic camera work, genuine suspense, and excellent (albeit dated) special effects. On the minor downside, the aforementioned tree rape scene goes a bit too far. Sam Raimi has said himself in interviews that he regrets the way he shot the scene and if he could go back and change it, he would. Too bad he didn't think about changing the scene earlier otherwise THE EVIL DEAD would be the perfect horror motion picture. As it is, I give it 9/10. Highly recommended for all horror fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
Classic/dated gorefest.,"I have never watched The Evil Dead. I know I know. I've just never got round to it until now. How does it look then to some fresh eyes in 2023? Well it's grimy, the sort of reassuring lo-fi grime though that lets you know that one you're in a horror film and two that it's made with love. That might seem like an odd thing to say about a film like this. Five college kids are headed up to a remote cabin in the woods. You know the scene, it's been parodied a million times. Off the beaten track, no contact with civilisation, fresh faced Americans (it's always America isn't it). They're canon fodder. It's all a bit eerie, but the supernatural kind. You see the cabin is an old hideout for a long departed bloke studying ancient burial grounds, where it's thought possible that demons lay dormant, waiting to possess the living. This the group find out by listening to an old reel to reel tape handily discovered in the basement. It's blunt exposition but it works. Much like the wooden acting. The camera work though is fun and the set and props work well. So despite its dated feel, there's plenty to enjoy. Plus at a thrifty 90 minutes it's lean and pacy. The best thing though is the score. A mix of subtle electronics, creepy orchestration and some visceral foley. I can't really say too much else without spoiling it because to be honest, there's really not much to it. If you like some retro (fake low budget plastic) gore and plenty of jump scares... that do get less scary as we go on. Then The Evil Dead has you covered. I can see why in 1981 it would've had an impact and I can also see why it's considered a classic, but if I'm being harsh, it doesn't really stand up. It's a good gorefest that's not at demanding of its audience, but it's very much of its time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is how you make a movie on a shoestring,"The Evil Dead will always remain a great example of what kind of cinema can be made on a minuscule budget. Its a testament to what can be achieved if the filmmakers have imagination and ingenuity. It was infamous initially as one of the most prominent members of the video nasties in the UK. This was probably in part due to the fact that it was the most popular videotape of the year back in 1981. Like many films from that famous list, its really quite difficult now understanding why it was deemed so dangerous. Undoubtedly, this is a very violent film and that is certainly the main source of its notoriety. But its just so fantastical and non-realistic that it makes you wonder if the moral guardians of the day had the slightest sense of humour. Yes, this is a splatter movie but its also a pretty kinetic piece of cinema. The Evil Dead is certainly one of the best examples of imaginative filmmaking on an ultra-low budget.The Dead films are one of the best trilogies out there. The chief reason for this is that they change a little each time in a successful way that keeps the formula fresh. This first instalment is an out-and-out horror film, part two is a comedy-horror par excellence and the third adds a fantasy dimension to proceedings. All achieve what they set out to do. For me, the second film is where the series peaks, as it is the best combination of its two major strengths - the horror and the humour. Star Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi were the twin strengths of the second and third instalments. But the original film is really unquestionably Raimi's film. Campbell hadn't perfected his knockabout comedy persona here, so its the visual invention of Raimi that the film derives its main strength from. There is a great eye for detail here such as the ominous thump of the swing seat on arrival, the malevolent POV camera-work of the unseen demon in the woods and the scary demonic girl in the cellar. Fair enough, some of the special effects towards the end are a little ropey now but what can really be expected for a film made on such a shoestring? All in all, this remains a very remarkable little movie that deserves its cult reputation. When you consider that everyone involved in making it was in their early twenties it makes it even more impressive bearing in mind how original and non-derivative it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gross but Good!,"I heard about the infamy of the Evil Dead which is what drew me to it initially, however I was hesitant to watch it as although I am a fan of the horror genre I'm not a fan of overly gory films.I think the Evil Dead balances out being somewhat silly yet scary at the same time and although very gory it wasn't unbearable to watch most likely due to the fact of the era of which it was filmed.The camera shots add to the suspense and there are quite a few creepy moments throughout the film which I didn't expect to be scared by.Although Evil Dead 2 is regarded as more of a cult classic I definitely rate this one more and recommend it to fans of horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Evil Dead - terrible, and that's why it's great","Evil Dead is a terrible, terrible movie. No one can possibly argue against that. That having been said, it's the best and most entertaining terrible movie I've seen. Evil Dead was filmed by Sam Raimi on a budget of $350,000 and it shows. Everything about this movie is terrible - except for the end result. The acting sucks, the special effects are laughable, the dialogue is the most stiff and unrealistic I have ever heard. At one point, one character turns around and is suddenly dead and possessed, with gray rotting skin and white eyes. She floats up into the air, explains to the others that they are all going to die, flies across the room and into the fall, and then falls down. The reaction of the others? Nothing. Eventually one asks ""do you think she's alright?"" That's just a sample. The makers of Evil Dead wanted to make the most gruesome and scary horror movie ever, and tried to push the envelope as far as they could. But their serious treatment is what makes it so funny. Everyone in this movie appears to very committed and serious about the movie, and the result is laughable. The actors seem to have no idea how bad they are, or how simply ridiculous the entire movie is. Had they known, it wouldn't have the same effect. Naturally, critics panned this movie across the board, but it found its audience in younger people who could find entertainment in bad movies. Eventually it developed such a following that it is now a trilogy, including Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, all staring B-movie kind Bruce Campbell. Sam Raimi went on to direct Spider-Man 2, which had a special effects budget that soared into the millions. So they all lived happily ever after except for everyone else who was involved in the movie.Final VerdictThe best terrible movie I've ever seen. The acting can be summed up in two words: cue cards. The movie leaves many questions unanswered, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and provides plenty of laughs. An altogether enjoyable, but at the same time painful, movie experience.",,Anonymous,Horror
Quite the night.,"Evil Dead started of pretty weak, but continuedly kept upping it's game and in particular it's horror. Showing some of the most disgusting and impressive practical effects of it's time. Like I said, I had a real tough time sitting through the first 20 minutes or so until the first ''event''. Once it gets going though it never really lets up so it's a enjoyable ride to the end. The acting is downright bad and the dialog worse. Good thing is people talk less and less the longer the movie goes. But yeah, the characters feel really flat and boring and a lot of their reactions are just off-putting or simply unrealistic.The directing is something, with the tiny budget it's still impressive what has been pulled off here. And there are some great shots. The music and sound design was a huge standout for me, at times maybe a bit much, but it added to the suspense and otherwise dull scenes. There are a few awkward silences in the movie though, without payoff.Overall this makes me really excited to watch the sequel and remake. Decent horror but you have to sit through subpar acting and dialog.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fun directional debut from Sam Raimi,"The Evil Dead was the film that started Sam Raimi's career and it was an experience. It was a simple Cabin in the Wood story where a group of college students end up fending off the forces of evil. The first half of the film seemed like a typical horror film where a group of college students go to the countryside and have a weekend of fun like it was a slasher film. There was even a character I wanted to be killed in the form of Scott (Richard DeManincor). The characters were generally likeable and there was plenty of mystery and atmosphere. Audiences could route for them.It turns into the splatter fest that audiences know it for and it could satisfy anyone's blood lust. The film was made on a low budget and it does show with some of the effects. But that was a part of the charm of the film as it was made with passion and it had a guerrilla-style to it. This combination of the simple setup, the characters, and the low-budget effects The Evil Dead did remind me a little bit of George A. Romero's zombie classic The Night of the Living Dead.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil Dead,"Right, so we all head off on a weekend trip to stay in a remote cottage. When we arrive, having crossed a distinctly dodgy bridge, we discover a ramshackle shack. Me, well I'm not getting out of the car, much less staying the night in the place. They are braver than me, though, so in they go for a night of Trivial Pursuits... In the basement, they discover a real-to-reel tape recorder with some tape that reveals that the previous occupants had discovered that the whole place was riddled with a Sumerian curse which the dozy pillocks proceed play aloud - I'm definitely back in the car; but by now it's too late and all hell breaks loose. What gets me is the choices they make under pressure - outside is the last place they want to go - without a Gattling gun anyway - but yet, off they go - in the middle of the misty, dark, night - and guess what...! This has suffered from the ravages of time; the effects are just silly now (think Ray Harryhausen with his first year chemistry set and some Fairy liquid) - but it is still quite scary; and that's largely down to Sam Raimi's style of storytelling: he uses close ups, light and sound to create tension and suspense and Bruce Campbell is actually quite decent as the hopelessly out of his depth ""Ash"". Still works well on a big screen - 40 years later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? YOU BET!!,"In the year 1979, a group of friends set out to make the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror. With a shoestring budget of less than $375,000, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell deliver one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.The Evil Dead tells the story of 5 college kids (Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Rich DeManicor, Betsy Baker, and Teresa Tilly) who travel up to an isolated cabin in the woods for the weekend. However, while they're there, they find a strange book entitled Naturon Demonto, (renamed Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in the sequels) which roughly translates to Book of the Dead. They accidentally play a tape recording that recites demonic incantations from the book that eventually makes the demons reawaken and possess them one by one until the lone survivor, Ash (Campbell), has to step up and fight back.This is a great film. Sure the acting isn't great, but this movie features some great practical effects from Tom Sullivan. Yes, it's fake. Yes, it looks fake. However, it's impossible not to appreciate them.It's a VERY gory movie. For pretty much the last half-hour or so, blood is soaking everything. There's even a scene where a character get's it's hand hacked half-way off, so it tears the hand the rest of the way off with it's mouth.This film introduces Ashley J. Williams, better known as Ash. The character of Ash is well-known for being a badass, but don't expect that from him in this one. In this one, Ash is actually kind of wimpy for the most of the movie. It's not really until Evil Dead II that Ash becomes a full-blown badass.So, anyway, this movie is amazing. It's scary, it's entertaining, and it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch with a large group of people. So, in the end, does Raimi succeed in bringing us the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? My answer is definitely yes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The House Is The Star,"While it's not the first film in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise to recommend to a non-seasoned viewer, ""The Evil Dead"" has pride of place for being the first of the films, as well as for being so visceral and intense.Five young people journey to a mountain cabin near the Tennessee border for a weekend getaway, only to accidentally awaken malevolent spirits of the dead by flicking the ""play"" switch on a recorded recitation of ""ancient Sumerian burial rituals and funerary incantations."" One by one, they are done in by the grisly ghouls, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to deal with the supernatural menace – or die trying.Billed as ""The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror,"" ""Evil Dead"" is markedly different from what you expect having seen the first two sequels. There's no ""groovy"" catch-phrase in this one, and the terms ""deadites"" or ""Necronomicon"" aren't mentioned. (The ""Book of the Dead"" here is called ""Naturon Demonto."") Humor is mostly in the eye of the beholder; on the surface this is a ""video nasty"" that lives up to its name with exploding heads and a straight-faced, unforgettable depiction of tree-rape.I'm not on board with the idea of this being a classic. But it is a good horror film, directed by Sam Raimi with real flair and engaging depth-of-field camera-work. After a slow opening 22 minutes, the film kicks into high gear and never lets up all the way to the end.The film proved a bit of a slow-grower. A sluggish box-office performer when released in 1981, it has since become a bigger deal culturally than ""Chariots Of Fire,"" the year's Oscar-winner for best film, as well as other big 1981 hits. Great, no, but it has a kind of greatness about it.""Why are you torturing me like this?"" Ash cries out at one point.""We're going to get you..."" the spirits answer, singing tauntingly.What makes the film work so well as I see it is not the acting, which is frill-free minimalist work to put it kindly, but rather the sense of location. The strange house, more a shack really, is a thing of wonder, with various rooms tricked out with odds and ends that suggest more than we see. There's a bit of a ""Snoopy's doghouse"" effect going on here, as the house interior seems way too spacious and crammed with accouterments to match the exterior we see. There's even an attic visible in some exterior shots which never comes into play in this movie.Why are the kids so insanely willing to stay in the house when things start to go so wrong? The car steering wheel suddenly acts on its own, the bridge they drive on to the house gives way as they pass over it, a pendulum clock stops in mid-swing, a woman's hand becomes possessed as she sketches, and a trap door bangs and flies open by itself. Perhaps it's some moonshine they drank that was lost in the editing, or some pot-smoking which was scripted but never filmed. The end result is you never really care about these dumb characters, who seem more like lab rats than people. Without the same level of humor that buoys ""Evil Dead 2"" so brilliantly, you don't care as much as you should.But that's more a quibble than a fault. The positives outweigh the negatives, especially in terms of the brilliant sound design by Joe Masefield (which adds immeasurably to the spooky mood throughout). They are further enhanced on the DVD thanks to dueling commentaries by Campbell and by Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, who play up their different views of what went wrong and right with what apparently was a grueling production.The end result was worth the struggle. ""Ultimate Experience,"" maybe not, but ""Evil Dead"" is a solid stab at shock horror that will leave you breathless, and quite possibly wanting more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The controversy surrounding the content of the film is understandable, as some scenes are sure to induce physical nausea for those who watch them.

A classic film that has inspired many other horror directors of the genre and gone on to inspire two sequels and a remake. The acting is not the best and in fact is a bit mediocre, though this film did make Bruce Campbell a star and one of Sam Raimi's favorite cast able actors. The pacing is wonderful, the camera work as well, the acting and dialog though can be considered cheesy in some aspects but it is still decent film. One must understand that this film though many consider a B-film was and in fact an extremely terrifying film for first time viewers. Some may consider it cheesy now compared to the effects ridden horror films of the present, but to this viewer, I personally find this to be an enjoyable horrifying film.

"A clever blend of ironic cliché and straightforward, unsettling horror - well deserving its cult infamy","There remains a perpetually unmistakable veneer to the sect of films known as ""cult hits"" - classics to certain select groups of people without being necessarily enjoyed or even known by a mass audience. It would be difficult to find a more fitting example than maverick director Sam Raimi's feature-length debut, The Evil Dead, decades before the Spider-Man films. In fact, apart from a vaguely distinctive style and cheeky humour, the two bookends of Raimi's career to date could hardly be more different on the surface: Spider-Man a mainstream, big budget action blockbuster and The Evil Dead a shoestring budget, schlocky horror comedy, tailored only really to appeal to a select fan base sharing a gruesome sense of humour. But most prevailing between the two, at the risk of delving into sentiment, is the passion and heart Raimi instils into each, regardless of their exterior trappings or financial investment. Despite being an ultimately small and unassuming film, The Evil Dead goes about its business in a remarkably self-assured and efficient fashion, just as fundamentally constructed to entertain as a certain friendly neighbourhood superhero.Given the general association of such horror fare with a sense of ""so bad it's good"", it is easy to forget just how grimly effective Raimi's film is, or how much of a cornerstone for 'do-it- yourself' film-making and macabre special effects. Masking its microscopic budget with chilling use of a single forest location (decades before The Blair Witch Project), Raimi's film opts instead for horror atmosphere turned bludgeoning object, complete with a pounding dirge of an ominous musical score and frantic cinematography, zooming along the forest floor as if precipitating the tension to unbearable levels. Similarly, for all of its deliberately campy excesses, it becomes increasingly undeniable just how genuine a knack Raimi's film demonstrates for full-blown fright, with an overwhelmingly Gothic ambiance and eerily effective mastery of horror conventions, extracting surprising scares from even the most familiar of set-ups. Indeed, rather than trying to fight the inevitable onset of cliché, Raimi instead cheerily incorporates them into his film and simply uses them for his own purposes, a welcome synergy of time worn technique into an ultimately unique concoction.Similarly, Raimi shows an innate awareness of viewer expectations as well as genre conventions, and gleefully takes pleasure in inverting just about everything which doesn't contribute to the continuous sense of creeping horror turned symphonic chillfest. Many sequences which should be terrifying are instead turned morbidly funny, many seemingly innocent sequences are twisted into being frightening, the film's sole romantic part is rendered completely un-romantic, and the fleeting moments of typical horror gratuitous sexual objectification are completely de-eroticized. However, Raimi appears equally determined to work in just about anything possible geared towards making his viewers squirm, and the film delivers in spades on the gruesome violence and disturbing gross-out effects front - no matter how intentionally campy and relatively cheaply they are done, the sheer gut reaction generated by them is the mark of a true genre pro.The film also marks the breakthrough performance of soon to be B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, and his enormously enjoyable work in The Evil Dead demonstrates exactly why his popularity would subsequently rise so vastly. Campbell manages to encapsulate the tone of the movie within his performance alone: on the surface serious and slightly nerdy, but with a thinly veiled quirky and goofy sense of humour on the underbelly, managing to not only amplify the shudders and screams of the rest of the film but bring a very welcome comic charisma to it as well. The rest of the cast appear to be giving almost wilfully bland performances, making their subsequent encounters with the demonic exactly the sort of abrasive difference needed to infuse the picture with a true shock value. As such, while most of the actors may spend most of the picture doing nothing but screaming and howling, they do it with considerable energy and aplomb, as well as a slyly ironic sense of humour making their presence all the more appealing.While likely too ironically cheesy, terrifying or wilfully gross to appeal to a mass demographic, The Evil Dead nonetheless merits its reputation as one of the defining early cinematic meldings of horror and comedy, as well as a foundational text for the school of schlocky, 'do-it-yourself' horror productions. Infamous in its cult success, the film marks a rare exception of living up to its hype, and should prove near essential viewing for any horror enthusiasts who have yet to experience it.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Dead is a classic,"'The Evil Dead' was one of those films that no-one ever got to see as there was little call for it in Video, but now with DVD it is readily available for anyone. And thank god for that! People can have opinions of this film which weren't derived from some friend who probably hadn't seen any of the trilogy, never mind the first. The film may have been banned when it was first released, but it is not the scariest film ever made and apart from Big Boy Bruce the acting is not the greatest. But the tension is excellent and the directing from Sam Raimi is effective as well as impressive, especially when you consider that this was his debut feature film. The possessed characters are brilliant, better than the make up in Romero's Trilogy, and the back drop is used to perfection.It may be another in a long line of horrors in the wood, but it easily stands out as one of the best due to its scares brought out through the high quality cinematography and Sam Raimi himself.

Anyways this is a cult classic horror movie that is most definitely worth checking out for cult horror film fans.

Choosing Bruce Campbell to play the main protagonist Ash Williams was a excellent idea.

It follows a group of twentysomethings, Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Shelly (Sarah York), and his friends Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) as they embark out to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. They stumble upon ""The Book of the Dead,"" which is inked in blood and bound by flesh, and unleashes a number of demons and evil spirits that quickly begin to take over the cabin and the souls inside. It's up to Ash, the cool-guy hero of the group to defeat the spirits and save his friends.The plot is, without a doubt, as standard as standard can get. At the end of the day, we come for the scares and the gore and that's exactly what we'll receive. Buckets and buckets of blood are utilized; one of the best scenes involves Ash puncturing a demon's eyes with both his thumbs, with huge amounts of blood quickly oozing out. Yet even with all this constant, flashy violence and gore, the film never veers off on the course of being sadistically exploitative or depressingly nihilistic. Its gore and violence isn't meant to be taken seriously or offensively. There's an aesthetic and tonal cheeriness to this material that is widely unexpected - especially in the eighties, when it seemed many horror films attempted to be as bleak as they possibly could be.Director Sam Raimi (who would later become known for not only his Evil Dead trilogy, but his Spider-Man films) knows how to employ terrific tactics when he works on horror movies. His presence and involvement with the 1980's horror film Intruder, while one of his more obscure films, definitely replicates a style that he would soon become affiliated with. Here, Raimi always seems to be trying something new, specifically with the camera angles. Consider the POV shot we get of someone (or something) gliding through the forestry near the cabin, even going as far as to colliding through the windows of the cabin. The trick to these scenes is we never know exactly what the POV is of, but we don't need to. We know it's not good, since it zips by at an unusual, lighting speed and makes the characters scream when they come in contact with it.These scenes work because Raimi largely knows when to utilize them and how to have them work accordingly with the cinematography. Shot on a roughly $350,000 budget, much of the atmosphere is presented through a lens concerned more with naturalism than polish. The presentation of the picture feels rawer and purer than many other horror films of the time period. This is yet another horror film that contributes to the thought that smaller budgets make better horror films in general.There isn't a whole lot to The Evil Dead. As a horror film, it features the obligatory faceless characters, little development, and devotion to smaller events that may or may not lead up to a grandiose finale. And yet, it works mainly because it aspires to be a bit more ambitious in the regards to its film techniques and gore usage. It's a delightful blend of black comedy and riveting horror excitement, which is a combination that is depressingly underutilized.Starring: Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, Sarah York, Ellen Sandweiss, and Hal Delrich.

No,"First off, let me say that this type of movie doesn't really tickle me. It is possible, though, that through wit and cleverness win me over. This one failed miserably. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Not only did it fail to provide me with an answer, ""Evil Dead"" made me just laugh outright at its awfulness. For being ultra low budget, it was well made. But apart from the gross-out effects, this movie could have been made by a monkey.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Grueling, Mr. King?  Oh, how clean the thrust.","No matter the cheap effects, much less the college acting, I had to have a deep tissue massage once the final credit of this film had completed its upscreenward journey. If there is one thing I'll give this film, it is that it keeps you in suspense. Sam Raimi's use of sound and angle are merely the infancy of his genius. I dare say the second was even more grueling. Hats off to you Mr. Raimi, we know now what got you that Spiderman bid.In Evil Dead, we also had a glimpse of Bruce Campbell's early acting. He plays the naive oaf with uncanny perfection as Ash, the unsuspecting hero of this film. Of course, in subsequent sequels, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, the character of Ash develops from this same unsuspecting hero and naive oaf to a crazed lunatic in the second film and finds himself a war hardened veteran of deadite war in the third.The ladies of Evil Dead are captivating in spite of the dingy cinematography and 80's acting style, and they look none the worse for the wear what with the cold Tennessee atmosphere and tea saucer contact lenses.They certainly do make that old cabin and Hal Delrich's garage look mighty frightening. Oh, and hey, Ted Raimi's in this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil Dead,"How old was Sam Raimi when he made The Evil Dead? A bit too young. He was 22 when the movie was released and 20 when he started shooting it.This is a low budget independent film. It gained notoriety in Britain as it joined a banned list of video nasties. Spurred on by a bunch of people who do not watch horror films and did not watch this.Five university students from Michigan venture off to an isolated woodland cabin for a weekend break. Ash (Bruce Campbell) his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, friends Scotty and Shelly.They come across the Book of the Dead and then play an old tape recorder. It unleashes the living dead and hell to those in the cabin.After all the mayhem. It is Ash who realises he needs to burn this book as well as hack the limbs of the people he knew.The low budget is plain to see from the opening scenes. It is very much a horror film with little humour.It delivers gore and blood by the bucket load. As well as people standing still as the evil dead go on a rampage.Some of the special effects look crude .However you have to realise these are young filmmakers who were basically amateurs making the movie as a labour of love. Joel Coen was an assistant editor.It is amazing what Raimi has achieved with a low budget. It helped that Stephen King had some nice words to say about the movie.It is likely to have inspired another budding filmmaker called Peter Jackson somewhere in New Zealand to have a go at making low budget horror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A fun and violent movie that isn't as disturbing as many make it out to be,"The Evil Dead is a fun movie. It's strange to say that, but it isn't scary and its violence only adds to its humour.The movie never has any real ""jokes"" in it; it simply has great timing. Everything in the movie is timed so well that it makes it hilarious. The difference between a horrifying death versus a hilarious death can just be a matter of seconds. This gives the movie a very unique flavor. Most black comedies usually get humour from violent/scary things happening and the main characters not reacting to it. However, this movie doesn't quite do that. The main character definitely react to death and violence; however, something always happens (due to timing) to detract from the horror of the scene.One such example is when the main character decapitates someone and the body falls on the character and bleeds into his mouth. Under normal circumstances this would be horrifying (and the main character is definitely scared) but because of the timing and the fact that ""A decapitated body coincidentally landed on the character and is spewing blood directly into his mouth for a long period of time"" makes it hilarious. The movie's gore is a major part of its humour. It's over the top.The movie's premise is actually entertaining enough. By today's standards it is incredibly cliché. Even for it's time, the whole ""Friends going on vacation in the woods"" scenario was a cliché, but not nearly to the degree that it is today. The movie's ""lore""--what little of it is revealed to the audience--is still more well developed than most horror/possession movies. While not a lot is revealed in the movie, you can definitely feel as if there is a bit more to the story that has to be revealed.The acting is good in the campy sense. It is supposed to feel kind of generic/campy. Overall, the cast is most entertaining when either being possessed or when reacting to something in horror...All in all, The Evil Dead is a very entertaining horror comedy. It isn't really scary and it isn't hilarious. It is simply a creative horror film that did very well with its budget restraints. The violence is done mainly to comedic effect.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Why have you disturbed our sleep....awakened us from our ancient slumber?""","It's quite clear that director Sam Raimi had aspirations above making a b-movie with The Evil Dead. A limited budget was one thing, but an independent spirit and drive to produce a film that at first semblance could be considered schlock, but at its heart was truly frightening, was another.The plot of the film is very simple. Five college kids head into the wilderness to a cabin for some r & r, who through no fault of their own, stumble upon an archeologists' tape recording of an ancient Sumerian incantation, which unleashes demonic forces, long since dormant. Dont'cha hate when that happens? Anyway, four of them slowly succumb to demonic possession, except for our protagonist hero Ash. Think multiple Regans from The Exorcist, minus the potty mouths, add a sense of humour and a whole heap of blood and guts, and that pretty much gives you an idea of what ensues.My only problem with the film are the continuity flubs, most notably Scotty's hair, which in one scene could be one length, and in the next scene, wow, magical haircut!The full moon matte cuts that are poorly executed in the right hand corner of the screen early on in the film are another drawback.Overall though, this film remains a blood-stained document of what happens when creativity and drive meet budgetary constraints, all in the name of producing something that would be a step up from any previous film depicting the demonically possessed.Definitely in my top ten of favourite horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The film that started the franchise,"I first got a glimpse of this film back when I was in my early teens and it terrified me! I watched the first 10 minutes and then ran from the room!Fast forward to the second film and I decided to try and watch it again.What a difference a few years make. The dark humor, the pace, the over indulgence of syrup blood and limbs flying about.Whilst the effects haven't aged that well, the film is still highly enjoyable and shows what can be done on a shoe string budget.There is one disturbing scene (even now) that makes me still wince but for those who still haven't seen it, I won't spoil the fun.I've rated it an 8 more on the nostalgia and for it being the first (and only) horror film I wasn't able to sit and watch from start to finish first time round.In todays world of hack n slash, cgi full and ""shock"" value culture, it would probably only garnish a 5/10.But if you love horror films and this one has slipped under your radar, grab some popcorn and enjoy the low budget delights.Groovy baby.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the movie I expected to see...,"The Evil Dead was a movie that I had wanted to see for a long time before I actually saw it.  I read many plot outlines and reviews of the movie and I still couldn't really piece together what I thought the film would be or how good it would be.  There are cult followings to the film so I thought it must be pretty good.  When I finally did see the film I was surprised to find that it did not grasp me the way I thought it would.  There is nothing really scary or funny in this film.  The deadites are kind of weird looking but it's nothing I would scream or laugh at.  Now I know that the first in the Evil Dead Trilogy is not supposed to be a comedy but a horror film but the monsters are very fake looking and there is no creepy music or anything. I actually found myself easily distracted from this movie because of the lack of interest I had in the characters and lack of suspense.  I found the film inconsistent with how one could become possessed by a deadite.  I started wondering if you had to be bitten, touched or just in the same room as one of the deadites.  And if so why did Ash (Bruce Campbell) not suffer the same fate as his friends.  There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie so kids would most definitely be frightened by it.  For people who love blood and gore you might like this movie but it just doesn't have enough good qualities for it to be a top notch horror movie.  So if you were like me and listened to all the buzz about this movie I say don't watch this with really high expectations.  It's not bad but I don't think it's deserving of all of the praise it has received.  =",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Check this Masterpiece!,"In the fall of 1979, Sam Raimi and his merry band headed into the woods of rural Tennessee to make a movie. They emerged with a roller coaster of a film packed with shocks, gore, and wild humor, a film that remains a benchmark for the genre. Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell) and four friends arrive at a backwoods cabin for a vacation, where they find a tape recorder containing incantations from an ancient book of the dead. When they play the tape, evil forces are unleashed, and one by one the friends are possessed. Wouldn't you know it, the only way to kill a ""deadite"" is by total bodily dismemberment, and soon the blood starts to fly. Raimi injects tremendous energy into this simple plot, using the claustrophobic set, disorienting camera angles, and even the graininess of the film stock itself to create an atmosphere of dread, punctuated by a relentless series of jump-out-of-your-seat shocks. The Evil Dead lacks the more highly developed sense of the absurd that distinguish later entries in the series--Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness--but it is still much more than a gore movie. It marks the appearance of one of the most original and visually exciting directors of his generation, and it stands as a monument to the triumph of imagination over budget.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Clichéd, wooden, but still worth watching","What better place to start with my first review than this classic 80's cult horror. I remember in my very early teens, all the hype surrounding this movie and scrambling around a friend's house to watch a grainy VHS copy totally against my parents' wishes, especially after the uproar that it had cause with the notoriously pompous British Censors which only added to the movies' allure.I recently decided to go through my old DVD collection so that I could give a rating to movies I had not seen in a long time and therefore had not rated. My attention was drawn to this movie very early in my task - I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It is a pretty poor movie by today's standards and a complete cliché, but in a way, that's what makes it good! It's like a journey through a carnival house of horrors as an adult. The effects are shocking, you know what's coming yet it still makes you jump! The acting is outdated and almost wooden at times. The effects of the puss squirting from the arm and eyes is almost laughable but still you can't stop watching it. It still manages to create an atmosphere that draws you in and engrosses you so that you do not want to switch it off no matter how bad you tell yourself it is. But it isn't bad at all, it really is quite good. Take yourself back to the 80's and this movie truly was a masterpiece filmed on a budget but drawing the attention some of the so-called blockbusters of the time could only envy.I have seen this movie several times now and each time I come back with the same opinion - that it is definitely worth watching. If you are viewing for the first time, do so with an open mind and put yourself back in the early eighties to give yourself a fair go... you won't be disappointed. I can only give this movie a 7/10 which in my rating system is a movie worth watching and that is exactly what it is what it is nothing more, nothing less, but still a masterpiece of its time which if judged back then would have surely scored a straight 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Swallowed my Soul.,"""The Evil Dead"" series is a very important one for me. I've bought them all on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray, I've bought special editions, imported versions and read books about them. I hadn't actually watched the first one in a few years though, so when it appeared on the BBC this week, in the run up to Halloween, I decided to watch it again.Five College kids, Scott (Hal Delrich) and his girlfriend Shelly (Theresa Tilly); Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker) and Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) head to a remote cabin in Tennessee. After some strange occurrences, they discover a dagger, a book and a tape recorder in the basement. The tape has a translation of ancient runes found in the book, which awaken a malevolent spirit that tortures and possesses each of them. Unable to leave, they try to make it through the night with their sanity, and their lives.It's perhaps a bit lost now, given how far the series has come and now entering it's 41st year, just what an achievement ""The Evil Dead"" is. It's a student film, essentially, made by some friends and family on small budget that is mostly begged, borrowed or donated. It was a notoriously difficult and fractured shoot and, along with reshoots, that normally makes for a disjointed film but, providing you accept the limitations, it's a genuinely unsettling, gory, funny, disgusting and accomplished film. Raimi's touches are all there from the get-go, the dynamic camera movements and the sound effects that come with it. The Oldsmobile. Torturing Bruce Campbell.I'd imagine those limitations might be a bit more pronounced to someone watching it for the first time today, who doesn't have the sort of relationship with the film that I do. The performances aren't great, the visual effects are sometimes brilliant, but often inconsistent, though this might be because of the need to use stand-in performers (Shemps in the films parlance) quite a bit of the time. The actual story is pretty much non-existent though, for me, that makes the films last 45 minutes a thrill ride from start to finish.By my own admittance, I'm not capable for giving this one an unbiased appraisal but for me, it's one of the classic movies of my life.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
See it for Bruce Campbell.,"Its low-budget look gives it a real charm. It progresses along gradually enough, ie the suspense builds realistically and naturally, instead of giving us zombies within the first five minutes, that we believe the zombies when they eventually come - it actually works as a straight horror movie, unlike its sequals.I don't know where Raimi found Bruce Campbell, but he's the real highlight of this movie. He's incredible - he's got this superhero's head. It was a great idea to have a certain guy's face being the figurehead of the series. Especially when he's got a face like this! Those crazy eyes, that jut jaw. Raimi is right - he does look great in a head shot.The first half hour is really exciting, because you can tell everyone is just learning how to make a film. It was shot over a period of seven years, i hear, so the general quality improves throughout, but there are no noticeable jumps in quality - the texture is not incredible uneven. It all hangs together okay.Its a fairly full-on zombie experience, once we get into the thick of it. Its fairly harrowing and foul, so be prepared - weak of stomach should stay away.Certain parts were better than others: I thought the zombie trapped under the trapdoor banging up against it was fantastic, all of Bruce Campbell was fantastic, especially his later scenes. But i didn't like the part near the beginning where a girl wanders into the woods and vines start chasing her and climbing up her crotch.Raimi's lightning-fast steadicam which predates Barry Sonnenfeld's famous ""crazy-cam"" from Raising Arizona by a good decade is pretty freaky, but gets a little gimmicky.7/10.

Woodland Creatures Unite!,"Five college friends take a vacation from school in a abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods. Weird happenings and a phantom force plague the students once they stumble across the Book of the Dead. It seems that the previous tenant of the cabin was a man working on translating the book. His translation opens a doorway unleashing a force that they may not survive from. This film was shot on less than a shoestring. What we are given is an amazing film that builds slow to a wicked ending and a cult status that is second to none. This film was a labor of love by all those who worked on it. It may look `amateurish' but that is part of its' charm. The camerawork is awesome the effects are awesome. The ending is a killer setpiece. I couldn't imagine this film made any better than it was.

Beware of the trees,"This is probably one of the most ridiculously simple movies ever made. 5 actors, a small crew, and a very tight budget. But it is precisely those strenuous limitations that make this such a classic.The story starts of with five friends heading to cabin in the woods for a bit of R&R. Here they find what is called ""The Book of the Dead"" and the terror begins! Many of the shots, and especially the spooky set up, are very clever and provide for a terrific horror film. From hand-held perspective shots to eerily steady tracking shots (a la Kubrick) as the demonic presence stalks the protagonists the movie is non-stop terror and excitement. Also, the amazing gore effects deserve mention and they are so putrid and gross that ultimately makes this film not for all tastes. Especially when a woman is raped by a tree (!!!!!!!!!).

"""Shut! It! Off!""...","THE EVIL DEAD is a true, low-budget labor of love, and a damned good horror film! From the opening scene, the sense of unease begins. Director Sam Raimi's camera skims the cold water like a ghost, letting us know that we're in for a terrifying experience. Everything that follows is a lesson in how to make a fright film.For its age, and lack of big money, this movie shows what a young director can do by using his ingenuity and imagination.

The practical effects range from innovative to ingenious.In Bruce Campbell, Raimi found the perfect... hero? Anti-hero? Non-hero?

He would go on to surpass even this, in the uproarious sequel!

Last house in the woods,"If you look at the budget Sam Raimi had to make this, it is incredible what the end result it. Of course having a good friend with the name of Bruce Campbell always helps.

On the other hand, Sam likes to put Bruce through some ordeals and this movie is not different in that approach.The movie though is straight horror. The sequels became much lighter in tone (especially the third one). It's also one of the movies that hasn't been released completely uncut in Germany! I won't spoil anything, when I say the two key scenes that are missing involve a pencil and a tree!

One of the genre's undisputed classics,"Arriving at a remote cabin in the woods, a group of friends find a strange book in the basement which unleashes a horde of demons which possess the group one-by-one and forces the lone survivor to battle them off to survive the terrifying ordeal.This here is easily one of the all-time best horror films ever made. Among the numerous outstanding qualities on display is the startling amount of high-quality suspense featured here, which makes for a truly chilling and utterly unnerving experience which starts almost from the very beginning. One of the most innovative aspects of this, the demented and bizarre camera angles here flying around the woods at inhuman speeds at truly obscure angles that gives a great idea of the forces at play here, and the continued usage of the tactic all throughout the first half to show the creatures out in the woods chasing after the ones inside or sneaking up to the cabin makes for a stellar, stand-out series of scenes which makes for quite a nice time here by building to quite a dynamic fever-pitch along the way. As well, the later scenes in the woods where the incessant rolling fog coming through the woods enhances matters so that the scenes around the cabin where they begin whispering in demonic voices or of them approaching the destroyed bridge off in the distance are just plain chilling and creepy, effectively making a clichéd situation all the more uneasy here with the lead-in from here to the film's second half where this really picks up. Firmly entrenched with the possession angle and featuring the group coming under the influence one-by-one, this becomes a series of demented, creepy antics here with the possessed popping out of the darkness, crashing through the floors or appearing sane before turning into a glowing-eyed demon throughout this section makes for some utterly chilling, jump-worthy sequences that are surprisingly demented. Aided by the chilling, creepy cackling they do in that eerie sing-a-long voice while tormenting him in their demon make-up, it all creates a remarkably nerve-wracking experience. Still, none of this here is possible without the film's utterly over-the-top and graphic gore gags here, with the requirement that the body must be dismembered to be freed of possession means there's several graphic depictions here id dismantling the corpse, along with the wounds inflicted here to hold them down in the first place which requires all sorts of stabbing, impaling and setting on fire, which doesn't include the vicious antics committed against the friends while being terrorized, the blood-splatter let loose in the basement or the graphic meltdown at the end which ups the ante quite well here. While the effects don't hold up at all and the story's a mess, the positives are far more worthwhile which make this one as enjoyable as it is.Rated NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, Rape from an inhuman source, Language and Brief Nudity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hated it. Highly recommended by cohorts in ketchup.,"I hated The Evil Dead. This movie was recommended for me based on some of the other movies that I have either selected for viewing, or just inquired and read the synopsis about. I was led to believe that there was something special or outstanding about this movie. As it turned out, The Evil Dead is simply a terrible cliché of all gory movies. The only thing special about it seems to be that it was one of the first of it's type and the director, Sam Raimi, was very young (21 ?) when he made it. It has all of the elements of a ""B"" movie (which it is): lousy story with characters that make unbelievably stupid choices, terrible acting, terrible make up and effects, overall terrible production. I couldn't believe The Evil Dead had a 7.5 rating on IMDb, but apparently if you like blood-fest type movies, this one comes highly recommended by your cohorts in ketchup. I don't watch many movies of this type; I will be more careful about selecting movies that are recommended to me by database preference analysis. I may someday watch the sequel, because other viewers stated that the production values and acting are so much better in the sequel. There's no way they could possibly be any worse.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The woods are full of the dead...,"Yes, this movie would go on to spawn two sequels, both of which had a bit more comic tone, however this one is almost pure horror. Albeit, with a couple of humorous scenes. The story, two couples and one sister go into the woods for a nice relaxing retreat. They end up at a cabin which is a bit run down, but not to bad of shape. Strange things happen and then they discover a secret in the basement that unleashes the evil dead! What ensues you ask? General mayhem and lots of gore. In fact this is the first time I have seen the movie in some time, I did not remember how bloody this movie got. This movie features a very young Bruce Campbell and some rather pretty girls and one other guy. They all do rather well, however, the real star is the unique style of the film which was kind of a new way of doing things back then. Basically, the foe or monster coming at a person basically being shown as the camera's point of view. Very effective...what else do you get, lots of body parts being chopped here and there and something else that is rare in horror movies a guy who is the lead and lasts the longest rather than a female. Granted there are still some of the same stuff you see in other horror movies. You will also probably say to the screen ""don't do that!!"". Still this is a very good horror movie and hey the next two movies would be very good as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror films ever,"This is not a movie you need to watch if you have been raised on ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" type horror films. No, this film is for people who grew up watching the films that ""Scream"", ""IKWYDLS"", etc., got their ideas from.It's a low-budget 1980's cult classic because it's full of originality, humor, and genuinely scary, sick moments, it never takes itself seriously and neither should the viewer. It intends to scare you, make you laugh, cringe, and even gag at times, and it succeeds in these areas admirably despite its budget and its numerous flaws. Keep in mind that it was made by college students who, in spite of being amateurs, put their best efforts into it. They did a great job and as a result the film is dear to my heart and to many other people who have seen it time and again over the years.If you can't relax and enjoy a horror film because you're expecting ""Sixth Sense"" type mind games (not knocking ""Sixth Sense"", though, it was excellent), then you are also among the folks who should avoid this one, since there is nothing subtle or thought-provoking about it. It's in your face from the start and isn't the slightest bit ashamed of it, but it's done in a very friendly, tongue-in-cheek way. People should just sit back, relax, make fun of the mistakes and bad acting, and enjoy the scares, which are many. A great party flick.",,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy.,"Looking back, this was the humble beginnings of a horror icon and a beloved franchise. But back in the early 80's, this thing was pretty outrageous. I would have paid money to see people's initial reaction during the first run of The Evil Dead. The story, by itself, is your typical cabin-in-the-woods creeper with a supernatural twist. The curse of the necronomicon. Old H.P. Lovecraft never saw it coming. From there, the film turns into a cross between The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, with the gore cranked all the way off the dial. It's gross, man. But it's all done practically. Scratch that.. it's all done way on the cheap. That's what gives this it's charm. It's so bad it's good. Minus the tree scene, which is just not good at all, but we won't get into that. Shout out to the cinematographer (Tim Philo) for using extreme, fast dolly shots when they were virtually unheard of.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

And me being a fan of Bruce's (Ash) acting especially in this trilogy only makes it even better. I have many times tried to understand just exactly it is that makes this movie so great but it is hard to put a finger on! it's a classic horror movie with a hint of humor as well as all the blood and old time effects that you need! i could go on forever telling you how much i love it but i'm tired..WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY!!!!

The Evil Dead (7/10),"Evil Dead 7/10 If one were to go out and search top ten horror movie list on the internet, you'll without doubt find Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead appear more often than not. The Evil Dead is made cheap, free and easy at the same time introducing some interesting camera tricks to create great suspense. The camera zig zagging throughout the woods at just above ground level chasing its actors still holds up as a great technique. However, there is a bit of absurdity to the nature of this possession when trees rape and lamps talk, all the while taking itself really seriously. There is also an overuse of gore with bodily fluids and blood that didn't match well with the bright colored demon makeup. Many scenes dragged on for too long and some of the actresses really overacted the crazy all-out horror scenes. If it wasn't for the innovative camera work, creepy location and Bruce Campbell, I'm not sure we're talking about this cult classic that still gains popularity to this day.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cult Viewing,"The Evil Dead is probably the first movie to shock, scare, haunt and amuse all at the same time. Sam Raimi captures the terror of the Evil Dead in this first outing for Ash (Bruce Campbell). He and 4 other students are taking a vacation in an old cabin in the woods, they unwittingly resurrect some slumbering demons that one by one take possession of the students.Unlike the title suggests, this is not a zombie movie, it is a horror that is both supernatural and evil, but it's also brilliantly funny without taking away the gruesome and creepy feel of the film.The only bad thing in the movie is the quite obvious low budget that Raimi had to work with. Thankfully most people can see past this flaw and appreciate just how good this movie is.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad as horror movies go.,"This is the first and the worst of the Evil Dead movies. Actually, worst isn't a good term. This movie is pretty good and very similar to Evil Dead 2, but it lacks the humour that made the two sequels so good. This movie is basically a kinda gory suspenseful horror. You don't even need to see this one to enjoy the other two because Evil Dead 2 summarizes this one pretty effectively. By all means, go and see it, but don't expect the humour and camp of the other two, which are much better. What you will see is all the same great camera angles and techniques, which work really well in all three movies. Worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still the best,"I first watched this film years ago, and I still love it. The casting was great, the effects were awesome for the time and budget, and the acting was above average. Above average isn't that good? Well, take into consideration that this was the first major film of most of these actors and actresses careers, and the first major film for Sam Raimi (true legend) and Bruce Campbell (Horror movie God!).This movie is about a group of teens who buy a cabin in the woods and have a party. After snooping around the cellar, they uncover an old reeled-tape player, reeled-tape, a shotgun, some shells, and a torn Hills Have Eyes poster. Ash (Bruce) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) bring the player and tape upstairs so they can listen to it. Upon doing so, they unleash the deadites from the Necronomicon, which was originally ""created"" by H.P. Lovecraft in several of his short stories. The Necronomicon was basically a book bound in human flesh, inked in human blood, that contained nothing but evil spells, art, and the occasional cheese ball line.After a woman gets raped by a gang of violent tree branches, she becomes a zombie possessed by one of these evil creatures. Some of the hardcore Evil Dead fans know the ""deadites"" are Indian spirits bent of revenge. After everyone except Ash falls victim to the spirits, he wages war against these ""monsters"".

Five bags of popcorn,"The LA Times once called The Evil Dead the ""grisliest well-made movie ever,"" which is largely accurate.

This is the most over-rated Stupid movie ever!,"Yes, I know it was done on a low budget. But I still hate it! I think it is a lame excuse to brutally and violently bash women around. I don't remember seeing any male demons or any of the men getting thrown around and having their heads bashed open... no... not at all... for some reason only the women turn into these crazed lunatic demons and in turn are disgustingly and violently beaten to death by the non-possessed male characters. I am not a femme-Nazi, nor am I sensitive to violence and gore... but when it is so obvious that this movie was just an excuse to lash out in such an extremely negative way towards women and try to disguise it as a horror movie... I just had to say something. I've always thought that this movie was over-rated. I've seen a lot better independent films that were made with even lesser budgets than this one... who were able to created a lot better than this trash.

Grisly low-budget fun,"A group of friends vacationing in a remote cabin awaken demon forces that slowly, and disgustingly, take over their bodies until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to messily defend himself. Director Sam Raimi's debut, the film is one of the great gore-fests of the 1980s and is good fun for fans of the frequently over-the-top genre. Considering the film's relatively paltry budget, the special effects are quite good, especially the dead-white eyes sported by most of the cast for much of the second half of the film (supposedly very uncomfortable appliances). There is also some good stop-motion sequences (mostly involving oozy dissolution) towards the end. Raimi buddy/regular Campbell makes a good suffering, terrified hero and the rest of the largely amateur cast (and fake 'Shemps') are fine in undemanding roles (both pre-and post-possession). Raimi establishes his highly kinetic style early on and once the blood starts splashing there is little let up. A fun, shamelessly excessive gore-pic that inspired a lot of substantially worse horror films. Followed by a couple of sequels in the 1980s and, decades later, a tongue-in-cheek horror TV series (Ash vs. The Evil Dead, 2015) that finds the tenacious survivor still struggling to stay alive (and human).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Being creative it's what it is all about,"This movie isn't the best acted movie and it doesn't have the best effects. But with so little money to spend you have to be creative.

It is amazing how an, at first glance, amateuristic film can produce such original and creative camera-work.Just don't pay to much attention to the bad acting. In Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn Bruce Campbell does a better job acting then in this movie. But this movie sets a standard for horror movies who don't take themselves too serious. But it's is scary too. And no: it is not a brilliant film. But for the people who have interest in the genre and for the people who recognize the creativity and the camp in this movie it is well worth watching. I think it is a classic. The audio commentary on the DVD is great too. Campbell tells us while seeing the movie on his own cynical way (even about his own terrible acting) how this movie was made and how they came up with the ideas.

Good try Mr. Raimi,"""The evil dead"" is a movie of absurd horror. Is an imaginative but disgusting and bloody story of our hero in horror movies Ash. In a lonely cabin, in a calm forest there is a curse. A curse that won't stop until possess all that finds in the woods.The story, surpasses some limits, and that thing make the movie not comfortable. For example... i know in the story, the trees have power of anything... but, come on, a woman who is raped by a tree? I think is a little violent and (apologize for the repetition) not comfortable.It is a very creative, but not well presented story. Is a movie for those that want a good fright and to see blood until in the mat.In all ways, Sam Raimi makes an excellent work as director. And this movie are not so good, but is a rare and good experience if you want to pass a fright night with your friends.In spite of everything, this is a great horror masterpiece that it should be appreciated.*sorry me for any spelling error",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Evil Dead is what I love in a Horror film; gory, fun and actually scary...","The passion and skill that went into the film-making here is great, it takes many of the usual tropes and enhances them in its own way (especially with Sam Raimi's fantastic style of direction). The effects are also great but in the way they stay charming and aren't trying to be realistic (using a more Claymation style of effects which I love to see).As a person in a love/hate relationship with Horror it's a film that takes a Hammer Horror type of style and makes something new with it. It's a unique Horror film and one of the stand-outs of the genre.There's a reason why Evil Dead is touted as one of the Classics. It takes a small budget, hard work and makes a passion project that still holds up to this day.

It has a gruesome sense of style.,"The zombie horror film owes a considerable debt to the masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"" from George A. Romero. That was the movie that instigated a brand new kind of horror in cinema. ""The Evil Dead"" took the subgenre to a whole new level. The success to down to Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell. It takes a short time for the film to really warm up but once it has, there is no let up for the viewer. The bloody and gruesome set pieces are fast and furious. A group of friends are holidaying in a cabin, amidst the American countryside. An ancient evil is unleashed upon the holidaymakers as hordes of the undead besiege the cabin and the characters attempt to protect themselves. In spite of the excessive bloodletting, I wouldn't describe this horror film as being particularly frightening. It is still very watchable all the same. The direction is good on the whole. Naturally, the budget was low but it is almost non-existent here. Bruce Campbell is the only person who went on to have any kind of career as an actor. A number of scenes were either trimmed or removed completely before the American Film Censors would allow ""The Evil Dead"" to be released. A influential film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Truly Disturbing,"Of all the words in the english language, disturbing is the best to describe Sam Raimi's cult horror classic.  The setup is simple enough; five friends rent a cabin in the woods and are attacked by evil spirits that inhabit bodies and go on a killing rampage, but it is on this seemingly cliche premise that Raimi builds a horror masterwork.  Evil Dead delivers in every aspect that you would expect of a horror movie and a few that are surprising.  While Evil Dead has mounds upon mounds of gore, billions of ""jump moments"", and other standard horror movie fare, it also builds genuine suspense.  Also the standard horror fare is top-shelf.  The Gore is frightening and not just sickening, the jump moments are perfectly timed and really make you jump.  Furthermore there is a sense of humanity faced with the unspeakable.  As a detatched viewer, you yell at the screen for Ash (Bruce Campbell) to take action, but you realize that faced with that situation you too would be frozen in horror.  Raimi does an excellent job of drawing his audience into the action with heavy doses of point of view shots and close ups that seem to bounce toward and away from the character.  These techniques are used with great success (and ripped off in the recent Blair Witch Project).  While the end may not be as satisfying as one would hope, any ending to this wonderfully horrible ordeal is a happy one.  I would like to end by saying that I am not a fan of the horror movie genre.  I find films like the Elm Street, Friday 13th, and Scream series to be highly stupid, but this movie is genuinely terrifying.  Recommended for those who really want to be scared and have a strong stomach",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil Dead,"A group of young people battle 'The Evil Dead' in this horror classic which spawned many sequels.The film starts with our main characters, five young university students, heading to an isolated cabin for a vacation. As soon as they get there, they notice the porch swing moving on it's own and stopping on it's own rather abruptly (great start to the trip...). Also one of the girls, Cheryl, hears a faint voice telling her to ""join us"" and decides not to tell the others. Despite the weird start to the vacation, the gang continues to try and enjoy the evening by hanging out and making dinner. During dinner is when the real fun starts. The cellar trapdoor flings open on it's own, and when the group decides to investigate the cellar, they find Naturom Demonto also known as the Book of the Dead and a tape recording of incantations which can resurrect a demonic entity.Later that night, Cheryl goes out to investigate strange noises coming from the woods and gets viciously attacked by demonic tree branches. She escapes and makes her way back to the others bruised and battered. They decide to go back to town but find the bridge has been destroyed meaning there is no way out. Once back at the cabin, Cheryl turns into a zombie known as a Deadite and attacks the others. Fearing for their lives, the rest of group will have to stay alive and avoid meeting the fate of Cheryl being possessed by 'The Evil Dead'.The Evil Dead was a masterclass in combing creepy, eerie atmospheric horror with quit e few comedic moments (perhaps unintentional at times). The film should also be commended on being so effective in many areas despite a low budget. The gore, kill scenes, and demonic possession moments were crafted in a very believable way. Nothing looked cheap. The actors were all good for me, and they had built a cool chemistry - very believable as friends. A star was born in Bruce Campbell who led the way as the eventual legendary character, Ash. I also thought Betsy Baker did a great job and had romantic chemistry with Campbell.All in all, 'The Evil Dead' was a great horror film which has punched out some terrific sequels, remakes, and reboots - some managing to surpass the greatness of this one. A must watch for all horror fans.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Join us,"What a pleasure it is to revisit Raimi's classic time and time again and never tire of it. Hard to believe 39 years has passed since The Evil Dead splattered it's way onto our screens and into our existence but this fact only reinforces it's tenure now as a modern 'classic' of horror cinema, even though it was ahead of its time back in 1981. It cost supposedly $50K to make and yet what they achieved with that paltry sum is indeed astonishing.They, for the most part didn't put a foot wrong. From the swirling fog and mist, to Cheryl's leafy assault and pursuit amongst the undergrowth, Linda's hilarious demise, the surreal excursion into the basement and of course the landmark final tracking shot - a movie of this flaming originality and departure only comes along perhaps once a decade. The Evil Dead stood in for the 80's, Blair Witch for the 90's and after that, I can't really think of the next entry ( there has been admittedly kind of a drought for awhile).

The ultimate Cabin in the woods Zombie flick! One of the bests ever brought to the Horror genre!,"The Evil Dead (1981) ReviewDirector - Sam RaimiPlot - The Evil Dead revolves around this group of college students who head to an isolated cabin and find a mysterious book, and accidentally release horrific events to occur by these terrifying demons known as ""Deadites.""My experience - When I was 14 years-old, it was around the Halloween season and I wanted to catch up on some horror movies I've never seen before and it just so happens that I found The Evil Dead free On Demand and the 2 biggest things that caught my eye was that Sam Raimi directed it (The same man behind the Spider-Man Trilogy) and the unexpected NC-17 rating. I was still a teenager, so I pulled off one of those ""I'm going to watch this anyway"" tropes, and my Auntie was the only person inside the house with me anyway, and she pretty much trusted me watching hardcore movies, mainly because she knew I really loved horror movies and cinema in general.From start to finish, The Evil Dead is an exploding experience! This is truly one of my all time favorite Horror movies with great acting, especially by Bruce Campbell, a simplistic, yet grisly story and a STUPID amount of gore. To me, The Evil Dead is one of the goriest movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing in the horror genre and only a few movies are able to match this kind of gore, with Dead Alive/Braindead being one of them and Cannibal Holocaust being another, The Evil Dead has to be one of the most graphically and disturbing horror movies I've ever seen! Aside from the gore and violence, the practical effects are astounding and are easily some of the greatest highlights of the entire film!This film also gives us a great introduction to the character of ""Ashley,"" who is later known as ""Ash"" in future movies and a 2015 TV Series. The dark humor and campiness of this movie also stands out perfectly, and a lot of people love this film for that, including myself, and not long after its release, it was clear to audiences that The Evil Dead would later become a cult phenomenon! Sam Raimi delivers some really clever shots in this film, while others may be out of focus at times, I have to give him credit for the shots he was able to make surprisingly well done! Sam Raimi really shows a lot of love with this film, especially with how he directs his actors and the way the Deadites themselves move around and attack people, it's very well done!The stunts in this movie are another thing I have to give praise to, because I'm pretty sure the 2 hardest things were to get the practical effects right and accomplish good stunts, while trying not to injure any of the actors. The Evil Dead is a movie that I adore, it's for sure one of my all time favorite horror movies and movies in general and it's a film that has stayed influential and revolutionary ever since its initial release. My only minor problem with the film are a few of the out of focus shots, but it doesn't truly hurt the film in any way, like I said, it's just minor.Grade - 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Epitome of Cabin in the Woods Terror,"Sam Raimi has created a cult classic that has stood the test of time, The Evil Dead is a horror classic. The first of the three in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, The Evil Dead is campy, silly, and all around a gruesome thrill ride worthy of its cult status. It's hard to not admire the film, you can clearly tell what Raimi was going for, the limited budget and inexperience definitely shows, but that only adds to the overall charm of the film. A group of unsuspecting 20 something-year-olds unleash an ancient evil and have to fend off the foe for the sake of their souls.As the movie moves along, the tone goes from being creepy to downright chaotic as the demons taunt and torment the remaining survivors. It's hard not to laugh at the silly antics of the possessed, as well as the campy dialogue coming from most characters. But like I said, all of those silly aspects of the film only adds to the overall effect of the film, which couldn't be any more entertaining. The movie may be too campy for most people's taste, this is a movie that must be seen by any true horror fan or anyone who has a taste for extremely low budget films.It isn't until the sequel Evil Dead 2, which was made 6 years later that our hero Ash truly takes form, but this sets the stage for that.

An Incredible Passion Project that Still remains Entertaining...,"The Story behind Evil Dead feels like a Hollywood Fairy Tale, 3 hopeless Detroit kids with no experience but just an immense passion for filmmaking, begging everyone around them for money to make this film, taking several years to shoot because they were always running out of money, and then finally becoming a runaway hit and a Cult Horror Movie. But On Screen Its One Crazy Nightmare. The Creepy Atmosphere, Sound design and incredible camera work set the tone early for this film and you are hooked. With a very charismatic lead in Bruce Campbell, you stay engaged till the end for his fate. The gore is just incredibly gross here and it was a big reason for this film's infamy. And surprisingly among all the carnage, there is some stupid humor too. Obviously there are flaws, the acting isnt that great, the makeup is kinda hilarious but considering they were literally scraping their way through,I'm gonna excuse that.

Is it a comedy?,"With special effects by the makers of the tv series Trapdoor, this is possibly one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. It's farcical, ridiculous and Creepy. Not to mention, generally quite badly put together. Too dark to see anything, too fast to see what's actually happening and too awful to watch. I'm shocked that the actors ever got work again.

The Dead Are Best Evil,"What can be said that hasen't been said already of this movie?  It is the most original, and truly frightening movies I have ever seen.  Having had the luxury of having seen ""The Evil Dead"" in the theater with ED enthusiests and on the small screen, I can say that this film works well in both formats. Made on a shoe-string budget of around $350,000 dollars made by Sam, Bruce and Rob from showing thier short film ""Within the Woods"", the effects are cheesy but are still very well done. The camera angles, lighting, matte composite shots and sound work harmoniously together to create a truly special film which boils down to one man fighting off his recently turned zombie-esque friends in a cabin, all alone in the woods. True, the acting is a little stiff, but keep in mind that Bruce Campbell was only 21 when they shot it in 1979-1980. All of the great props of movie history are in the film such as the 1972 Oldsmobile 88 Supreme, the axe, the out of sequence costuming of artificial blood on the face and clothing, bookcases, mysterious dissappearing floodlights on the cabin roof, and a shovel to name a few.If you'd like a good scare and a little bit of laughter, get this film, turn off the lights, light a fire in the fireplace and settle in.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cheesy, campy, low budget, and yet, so full of heart, originality, and yes, GORE GALORE","Definitely not the best horror ever made. But one of the most important, influential trend-setters for horror films of all time. Definitely something any true horror fan wished they were a part of, despite the horrible living conditions for the filmmakers at the time.It's a lot of quick pans, zooms, low budget look-what-I-can-do-type-special-effects, and yet, it is incredibly groundbreaking and crucial to the horror genre. You can't help but love to hate it, and hate to love it. The dubbing, editing, etc is so amateur, but it works so well because these people not only had talent, but Sam Raimi, who had VISION.NC-17 at the time, rated R for our time. Yes, the 2013 remake is WAY more intense, violent, and gory than this. But this, is STILL violent and worthy of its rating for its age. It's STILL gory, gruesome, and a milestone for horror gore effects. You gotta appreciate its value. And that says a lot for horror films, when so many tried to set the standards. THIS one, not only set the standards, but raised the bar for mainstream AND indie horror alike.If you consider yourself a horror buff, and have not yet seen this, you're a fraud.

sweet little movie,"In Raimi's first movie you can already see his directing qualities. Conceived as a ""This is cheap, but let's see how many people are going to throw up their lunch"" film it features extrodinary camera work and a brilliant actor (Bruce Campbell) and Raimi did well in concentrating on them. Because of the bad script and the lousy co-actors, this appears indeed as a first try and in his second try (Evil Dead II) he adds what is missing in this film: humour. But with a few beers and friends it still is a sweet little movie, but nothing more (I give 6 out of 10).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
When I saw Evil Dead for the first time I asked myself two questions : Should we see this film in the first or second degree?,"And should we take the apparent production mistakes for stylistic effects or beginner's mistakes? These questions are important because depending on the answer given to them, the film changes radically. For my part, not knowing what to think, I adopted a very docile posture : I confirmed my vision to what each scene evoked me. A forced laugh here, I saw a desire to create discomfort. From the monsters that appeared there, I jumped and let myself be overcome by fear.In my mind, Evil Dead always landed on its feet, and even, it was sublimated by an incredible intelligence to film and an exploitation of space like I have rarely seen. Some criticize the film for its actors who sometimes lack credibility. But what if, basically, we have to adapt our gaze as I advocated before. What if, after all, these acting faults were intentional?Let's agree on the problem : I'm talking about the fear reactions that anyone would experience instead of the protagonists, who are often too calm. But deep down, maybe that's the intelligence of the film. The audience is required to experience each situation for themselves and not just through actors who do all the work for them. Sam Raimi pulls on the cord of the placidity of his characters, and we die of fear for the lack of finding an emotion ready to take away. Some will say that I see what I want to see and it's quite possible. But after all, not all of the qualities of a film are necessarily intentional. Sam Raimi leaves his audience with a multitude of possible experiences, and for me, that has been a significant wealth. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very strange break into film for Mr. Raimi,"Every famous moviemaker has a start somewhere. Some have greater beginnings (Steven Spielberg), while others are not truly recognized and are left with a strong cult following (Clive Barker). For Sam Raimi, he has the luxury of both. Not only did his first theatrical film gain popular momentum, but it also has such a large fan base that it spawned two sequels and a remake, not to mention it made the name Bruce Campbell a family name. Sam Raimi is a lucky man, but I was actually surprised to see that his first film was not what so many viewers have praised it to be. For me, it was scraping the surface of entertainment.The Evil Dead (1981) story, written and directed by Sam Raimi himself is about five friends who decide to spend some time in a cabin secluded in the woods. Little do they realize that not only does the cabin contain a deadly secret but the entire area surrounding it is in need of some serious pest control. They should've called the Ghostbusters (1984),...oh right, that company was established three years later. Anyway, this dark secret has the power to unleash deadly spirits that can inhabit any host when read from a mystical book.The thing I found the most troublesome about this movie was the fact that for everything I wanted to give full credit for, ended up only being partial credit. For example, I found the makeup effects noteworthy because it made the victims of the demons look really supernatural. However, what I could not take were the voices of the possessed victims. Either screechy and raspy, or deep and gurgley, I would prefer to hear one kind of demonic voice. At one point, one of the voices sounded like an upset stomach. I'll admit that it did make the possessed victim seem more unnatural but it still was hard on the ears.But for a film with such a low budget, it does get creative with its practical effects. At some parts of the film, it even uses stop motion animation. One of those scenes is the vine-raping scene. Unfortunately, this is a particular part of the film I really wish Raimi did not include. It's one thing if the character gave consent for this kind of thing but watching a rape scene is a tad bit too far on the ""entertainment"" description. I just felt uncomfortable watching it. Why would anyone consider it fun to watch?As for blood goes, audiences will get their fill of grossness. It's not a bloodfest but it is nasty. Just nasty. Bruce Campbell's character can't escape having buckets of blood thrown into his face every ten minutes. But here's where I get frustrated again. What is Raimi's icon? Is it Ash (Bruce Campbell)? Or is it the demon spirits that inhabit his friends? For most horror films, the antagonist is the icon that represents the franchise but in this film, I can't figure it out since the audience will never get to see the demon that inhabits Ash's friends.Lastly, the score produced by composer Joseph LoDuca, (his first theatrical score to be exact) was half hearted too. I know LoDuca can produce good work because he did it for the Xena and Hercules TV show. Did he just not have enough equipment in 1981? The only two times I hear an actual tune is in beginning and ending. This proves he knows how to make themes in music. But besides that, LoDuca relies way too much on the strings to make any kind of music. And majority of the time, I enjoy the strings. The problem is that LoDuca arranged their music to create either scratchy or plucking noises. That doesn't create tension. Besides of the fact that they were only used for mainly transition scenes. The score was barely there to begin with.This was a project I was really looking forward to enjoying but instead for every good part, there was a counter. It's by no means awful but for all the praise that it's been given, I was expecting more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent.,"I finally get why people consider Evil Dead II as one of the best and superior film sequels. For as much as I found this one truly innovative in terms of its stylish direction, some ideas, amazing camerawork and fantastic stop-motion animation, claymation and practical effects in general, it's in grave need of more self-awareness to compensate for its great lacking in substance and justify its unbelievably dumb characters. It's still good fun, though.(6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Don't believe the hype,- could've been brilliant, but isn't.","I love horror films, but finding a good scary horror film is not something that occurs very often. Then I hear about the Evil Dead,- a film for which I haven't seen a bad review so I thought I would pay out some of my hard earned money for a copy on VHS. Were my expectations too high? Maybe. In the opening scenes, the acting is wafer thin, the script not too good either. Then the scene with the cellar was genuinely creepy,- if the rest of the film was left to the imagination like this scene then I think maybe we would have a timeless classic on our hands. Very tense. Some of the special effects are still impressive (even 20 years on), but the make up is just hillarious. It isn't scary, it just seems like a joke. The reactions from the cast when they encounter the ""undead"" is so annoyingly bad,- imagine one of your best friends/your girlfriend has been possessed by an ancient evil spirit, i'm sure you'd look just a little bit concerned/frightened/confused. Not just ""lets kill it"" without an element of ""what the hell is going on?!""Maybe I'm being harsh, as apparently the film was made with a reasonably small budget,(which would perhaps forgive the amazingly non-frightening make up), but how hard is it to look frightened or to look surprised? This film could've been brilliant, but it is two dimensional with a poor script with mediocre acting - and this comes from somebody who loves horror movies. That aside, if you've had a few beers and you are with your mates this film would definitely be a good laugh. The disappointing this about that is it isn't intended to be a comedy. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible film, just not as good as it is made out to be,- don't believe the hype.

Them some evil deads,"Sooooo...this is my first time watching this, even though cheap horror films have always been a particular guilty pleasure of mine. I know that's a sin against the cinematic arts, but I'm here now, and happy to say that there's nothing guilty about these pleasures.This is actually one of very few examples to me of a really cheap and schlocky horror film where I don't only not care about how cheap it looks, but I think it actually makes it vastly better than it would have otherwise been.Roll with me for a bit here: could you ever imagine this film having a bigger budget than it did? Even if you could, in what way would that make it any better? None, as far as I can see anyway.And that's primarily why I loved this so much, because while the script, even at the time probably, was nothing all that amazing, it's just such an honest effort from a bunch of people who started out with nothing and no one who cared about what they were doing other than themselves.It's pretty obvious that about 85% of the budget likely went to the make up and special effects, and while it's a little cheap-looking, it's still so much more interesting to look at than any number of faceless CGI zombies having their guts stomped out or heads chopped off (yes, this is exactly what I'm expecting from Army Of The Dead). And I'm not lying when I say that towards the end, I was starting to feel genuinely sick from all the gore, and that is not a very common occurance for me, so it was definitely doing something right.Even though there can't have been all that much money going into everything else, there's so many visually creative and interesting shots that don't even involve any special effects.The dialogue is hilarious, the sound in general is awesome, and while it wouldn't ever win any awards for acting or writing, I think any idiot can tell you that's obviously not what it's focusing on. One point on the writing though: I really could have done without the tree rape scene. I know everyone's talked about it already, but it really does feel trashy and exploitative, and leaves a bit of a stain on an otherwise brilliant series of scares.And I suppose you do have to question why the demons can't just possess Ash as well instead of watch as he chops up all their hosts, but other than that, this is...well, rubbish, admittedly, but it's good rubbish.

A brilliant genre staple,"Truly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sam Raimi's inspired foray into the genre has rightly gained an enormous cult following and as well of an extended franchise of its own including a superior sequel, a fun follow up, a solid remake and an amazing tv series.

The Wicked Witch was more convincing when SHE melted! And people put this on a pedestal? It is laughable.

"Mostly on point, but fails slightly in one key area","Five friends travel to a cabin in a remote woodland area. Upon arrival, they find a tape recorder in the cellar and out of intrigue they decide to listen to the recording. Unbeknownst to the friends, after listening to the recording, they have unwittingly released some undead demons who begin to pick the friends off one by one...The Evil Dead has a classic horror set-up; there is the isolated setting providing a claustrophobic atmosphere and several suspense-filled moments. I did particularly like the film in its early stages when some supernatural presence captures one of the friends outside the cabin and subjects her to a terrifying ordeal (this was one of the best moments of the film in my opinion). I've always had the assertion (particularly with horror films) that fear of the unknown or what you cannot see is more frightening than what is known or that which you can see. That's what made the first half of the film work so well; it was intriguing, mysterious and pretty creepy and it's a shame really that the 'supernatural presence' outside of the cabin was not used to better effect.The reason I say this is that once the possessions begin to take place and the demons begin to attack the living the film loses some of the suspense it so admirably built up and became a bit silly and cartoonish. Despite the best efforts of the costume and make-up department, the undead do not look particularly scary and for me that took away some of the viewing experience.Although The Evil Dead weakens slightly in the second half, Raimi does still manage to provide many tense scenes and some of those involving the undead are quite good (although many are predictable). The film is short and gets going fairly quickly so is never boring. As I've mentioned, a lot of effort has gone into the costume and make-up with the undead, but I only wish that cinematically it was all a bit more worthwhile - like I say it all looks more silly than scary which is a great shame.Despite some of its flaws, The Evil Dead gets more right than wrong. It's suspensful from start to finish, but loses some of its edge slightly in the second half. What lets the film down is the goofy undead which to me were not particularly scary.In my opinion, this film works better as a suspense thriller, but the problem is that this is not how The Evil Dead sells itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Grab The Shotgun, I've Bagged The Chainsaw - The Demons Are Waking. 1-2-Watch. 1-2-Own.","Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of The Evil Dead; before launching into my critique, here's a breakdown of my ratings:Story - 1.50
Direction - 2.00
Pace - 2.00
Acting - 1.25
Enjoyment - 1.75TOTAL - 8.50 out of 10I was there when Raimi released this glorious gorefest, and I remember the hype. Forty-One years later, the film still deserves a fanfare of trumpets. For all the wanna-be directors and story writers, The Evil Dead is how you do it right.So why not a ten out of ten? Because it isn't perfect. For one, the story is a tad diminutive. Our intrepid homesteaders head out to inspect their new cheap cabin in the woods. While investigating the place, they discover a strange book bound in human flesh and an ominous tape recording. Curiosity killed the cat, and it may do the same to our group as they unwittingly replay an incantation. From this moment on, the demons come out to play, and they play messy. It's a basic plotline, but you don't really care because it's littered with believable characters and several witty lines. All of which keeps the story flowing along at a gallop.But when you add the magnificent and captivating direction of Raimi and his perfect composition of timing, you become immersed in the movie. Not only are you hooked on the line, but you're being reeled in, and you're enjoying the bloody ride. It all comes down to Raimi's ingenious use of...everything. Fast, slow, and crawl tempos, strange and fascinating camera angles, visual and sound effects, and a soundtrack that perfectly interweaves with both the film and your psyche. The Evil Dead is one scary movie - I've watched many, as you can see from my lists and reviews, but only Evil Dead still gets the collies wobbling.The only letdown is the special effects; just a few of them anyway. The make-up FX are superb, the pencil in the ankle still makes me wince, and the tree-sequence is legendary (though, maybe for the wrong reasons). It's the masks and stop-motion that look dated - and did when the film came out in 1981. But I have a solution for the stop motion: Try a wonderful program called SVP (Smooth Video Project). It intersperses the film with extra frames, meaning you can have as many frames a second as you want. I tripled my copy of Evil Dead, and the stop-motion was smoothed-out more and became less noticeable.The cast is okay. They're not stellar performers, but their performances are enjoyable. Even when Bruce Campbell goes over the top with his facial expressions, you're never sure they were intended because they work well in the scenes. And, I have to say, I loved Betsy Baker when she took on the guise of the laughing demon - she drove me nuts but looks kinda sweet when she curls her hair.I loved this film when released on video - I was too young to watch it in the pictures. Even with the 4:3 TV aspect and the cut scenes, The Evil Dead was special. I remember the tape being scarred to hell, and the tracking having trouble taking the lines off the screen - The video had been rented a lot. I was a member of fourteen video rental shops, and I still had to order it - it was on a two-week waiting list. But when I had it in the player, me and my mates watched it three times...it could have been four. And, we rented it again and again. I then bought the tape when it went for sale, it was the first time I'd watched it without a single tracking mark - it was still bloody awesome. Then I bought the DVD and finally saw the complete fullscreen picture, and it became bloodily GROOVY. If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself the biggest favour ever, and get a copy. Rent, buy, or borrow; either way, you need to watch this film.Please feel free to visit my Absolute Horror and Guilty Pleasures lists to see where I ranked The Evil Dead.Take Care & Stay Well.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

50'000 $? How did they do that?(!IF YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE STORY SKIP THIS REVIEW!),"Evil Dead is by far the most frightening horror film I have ever seen and I can't imagine how any film could possibly top it. The budget (50'000 $) is laughable because the film contains so many effects that it is almost unbelievable it was done on such a small budget. The actors and actresses did a decent job (at a salary of 100$ a week) although they weren't experienced at all. Sam Raimi's direction is absolutely outstanding, maybe the best ever seen in an American film.The story is about five students who go to a cabin in the woods. They find a tape with the voice of a professor trying to translate the ""Necronomicon"", the Book of the Dead. By playing the tape the students unleash the evil power that lives within the woods.

Fine Original,"THE EVIL DEAD is a scary horror film. It succeeds as one of the best in the genre because of extreme low budget made to great use in gore, action, and directing. Sam Raimi, director, has even said this is one of his best films. There is not a lot of flaws one would expect for a B movie like ""Evil Dead"". Instead, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. Bruce Campbell is not as heroic as the sequels would show, but he still is great as a defensive fighter against the dead. It shows he is more vulnerable and at the time period, (79-81), nobody knew what to expect from Bruce.Evil Dead is good to watch as the stepping stone to future horror movies. I'm sure Jason, Freddy Kruegger, Halloween, and other horror movie chain directors have used a page from Evil Dead with its mix of comedy and horror. I recommend you seeing Evil Dead II however, out of the Evil Dead trilogy, because it is a pictureque remake of this movie and a lot high-paced. Most importantly, it looks better on screen as the DVD for Evil Dead is still not as clean as one would expect.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scariest, terrifying, stomach-churning cult horror movie!","I call it Tension Raiser No. 1. I saw it on a local video hall in my neighborhood. That time I was a sixth standard student. I must say I got scared out of my pants. Could not go out at night time outside for a long time. Sometimes I was jolted out of my sleep by dreams of the possessed girls of the film choking my throat with their dreadful hands. How would one define a good horror film? A good horror film evokes terrible and relentless tension and unease. Despite knowing that its merely a movie, one gets scared terribly and the terrible hangover lingers for much longer time than one is comfortable with. Evil Dead is one such one of a kind film. The most memorable scene? The fast moving camera chasing the actors, of course. Thanks Sam for giving us such a gem to cherish on. The best horror cult movie ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disturbingly Good...,"Evil Dead is a film not for people with weak stomachs. As it is very gruesome and grisly. But it has a great story,good characters,and a great lead in Bruce Campbell as Ash. Five friends go to a cabin,where they find a recording of a few passages of the Book of the Dead. It resurrects flesh possesing demons,who take over the bodies of Ash's friends. Ash must brutally dispatch them all. The film is very scary. It has some jump out of your seat moments. This isn't your typical Jason/Freddy flick,this is much more gruesome,and can be a bit disturbing at times. But I like it a lot.4/4",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's...well, a Horror Movie","Evil Dead has some off-beat horror.  But Bruce Campbell really doesn't come to the foreground until the back half of the movie.  Much more horror than comedy, and unless you're looking for the Raimi Trademarks in this early film of his, you'd be hard put to distinguish ED from many other ""evil spirits possessing bodies and killing others"" movie of the era (like The Evil).

Iconic horror classic!,"After a somewhat slow beginning. ""The Evil Dead"" quickly turns into a stream of nightmarish moments, and remains one of the most unique, entertaining, and original horror films of all time.While it doesn't have nearly as many iconic moments as its brilliant sequel ""Evil Dead 2"", it's still a superb movie that I urge every horror fan to see immediately if they haven't already. It's the perfect example of an unexpectedly popular cult movie shot on an extremely low budget. It's an independent movie legend, that has spawned tons of fans and imitators, and it still remains an impressive little movie to this day.Despite a small budget, Sam Raimi and his crew work with a lot of great special effects, especially during the film's gruesome finale, that is packed with gore and stop motion. ""The Evil Dead"" certainly has technical flaws and some strange editing decisions throughout, but these flaws help add to its charm. It's not a perfect film, and if it was perfect, then it wouldn't be nearly as good or entertaining, believe it or not,I would also like to mention the film's dark sense of humor. Or, at least I think it has a dark sense of humor. Honestly, I can't tell whether or not the movie is intentionally or unintentionally funny. Some scenes feel so slapsticky and over the top that they must be comedic, and the fact that the film's sequels take these comical scenes to a whole new level feels like proof of this being an intentional horror comedy. The sequels may be funnier, but that doesn't mean that the original doesn't have its laugh out loud moments.Despite dark humor being sprinkled throughout ""The Evil Dead"", it remains mostly serious throughout, and at times is genuinely frightening and intense. It is nowhere near as goofy and funny as its sequels, and has the capability to actually shock and scare me at times, unlike ""Army of Darkness"", a movie that I also love, but still doesn't remotely scare me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Director Sam Raimi was born on October 23rd, 1959","Sam Raimi's first film was a film project right out of college. In the late days of the 1970s, Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell's lives, were heading in different directions. In those waning days leading up to college graduation, their choices for their futures were not great ones. They brainstormed on a film idea and they managed to scrape up just enough money to make a film. They even went so far as going to theaters and drive-ins to understand more of what their target audience wanted. Still, the money was tight and the budget ended up being very low, but these guys had the drive, the desire and the talent to make it work. So, other than a few film shorts they made during their college years, a feature film next was in their sights. It would be a horror film. A film that would make film history.Evil Dead (1981), is a simple film. It was something that was actually pretty popular by this point in film history, with films like, Halloween (1978), Friday, the 13th (1980) and various other horror films of this brand. In this film they decided to add in the demonic possession angle, along with all the horror and gore. The Book of the Dead was an idea that Raimi stumbled upon while in college and they used that idea to drive the rest of the film. It is simple in its design, because it follows the same basic formula that most films of this type do. Five college students go to an abandoned cabin in the woods for a vacation and manage to release demonic spirits hell-bent on destroying them.Bruce Campbell, who wanted to work more in comedy, but agreed with the rest of the crew that they should do a horror film, plays Ash, a character who eventually would become one of the most famous cult classic heroes in film history. The five students stumble across a tape player with a message on it that eventually releases the demonic spirits that inhabit the cabin and the woods. From this point, the film is a gore-fest of survival for the students. One by one they are possessed and meet horrible fates. Sure, to most filmgoers this film would scare them away. It is too gory for the faint of heart, but if you are the type of person who can handle the idea, that it is just a movie and not real, than the film becomes entertainment on an artistic scale. For film-junkies it is an interesting chapter in film history. First off, as we look at the film-makers' careers today, you understand how important Evil Dead (1981), was. You also learn that with hard work, determination and untapped talent exposed, that eventually Hollywood will come beckoning.Even for a low-budget, college film from the early 1980s, the special effects and make-up tricks do work. The film came out at a time when filmmaking was transitioning from stop-motion effects (the Ray Harryhausen effect) to computer generated special effects (the Lucas effect) and Raimi and his crew went the stop-motion route, with surprising results. It works really well in this film. It's effective with its desire to terrify. It's scary and gross, but nothing worse than what we see on today's TV shows like the Walking Dead or CSI. For 1981 it was perfectly placed. We have reaped the benefits from this film, as the careers of the Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell have shown us, here in the 21st century.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Insane horror,"The Evil Dead may lack genuine scares or terror but what it lacks there it makes up for in overall energy as once the carnage begins it just does not stop. Resulting in a tightly paced 90 minute thrill ride of extremely fun yet gross gore that announced debuting writer/director Sam Raimi as one to watch.Bruce Campbell fully embraces his final girl status as Ash, cleverly allowing the film to play with the stereotypes of horror. The constant barrage of carnage that's thrown at him through the course of the film adds a palpable exhaustion to his character as well.Sam Raimi makes an extremely confident debut with really energetic and mobile direction, making the film feel extremely assured in its construction even if it wasn't.

The Evil Dead,"Short and Simple ReviewThe plot is full of clichés but since this is an older movie it may seem original. The story is kind of intriguing but it is still a little weak. The pacing in the movie is very slow in the beginning but picks up towards the end.The acting is overdone. Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, and Sarah York perform on the standard of old horror films. All in all, the acting feels old in a bad way.The gore is the best part. The amount of creative uses of gore is great. From melting scenes to grotesque monsters, this film does a great job at making gore seem fresh and unique.Pros: Great use of gore, suspenseful third act, and a semi intruding storyCons: Outdated acting, slow pacing in the beginning, and a cliché storyOverall Rating: 7.1",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What kind of movie has a shell like this?,"Wow. that movie was so bad it was almost worth it to watch to see how to not make a movie. I strongly suggest just about any other horror movie over it. The acting was terrible, and it was one of the most predictible movies i have ever seen. Nothing is really scary when you know whats going to happen before it does. And the problems havent even begun to start. I am well aware that a movie does not need great special effects to be a quality film, but when the special effects actually take away from the movie its another story. If you do decide to get it, make sure you look at the scenes when it shows the cabin and the moon in the background....i have never in my life seen such a poor editing job.

Brilliant milestone in horror history!,"Here's another movie that definitely has viewers give black or white opinions. You either love it or you hate it. Exceptions not counted, my guess is: if you're not a true horror fan, you'll absolutely despise this brilliant piece of film. It's understandable because if you're not to it, the constant terror, haunting sound effects, scary photography (from the forest creature's point of view), and bathtubs full of blood and other gore that occupy the screen for 75% of the duration will put you off if not sicken you beyond belief. But if you would manage to see beyond that, you'd see the incredible talent of Sam Raimi, the director. The vision, the way of shooting the movie, the choice of sound effects, are examples of a great new master at work.The special effects are low budget, yes, but once again to all the people who complained, THIS WAS A LOW BUDGET FILM! You can't buy a Mercedes with minimum wage. And however ""bad"" the effects may have been, they were still effective and at times pretty scary. Just watch this movie alone in the dark late at night and you'll see.When i first saw this movie i was shocked at the gore displayed in this film, and although less so, still am today. With the exception of certain zombie films, especially the brilliant ""Brain dead"", there has yet to be a horror movie making this attempt to gross you out.Another thing which made me give this milestone of horror a perfect 10 is that there's some dark humor, but just enough to not get in the way of the shocks it's trying hand out.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very Brutal Horror.,"This movie is a very brutal horror movie. Some viewers may find the scenes of extreme violence an ordeal to watch though.

If bone crunching violence & suspenseful horror is not your cup of tea stay clear of this movie. But if you want a good suspenseful thrill ride give this movie a go.Also the make-up on the possessed people is very scary and I think is almost as good as the make-up in ""The Exorcist"".Whilst this movie is not as good as its sequel Evil Dead II, it is still an alright horror movie.

A True Classic!,"Where can you even start? The Evil Dead, directed by Sam Raimi, starring Bruce Campbell, produced by Rob Tapert, with assistance from Josh Becker, and special effects by Bart Pierce, and even co-edited by Joel Coen, as far as horror movies go, The Evil Dead is the best of the best. It was here that Ash, the greatest horror hero in cinema was born. He has had two more adventures (Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness) and I hope he will have at least one more. At the end of the remake Bruce Campbell had a cameo which gives me hope that this might still happen. The remake was decent, but the original is just the best. It's scary, it's funny, and the camera work is out of this world. Sam Raimi was a genius even when he was a teenager and a better director than most directors when they're 40.

The epitome of an underground classic,"I know it goes against the popular mass, but Evil Dead is my favorite of the Dead trilogy. Yes, it is true that the Sam Raimi quirkiness seemed to become more and more apparent as the trilogy rolled along. Each film possesses its own personality, and I found the desperate solitude created in the smoky hills of Evil Dead the most cinematically effective. Evil Dead, to me, had the most in common with later Raimi films like The Gift and A Simple Plan. All three films relied on silence and surprise as its main technique. As opposed to the zany, eye grabbing  circus of his Army of Darkness, Evil Dead II & Darkman.To me, Evil Dead set the stage for a classic. We had young filmmakers, not yet tattered by the spoils of Hollywood, sacrificing everything to make a movie and a career for themselves. There was nothing for an audience to go on except what they're eyes were experiencing right at that very moment. I myself didn't expect to see a film with blood running down the screen. The violence and gore is legendary, only being eclipsed by Peter Jackon's ""Dead Alive."" Evil Dead, unlike most horror films, doesn't seem to exist only to bleed and spill though, but more to act as a window for young Sam's need to make movies. This is my favorite part about a filmmaker. I think that such an attitude produces the best results creatively. Hence, my stance on the dubbing of classic. Some might disagree to the fullest but that's just the way it is in the critical circle. I, however, will never stop recommending this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I know that many intelligent people have praised this film. They are wrong.,"Personally, I found the tension so unbearable that I could hardly stay awake.The more risible something is, the harder it is to parody. Imagine, for example, trying to parody PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.What Raimi is apparently trying to do here is to parody moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flicks. Unfortunately, he has no idea how to accomplish that difficult task, so he just ends up making a *particularly* moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flick.(At least, I *think* he's trying to send up the genre. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he simply lacks the imagination to do anything interesting.)On the other hand, Raimi is also trying to make a truly frightening movie. But the *sine qua non* of horror is that we must *believe*. Blood and guts are beside the point. For the duration of the movie, we must be made to believe that we are watching real people, and that what's happening to them could happen to us. That is the essence of any horror film.However, since Raimi intentionally (again, I *think*) used the sort of typical cardboard characters and ludicrous plot contrivances which show up in these exploitation gorefests, he lost any chance to make a genuinely frightening film either.Maybe I'm getting jaded in me old age, sonny, but I no longer find that films like this work (if you can call it that) even on a sheer grossout level. What's grotesque about red-colored corn syrup and cranberry juice? (Contrast THE EXORCIST, during which many viewers get physically ill at the sight of pea soup--because William Friedkin makes them *believe* that it is something else.)Even the widely-praised camera work is merely a sad cry for attention. It adds nothing to the film, while failing to mask the utter lack of anything worthwhile actually happening on the screen.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Low budget is just a minor casualty, it doesn't matter how much cash you have. It's like that old ""wood shop"" motto ""QUALITY IS BETTER THAN QUANTITY"" and this movie lives up to that.  Now I'm not saying that every low budget flick has a good plot, nor am I saying that every high budget flick has a bad plot, all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter.  This movie captures the essence of a good horror movie.  Raimi, Campbell and the rest of the production staff made this film a masterpiece of the modern screen.

Prioritises Scares over Character which mostly pays off,"A film that severely challenged the filmmakers of the next generation to create horror and gorefests that could even hold a candle to what this film threw at audiences.First and foremost, credit must be given to the people behind the makeup and special effects for this film because they well and truly made this film and gave it the reputation it has.Unfortunately, the lack of characterisation and dialogue the lead characters have in the beginning does undermine the stakes which results in you maybe being unsettled by what takes place but not intensely terrified as you don't necessarily care tooich what happens to them. That being said, Bruce Campbell, in particular, gives an authentically traumatised performance as Ash which when you combine that with the increasingly creative scares it has to offer, it culminates into an enjoyable horror that does get under your skin at times with some laughs also not being in the minority for much of the runtime.A film that will slither effortlessly into your watchlist for Halloween.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I can also see the things Evil Dead took from other movies etc. Psycho and it is used in a cool way. Visual effects were bad in scene or two but they stood the test of time for me and were so realistic and raw. Make up is also well done. Bruce Campbell carried the movie and was the highlight of the film. The score is also perfect and haunting. I felt unsettling most of the times and on the edge for the most part.

Who says you can't laugh at a movie that's still scary?,"You might never suspect a relationship between horror and comedy — which means you've never seen a Sam Raimi horror film. Although some of us have drawn a line in the sand between the two genres, those who haven't will appreciate if not love ""The Evil Dead."" Raimi recognizes that horror is kind of an absurd genre in itself and that our capacity to fear and to laugh exist on the same spectrum. If you let yourself experience both on the wacky 85- minute ride that is ""Evil Dead,"" you're bound to appreciate the way he plays with both.Undoubtedly inspired by ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the film centers on five young adults who decide to stay at a cabin (arguably a shack) for a weekend in the middle of nowhere Tennessee. After experiencing some strange activity they come upon a book and a recording of a man reading incantations from it. These incantations awaken flesh-possessing spirits that live in the woods.Rather than an ""us against them"" horror film where a group of people have to avoid getting picked off one by one at the hands of something(s), the film takes more of the zombie angle with characters ""turning"" into evil undead creatures. The cast is also small, so the events are character-focuses and more intense. Bruce Campbell leads the way as Ash. There's no real way to describe Ash, except he's more of a softie for a leading character.Part of the great/annoying part about ""Evil Dead"" is how the main characters never act like you want them to. You want to scream at them to hurry up and grab something that can be used as a weapon and pound the crap out of the possessed undead people. Because the characters are a bit hollow and we've been exposed to films like this before, we have no sympathy when a good character turns. They need to die and die fast, but the characters remain hesitant because technically these possessed gnarly creatures are their friends. Consequently, Ash is a dumb sucker that probably deserves to die with everyone else in the cabin.That said, there's an odd pleasure in that kind of psychological toying with our minds. Raimi executes horror with strong build up and off-the-wall payoff. We writhe until the last second and then the zombie guts hit the fan time and time again. And he never completely lets go of the leash; everything goes back down to an eerie calm and builds back up again until the climactic scene. Although for all intents and purpose ""Evil Dead"" is a camp-fest, that technique suggests Raimi's interest lies in keeping us spooked.All things considered, any film that can depict a woman being ""raped by the woods"" (yes, the collective entity of ""the woods"") that still manages to leave a good lasting impression deserves its cult-classic status.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Wacky, But I still nonetheless love it","What can I say, this movie is awesome!Slow start but whens things get going, your day is made better.Absolutely adore the effects they made for the amount of money they had for the effects.One opinion I have that people might not agree wih is that I think this movie (The Evil Dead) is better than the second movie (Evil Dead II).This is because this movie was made with love and it was obvious. But with the second they had more money and instead of making it an improved horror movie, they just spent their time trying to add comedy that didnt add much to he movie, if not made it worse.Love this movie, always will.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Averages out as an effective horror-comedy,"An American horror; A story about five students staying in a remote cabin in Tennessee who unwittingly unleash evil spirits on the world after finding an ancient magical book. This familiar cabin-in-the-woods story is a mix of suspense, camp, black comedy and over-the-top gore by design, short on characterisation and plot but strong on atmospheric horror. There doesn't appear to be motive or reasoning to the demonic forces but the tongue-in-cheek tone carries the film amidst some crude and disproportionate violence against the female characters. There is inventiveness with camera angles and the staging and setting is imaginative. While the production is modest, filmed as it was on a 16mm film guage, this suited the grubby, low-budget intensity fabulously. The sound design is excellent and helped sustain the atmosphere.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Makes me smile just thinking about it,"What a film!!!
Gory, scary and very funny...what else do you need?I'm actually surprised the rating for this movie isn't higher.Bruce Campbell is pretty good as Ash, he really takes the role to the next level in Evil Dead 2.Lots of blood, tension and classic moments of terror.You can tell it was a passion project, simply dazzling!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Low Budget Classic,"While not possessing the humorous qualities that made Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness nerd culture classics, The Evil Dead is a great low budget, independent horror film from a small group of friends looking to make it in the harsh world of cinema. Filmed for dirt cheap, The Evil Dead had to come up with ways in which to take shortcuts that would make it look good and be scary without looking silly. Thus was the first person perspective Sam Raimi is known for invented. Claymation, cheesy blood hoses, and milk vomit add to the enjoyable inventiveness of this movie.There's not much to say. The actors are all subpar, even Bruce Campbell is still gonna need a few years to iron himself out into a B-movie god. The story is weak and the script isn't particularly memorable, it'd only be with the next iterations we'd see the memorable parts. I feel that if this weren't attached to two other much better movies it'd have been lost, but despite that it's still an enjoyable cinematic treat and one of the most respectable horror films of the eighties.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Holy Grail Of Splatter Horror!,"""The Evil Dead"" is a 1981 horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss. There's probably no movie more controversial and simultaneously beloved than Sam Raimi's directorial debut. In Germany it was banned and highly cut for more than three decades and only hardcore fans had the chance to own it. It literally was unavailable as an uncut version until 2017 and now it's even rated 16. Last year I had the chance to finally experience what's claimed to be the holy grail of horror and I was tremendously impressed. This year, it did not change a bit. Unlike most people from my generation, I absolutely love this film for what it is. From start to finish it offers a gripping and sinister atmosphere that always sends shivers down my spine. Every single frame of this brims over with pure horror and it's incomparably iconic. While there's not much dialogue and the characters make some questionable decisions, it's scores with the pictures that speak for themselves. The best of it all are the absolutely gross and bloody special and make-up effects that haven't aged that well, but still manage to terrorise the audience with their excessive vehemence. Furthermore, every single character is worked out so well and sympathic, especially Campbell's Ashley Williams, the hesitant protagonist and hero against his own will. He really carries most of the film with his genuine coolness and well-paced character development. A hero the scared viewer can easily identify with. Next to this, the plot offers a lot of terrifying ideas and plays them out extremely well. Considering that this is a low budget production it made every single penny worth it. All in all, Sam Raimi created a timeless and horrifying splatter masterpiece that lives from its gorgeous effects and iconic scenes. Although it was a college student film it managed to become an infamous cult classic that will always scare the hell out of teenager generations to come. It might not have aged perfectly, but that's what makes it so special and remarkable. It breathes the essence of 80s horror. Also, it's absolutely inspiring for young filmmakers and shows them that you can achieve so much with so little. An all-time favourite that will never get boring. I love it!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Feelin' It,"I guess this movie is some sort of horror classic. That doesn't mean I have to like it. Maybe it's because I'm wearing 21st century lenses. If so, I can't take them off. But it's not that alone. Sure, it was low budget and they did what they could special effects-wise, but that doesn't explain 70's and 80's horror movie stupidity. I wouldn't care what the decade was, people don't go into the woods investigating noises. People don't stay quiet about strange phenomena that occur to them, and many other scary movie tropes that just annoy me. I just wasn't feeling this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horrors ever made!,"The Evil Dead (1981) follows a group of college students who visit a cabin in the woods, and end up provoking a demonic force in the forest around them. This was a campy and fun film and it's easy to see how it's become so instantly recognisable and iconic. It's truly one of the best horror films ever made! Sam Raimi proves himself to be an excellent director and Bruce Campbell is charismatic and iconic.The cinematography feels so unique, and Sam Raimi has his own signature style. The POV and tracking shots were so well done, and the handheld camera used made it feel so much more gritty and grounded! The movie is very visually dark, but the lighting was good and I could see everything! Also, I loved when the actors looked directly into the camera; it added to the unease.The visual effects were amazing, and the film was so gruesome! The fake blood looked so good and realistic, and the demons were very creepy looking! They send shivers down my spine! The last 15 minutes of this movie are art! The effects are unsettling and gross, I can't get enough. Also, the isolated setting for the movie was incredibly immersive and the fog used added to the atmosphere.Next, the characters were fun and I liked them all! Bruce Campbell is iconic and his character is one of the best in horror, I love how ash starts off very timid and becomes an absolute badass! Ash Williams is a genuine, loveable character and Bruce makes the role his own. The dialogue is compelling too, which certainly helps!The score was wacky which I completely loved, and I found it really fit the film itself well. The score didn't take itself too seriously, but could get genuinely creepy when it needed to! Also, the sound design was just as effective, the whistling of the wind really got me!Lastly, the film was fairly fast paced, and there was never a dull moment! The run time felt way shorter than it was, but time flies when you're having fun! The movie ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger, leaving anyone excited to watch the sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great Splatter/Fun/Horror-Movie...!,"Evil Dead is for me one of the best Splatter/Horror films ever. The story is simple: A bunch of young, ordinary and healthy ""Kids"" make their holidays in a small cabin deep in the woods. After a short time they find an old book, a tape recorder and a knife or something like that. They decide to hear what is on the tape but unfortunately they call the ghosts of the wood. The only way to stop this demon force is to cut the bodies into small pieces.The main character is Ash, which is played by the young Bruce Campbell. He did a very nice job, but the rest of the cast is good too. Sometimes they overact a little bit, but that's okay.The special Make Up Designer did a great job. I have never seen such great gore effects like some of that which were shown here. And, I mean this Film is some years old.So, if you like good Splatter-Films, with a nice bit of humour, this one is the right one.!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Undisputed Horror Classic,"Five chums vacate to an old abandoned cottage, only to wind up inadvertently summoning some nasty demon spirits who have a tendency to possess the lads. Mind-blowing special effects and stunning cinematography highlight this cult classic, especially considering its meager $50k budget.  Writer/director Sam Raimi really shows off his talent here, effectively combining gut-wrenching terror with stomach-churning gore to create a certain feeling of uneasiness in the viewer.  And even though the actors tend to overdo it a bit (a quality which actually adds to the creepiness of the demons, but detracts from the movie as a whole) and some sequences are just a bit drawn out, anyone who appreciates a good scare will no doubt dig this film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi's classic horror film is still worth checking out.,"""We're gonna get you. We're gonna get you.""The Evil Dead is ultra low-budget, ultra gory, and ultra entertaining. I recently saw the Night of the Demons remake, which has a similar premise to this movie, (group of young people trapped in a house with demons and forced to try to survive until dawn) and I hated it. It's impressive how Evil Dead did right what Night of the Demons failed at miserably so many years later (and with the advantage of a bigger budget, I'm sure).As the number of survivors in this horror flick fall to one, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is driven close to madness as he's forced to fight off the nightmarish attacks of his former friends, who have all become possessed Deadites. The demon-like creatures aren't content with just trying to kill him, they seem to take great joy in torturing him mentally as much as possibleThe special effects and make-up are extremely well done. The Deadites all look quite gruesome, and there's a great sense of foreboding atmosphere before they even appear. It bears repeating how great all this looks, considering how low of a budget it had. Even if it wasn't as entertaining as it is, it still would be worth seeing just as an example of what can be done with creativity and not very much money.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Whoa! What an old school delight,"Do you remember back in the day, when once or twice a year the expensive pay movie channels had a free weekend? Everyone I knew used to put the blank VHS in and just start taping anything and everything right?! Then you'd end up with crap movies, great movies, and some movies you've never heard of. I was about 14. My brothers friend gave him 2 of these VHS tapes. With 3-4 movies on each one. It was a long weekend or something, so I had some late nights watching them. On one was Monkey Shines, Amityville Horror, and The Evil Dead. I had heard of the first 2 before and the last one had a name that sounded ridiculous.When I got to the Evil Dead it was very late at night and it turned into a horror movie experience I will never forget and made me a life long genre fan! I quickly got over the ""crappy"" quality and low budget. I was mesmerized by the terror. Excited, scared, and blown away. It was the perfect time and setting to make me a Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fan FOR EVER! I realized that there was a sequel and that Army of Darkness (which was a ""new release"" VHS at the time) was the 3rd one. So i devoured it all HAHA.I wish others could have the experience I had with my first viewing of Evil Dead. But instead I will continue to be an ambassador for it! Don't expect crystal clear quality or amazing cinematography its just not like that. Its older. And one of their first movies. Just let go and let yourself get sucked into the horror, the genius...And the CELLAR!!!!!! ooooooooooohh. Ha.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood to max,Gore enthusiasts love movies like these. Evil Dead is over done with the gore and blood. It is 80's blood and gore to the max.

I can see why this is a cult classic,"It's hard to know where to begin when reviewing this film as it is absolutely bonkers.It has genuinely good horror, mostly through it's almost unbearably suspenseful atmosphere and clever camera work. The setting adds to this horror and is absolutely spot on. The cabin has such a creepy feel and the way the camera and characters navigate it is perfect.The practical effects surprisingly stand the test of time and are pretty freaky (the less said about the aged stop motion effects the better...).The acting is... sort of awful? But it works. I wouldn't have it any other way.In many ways this film just shouldn't be good, but all of the elements come together to make it a classic horror which is so much more than the sum of its parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What an incredible piece of trash,"It is astonishing how many times this movie got rated a 10. It was comically gory and the storyline lacked depth. It was merely 1,5 hour of blood spilling. The rape scene especially ruined it for me, as it felt like one of the creators was acting out their twisted fantasy. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. Because the film was rated a 7,4 and I did not read any negative reviews, I went ahead and watched it. I regret it. The three female characters were underdeveloped and it felt they were only there to get murdered. May this be a warning, the movie is not scary, there is no build-up or developed storyline. Only a lot of hacking and stabbing.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
the bets of the three,"I have all three of the evil dead movies on dvd and I have to say this is the best one. This movie just has something that the sequels don't.I recommend anyone interested in the evil dead series to pick up the collectors edition dvd, it is fantastic, it has 10 minutes of deleted scenes and 2 commentary tracks, one by sam and rob and one by Bruce Cambell, you can't really appreciate what they had to go through to make this film till you hear these excellent tracks.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best of horror,"Wow there is so much blood and suspense and I love it. Very basic story but quite intriguing. I watched it with lights out and some moments scared me. I love the cut scenes when he is equipping the shotgun and all the stuff on himself just like in Hot Fuzz when Nicholas and Danny are preparing for fight against the village people. I guess Edgar Wright got it from here. Also, now after watching this for the first time I realized that Cabin in the Woods is full of Evil Dead refrences. I can also see the things Evil Dead took from other movies etc. Psycho and it is used in a cool way. Visual effects were bad in scene or two but they stood the test of time for me and were so realistic and raw. Make up is also well done. Bruce Campbell carried the movie and was the highlight of the film. The score is also perfect and haunting. I felt unsettling most of the times and on the edge for the most part. Very smart to pick one location for the whole movie and spend the rest of the money for effects and other stuff. I would recommend you to watch it for Halloween and I will rewatch this one with pleasure for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst movie ever !!!!!!!,"this movie is probably the most ridiculous and cheesy I've ever seen. I've seen it 3 times or more; I don't know if this was scary for the early 80's ( movies like these maybe inspired gore bands like Cannibal Corpse years latter ) but for these days I watch Evil Dead and only see myself laughing at the extremely lousy effects, the poor characters, all the ""ketchup and red ink"" gore anyone can make alike at home and most of all the way juvenile plot for this. I think I'd only recommend this movie for 14 year old kids into black metal who think they are the most ""evil"" kids on their area. pure garbage this is what you get with this !!!!!! I can't believe anyone can dare to call this piece of scum a ""classic"" of the horror genre.",,Anonymous,Horror

Best horror film ever.,"I'm 17 years old and honestly, i actually love this film with a passion. Everything about it, the gore, the special effects, the setting, the theme, the plot and the camera work the lot! I first heard about this film when i was about 7 or 8 and we got the game on ps1. After that, the fascination began. Took me a while to watch it as this film used to scare me a heck of a lot. But once i was able to watch it, its been my favourite horror film since. This film has inspired me to pursue a career in media. It might sound odd but honestly this film is that good. If your a fan of the B movie horror films then this should be a favourite. This is the king of B movie horrors. It doesn't have great special effects (at all) but thats why this film is amazing. The over-the-top violence is endulging. Sam Raimi's best film. The camera technique when the camera goes over the rafters is just brilliant. If your a lover of horror films, this is a must. Every horror fan must/would've seen this film!

Cult Classis for a reason,"There is a obvious reason why this is a cult classic film, in how ground breaking and innovative for its time. Filming for this movie was rough and it becomes obvious when watching it how painstakingling each actor puts in there best effort to bring such a fantastic movie. A group of friends go to a cabin for the weekend when thing go bad immediately. They discover things in the basement and evil forces become released that cannot be stopped. Ashly is such a fun character that it is no surprise that a series of Evil Dead movies have stared him. A very interesting concept that pushes boundaries for sure!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil Dead is possibly the craziest horror film I've seen.,"If someone asked me ""Luke, describe in 400 words what happens in The Evil Dead""...I would probably struggle. Basic plot is basic. Group of teenagers go to remote cabin in woods, discover book of the dead, play a tape recording speaking some dead lingo and then creepy stuff happens. I've seen the remake a good few times, this is my first watch of the original and actually I would probably rate them the same for different reasons. An advantage that the original has, is Sam Raimi. Wow. Probably his best film. He does lack some technical finesse but the inventive POV camera tracking shots through the woods were incredibly effective. When Ash climbs up the stairs in the basement, when he walks through the cabin...extremely well crafted camera techniques that heighten the experience. His writing was also good, not the best but better than your average horror. There are hints of personality to our characters, particularly Ash, but I don't think it was enough to make me care about them. A slight dark comedic undertone within the script but it's extremely subtle. The star of the film is the makeup design. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Blood is spewing out everyone eventually, bodies start to decompose in rapid stop cuts (great editing during those scenes) and when the teenagers start to become possessed...some of them looked damn terrifying! The prosthetics were innovative as well, particularly the infamous tree rape scene which had been originally cut in several countries (I wonder why...). Let's face it, in 1981 no one ever saw anything quite like this in terms of gruelling horror...it was bound to be cut and edited to make theatrical releases in different countries. This isn't so much a scary film, more aimed towards the gore sub-genre. Some of the characters felt way too calm given the circumstances. Seriously, who would be relaxed if they disembodied their friend? An effective and inventive gory horror that just lacks technical finesse and memorable supporting characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Skip This, And Watch The Sequel Instead","Here's a film ""series"" in which I much preferred the sequel over the original. This is the first one of the Evil Dead movies and it lacks the humor and general interest that Evil Dead 2 provides. ED2 also is much tamer in the language department, has better thrills and more entertaining action-horror scenes.This one has 30-year-old-looking actors playing college kids, one of them blaspheming every few minutes, and most of them give an amateurish feel to the whole movie. After a slow start, when the gore starts, it comes in buckets. Sometimes there is so much it's almost laughable, so stupid and ludicrous.Actually, this whole film is so bad it is unintentionally funny in a number of spots. Bruce Campbell didn't speak much in this movie, either. Maybe he was just learning how to act. By the second ""Dead,"" at least he had the facial expressions down pat.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I wasn't sure at the beginning, but I get why this is a classic","I've heard a lot of good things about this franchise so the other night I finally got around to watching the first installment since I knew a new one was being realeased soon.I'm a really big fan of 80s horror, but honestly at the beginning of the movie I wasn't sure how much I was going to enjoy this one. But once it actually got going I was sold.Being that it's from 1981, the special effects are obviously dated. Some of them are a bit over the top so that combined I wasn't sure how well it would hold up but I didn't find it took me out of the movie at all. I mean, I'll take multiple decade old practical effects over dated CGI any day, but they also felt like they fit the overall look and feel of the movie.I loved Ash as a protagonist, I loved the low budget, 80s, almost DIY at time feel of the film. This is definitely going on my favourites list, and if you're a fan of 80s horror and you haven't watched it yet, I'd definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best Horror Films Out there!,"Let me get started by saying, no I am not here because of the hype. I just happened to stumble across this movie and was blown away! Sam Raimi does an incredible job crafting this masterpiece. I'll admit, I jumped quite a few times with some of the jump scares, and I laughed my butt off. This movie is soooo funny! The camera angles are absolutely beautiful. I don't know what they did but it worked so well. While there were a few moments that I felt were kind of cheesy, i still enjoyed it. Especially since they were purposefully cheesy and ended up being really funny. In all honesty I think that this movie isn't for everyone. However if you are a fan of Sam's films then you will like this. I would say it's okay for teens 15 and up. There is only one scene about 26 minutes in that you may want to skip but if not it's not that bad lol. You see a nipple for a brief second in a non sexual context. All in all a great film!

"The first, the best!","When I was a child and this film came out a lot of rumors were going around: that it was one of the goriest and sickest movies ever made and only the toughest guys had stick it out till the end. Nineteen years have passed and I´ve seen Raimi´s flick about 6 or 7 times. As you see, I have survived and ""The Evil Dead"" now belongs to my favorite horror movies ever! This film is really sensational: realized with nearly no budget it became one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. Sam Raimi´s work is gory as hell, the make-up F/X are well done and the ""flying camera"" and a lot of unusual camera angles make this flick being a unique masterpiece! This film was banned in Germany for a long time until an annoying cut version came on the market. Author Stephen King called ""The Evil Dead"" one of the best shocking movies ever made and main actor Bruce Campbell became the greatest cult star of the modern horror genre. Together with director Sam Raimi he also filmed ""The Evil Dead II"", which is a very enjoyable shocker, too, but after all more a remake to the original. ""Army of Darkness"", which is the third part of the serial, really disappointed me - the original stays unrivaled, an immortal cult classic!!!",,Anonymous,Horror
A masterpiece that lives up to its tag-line!,"The tag-line for THE EVIL DEAD - the ultimate experience in grueling terror - is genuinely lived up to.Having seen the sequel, EVIL DEAD 2, before this one and laughing hard at its light-hearted intentionally comical nature, I was completely unprepared for what awaited me when I popped the video tape of THE EVIL DEAD into my VCR player all those years ago.There is an ongoing polarising debate about what makes a good horror movie - supernatural horror or gore. Sam Raimi sweeps away the false choice by taking both elements and elevating them to extreme proportions to bring an ultimate terrifying nightmare you will absolutely never forget.Sam Raimi took a budget that would seem tiny even by the standards of Hammer horror movies and produced a true horror masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of cinema like never before. Wearing its NC-17 rating like a badge of honour, it truly gives no quarter and takes no prisoners. It makes its sequels, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS, look like Disney movies in comparison.THE EVIL DEAD is one of 74 entries on the DPP (now CPS) video nasties list and it's the best by far.The simple plot of five travellers taking a trip to the woods and unknowingly unleashing demons seems very formulaic these days. But I'm telling you the rip-offs and stealth remakes are merely swimming in the wake of this classic original.The small cast works wonders in this movie. These young people are easy to relate to. They are likable. They enjoy having fun. They like to tell jokes. They show love and affection for each other. As such, we feel for them when they are picked off one-by-one.The demons in this movie are also proper antagonists. They are not Hollywood villains who you can negotiate with or shoot with a machine gun if they annoy you too much. They are genuinely ugly, horrific, inexplicable abominations prepared resort to emotionally cruel subterfuge to achieve their evil objectives. You can bash them over the head a dozen times. You can shoot them in the face with a shotgun. You can even poke their eyes out. But they keep coming for you until you've literally chopped off their every limb.The special effects here are funded on microscopic budgets compared to Hollywood blockbusters. Yet there is no Hollywood movie I could name where you literally see demons decay bit-by-bit inside and outside for several minutes, bits of flesh shriveling up like screwed up paper, skulls exploding, blood emitting steam as it oozes out, demons biting their own hands off and faces pierced with shotgun shells like a dart piercing a dartboard.The camera work and sound effects allow Raimi to exploit to the fear of the unknown to the absolute maximum. You know there's a demon there, yet you can't see it. A simple effect of a camera mounted on top of a motorbike combined with excellent sound effects and jarring music chords literally, and I mean literally, scares the living daylights out of you the first time you see and hear it.The acting is superb as well.Bruce Campbell plays the role he was born to play as Ash Williams. He is not the stereotypical muscle-bound Hollywood or the James Bond-type hero with nerves of steel. He's an ordinary guy just as freaked out as the audience. He literally is overwhelmed at what is happening. He's watched his friends die. He's even had to kill his girlfriend to defend himself. He tries to avoid believing what he's seeing is true. He shakes like hell as he tries to barricade himself into the cabin. He can't hide forever. Sooner or later he has to face up the demons. When he does he accidentally becomes a hero - one who returns in two sequels.Ellen Sandweiss also delivers a highly underrated performance as Cheryl. The events that bestow her character are unlike anything seen in movies before this. You feel her fear, her anger, her disgust and shock from the ultimate violation. This is what proper horror is about.This is a dangerous movie to watch from a personal perspective because once you've seen it, you might never see other horror movies in the same light again. I mean that literally.Overall, THE EVIL DEAD is a true masterpiece of low-budget movie production. It's easily the best of the video nasties and a must-see for all fans of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
These Demons from Beyond Scared the Pants Off of Me,"SCARY AS HELL!!!!This is one of the rare horror films that knows how to make gore frightening. But it's not just the blood and guts that terrifies here. it's Sam Raimi's accomplished direction and his fearless ability to make the movie so damn WEIRD that makes it such a good entry in the horror canon.A bunch of kids are staying in an isolated cabin in the woods and conjure up a bunch of demons from beyond. Sounds pretty standard. But Raimi directs with such a unique style -- cartoonish and campy in a way, yet utterly terrifying in spite of, or maybe because of, that approach -- that I wound up watching this film with one hand poised to cover my eyes at any moment, and I don't scare easily.I am not among those that think the film's sequel, ""Evil Dead 2,"" is a masterpiece.

Completely serious (if horror movies are serious) unlike its sequels, Evil Dead doesn't take long to turn on the horror, and once it does it's unrelenting through the rest of the movie. The evil force crashing through the woods that you never saw (love the noise it made also) was perfect. An untangible presence that struck randomly... great stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy contender for 'greatest horror film ever',"I don't know why it took so long for me to watch this film... I think it's the fact that I've always been told that it's a gore-fest and not really anything else. I can tell you now; I have been grossly misinformed. This is one of those films that everyone who's into the genre should see. If you as much as 'like' horror, you should see this film. Look past the less-than-stellar acting, the dubious dialog and the thin character writing, and you will see one of the greatest horror films ever created. The plot is hardly worth mentioning. The pacing is top-notch, you're not bored for a second through the entire film. Not one second, throughout the whole film. Seriously. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are daftly written, and so hard to tell apart due to vague personalities that I was never completely certain how many men or women there were, or who was who(well, apart from Campbell as Ash, but his face is a pretty recognizable one). The dialog, as mentioned earlier, is quite dubious. Just about all characters(including the demons/Evil Dead, in-between moans and 'join us') get at least one really bad line. Delivery isn't exactly perfect, either. The effects, though some cheap and a few outdated(but not noticeably so; none of them looked fake or were easy to figure out) are very good. The real strength in this film, however, is the buildup to the horror and the editing. The way ""The Evil"", this unseen, abstract force of true evil is hinted at through the film... impossibly effective. The POV shots originating from said force are incredibly creepy. The editing is tight and excellent. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have seen in my entire life. A few shots were off, but there is no doubt that Raimi knows exactly where to put the camera or how to move it, even when he doesn't have the money to get a hold of expensive rigs. Now, as mentioned earlier, many have told me that this is a gore-fest... while everything I have put in my review up to this point still stands, let me make one thing clear; there is plenty of gore in this film. For better or for worse. Plenty. Limbs are torn off, bodies are maimed and blood is dripping by the truckloads. However, even if you don't like gore, if you don't care for blood and violence, you should watch this film... if you are into horror and you can take the gore(which is graphic and intense, make no mistake about that), you should definitely watch this film. One to watch for everyone who is into horror. I recommend this film to every horror fan who believes he can stand the violence and gore, and to everyone who is into both horror and gore... you've probably already seen this film, but if you haven't, go do so now. You won't regret it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fantastically Gory...,"Well what can i say, i mean what it lacks in script it makes up for in gore in pure 80's horror fashion.With a small budget, up and coming director Sam Rami did not have a lot to go with, but he certainly did well with some of the camera shots.Rami, who has since directed hits such as Spiderman and Spiderman 2 used simple techniques to get the right effect. For example the effect of the camera creeping through the bushes was not used as much when this film was made, and the production team managed this by attaching the camera to a plank and they had someone running around with it.The script isn't great, and to tell the truth there aren't a lot of lines anyway apart in the first half an hour or so while the story is set, but as time goes on there's more bloodshed and less chat, which is good in a way.There are very few special affects, and the while the appearance of the zombies is good it is basic, but as i said before, where it lacks in story and script it makes up with gore and pure violence.Shortly after it's release it was banned for many years, and even after it was re-released there were many scenes that were missing, luckily not for ever. For example a scene where this woman is led out into the woods, wherefore the trees and plants come alive and rape here, called "" the tree rape scene"", or another scene where a woman gets a pencil stuck in her ankle.Luckily though the full version is being shown on television, as it was last night where i watched it.Towards the end as the number of characters diminish due to being killed or turned into zombies, the amount of talk lessens which leads the way to a climax of gore and violence.This is a good film which is enjoyable despite a few faults, and i am looking forward to seeing the two sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Had dated badly but scared me silly as a teenager,"When Evil Dead came out first I was only a teen. A friend of mine got a copy of the film on bootleg and we watched it in his house when his parents were out. Back in its day it was considered a video nasty and pretty tough going. At the time, I found it terrifying - especially the bit where the demon is locked in the cellar. I got to watch the film again recently and I thought that it had dated badly. The special effects look very wooden nowadays. However, it is a landmark film and one of the first of the zombie genre. It will always hold a place in cinema history. Sam Raimi is to be applauded for making such a successful film for such a small amount of money. The sequels were rubbish and turned the franchise into a comedy show. I would love if someone competent were to do a remake of this film. Sam Raimi himself would be ideal....",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dead by dawn, dead by dawn!","Evil Dead (1981) was one of the last midnight movies (at least in my area). It was also the most violent, gory and cheesiest horror film I have seen inthe last ten or so years that was highly entertaining.  A group of collegekids go fooling around in some old cabin and discover the Necronomicon. Yes, they find the book that H.P. Lovecraft used to love to write about. A book made from human skin and contains a bizarre language and horrific images.  Evil Dead was the movie that raised the bar on shock and gore.Not only did this movie launch the career of Sam Raimi but it made BruceCampbell a B-movie legend.   Made on the cheap but it brought in a lot ofmoney and in the process became one of the most talked about horror filmsof all time.  Several years later, armed with a bigger budget, the same teamproduced a semi-sequel/remake that eases on the horror and amps up theblack comedy.  An essential film.Highly recommended.A+",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Raimi's gore fuelled debut...,"This classic low budget gore fest follows 5 friends as they travel to a secluded cabin retreat in the middle of nowhere for the weekend. While there they accidentally awaken an ancient evil force from the surrounding forest, that gradually begins to take them over one by one and turn them on each other. With no way out and limited resources, will the emerging hero Ash survive the seemingly endless night?I first saw this film so long ago I could barely remember it, but it is still great fun. It looks like it must have only cost a few thousand quid to make, but that being said it still manages to be quite engaging. The acting and dialogue is obviously very low quality, with the performances offering laughs for all the wrong reasons, but somehow it remains endearing. The story is ridiculous and the location cliche, but Raimi and co make the most of it all with some awesome first person camera shots from the point of view of the evil, along with some spectacular and comical gore effects.If you like the idea of somewhat tongue in cheek horror with splattering blood galore, then you can do far worse than check this out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A blood filled classic,"The Evil Dead is a franchise I've heard plenty of great things about, and one of the more classic franchises in the genre, right up there with Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, and child's play, Sam Raimi is a director I've always admired, from his work on the spider-man movies to doctor strange 2, so I was naturally excited to jump into this franchise, and I must say, it started out terrifically.The Evil Dead is one of those films where if you adore tons of blood, suspense, and cheap thrills, aka me, you'll be incredibly satisfied, Sam Raimi directed this film beautifully, giving a great craft to each of his shots and really highlighting the sinister theme of dread and that something is lurking.While I didn't get attached to any of these characters in particular, the badass Ash Williams stood out to me, I can't wait to see where he goes next.And some of the imagery in this film is absolutely traumatizing, I'll be seeing some of these monster designs in my nightmares tonight.I'm gonna give the evil dead an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good,"This is a good movie, quite simply.  It's very scary, and hilarious at some points.  Many people miss the funny parts as they take it way to seriously. Evil Dead, whilem more serious then the other two movies, is not like the Exorcist or The Omen.  It has it's moments, and is definetly one of the better horror movies of the 80's.  One other thing I should mention: the budget is not around $50,000.  It approaches $250,000, some estimates put it over the $300,000 range.  So Halloween was actually made for LESS, but it looked slicker.  I think this was an intentional (least partially) thing on Raimi's part.  Kind of an atmospheric feel to it, this rawness.

Join us!,"Released in the years before cable TV and before video cassettes made low budget schlock available to the average viewer, Evil Dead found its audience with the midnight movie horror festival crowd. No way did it get a nationwide release. Privately owned cinemas bought prints and slowly the film spread from coast to coast and even made its way to Britain. But by this time videos were gaining popularity and it was released on cassette at the same time as a very limited theatrical release.Critics and censors dismissed it as trash and not long afterwards it was relegated to the video nasty bin and banned. As silly as this may seem, that was the logic of the BBFC. The fact that it is inventive and well directed was lost on them. And until recently only cult audiences appreciated its value. With Anchor Bay's new DVD we can all finally enjoy the uncut, definitive and best-looking presentation possible.Originally released in 1981 as The Book Of The Dead, this was a feature length re-make of Sam Raimi's short film, Within The Woods. The plot (excuse) and story (violence) involves a quintet of friends, enjoying a few days of quiet at a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods. These are not Friday the 13th goofballs who want nothing but sex and skinny-dipping. They are realistic. And it all goes nicely until Scotty (Hal Delrich) finds an ugly-looking book (with a face) and an old reel-to-reel tape recorder in the basement. The tape is of an archaeologist explaining how he resurrected demons that took over his wife in the very same cabin. The professor is nowhere to be found, but the haunting burial rites and incantations written in Sumerian text in the ugly book, The Necronomicon Ex Mortis-Book Of The Dead, are on the tape also.Sheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) freaks out. She hears a demonic voice out in the woods. ""Join us!"" Foolishly going out to investigate, she is raped by a tree. Although this particular scene isn't so hard to watch, the film still has the power to disturb and make you squirm.Once Sheryl returns, all hell breaks loose and Raimi has a helluva time firing torrents of blood of varying colours throughout the cabin. Limbs are hacked off with carefree abandon and poor old Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to take them all on at once.The supernatural hijinks were repeated to a much lesser effect in the sequel, but here Raimi creates an atmosphere of dread and whatever that force is out in the woods - it's scary. It does have some humour, but first time around the filmmakers obviously wanted horror first. You'll wince a few times, no doubt. The raw tone goes hand-in-hand with the low budget and Raimi's bizarre, hardcore cartoonish style is much in evidence.More time is spent building character. Ash loves his girlfriend and a simple little scene between them makes us totally root for him. He is still to become the hapless buffoon, as he will repeat in Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.At the very least, Evil Dead is so popular that it can no longer be regarded as a cult movie. It's not a classic. Not yet. But it is highly regarded and definitely worth several viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The very pinnacle of schlock-horror!,"I've got to tell you right off - The Evil Dead is my favourite horror film of all time - so you can expect a praise-filled review here! I have seen this film at least one hundred times since I first saw it at about the age of ten, and to this day, I can still stick the DVD in the player and guarantee myself a good time. The Evil Dead may be low budget schlock at heart, but there's very few A-class films that I can say that for! The notorious shocker that started the video nasty debate in the eighties is as good now as it was then, and that is all testament to the imagination and dedication of the talented team of amateurs that conquered their budget restraints to put the film together. I'm sure that Sam Raimi and co. didn't know that they had a cult hit that would still be much loved twenty five years later on their hands during filming - but really, that only adds to the cult value of this masterpiece. The plot is brilliantly simple, and it follows the story of a group of five friends that go for a relaxing holiday in the Tennessee Woods. However, their holiday turns out to be anything but relaxing when Ash and Scottie, with the aid of a tape recorder, unwittingly unleash the aptly named 'Evil Dead' from it's slumber.Looking back at the video nasty list now, the vast majority of them are tame by today's standards. This is either down to the change in views of what is and what isn't acceptable, or simply because the films were so atrociously made that they're impossible to take seriously. The reason that The Evil Dead sits at the very summit of that illustrious list, therefore, is because this is every bit the film now that it was then. The film is grainy on purpose, and the gore effects, while obviously cheap; are potent, relentless and disgusting enough to still cause a stir today (the fact that the uncut version wasn't passed all that long ago shows that!). The Evil Dead has become the benchmark for schlock horror films, and this is shown by the fact that almost every film in this vain to be made post-Evil Dead has benefited in some way from the film. That's not to say that Raimi hasn't taken influence from some classics himself. The claustrophobic sets and camera angles echo those in Night of the Living Dead loud and clear, while on famous sequence involving a spade has been taken straight from the Hammer classic 'Plague of the Zombies'. However, Raimi has implemented all of these things into his film in such a way that it feels fresh - and there's nothing wrong with regurgitating elements from other people's films if you can make good of it.The claustrophobic way that Raimi uses his camera helps the film implicitly, and when coupled with the isolated setting that the central location is in; we have a great base for a horror movie. Considering that he was an amateur at the time, Raimi's use of the camera is extraordinary and more than gives many of the established horror film makers a run for their money. The idea to put a camera on a motorbike ('Raimi-cam') is brilliant, and those shots give the film that extra 'x factor'. Seeing the camera roar through the woods is actually quite terrifying. This also gives the film a very nervy atmosphere, as you never know where the evil is going to strike next! The most infamous sequence in the film has to be one that sees Ellen Sandweiss venture out into the woods, only to be violated by the trees. Raimi has said since that this sequence was the mark of an amateur filmmaker, and I agree with him. However, this sequence is an integral part of the film as it helped it to gain a lot of it's notoriety, so I guess it's important if only for that reason.The characters are thin in a typical schlock style. Characterisation doesn't matter, however, as the focus of the film is always on the atmosphere and gore - but nevertheless, the ensemble of amateur actors perform with gusto, and their heart definitely helps the film succeed. Consider the women of the film. They give it their all when their characters are turned into evil demons, and there aren't many 'a-class' actresses that would be able to do that! Of course, on the acting side this film is famous for one man over all else; B-movie god, Bruce Campbell. His performance as Ash was what has made him a cult favourite. Bruce portrays his character with comic brilliance; using a range of facial expressions to portray fear, exhaustion and a sense of loathing towards his situation. Bruce develops the character of Ash as the film goes on, going from a wimpy young man, to a resourceful 'demon-slayer' using all manner of items, including axes, planks of wood and even his girlfriend's necklace to dispatch of his foes. Don't get me wrong, he didn't deserve an Oscar (that was part II!) - but if it weren't for him, this wouldn't be the film that it is.On the whole, The Evil Dead is a film of such paramount importance that it is fundamental viewing for anyone who considers themselves a horror fan, or any young filmmaker wanting to make an impact in cinema without the benefit of a lot of money. Many people refer to this film as 'just a fun flick' or 'so good it's bad', but I cant agree with that. Considering what went into making, and the end result - The Evil Dead is one of the greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Evil"" Indeed!","As a birthday present to myself (and to gear up for the upcoming Halloween movie season), yesterday I bought the ""Book of the Dead"" edition of Sam Raimi's 1982 horror classic, ""The Evil Dead.""

They spend the night in one of those spooky log cabins and as you know, trouble's a brewing. One of them, discovers the infamous ""Book of the Dead"" and as the plot requires, they read from it, not knowing that doing so would be opening up a Pandora's Box of ghastly horrors.

It's not scary at all, but does have quite a lot of tension. I would guess that if this is scary to any degree, it's not because of atmosphere really, but more because of the horrific makeup used and the incredibly gory special effects. All of this is lightened up by a really dark sense of humor that would become more apparent in the later sequels.Sam Raimi really knows how to direct a good horror movie and of course would try to shake off this image over the next 20 years, which would lead him to directing last year's ""Spider-Man.""

"Overrated, but not bad","I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this, but I think this one beats THE EVIL DEAD II and ARMY OF DARKNESS by far, in my opinion. It's far simpler and less elaborate, not resorting to as many campy cheap thrills that those latter films resorted to.  Sorry, but I'm not into black humor, especially when it appears forced and contrived and silly.  If I want silly, I'll watch BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY.  This film has some of that, put it's played down and kept to a minimum.I'm sure everyone knows what this one's about by now.  Two dudes and three chicks go up to a cabin in Tennessee and find a book made out of human skin left behind by an anthropology professor, along with a tape recording of his last and final words.  The evil spirits then take over these guys and they start to kill each other off.  All except Bruce Campbell, that is...It all is pretty standard stuff until the last scene where Campbell throws the book into the fire and the corpses of his dead friends start to melt and decompose.  It reminds me a lot of the claymation Ray Harryhausen used to do with stop motion photography.  Looks like they spend a lot of time setting that one up.That scene looks pretty cool and imaginative, however I think there were far scarier 80s horror films out there, done by the likes of David Croneneberg, John Carpenter and Wes Craven, so I think this one's a bit overrated.  And nothing was more scarier at the time than the first TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. That one scared the living fu#k outta me.The Anchor Bay DVD uses a pristine print and has all kinds of extra goodies on it, including unused footage, stills and posters, pictures of theater marquees at some various premieres around the country, Raimi and crew on location, etc.Even though I think there are greater shockers out there, this one is still entertaining as hell.  7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

By all means a horror classic! ****1/2 out of 5,"One of the great things about this film is that it's so low budget and nitty gritty in a Texas Chainsaw kind of way. It really has the weird oogy feeling about it and that, to me, is the most important factor in the film.Secondly the gore is piled onto the atmosphere this only makes the film all the more nitty gritty. Rarely do you see so much gore in one film and the movie still be taken somewhat seriously.Now that's not to say the film should be taken too seriously though. It definitely has it's share of tongue in cheek moments, but when you get down to it, it's a lot more serious than the next couple of entries.Acting here, other than our man Campbell, really ain't all that great. But that's an element most horror fans can dismiss for the most part. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly all terrible either.The one scene that aggravates me the most though is when 'Cheryl' hears a noise outside the cabin late at night and actually goes INTO the woods yelling 'Who's out there!?' To me, I just can't justify such stupidity in any way. And that's why I can't give the film a full five stars.But again... don't get me wrong. I love this film as much as the next loyal horror fan.It's gore infested, demon possessed, and directed with gusto! This is an all time horror treat and can't be missed.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sinister,"The Evil Dead. Ah yes. The first installment.The movie starts off with a group of people going to a rundown cabin in Tennesse.

The people indeed look quite disgusting. So far so good.There is however a scene involving a tree and our first victim. What happened there was.....original and will definitely get your attention. Trust me. The movie is unrated for a reason.We meet Ash for the first time here. Don't expect the calm and cool one here. He starts off as kind of a wuss. This is the first time he is witness to the awful events that unfold and how would anyone react to horrible things like this? Sam Raimi is a talented director.

Even Ted Raimi makes his film debut here.(You have to listen to the commentary to find out where)The Last Word: A good start. The cult following begins.

A modern horror milestone.,"We have a tendency to look back and glorify the old, great horror films, like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby and Night of the Living Dead, etc, automatically hailing them and lamenting the depressing thought that films like that will probably never be made again. Rob Zombie recently eased that fear a little bit, but in Sam Raimi's early career, he was making gritty, grimy horror films that reminded us that the old days of horror can still be brought back to life. For every I Know What You Did Last Summer or Hostel or other idiot teen slasher I think back to the days of Raimi's early horror films and just wonder what happened.Here's something interesting, in modern times, there are more and more high budget horror movies coming out, with a noticeable decline in quality as the money gets bigger. I wish someone would notice that one of the best things about The Evil Dead is that it was made on a shoe-string budget. Like Chaplin's favorite part of his career, the early years when he would just go to the park with a bench and a girl and a big oafish guy and just bang out a film, Evil Dead gives the feeling of being just a bunch of friends who went out to the woods and cut themselves off from society for a while to see what they could come up with. And they came out with a classic!The plot, of course, focuses on (you guessed it) a group of friends who go out to the woods to camp. The opening of the movie, the drive through the creepy woods, is one of the best examples of mood-setting that I can think of. You can almost feel the trees closing in around you as the hapless friends drive through the woods, teasing each other about the scary woods.There are several scenes in the movie that will immediately put off a lot of viewers, such as the infamous tree love scene (not my favorite either), but the fact that the movie doesn't try to please anyone is what allows it to cut loose and just be a real horror movie. Trying to please a wide audience is the worst thing that any horror film can do, because that's what gives you those stupid sophomoric teen thrillers.Bruce Campbell, in the first performance of his best role, Ash, is surprisingly geeky in the first Evil Dead movie, at least compared to the hardened badass that he was to become in the two sequels, and considering the fact that he is generally remembered as being the coolest horror hero imaginable. But I think that may be what makes the trilogy work so well. A good story should show character change, and through the course of the trilogy Ash becomes something completely different from what he was when we met him in 1981, and Campbell fits the geek and the hero exceptionally well.Raimi understands the cartoonishly excessive blood and gore will reduce the real scariness of the movie and make it almost into a bloody comedy, so he uses that idea to its maximum potential, causing us to laugh and squirm all throughout the movie, although the real scares are few and far between. The sound effects, camera work, costumes, and vile liquids spraying forth across the screen, however, are horrible enough, and it's clear that Raimi and the cast and crew are having a lot of fun with the material, which is one of the many reasons that it's so easy for the audience to have fun with it, too.It should be noted that, because of the shoestring budget, they had to be truly creative in their effects and filming. Much of the camera work is done using very crude techniques, and the creativity involved creates a feel that the biggest budget could never approach. There are dollies and slides and other devices that are handmade from things like pieces of wood and duct tape in order to get the necessary shots, and the effect is brilliant. Can you imagine? They actually used duct tape to film this movie! Outstanding!Strangely, Raimi took a four year break from directing after the Evil Dead, before finally following the movie up with the astonishingly bad Crimewave, the badness of which just strikes me as a real mystery, given the talent involved in making it. Luckily, he almost immediately followed this disaster up with the first sequel to Evil Dead, which plays like a sequel and a remake at the same time. It serves as a testament to the success of this early effort that it was basically remade Evil Dead II, and now is set to be remade again in 2009. Let's just hope that, now that he's a Hollywood director, Raimi can still capture the same attitude and gritty goriness of his early career!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic zombie movie,"A classic zombie movie.A group of friends - Ash, Cheryl, Scott, Linda and Shelly - head out to a remote cabin. The cabin has an eerie feeling and they soon discover some items left by previous occupants. One of the items is a strange book...I'm generally not a zombie movie fan (unless it's a good zombie- comedy, eg Zombieland, Warm Bodies). Zombie movies tend to be very unoriginal and predictable and usually consist of hordes of zombies chasing humans around, Benny Hill style, for large portion of the movie.However, The Evil Dead is different, and much better. Writer- director Sam Raimi builds the tension well and, even though you know there is zombieness coming, you don't know when, or how. Even once the zombies start appearing, it is not your usual random chase and fight scenes. The atmosphere is genuinely tense and scary.Production values are pretty poor, but that helps the movie, in a way. The cheap special effects heighten the sense of decay and abnormality of the situation.The movie made Raimi's career. Just a pity the follow-ups, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, didn't have the same originality and unpredictability, degenerating into zombie clichés (though they were still better than the average zombie movie)The movie also launched the career of Bruce Campbell, who starred as Ash. He would appear again, as Ash, in Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Always a first time.,"I have been rating movies here a long time -- although the reviews have been sporadic.
I don't make it a point to point out the bad ones. This one was so bad that it is the exception.
It was a bad film, no plot, no caring for characters, no character development, nothing. I am amazed that at this time it is rated on the IMDb weighted average at 7.5.

The Tag Line Was Actually Right,"""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"" This tag line is actually correct this time instead of a lame exaggeration. The terror produced by this film is indeed grueling and physically exhausting. I thought I saw the scariest films ever made in ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and while those film did indeed produce their own kind of terror, ""Evil Dead"" has surpassed them.The story is simple. Five friends go to a cabin for some good old partying. A few weired instances take place but only when the Necromonicon is found and a tape player recites the text that the fun begins.What makes this film so scary? The first would have to be the inventive camera angles. Fast, rapid and above all else stylish, especially when from the demon's POV, it's like being grabbed by the shirt and pulled along for the ride. The cabin is a perfect setting to take advantage of which Raimi does. Add to that is the use of sound. A creepy soundtrack with sinister sounds and a good use of silence, this movie has scene after scene after scene of unbearable tension, knowing something is going to pop out but never knowing when.The makeup on the zombies are well done and while the fore effects are not realistic, they sure are cool to look at. The acting ranges from mediocre to below, the best performance going to Bruce Campell who pulls off his part fairly well.On the downside, the film does drag a bit at the end, probably could've been cut about 5-10 minutes short. With that aside, this is a classic, classic horror film and one of the best ever made undoubtedly.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great,"In my reviews of 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' I have mentioned numerous times of my appreciation for Sam Raimi and his movies. I have to say, that I think he is a stylish director and a great story teller.Now I have to admit that it was not until recently that I got to see 'The Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', despite Evil Dead being his first movie. I had seen the third movie, 'Army of Darkness', a while ago, and I really enjoyed it (come on, who didn't?), so with some widely available, and cheap DVD releases, I got the whole trilogy. Yay! 'The Evil Dead' follows a group of friends who take a trip to old, cheap cabin (two ominous signs there!). When they arrive, they find a cellar (ominous sign the third), and what appears to be abandoned research into the occult (fourth and final sign of evil). They play a recording of incantations that bring ancient demons to life, and now Ash (Bruce Campbell) and friends have to survive until dawn.If Bruce Campbell's comments supplied with the DVD were any indication, I wasn't looking forward to much apparently. Well, the acting was rather campy, but still a little better than what Bruce had implied, and the plot wasn't astounding or completely original. He forgot to mention the movie's special effects: rivaled, and beaten, by 1933's 'King Kong'. I wish I was joking here, I really do.Hey, I'm not holding any of that against 'the Evil Dead'. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were unknown to Hollywood when the movie was in production, and the budget was very small, yet they came up with one of the best horror movies ever made, and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The way the film is shot, and some of the better moments of acting, maintain a dark atmosphere and manage to keep the movie suspenseful. However, I didn't know if the special effects towards the end were supposed to disturb me or make me laugh at the cheesiness. That's my only real complaint about the movie. I did want to see the Ash from 'Army of Darkness', but now I see him as a male version of Ripley from the 'Alien' saga - terrified at first, calm and casual at the end.8/10 - Not for the faint of heart...",,Anonymous,Horror
I didn't connect with this film.,"For some strange reason, this film didnt really do anything for me. That's kinda sad, 'cause I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I had read some great reviews, and word of mouth among mates was good, and I know it's become a hell of a cult classic, so why didn't I like it?The simple fact is - I just didn't care about the main characters. I didn't CONNECT with any of them. I know it was an independant film, and on that basis it deserves a 10 for special effects and make up and so on, but if I am to judge the film as whole, then it hits just over average. I firmly belive that the main factor that NEEDS to work in a film if it is to succeed, is to have the audience relate to or care about the characters in the film. This, to me, fails to do so, and I was left wanting a few of them to die!!The story was good, with some intelligence, and the acting was deliberately OTT - Bruce Campbell is the king of Ham acting!! So I didn't mind these small trivial facts, I took it for what it was. I enjoyed it, but maybe it was hyped up too much?There were some genuine frights as well, I have to admit. The 'tree rape sequence' was, for me, slightly disturbing, but I had been warned that I could either view it that way, or just laugh, I'm glad I didn't react the latter way.All in all, this is an average horror film. It's not amazing and it's not trite.You need to watch this film so you can say that you HAVE seen it, but don't expect much, go in with an open mind and just take it for what it is - a B movie spoof. Which, if you put it that way, is kinda interesting...6/10Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A true cult classic.,"Folks, this film defines ""cult.""  I love a good horror film, but these days the're just so hard to find... so when you catch something like ""The Evil Dead,"" you just can't help but feel jazzed.I was 13 when I saw this movie (but don't let that marr your opinion of the proceeding words) and I was truly scared.  I love that adrenaline rush, and this one delivers it.  It wasn't the gore - this is one of the few films that puts the viewer on unstable ground and makes them nervous, and THEN uses gore to heighten the terror.  Blood and guts doesn't do the trick alone.  Sam Raimi, the genious that he is, uses masterful techniques that thousands of striving directors lunge for but miss so terribly.Wait for a stormy night, put off dinner for a while if you're squeemish, pop in the videocasette, and enjoy!  You'll truly love it.  I know I'm always disappointed when I rent a tape with high hopes and it turns out to be a dud.  But this is one of the few films, along with ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" and the uncensored version of ""Natural Born Killers"", that have managed to frighten and disturb me!""The Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Terror.""

A nice horror movie...,"""The Evil Dead"" is a Horror movie in which we watch five friends going to a cabin in the woods in order to have fun and spend a peaceful vacation. As they arrive there they starting to explore the cabin and the area close to it. After their exploration of the cabin, they found an audio tape and an evil book from which they read some pages and they release the evil. The friends are helpless and trying to stop the evil before it's too late for them.I liked this movie because it had a simple and very interesting plot with many surprises and plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Sam Raimi who is also the writer, it was very good with much suspense and many good scenes. I also liked the interpretation of Bruce Campbell who played as Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams and made the difference in this movie and I also liked the interpretation of Betsy Baker who played as Linda. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Ellen Sandweiss who played as Cheryl and she was equally good.Finally, I have to say that ""The Evil Dead"" is a nice movie with plenty of suspense and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it either you are a fan of horror movies or not. You just have to remember that it's a simple zombie movie and you don't have to take it too seriously because none took it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One By One We Will Take You,"Sam Raimis Directorial debut 'The Evil Dead' is a wild, scary, gory, and intense ride.

We also get to see Bruce Campbell as Ash before he grew into the chainsaw weilding one liner legend we all know and love.The pacing is welldone, and the atmosphere of the cabin/surrounding woods still keeps me on the edge of my seat even though I've viewed this film many times. This film was what got me into B-Movies when I was younger, and it will always have a special place in my heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressive low budget horror flick dulled down by thin plot,"Although at times it's often over-the-top nature and peculiar storyline can be generally amusing, Evil Dead suffers most from dragging out its plot till it wears thin, and becomes dull in the process. All the performances in the film, besides that of Bruce Campbell, vary on being generally okay to mildly cheesey. Bruce Campbell doesn't get his time to shine in the film in comparison to the others in the franchise, but his performance is well done, as he clearly shows the most emotion and does it the most well throughout the course of the film. At times, the action and gore is certainly over the top, but the thrills can be particularly interesting to watch, especially on how far the scene is willing to go to illustrate a point. However, this can also be its most fatal flaw, as the film at time becomes rather frustrating, trying to span out the time in the film with the events in order to make a proper time cut. In the end, the film seems too long, even though its runtime is less than 90 minutes. It's a shame because of the pacing, and its campy nature doesn't seem appreciative enough to capture my attention, to what it could have been if it were shorter, or more likely, had more going on. In the end, The Evil Dead is a horror classic that has not aged well for the modern viewer. It can be amusing at times, but fails to deliver on all accounts, and seems more like an interesting idea dragged out, than a complete film itself. It can be impressive for its low budget, but in the end, doesn't have enough material to truly capture the eye of those watching. Its ending however, does leave more room for hope though, and will hopefully lead to improve on the sequels to come.

Not worth the time.,"This film seems like an exercise in moviemaking that did not pass the test of time. As there is a new release in the franchise, I decided to get to know the origins first and now I dont know if it is worth to follow up. Some parts are too slow, but mainly most parts are too fast. The film is neither scary not funny - it is judt groteque, and while this is a niche it does not fit in. There aint much of storybuilding and the premise seems paper-thin.The elements surrounding the movie like the small number of actirs and a limited location are fine for any horror movie, but in this case I feel that something is lacking.The main character seems to be ehthusiastic enough to carry the franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The attempt at film noir in some shots was just awful. The screaming was far too long,loud,ill placed and headache provoking. The over all lame attempt at continuity was boring. Some of the attempts to shock and scare were mildly comical but half hearted at that.My suggestion is to avoid this waste of time.",,Anonymous,Horror

EVIL DEAD (DIDIER BECU),"""Evil Dead"" will be known for its classic merits in the horrorgenre and it might be one of the pioneermovies in the slash and splattergenre but this doesn't take away the fact that this movie is hopelessly dated.

Ash is a hell of a character!,"There were some things in the movie that would not disturb a real horror movie fan -like me.

He also cares about his friends and only about saving himself. He is bold and straight,full of hope and ready to fight. He is a kind of a hero.These characteristics of Ash are those who make this movie a horror classic.

Sam Raimi's deal with The Devil.,"Did Sam Raimi sold his soul in order to have a successful b-horror movie? Did The Devil asked for recognition and display of his power in order to give Raimi the winning formula?The ""Evil Dead"" is not an easy watch. The movie starts like a standard early 80's slasher flick but after half an hour of it's running time it turns into a bizarre gore-fest.Five friends (minimal stereotypes) rent a cheap cabin in the woods for some fun but suddenly, one by one they get possessed by an ancient evil spirit that rests in the woods. The plot sounds typical for the 80's horror but believe me, it's something you haven't seen! This movie is recognized internationally. I'm sure that the movie has been translated in many languages. Everyone knows about it. In my country, Mèxico, the title translation is ""The Devil's Awaken"" or something like that. This is now more than an obscure cult classic, it's THE EVIL DEAD.Adding the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) into an early 80's slasher flick sounds a little pretentious but it isn't. It worked perfectly.The idea was totally asked for. The whole demon possession is believable because of the Necronomicon idea. In my opinion, since the brilliant ""Exorcist"" (the first big budget movie about demon possession), none other movie has had the adequate treatment of the topic like ""The Evil Dead"". People that know a little of demon possession, evil incantations, treats with the devil (or selling your soul to him), and these kind of topics related to the occultism can tell that ""The Evil Dead"" is a movie that knows exactly what it's showing. The make-up (somehow related to ""The Exorcist"") is excellent. Descriptions about possessed people actually match with the characterization used in the movie. The voices, the wicked laughs, the goofy evil spirits, the supernatural physical strenght, and the behavior that the movie shows is a display of what happens in real life cases. I wonder if Raimi was into Satanic stuff...Anyways, the weirdness of the situations combined with lots of gore makes this a unique cinematic experience. There are elements of horror from the 70's and the basic elements of the 80's all mixed up with Raimi's horror point of view. The black humor is present indirectly mainly because of the grotesque images that not everybody's imagination could craft. Still, there's nothing to laugh about if you're a die hard horror fan. If you want to laugh and watch an extremely gory film them watch the sequel to ""The Evil Dead"".Bruce Campbell delivers a terrific performance under situations that you can't imagine. His face expressions, his yelling, and the torment expressed on his eyes, are the elements that make an unforgotten performance. The rest of the actors deliver a decent performance mainly because their acting skills were not needed at all.The scare factor is ALWAYS present through the movie and that's why it's difficult to label this as a straight horror movie or as a cheesy slasher flick. The tension is present in every scene and the usual but effective scenes that make you ""jump out of your seat"" work pretty good. The truth is that the movie works in EVERY field that the horror genre can offer. There's gore in huge amounts, there's tension, suspense, and the feeling of horror that not much films can offer.""The Evil Dead"" contributed with several scenes to the genre and nowadays are labeled as infamous. For example, the pencil stabbed in the ankle, the demon in the cellar, the demons mocking, the possessed people, and the creepy but effective ""join us"" voices. The possessed Linda still gives me the creeps. Because of these elements and more , ""The Evil Dead"" is a cult classic and an important and basic movie in the genre. I wouldn't match this movie with ""The Exorcist"" but I would match it in a special category, the ""Evil Dead"" category. The trilogy (1, 2, and Army of Darkness) is a key franchise in the genre and will always be a reference for ANY horror producer. This franchise stands alone and deserves a lot of respect for it's contributions to the genre and to the industry! The Devil hasn't been very accepted in the genre but this time he looks ""cool"".Anyone that has watched the movie MUST have an opinion about it; you either love it or hate it but if you're into the genre you will certainly have an objective review about it. I love this movie for what it is and I can say it changed my life and my point of view towards horror movies.You need to watch the movie at least 2 times to understand and live to it's full this gory experience. It's a horror movie you will never forget and believe me, it will stay with you for a long, long time. The demonic images, sounds, violent images, and of course, Bruce Campbell will hunt you until you become a die hard fan of the movie. This is a fantastic horror movie with fantasy elements, disturbing elements, and the occasional correct use of gore. What else can you ask for?!Watch it for a good scare and you will get MORE than you expect. Probably the best horror from the 80's, no kidding.

The effects were phony and so was some of the cheesy dialogue but other than that, the movie was extremely entertaining!

Books can kill.,"The Evil Dead. Books can kill. A cult horror film that impresses with its cruelty and unique atmosphere. Director Sam Raimi creates a stunning combination of horror, dark humor and madness. The film tells the story of a group of young people who find themselves in an old abandoned house, where they encounter demons and sinister forces. Violent visuals and unpredictable plot twists create constant tension. Bruce Campbell's excellent performance as Ash Williams gives the film a special flavor. While some viewers may find the film to have dated special effects, The Evil Dead is still a powerful force in the horror genre and an inspiration for many films to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
horror gold,"What can I say? EVIL DEAD was a horror masterpiece. First of all the story is brilliant,long dead demon ghosts possess college kids in a creepy forest, you can tell it's going to be good.But even better the director keeps you interested by using strange camera angles and using so many twists you cant even begin to expect the most cliché scenes in films.The makeup was, for the most part believable,and the cast was great ,especially Bruce ,using facial expressions and making the scene believable,and the eeriness of the movie gets you straight from the beginning. All in all if you like horror, WATCH THIS MOVIE!\best movie ever",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
just watched this again after 31 years,"When I was 14 / 15 myself and two school friends used to go to our local cinema in Glasgow for the Wednesday night skuddie / horror double-bill. Allow me to clarify. The opening / supporting film would usually be a soft porn flick, and the main feature would be the latest horror. The man on the door would enquire re our age, to which we would reply ""18, mate"" - and that was us in.We had an arrangement that we would each bring something to the party. And so it was that cans of lager, cigars and so on, were transported from our homes to the picture-house in large coats.If I shouldn't move from here, I can remember - with one of my old Granda's cigars in one hand and a can of lager in the other - saying to my pals, as we settled down for The Evil Dead, how I was sick and tired of being disappointed by these would-be scary films about young Americans getting murdered on rural holidays. Not this one, one of my mates assured me. He'd seen the clips, and they were enough to convince him that this film would be different. And he was right.All the knock knock knockin on horror's door stuff was familiar enough, but once it all kicked off, it was a relentless, concentrated gorefest. There is no doubt that I had never been so captivated by a horror film in my life. For once, I had got what I paid for, and was thoroughly entertained.So, how did it look tonight, all these years on? Might sound daft, but I think that one of the things that 'dates' early 80's horrors (and Sci-Fi's) is the electro-drone music. But, I enjoyed the sfx - very European, with touches of The Thing near the end. Has there been a better horror film than this made since? I think that The Omen is a better horror than this - but it's older, and very different. And I would say the same of a number of other films. However, I cannot think of a younger horror film that is a better horror film than this. Then again, as you'll have worked out for yourself, it's all changed since my day - all of this was just fields, you know.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Bound In Human Flesh And Inked In Blood....""","It's been one of my favorite horror films since the first time I saw it, when I was too young to know what I was getting into. Sam Raimi ain't the best director in the world, but he did invent the Raimi-Rush here, a technique which no one besides him ...(read more)has ever really used to as great effect.Anyway, this is Bruce Campbell, in a small shack in the woods, with a few friends who accidentally summon the demon spirits of the woods, and are one by one possessed and transformed.There's severed human hands crawling of their own accords, a woman raped by a forest, and more blood, gore, and hilarity intentional or not, than you will find in the thousands of films which imitate this one. A horror classic, that's more inventive and raucous than scary. Also the beginning of a trilogy in the saga of Bruce Campbell's Ash character in the horror slapstick ""Evil Dead 2"", and the full on epic mid-evil parody of ""Army Of Darkness"" both fun films, too but it all starts here. And it was never truly as good. ""We can't bury Linda...she's our friend!""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favourite Video Nasty,"Two guys and three girls go for a short break at a cabin in the woods, only to release an ancient evil. Demonic possession and death soon follows.
I can remember The Evil Dead being banned as a Video Nasty back in the 1980's but thankfully a friend of mine had it on tape. We would often sit and watch it whilst indulging in some under age drinking. Very happy memories! Thankfully we live in more enlightened times and the film has been available uncut since 2001
This in my opinion is a low budget masterpiece, quite probably my favourite horror movies of the decade, and that's quite a statement! The pace is fast, the acting good. The film is scary, atmospheric, violent and very gory but there is also a degree of humour. I loved the Hills Have Eyes poster hanging in the basement. I have lost count of how many times I have seen it but it's one of those movies that I never tire of, absolutely love it. Personally I think it's better than part 2, and far, far better than 3. Raimi and Campbell's best film,the best film on the Video Nasties list and one of my favourite horror movies of all time.

A horror classic,"The original evil dead is an instant classic. Made by young people, it manages to be better that most horror movies today by it's low budget, gore, scary-a$$ scenes, female deadites saying: ''we're gonna get you...'' and great acting and characters makes this a perfect movie to watch on a rainy day. I watched this movie and it was amazing. I really don't know how the heck are the effects made for this movie but I'm not complaining.

One of the greatest horror movies ever made!,"Became famous for being one of many films in the video nasty list in the UK during the 80s. If that didn't happen, it will probably be forgotten. Bruce Campbell as his best known role as Ash who has to protect himself from his friends who gets processed by the evil dead. Sam Raimi was 19 when he directed this, he made short films before including Within The Woods which was the short film which got him where he is now. (It is available to watch on Youtube but very bad condition.) It has all the elements of a classic horror movie including creepy music and atmopshere. If you liked The Evil Dead, you'll like Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness (even though it's more on the comedy side.) If you liked these films, I recommend, the Re-Animator films, My Name Is Bruce, Bubba Ho Tep, Braindead, Bad Taste, Dawn Of The Dead, Jack Brooks Monster Slayer and Day Of The Dead.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Low Budget Masterpiece,"This film I have an interesting past with. I saw Army of Darkness first, then had my mother pick up Evil Dead 2 before finally seeing this one. I don't think my video store had this so we bought it on VHS as the reason why. It is an interesting way to watch it as both sequels are more comedic where this is more of the horror. I've seen this quite a few times now, with the last time being in the theater and my 4K Blu-ray with my wife Jaime. She had never seen this one.Synopsis: five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.We start with a group of friends in a car going to a cabin that is in the middle of the woods. The man driving is Scott (Richard DeManincor) with his girlfriend sitting next to him, Shelly (Theresa Tilly). He is a bit of a jerk and likes to play jokes on those around him, some of which are not that funny. In the back is Ashley J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) with his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker). Ash's sister is also along Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss).Odd things happen from the beginning. The wheel to the car locks and it is aimed right for a truck that is coming. It rips out of Scott's hands. He blames Ash for it happening, but he tells Scott that he just took it in for a tune-up. They go over an old bridge and along a narrow path to the cabin. There is a porch swing that is hitting the shuttered window until Scott takes the key down from the door frame. It stops moving by itself.They unpack and settle in. Cheryl likes to draw and is doing one of a clock. Something calls to her to join them from the woods and then her hand is taken over by an unseen force. It makes her draw a rough looking book with a face. They then have dinner when the door to the cellar flings open. They all investigate with Scott going to see what caused it.Ash calls out to him, but there's no respond. He then takes a lantern to go find out what is happening. The cellar is dark, damp and weird things are hanging from the ceiling. There's a backroom with a bunch of odd things. They find a table with a shotgun, shells, a book that has a face and looks odd as well as an old tape recorder along with a long dagger with skeletons on it.This stuff is brought upstairs and they listen to the tape. The voice is a professor who found this text while doing a dig and has come here with his wife to translate it. The book is the Book of the Dead. It is bound with human flesh and inked in human blood. It contains ways to summon demons and things to this nature. The tape upsets Cheryl and she shuts it off. Scott wants to hear more so he fast forwards it and plays it again. He ends up to a point where the voice is saying an incantation. We then see something wakes up in the woods. Cheryl screams to shut it off and a tree crashes through the window.It becomes a nightmare as they try to survive the night. Whatever they did woke up an ancient evil that is coming for them, one by one.That should be enough of a recap as I'm assuming most everyone that is reading this has seen this one. It is a classic in the genre and pretty much created the 'cabin in the woods' subgenre. Since I've already given my history with this movie, I'll get into this. This is more horror than the others in the series and even though I know what's going to happen, it still creeps me out. What is insane though is how low of a budget that writer/director Sam Raimi had to work with. They went far with what they had to bring this all to life for sure.I should also state that some of the movies that terrify me the most are possession films. I might not be able to necessarily stop a killer, but I have a fighting chance. When it comes to films with demons like this, I wouldn't know what to do and would probably either die or become possessed before I could. This also does bring a bit of issue I have here. Not enough to affect my rating, but my problem is that there doesn't really seem to be a rhyme or reason for who becomes possessed. Cheryl gets attacked and I understand her fate. Same thing for Linda and Shelly, but Ash is attacked in similar ways and he seems to be able to resist. It doesn't get explained either. I have a slight issue when my director doesn't know and that's what it feels like.Then to get back to a positive, I love this idea of the Book of the Dead. They don't use the name Necronomicon yet, but that's what it ends up becoming. I like the concept of this book that contains ways to bring these demons to life. It is spooky that they're just living around us, not bothering us and they seem to be upset when their slumber is disturbed. Or they just need the door open to get into our world. I also like that after what the professor did, they're subtly roaming the woods and messing with these people. I do want to know if the incantation needs to be read every night to attack or what. That's something else that is not fully explained either. My interpretation is that the professor gave them power and then they've become weak again until it is replayed, making this group a target. I don't need this fully explained, but it is something that I noticed.To move away from the story and premise, the pacing of this is good as well. It doesn't take long for creepy things to happen and we get to meet the characters around it. This is interesting as well, because we get to know them through seeing fear of what is going on. With a runtime of 85 minutes, it doesn't outstay its welcome and the horrific elements are evenly paced throughout. As I said, it never gets boring either and I like how this all ends.That brings me to the acting. I will admit, it is quite amateur and I must commend them for going out to do what they did here. Campbell isn't the Ash that we know and love yet, but you get glimpses. You can also see that he would go on to do great things as well. I like him here as our lead. Sandweiss was fine. She's a bit hysterical, but I almost think that is due to her being more in tune with the supernatural without realizing it. She is also easy to isolate. DeManincor is a jerk and I think he does well. He got a reaction out of me, so I give credit there. Baker and Tilly are both fine. I did find Baker to be attractive. Everyone also does good when they're possessed. It is so creepy if I'm going to be honest.That will take me to the effects, which for the budget look good. They were all done practically. Some of them were clever and still gross me out. The blood we get looks good and I like that the possessed people have almost black blood. I think this is an interesting choice to differentiate. There is a bit of an issue that the blood and gore on characters isn't also consistent, but that's fine. There's a lot to keep stretch and someone who has done script supervising, that can be tough. The cinematography is good. Watching in 4K is interesting though since it showcases the budget. Regardless, Raimi can shoot the heck out of a movie and has an eye for it.Before I end this, I did want to bring up something dealing with if this is Lovecraftian or not. From what I know from someone I look at as an expert here, Brian, this has elements, but doesn't fall into that. We are getting the cosmic horror aspect with the use of the Necronomicon, which Lovecraft introduced. We are also dealing with beings that are older than religion with these demons. This is more of a possession movie that is using elements for sure.In conclusion, this has a lot of nostalgia for me. I can recognize that this low budget effort has flaws, but I'm going to overlook them. They don't affect anything so there's that. The demons here are creepy and even after knowing how things play out due to multiple viewings, it still works. I like the Book of the Dead that is used here. There are inconsistent story elements. The effects looked good and the pacing is effective to a solid ending. This is a classic and I believe this to be a great movie.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cabin In The Woods,"The premise is simple. Five generic college students arrive at an inconspicuous cabin in the woods for a few days of vacation. Unbeknownst to them, the cabin and the surrounding woods are home to evil beings that are dormant ... that is, until the kids find an old book and tape recorder filled with zombie gibberish. The story is set mostly during one night. Dense fog obscures one's vision outside the cabin.The first-half plot isn't bad. The camera takes the POV of unseen entities, darting here and there. And the kids spend a lot of time exploring the cabin and its cellar, waiting and listening, as eerie sounds put them on guard that something isn't quite right. The music, too, adds to the sinister atmosphere.But if the first half conveys a pleasantly spooky atmosphere because of what we do not see, the second half's plot plummets to stupidity because of what we do see. No longer hidden, the evil makes itself visible, in the form of nightmarish images and gratuitous gore. The film thus loses its suspense and mystery.The second-half plot trends repetitive as the same fate befalls one kid after another. And the gore continues to escalate. Nearing the film's merciful end, I started getting a headache, as the gore got progressively more annoying.The film has no thematic depth. And since the underlying premise presumes a supernatural explanation, we can't apply logic to any story element. Acting is largely irrelevant. The credibility of the film thus lies mostly in sound effects and special effects, which are nicely crafted but over-used. I would have enjoyed the film more if the zombies, or whatever they're called, had been less visible and if the gore factor had been hugely reduced.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not the funniest movie ever, right, but, as i said before, some mad scenes, by the extreme of the thing itself, can make you kind of laugh.

I understand why people loved this film but...,"The Evil Dead is a cult classic horror film and I was excited to see this because I've always been so interested in it. So, I watched it and it was rather disappointing - and maybe because there was so much hype and I had high expectations.I can't lie and say this movie is a masterpiece. It's not - but I can say it's a cornerstone of the horror genre and it is definitely ambitious. It's not ashamed of being that ambitious despite not having the highest budget or levels of technology. I applaud Sam Raimi for this project - you can tell he knew what he wanted to do and wasn't afraid to show the world what he had in store despite these shortcomings. That, I can respect and admire.Yes, at the time, it was probably incredibly inventive and terrifying. The audience in the 80's probably saw this film the same way I saw the remake (Evil Dead, 2013) which I thought was on par (in terms of ratings) with this movie but that's only because the remake nailed the gore aspect... take away that gore, and the remake is powerless, generic and just a recycled horror film.I must say the first leg of the movie had me at the edge - they executed that very well and it was promising. But, moving along with the story, I found it comical and I just COULDN'T help but laugh at how comical some of the scenes were (it maybe goes to show how desensitized I am to horror flicks and how far technology has advanced) and how tediously annoying the ""evil"" laughing was.Overall, this movie isn't all that bad - it was inventive at its time and has eventually inspired many horror films but... I'm more indifferent towards it than liking or hating it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Spooky, Funny and Unsettling - Evil Dead Remains Vastly Superior to its 'Sell-out' Sequel","Jump sequences have been quite successful in evoking fright; add to that a claustrophobic cabin and remove any sort of background music and what you get is tense gripping horror. This element was entirely missing in the sequel of Evil Dead, which I had the displeasure of watching about a year ago. Evil Dead however retains segments of horror while also providing enough laughs, and thus remains more exciting, more interesting and more original than its sequel.The plot of Evil Dead is not very new: Ash, his sister Cheryl, his girlfriend Linda, his best pal Scott and Scott's girlfriend Shelly decide to stay the night at a lonely deserted cabin in the woods. In the first scene itself, as they are traveling in a cramped car to their destination, they encounter this mysterious force (although they do not understand what actually happens) as their car steering wheel loses control momentarily. As they cross the rickety bridge to the cabin, a plank of wood gives away under the car's weight but they somehow cross the bridge and drive to the cabin.Over there, the mysterious thing's presence is felt again as a swing outside the main door keeps striking the house until Scott opens the door. At night, Cheryl is the first unfortunate to be directly targeted by the force as it takes control of her hand while she is drawing. Later, at dinner, the moment Scott says 'party down!' the basement door opens on its own. In a funny Scooby Doo like sequence, the camera pans at each one's faces as they speak their thoughts about the incident. Scott first enters the basement with Ash following and the pair come out with a book on the dead and a tape recorder. The tape, recorded in the past by a doctor, is played and the evil spirits are beckoned. After Cheryl is raped by the forest, she demands Ash to take her out of town but the pair realizes the group's fate is doomed when they see the bridge destroyed. One by one, Cheryl and the others are possessed and it is up to Ash to do something before it is too late.The low level canting shots in Evil Dead, which were shot without using dollies (the crew couldn't afford it) made me uneasy and I was reminded of similar shots in Blair Witch Project; its marvelous how these raw effects could evoke fear while many of the sophisticated effects in recent movies cannot. Another interesting element is Raimi's focus on the eyes: when the pendulum stops suddenly, a close up shot of Cheryl's frightened eyes are seen. A much better example is when Ash keeps a box on his lap and feigns to sleep while Linda tries to look at the contents. The camera focuses on their eyes as they play this little game of theirs. Later, when Ash is about to bury a possessed Linda, she pretends to sleep and the camera again focuses on their eyes, thus depicting the irony and difference in the situation.The gore in the film is plenteous, but it isn't very disturbing as most of the blood comes from the zombies. However, there is the tree rape scene that is much more uncomfortable since Cheryl isn't in a possessed state. This reminds me of another scene in the movie: just when Ash contemplates striking a possessed Linda, she turns normal for a few minutes and begs Ash to protect her from 'them'. This was when I realized how my perception regarding the gory content changed when the characters transformed; it would have been much more disturbing to see a normal Linda being hacked to death.Bruce Campbell, the supporting cast and the 'fake shemps' deliver great performances for a horror movie. Some of the dialogs are very funny and very cheesy, with Linda getting some of the worst and most vapid lines in the film. The thing I did not understand about Evil Dead is how the entire 'monster mechanism' worked – while it seemed at times that the evil force could not enter the 'cabin' (Ash closes the doors and locks the force outside), Linda gets possessed all of a sudden even though Cheryl only stabs her with an object and doesn't bite her.I saw Evil Dead twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both the times. While its sequel sells out for popcorn fun, Evil Dead remains spooky, funny, unsettling and the superior one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Thank you, Sam Raimi!","Well, it's finally time to review The Evil Dead (1981) and this movie was awesome. While watching this movie, I was sitting there and thinking to myself how the same man who directed the original Spider-Man Trilogy got his career started with this movie and franchise.Positives for The Evil Dead (1981):
This movie was absolutely insane from start to finish. I'm genuinely impressed with how this movie was able to succeed with such a small budget. The Deadites in this movie are terrifying in every way possible from their makeup effects and the laugh that they used. The blood and gore in this movie is extremely shlocky and over the top. I also really enjoy the setting of this first movie and I liked that it was executed in a very simple way. And finally, I love how this one movie launched the careers of both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.Mixed for The Evil Dead (1981):
The characters in this movie are not very interesting at all and yes this is even including Ash Williams. Now I will say that Bruce Campbell does a great job at playing the generic final guy in this movie, but for anyone who is expecting the iconic character that we all know and love from this franchise, then you're all going to be very disappointed.Overall, The Evil Dead (1981) is truly terrifying experience especially coming from a first-time director and it launched one of the great horror franchises in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

OK... here it goes: i think it's one of the most ridiculous and at the same time cool movies i'v seen!!! i laughed so much that i have trouble on just describing as a terror movie, more as a dark-gore comedy!!! u can c it's 80's without any doubts... plenty of goofs all over the movie, bad script (at least for the demons development and appearance) and weird weird blood ""ejaculations""!!! it's not scary at all and u can undoubtedely watch it with ur girlf if she has a dark sense of humour!!! just don't offer such a bad taste necklace!!! haha, that's pure evil!!! :P anyway, the movie follows a nice line and the effects are quite original and good for the year it was shot... a great scene that i'll always remember is the originality in the last scenes when the main actor goes to the basement... oh man... blood filling light bulbs and coming out of the pipes!!! hell yeah, pure evil!!! and the guy being illuminated by the projector and all the blood running down the wall behind him... beautiful beautiful beautiful!!! i'm really pleased with this low budget film, it's pure entertainment!!! and check well the last demons death, it's pure gore on its best form!!! and as always, zombies have more than 1colour of blood!!! ahah, actually these are 3-blood-coloured-like-zombies!!! and i like specially the blood part in the end when the book burns!!! oh man, run and watch it, it's so damn funny!!! gets a 7 for a good Sunday's night entertainment!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun funny well made old-school horror movie.,"This movie is one of my all time favorite horror films. Very cheesy, but in a cood way. It goes along with the low budget campy vibe of the film. It had a somewhat simple but good story. Teens go to cabin. Teens awaken dead. Teen have to fight off the dead. Its filled with some very ridiculous and funny scenes. The gore is not frequent, but when it hits it's in your face and over the top which makes its impact even better. It's one of those movies you watch to have fun, and it's a really fun movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy,"I bought the uncut version of The Evil Dead on DVD two years ago, The Anchor bay version, What an ace movie this is!Sam Raimi who directed this fine crafted movie made a big name for himself in the horror world when he followed The Evil Dead up with a bigger budget Dead by dawn sequel and the later Med-evil dead, Which i still laugh at today.I own all three movies on special edition DVDs. The Med-evil dead is my favorite (if you watch when Bruce Campbell is being chased through the woods before the windmill, You will see three trees split open. The last tree to split open has the face of a demon on the inside side of the tree!)But at its time The Evil Dead was ground breaking stuff on a shoe string budget.The movie was originally completed in 1980 but was not released until 1983 as the movie ran over budget and could not be completed. But determination prevailed and Mr. Raimi became a cult horror name!My verdict 8/10 Highly Recommended if you have never seen a splatter movie before.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Evil Dead,"The Evil Dead is one of the most imaginative and fun horror movies ever made. You can really tell that Sam Raimi and co. had a blast making this movie as the enthusiasm (along with the blood) pretty much drips down the screen. Hearing all the wild stories about the film's production is as fun and interesting as watching the movie itself. This movie introduced Bruce Campbell and his ""Ash"" character to the world and pop culture would never be the same again. Bruce is probably the best actor out of the bunch, but that really doesn't say much since the acting is pretty much atrocious. The wild and inventive camera-work and editing make up for it though. The special effects hold up surprisingly well and the filmmakers get extra points from me for creativity. No CGI here folks, this is down and dirty film-making at its best. Probably my personal favorite horror movie of all time this movie has an essential ingredient that most of today's mundane horror movies are missing,.............style.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Splatter Film,"I bought this movie recently under the mistaken assumption that it was a zombie film. At least that's what a zombie site on the internet said. Needless to say, this is NOT a film about zombies. At least it's not about zombies in the traditional sense. It's more about demonic possession. Regardless, this is a great low-budget film for those who enjoy the splatter film genre. Gore hounds will simply love it. Horror fans might like it too depending on which style of horror they prefer. But this isn't Hitchcock or even Stephen King for that matter. Like I said, it's a splatter film and because of that it revels in graphic special effects and violence. Now, some of the special effects are very good. Unfortunately, some of them are downright silly and (in my opinion) lowers the film's value. Likewise, the acting is essentially non-existent. But that's not through any fault of the actors necessarily. The fact is that there simply wasn't any room for acting or much dialogue due to the huge amount of brutal action and special effects. And while I recognized Bruce Campbell, the rest of the actors were completely unknown to me. Not that it really mattered of course as nobody was going to win an Academy Award for their roles in this movie anyway. It did however manage to win a Saturn Award for ""Best Low-Budget Film"" and that is certainly quite an achievement. Even so, the fact that it is a low-budget film doesn't necessarily mean that everybody should overlook the obvious faults and pretend they don't exist. Things like dialogue, plot and character development are important and shouldn't be dismissed because the special effects are so plentiful or gory. After all, it doesn't cost much money to write a script. It also doesn't require much imagination to improve on a plot that consists simply of 5 young adults going to a cabin and (all but one) getting chopped up in graphic detail. For that reason, I thought this movie could have been better. But that is just my opinion. One thing I do know though is that this movie isn't for the squeamish or the faint-of-heart. But it is sure to satisfy a certain niche who loves this type of film. And that's perfectly fine.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Soon all of you will be like me... And then who will lock you up in a cellar?""","With my revisit of this film imminent, I chose to watch it again yesterday night, and wow. I mean, I got the opportunity to see this as a movie experience in October 2023 as a back-to-back secret screening at Cineworld; this was the first, and the next was The Shining. Don't get me wrong, I truly liked this film when I saw it that night, but I believe my perspective and sentiments for it were dampened the follow up viewing was The Shining. So let's give this film some justice.The Evil Dead is a stunning blend of flawless sound design, superb camera views, and realistic effects that will make your stomach turn. This is a very well-made film that combines all the right elements to create a good, functional horror film that is sure to scare fans.Released in the early 80s, this movie must have been very scary for viewers at the time, because they weren't as desensitized to things as we are today. Many people think this is a ""low budget"" movie, but I don't see it that way. According to Google, the film cost about $375,000 to make; at the time, in the 80s, I considered this to be quite a budget and well spent if I might add. Even in 2024, some of the practical effects hold up very well and do a great job of selling the film's sinister tone. The camera work is very creative and throughout the film it switches beautifully between first person, wide shots and close ups. I believe this is some of my favorite camera work to date. The plot (which wasn't an overused concept at the time as far as I know) seems to be heavily influenced by a low budget 1970 film called Equinox. I always thought the ""cabin in the woods"" concept came from Sam Raimi, but then again, it was a pretty ""new"" idea at the time and has been repeated in every horror film since.One thing I remember clearly when I saw it in theaters was my friend hating the acting. Understandable but a lot of classic horror films don't have the best acting. The way I saw the acting was in a comedic tone and I found it brought light to the film, made me smile throughout and gave me a mixed emotional experience. The acting was the only thing you could pick out of this film and that says a lot about the quality of the film.Ultimately, Sam Raimi created one of the most influential horror films of all time and a staple in the film community, and in turn creating one of my all time favorite trilogies. Bravo.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
EQUINOX redux...,"EQUINOX (1971) is a creepy, almost documentary-like low budget fright film that begins with four college kids going out into the mountains for a picnic. They stumble across an imploded cabin (the home of a professor, played by the late fantasist Fritz Leiber) and find a book whose pages are made of human skin. If our intrepid quartet can't keep the book from falling into the wrong hands, there'll be, well, Hell to pay...EQUINOX appears to have inspired Sam Raimi's fright-fest, THE EVIL DEAD: the parallels are, uh, Legion... But, whereas EQUINOX (available for years on video tape under the oddball title, THE BEAST) features towering, ape-like split-screen creatures, stop-motion animation, and forced perspective shots of ancient castles and the like, THE EVIL DEAD relies primarily on some extremely effective makeup fx. THE EVIL DEAD is intense, and there certainly are some shocking scenes, but the series began to slide into self-parody with the second installment (which I liked, nonetheless), and finally into outright cornball slapstick humor of the Three Stooges variety. It's a shame Raimi didn't stay the course: there are few enough ""legit"" fright films as it is; by opting for the dim-witted kiddie crowd, Raimi denies us a series that might well have rivalled George Romero's Living Dead trilogy in terms of sheer terror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror films ever,"Very few films can mix humor and horror like The Evil Dead. The film is about a group of teenagers who are going to a cabin out in the middle of nowhere. While there, they find a book called the book of the dead, one of them recites the words and in doing so, releases unleashes a bunch of demons. The acting is top notch from everyone, along with the creepy as hell demon voices that are guaranteed to give you the creeps and the sound of the winds increasing outside, it wins in the auditory department. This film is gory. Yes I've seen hundreds of not thousands of films and this is the only film that the gore looked so real and disgusting, I actually threw up. There is no horror film out there right now that can match this film in terms of violence, between demons getting their heads cut off and buckets of blood (literally), I recommend that you bring a barf bag. Another thing is that this is the scariest film I have ever seen, even more so than The Exorcist. The way this film builds up suspense and tension is unrivaled in any film in any category, not just horror, and the best part: most of the scares aren't jump scares! It is also unrivaled in the humor department, heads are getting cut off and yet it is intentionally funny, the sort of humor that you'll find in Zombieland and Shaun Of The Dead (Though this film came before both). Add all this, plus the most creative camerwork in the industry and you've got the formula for one badass film. If you like movies of any sort, go check this out. And even if you don't like movies (I've never met anyone like that though) you should still go out and buy this movie. The Evil Dead is a masterpiece, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fair...Not My Cup of Tea,"I cannot add anything new to the critique of this film.  I can praise the inventive camera work by Sam Raimi.  It is outstanding.  I can commend the production for its ability to use what little financial resources were available to their fullest.  The film is effective in that it does create some good, honest scares.  It utilizes some interesting special effects hitherto not seen in film.  Bruce Campbell is very good in his role, and the other actors are not too terrible till make-up gets hold of them.  Some of the night sequences are very chilling and atmospheric as well.  But(and you probably knew this was coming)the film is wildly overrated as some kind of cinematic masterpiece.  It is NO masterpiece.  It is your basic take some teenagers out into the woods, let them play with black magic, and finally kill them off in crude ways.  This is one gory, unrealistic film.  That's fine if that is what you like.  But I found myself yawning in some stretches through the repeated, pointless, senseless, brutal gore.  And let's talk logic...at one point one demon-faced girl is knocking wildly on the door to get to Mr. Campbell...while only several feet down is a window that had its glass smashed in.  She got something against windows?  Evil Dead is not a bad picture.  For its type, it is very good, but when you get right down to it...it's not my cup of tea to see so much violence with almost no exposition.  I need a story with a little meat, not a lot of butchered meat and little story.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sam's directing is top notch, and more involving and fun than his directing in Spider-Man. The script is a bit cheesy but if someone can kick back and have fun with the movie, they'll enjoy it much more.

Horror classic,"Sam Raimi's hyperactive, crazed The Evil Dead is a benchmark zombie flick, a milestone in the realm of practical effects, and just a bloody damn good time at the movies. And I do mean bloody, as gallons upon gallons of blood, puss, and all manner of other goo are spilt, and slabs of latex gore are flung around for nearly the entire hour and a half running time. Now iconic Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a hardware store clerk on a remote getaway with a few friends at a cabin in the woods. Upon entering the dilapidated base,sent, they find a seriously no touchy looking book, which of course they open anyway, reading some of the strange words within. The book is the Necronimicon, containing ancient incantations which bring the forces of evil to wild, screaming, laughing, projectile vomiting life. No sooner have they spoken the words, something makes its way from the woods to haunt them relentlessly. The POV shots of a fast moving 'something' tearing it's way across the underbrush towards the cabin are now iconic as well, and a telling sign of the delirious horrors to come. Corpses start to come back to life, and really mean that. These aren't shambling, sluggish undead, or rage virus fast ones either. They're the film's own brand of demented zombies, spastic lunatics that howl, cackle, speak in tongues, spew bile everywhere, cavort around like chickens with their heads cut off (which happens) and generally liven up the movie with their nonsensical antics. Oh yeah, and there's a scene where a girl gets rated by a gropy tree (!). It's all filmed in a hazy, jagged manner, unpolished and sketchy as hell, making us feel like this really is happening in so,e weird corn of the woods to these hapless people. Ash doesn't get his classic chainsaw hand or shotgun in this one, you'll have to wait for the sequel for that, which is just as awesome and amazing as this, but slightly more expensive looking. This is the ultimate cabin in the woods movie, a nerve shattering exercise in go for broke, kamikaze horror that doesn't let you catch your breath for a single second, either from screaming, laughing, or screaming with laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Gorefest with Imagination,"This film is about evil spirits taking over peoples' bodies and turning them into bloodthirsty zombie-like killers. I decided to see this film because I enjoyed director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. I thought that this would just be some gore fest but judging from most of the positive reviews it got, I became sure that it was going to have some good in it. I was entertained from start to finish.The first thing I would say is Sam Raimi definitely has some talent. He takes his films very seriously and works very hard for them. this film shows that he can do gory horror films as well as spectacular superhero films.Its not just gore you get out of this horror film. It is also very chilling. The demons look extremely scary. Also the moving spirit is also quite creepy. Its mostly the way they move, look and talk. Their make-up was done extremely well.The acting was also very good. Bruce Campbell does the ""ash"" character very well. The other actors were good in this film as well. Unlike the sequels, there is no comic performances in this film. That in a way is a good thing but the sequels were still great entertaining movies.Overall The Evil Dead is a fun movie to watch.

So relentless it works...,"Sam Raimi, the same director who was given 139 million dollars to make ""Spiderman"" started off with 150,000 dollars to make ""The Evil Dead,"" which I personally like better. ""The Evil Dead"" is the first in the trilogy that features the misadventures of Ash, a gun- lugging, chainsaw-wielding, blood-secreting ""sole"" survivor of a night of mayhem and horror. Ash, being the main character, basically is faced with the decision throughout the entire movie to either kill his friends, or lock them up in the cellar. I personally enjoyed the film because of its relentless amount of gore. When's the last time you've seen a Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) lick its own face while a demon is hitting someone on the back with a fireplace poker.The basic plot revolves around a group of five friends who decide to travel to a supposedly remote cabin for a vacation or something.  But things go awry after... well it doesn't matter. A real basic summary of this movie would be: teens get killed off and/or transformed one by one into zombies by the evil spirits inhabiting the surrounding woods.  Basic zombie/survival horror flick.  But this one stands out from the rest for some unidentifiable (to me) reason.  Maybe it's because it knows no bounds.So anyways, if you like NC-17-worthy gore, tree rape, and any way, shape, or form of dismemberment, then this is the movie for you.*Gore: 10/10*Suspense: 3/10*Overall: 6/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I believe that if anyone today tried to do a remake, it would even surpass the awful 'Psycho'-remake from 1998 on the list of pathetic movies.What makes Evil Dead one of the best horrorfilms ever, is the way it's presented. It has the same kind of feeling you get when you listen to the early 70's Black Sabbath. Very, very doomy and gloomy.I'm not a big fan of the ""Zombie"" genre.

'The Evil Dead',"Five friends go to a remote cabin and find themselves in the middle of a haunted forest surrounded by mysterious evil forces. Director Sam Raimi, operating on a super-low budget of approx. $300,000, makes a movie that is intense, gut-wrenching and, in a sense, innovative despite the familiar premise. Sure, one can admit that the acting and the gore can be a bit over-the-top.  Heck, even the special effects really pale in comparison to other films in the genre. But one can't deny the creativity that Raimi has put into his film.  This creative sense of the film more than makes up for its miniscule budget.

A first-rate shocker.,"I'm not a huge fan of messy horror flicks, but when I watched Sam Raimi's bloody thriller, ""The Evil Dead"".  I wondered if I was being too harsh on the film although I did like the sequel to ""Urban Legend"", Wes Craven's ""Scream"", and David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"".  The three films had one thing in common - they were very graphic.  The film takes place in the backwoods of Tennessee where a few Michigan State students drive up to a wooden cabin to spend a few days there.  Soon the students discover that they aren't alone when some demons called ""Shemps"" come after them.  The Shemps don't go down without a fight and take a severe beating (more severe than Stallone took in the ""Rocky"" films and Walken took in ""The Dogs of War"").  Although the violence is very graphic, I wasn't bothered by it and part of that comes from the excellent camera work.  The film made stars of director Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who plays the heroic Ash.  ""The Evil Dead"" is a first-rate shocker.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This isn't as funny or as cool as the 1987 remake/sequel but it has one truly defining moment that isn't in the second one. The tree rape scene. It's amusing, sick, offensive, and just downright nutty. Bruce campbell starts off as a much picked-upon Ash who when ever hit always seems to go flying into furniture.

Campiness and Horrifying,"A cult classic amongst Horror fans for many reasons! Evil Dead is a near perfect mix of campiness and disturbing horror.

The story seems organic and no one seems to disappear like in other movies to then reappear which is a massive positive to me as it is maintaining the world of which is being presented to me as a viewer.Where this movie lacks is the music and the foley used for the sound effects.

Aged like Milk!,"The movie was made in 1981. It may have been the best horror movie in 1999 but today in 2022 that is clearly no longer the case. The oddity of special effects, make-up effects by todays standards is well, outdated. Some key scenes(specially ones involving vegetation) do not look believable today. Since it looks so dated, it takes away the realism and at one point you might find yourself staring at the demon(and its makeup), than be afraid of it. This entire logic may well be applied to other hits from pre-CGI era movies such as Alien, Star Wars. But the thing is none of those movies required close-up shots in full light of the antagonists to instill fear, which this movie has to do as part of the plot.Save yourselves some time, and watch the 2013 version instead which is better executed and far scarier than the original.

"""Ever-present, ever-listening.""","Stephen King has called it ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror."" It certainly lives up to and exceeds that. The Evil Dead is one of the greatest and funniest horror pictures ever made and an inspiration to filmmakers everywhere. It's an undisputed classic. Shot in 1979, it's still just as effective today. The gallons of blood, the flying body parts, the evil laughter, it's all in good fun. And, yet, it's all horrific. The movie works so well largely because of four factors: the genius of Rob Tapert, the stylish direction of Sam Raimi, the crude make-up of Tom Sullivan, and the facial expressions of Bruce Campbell. Everything is forced to blend together seamlessly. It's all beautifully and brilliantly done. The Evil Dead is a cult favorite for a reason.

I was never the same again...,"I first seen this movie in 1983 very soon after if was first released on VHS.  At the time I was about 6 years old and I lived a 4 room shack out in the boonies.  This shack had no running water and the washroom was an outhouse, the shack itself consisted of a kitchen, family room and 2 bedrooms.  While I watched this movie I was horrified, but it was the long lasting effect that it had on me that was the worst.  I had nightmares for almost ten years, never being able to get the image of the deadite girl sitting on the floor, chanting ""We're going to get you"", out of my head.  I am 21 now and I still get scared watching Evil Dead to this day, and my fiancee refuses to watch it because she can't get to sleep that night if she does.

Good for what it's worth,"This movie is a very memorable horror which has stood the test of time. With a fascinating story, loveable characters, erie scenery and some pretty gnarly death scenes, Evil Dead is one of the very few films from my parents' childhood I've actually really enjoyed.The character of Ash Williams is a brilliantly written protagonist who effortlessly steals the limelight. His story is not only emotional, but it is badass and entertaining. The cabin scenery sets a sort of helpless mood with decayed furniture and dim depressing lighting (and that's a good thing in this case). The surrounding woodlands create the feeling of being lost and alone, further making you care about the characters. The Deadites (main villains) are horrific in appearance and have an unsettling joyous personality as they wreak hell upon the helpless characters.This movie, as well as its sequels, I'd highly recommend to any horror fan.

Greatest Possessed Soul Scene,"I'd taken my friend's advice to watch the film alone in the dark. I'm about to heave a relief as suddenly this scene occurs. The one with the woman sitting and laughing by the door. Not to mention that wiggle in the head, and the smile.In split second, the shuddering made me stone-tomb cold and dumbfounded. This, together with Megan's 360 head-roll in Exorcist, was one of the most dramatic possessed soul moment in films. I'd lost my bet with my pal (as I turned on the light immediately) and had to endure being called 'Duh' dude for a while. Nevertheless,the movie was darn frightening. The walking dead, the falling bridge and the living woods are all became inspirations for today's horror genre (include those teen-scream films et al). I wonder are there anyone just like me, duh ??",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll have more fun watching paint dry....YAWN,"I'm sorry, but I still can't understand why so many people like this movie? I thought it sucked the big one. If you're in to demons, then you should probably skip this one and rent Night of the Demons! The only good part about this movie is Army of Darnkness. It was way too long for the little bit of trash it had in it. And the tree having ""sex"" with the one chick, who went outside looking for the owner of a strange voice was just LAME with a capital SUCK! Who in the hell goes looking for strange voices in the woods in the middle of the night? Not I. The part with Ash's girlfriend all crazy and possessed, giggling like a psycho was kinda creepy, in a weird ""WTF?"" kind of way, but that was about it. That is why I asked for my money back when I took this P.O.S back to the video store. Take my word for it...rent Night of the Demons, and give this one a wide berth in the video store.

A very scary movie,This a great horror movie. It is very scary. I can think of scarier movies. Evil dead II dead by dawn is a scarier movie. Evil dead III the army of darkness is also scarier. But still this is a very scary movie. One of the scariest movies made before 1987. A group of teenagers of to an old cabin in the woods. They accidentally come across tape. That read out a passage in the book of the dead. It summons a demons that kill people then posses there dead bodies. Tuning them into zombies. This movie has great acting. It also has a great stories line. I also has great special effects. If you like scary movie then you need to see this movie. All the evil dead movie are must sees.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the those horror films you cannot miss.Frightening.,"I had first seen ""The Evil Dead"" back in November of 1988 on video and was truly frightened by the entire film.This wasn't just one of those horror films that made you block your eyes.""The Evil Dead"" takes place in the middle of the woods where five college students are victims of some supernatural force that posses their bodies.Except for one who is Ash,played by Bruce Campbell.Sam Raimi who directed this ,in my opinion,cult horror classic,has a great eye for horror films and Bruce Campbell is definitely one hell of an actor when it comes to these roles.He reminded me of Sigourney Weaver from ""Alien"".""The Evil Dead""will probably frighten first timers.For others,it will probably entertain them.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
it gets higher rating because it is old.,"I don't know why some people think that this is an interesting movie. First of all, the demonic forces don't throw things around or cant make the dead alive. this is stupid. If you wanna see real horror watch exorcism of Emily rose and try to compare the two. In E.O.E.Rose the horror is created just with the superb acting and dialogs. there is no one vomiting colorful liquid, blood all around or trees raping people.Has anyone ever felt scared in real life? In real life the horror comes from our feelings inside that cause us to perceive the ordinary things around us in a different way than normal. Demonic forces just use these inside feelings and scare the possessed ones make them act insane. sometimes give them knowledge which may be good or bad. but NEVER can they make person do things which are physically impossible.People who are possessed (and there are very few most of them are psychotics) cant so things like flying around or other wonderful feats. Trees, bushes never rape people.I like films where horror is created without showing the things that can never happen in real life.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eeeeviiil.....!,"Please realize that I'm not trying to look down on this movie. It's a good movie, but it lacks a plot. That was my only real dilemma with this movie. The only thing that happens is the group listens to a tape that awakens the dead, then the forest (yes the forest) captures a girl and everything goes from bad to worse from there. But when it comes to horror movies Evil Dead shines as an original because it uses the ""Deadites"" a type of evil dead zombie that's actually kinda smart. The Deadites are obsessed with eating souls. I have to say that I was surprised at the amount of gore used in this, but that's probably because I saw AoD first. Out of the three movies (Evil Dead, ED2:Dead by Dawn, AoD) this one has the most ""no non-sense"" feel to it, it has a much deeper fixation on horror than the other two which mixed comedy elements into them. Horror fans are sure to get a kick out of this as it is a really great horror movie (it's a really great horror series). I recommend it to horror fans who don't need a deep story to get their fix and gore fans because some of this is beautifully brutal.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think The evil Dead is a real scary film, but also think they could use some less bloody effects, I really like the movie but the melting of the Zombies at the end was unnecessary.

Good small budget horror film,"""The Evil Dead"" is very atmospheric, small budget horror film. The tension is build by the unseen horror, that haunts the teens enjoying their time out in a small cabin away from everything.The obvious lack of huge budget has driven Sam Raimi in a very good decision not to show the thing, that turns people into a flesh hungry monsters. Weird camera angles and eerie music give the film a throbbing personality, with very eerie atmosphere.As said, the plot goes like this: A group of friends go into a cabin middle of nowhere. Then they discover a human flesh bound book, the Necronomicon, and they of course awaken the evil in the forest. Silly for them. The evil then starts to hunt the friends one after another, turning them into a flesh craving monsters. The death is always near.There are some rather campy jokes in the beginning of the film, but it does turn into a rather serious horror film in one point. It's the build up of the atmosphere that does it. There is also the fact of not showing the main baddie, which gives the viewer a good change to let his/hers mind to make out its appearance.Bruce Campbell is the one actor, who rose from the film as a lovable b-film star he is today, as for other careers the Raimi bunch came along this film.All in all a very good horror film for the fans of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Masterpiece Of Low-Budget Horror Film-Making,"Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD is one of the best examples ever made of what can be done on a small budget. Acting is great, FX are great, story is great, and even the cinematography and style are great. The story is pretty simple: some friends go to a cabin in the woods and find a strange book and some tapes in the basement. Turns out the book is the fabled NECRONOMICON, a tome that was created for the purposes of black magic and summoning demons. When the campers start fooling around with the book and tapes, they unknowingly unleash the demonic hordes!THE EVIL DEAD is truly a horror classic. Bruce Campbell is excellent as ASH (a role he reprised for EVIL DEAD 2, and ARMY OF DARKNESS). The gore and other FX still hold up to this day, and is still a blast to watch. If you haven't seen this one, you know nothing about horror! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Classic That Is Simply Genius,"Finally, a movie that change the horror genre shocking the audience with intense gore using brutal violence that was to much ,but felt so right for the movie. All that blood that was spilled on the floor and wall makes me want to be for more! The acting in The Evil Dead is not the best ,but as for myself I didn't seem to have a problem with it. Let alone, theses poor teenagers are constantly suffering inside a cabin with no help or anything. The demons play around with them like puppets. Thank god Sam Raimi created the character Ash to bring down some hell!!It's really surprising how they got away showing this in theaters especially, the infamous scene in the woods that everybody remembers. As for the make up, how incredible the demons looked for a budget that was about $350,000. Blood coming out of their mouths, big white pearl eyes, with insane body decay, screaming and laughing... ahh I LOVE IT!!!Now theses are the demons that belong in Evil Dead!, the remake of Evil Dead seem to fail at that.Its a bloody good horror classic even though it has a cheesy moments no matter what, Ash is the one that makes the whole circus ride without a doubt a experience you don't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Night of the Living Dead meets the Excorcist...and this is better than both.,"This is a very silly movie...not as silly as the two sequels it spawned, but it's still silly. The violence is very over the top, and the villains of the film are creatures inhabiting the bodies of the characters, brought to life through black magic. The girl in the Excorcist said some pretty crazy stuff when she was possessed, and the characters here are just as rude and over the top. It's actually sometimes hilarious. At the same time, this is one of the most nerve wracking scariest horror flicks. You have no idea what's going to happen at any moment, and you feel for the protagonist Ash (Bruce Campbell) who's going through Hell trying to get out of this abandoned cabin.Five kids go into the woods to an abandoned cabin, and after playing back a tape recorder, and evil force is unleashed. They try to survive as these strange spirits try to kill them off and possess their bodies. In order to kill the possessed people, known as deadites, their heads must be dismembered, leading to a lot of gore, and some violent and scary scenes.Evil Dead, more than any other movie I've seen, has such a perfect mixture of slapstick and horror. These creatures are so vile and nasty, but at the same time somewhat humorous in their over the top nature, and the extreme gore effects. Someone could be chopping another person's head off, which would normally try to be scary, but here it's so over the top and the camera work is so fast it becomes comical. It's a really great mixture of humor and horror.Overall, this is a great movie, which spawned off two sequels that were actually superior to it.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. R for language and violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's Not That Good,"It might seem rather morbid now but a prolific topic of conversation in 1983 were video nasties . I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON in particular came up in conversation with colleagues and friends on a regular basis but perhaps the most talked about video nasty* was THE EVIL DEAD , especially the scenes featuring "" The woman and the trees "" and "" That bit with the pencil "" . After finally seeing it that year I was very disappointed . I found it dumb , badly made and badly paced and basically a waste of time .I saw it again last night when it was broadcast as part of Channel 4's "" Banned "" season and my opinion of it has improved , but only very slightly . This might be because I have become impressed by director Sam Raimi's work over the years most especially A SIMPLE PLAN and THE GIFT , two very intriguing thrillers and feel he'd probably be better sticking to that genre instead of making yet another sequel to SPIDERMAN . Despite the director's later success THE EVIL DEAD is still very flawed . It might have literate roots that other so called video nasties lack ( HP Lovecroft is an obvious influence on this movie ) but it's still basically a bunch of teenagers go into the woods and get killed in a graphic manner type plot . The characters aren't characters at all they're just cyphers to drive the plot along and the acting is poor . They're is some humour but I'm uncertain if this was deliberate on the part of Raimi . Compare this movie to its sequel and tell me what one is actually trying to be funnyTHE EVIL DEAD is a movie that would probably have become totally forgotten if it wasn't for the director's later success . It remains rather watchable though which is something you can't say about most other cheap and cheerless horror movies from the period , but it's no masterpiece either* Yeah I know THE EVIL DEAD isn't a "" video nasty "" in the true sense so don't message me to point this out",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The king of low-budget horror,"Ultra low-budget horror movies simply don't come any better than this. Wonder kid Sam Raimi concocted a really scary demon flick here and with the use of some incredible camera work, very inventive make-up effects and surprisingly good special effects he made one of the best horror films of the eighties.The woods scenario had been used a lot, even demons had made many appearances but this flick makes it look so fresh and insanely creepy you forget all that stuff and really sink head first into this nightmarish vision. Granted, the fog machine is used way too much and Hal Delrich as Scott is incredibly bad in his role, but still, all this works in the film's favor. Bruce Campbell is very subdued here compared to his Ash in Dead's two subsequent sequels but even this early he shows leading man potential and why he is one of horror's true cult legends.Some scenes here are creepy as hell and it's got a few very nasty shocks in store, even for seasoned horror viewers. Raimi hits all the right notes here; there's a creepy basement, fog bound woods, blood and guts in big doses and there's even a chainsaw here. As said, make-up effects are really spectacular and the gory show still impresses nearly 30 years later. Humor is also well placed and delivered; though this flick is indeed a horror film as opposed to the more comically driven sequels.I really don't know what to say more about ""The Evil Dead"" that hasn't been said (and written) many times before. If you're one of the lucky few who hasn't seen this horror masterpiece; stop reading now and go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic supernatural horror movie.,"The story is definitely interesting and is build up really well. I found the Naturan Demanto to be really interesting and I like the information on the tape recorder. The Deadites are a interesting type of demons who possessed people, talk in a creepy way, and are threatening creatures. The movie does a great job on build up the suspense towards the Deadites and the jump scares. The best character is definitely Ash Williams. He's a memorable and likeable character throughout the movie. And have a strong developed relationship between the other characters. Also he's a badass. Bruce Campbell does an amazing job in the movie on how he portray the character. The practical effects are really awesome in this movie. I really like the makeup effects on the Deadites to make them look creepy and threatening. There's great gore effects in the movie and the death scenes are really effective. I also like the stop-motion animation in the movie. The atmosphere is really effective and creepy on being set in a isolated environment where there's no way to escape. The cinematography looks great on how it's done and presented here. And the movie does a good job with it's creepiness factor.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The worst film I have ever seen,"To start off with I love weird stupid films and shows, I personally love the Scary Movie franchise (Yes the later ones were not as good as the first two), I love the idea of just sitting down, switching my brain off and enjoying idiotic things for an hour and a half. But I like many people have limits and this film destroyed them, before watching this film I thought the worst kind of film was a boring film that you don't even react to, but no this film changed that.So this film is about a group of people going to a cabin in the woods for a holiday and when they get there weird and satanic stuff happens, nothing other than that really happens. The characters are very forgettable and bland and this includes the main character who is the worst of the bunch, but where this film is at its worst is with what it shows and makes you listen to.One of these things occurs about 25 minutes into the film, when I first watched this I stopped it and made sure I saw what I actually saw and then carried on, the thing that happens is one of the dumbest things I think I have ever seen (Remember I love the first two Scary Movie films) and it just makes you rack your brains at its existence. Then near the end everything gets so much worse as the sounds used are very grating and just painful to listen to.A pro of this film is the special effects which for the low budget of this film (Wikipedia puts it between 400,000 and 500,000) is just incredible as they are so creative and puts other horror directors with bigger budgets to shame. Other than that the plot is like the characters and is very boring and forgettable and the film is regarded as a Horror and it is not scary at all compared to other films from that era like 'The Thing' and 'Friday the 13th' this could just be because of budget but 'Friday the 13th' did not have a much higher budget (Wikipedia puts it at 550,000), this film also has been regarded by fans as a comedy and it is not funny in the slightest.It may have been different if I saw it when it came out but I do not know, it could just be my taste in films (Although I would say I like quite a broad range of films). Oh well I have no idea and if you like this film then that is great that it can appeal to others and bring you/them happiness and remember that this has been my opinion and you really do not need to get upset or angry with it but hey, do what you like. Have a good one :)",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Film Ever,"This has been my favorite movie and favorite horror movie for years. Sure, the acting comes and goes in quality and yeah, that stop-motion animation is dated, but that's not what makes a horror movie. This has something you almost never find in our modern watered-down Hollywood horror trite these days. Pure, dark, terrifying atmosphere. It's dark, moody, and the action comes and goes with relentless pace. The quiet moments are so well done that you can FEEL the stress. The scene out in the woods... if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about... reminds us all of how the filmmakers came to the idea that submitting this movie to be rated (or raped) by the MPAA would've resulted, most likely, in an X rating. Not to mention, this movie is about the only competitor in horror film existence that might even be able to match, let alone compete, with the amount of gore dumped throughout, Peter Jackson's (Unrated, Uncut) Dead-Alive.

""The Evil Dead"" is a major cult classic, for over 25 years that critics and especially fans of the feature make it special until this day.

I am getting everything straight between Evil Dead and Dead Alive(Braindead),"Ok. The Evil Dead movie hit theaters in 81 and it was frightening. They started making it in 1977 it was released in 1981. Once this fild came out, people hardly wanted to go see it... After seeing the trailer or commercial, people thought this move was two intense. Ill tell you a true story... This was on the news along time ago. 3 friends went to see The Evil Dead. After the movie was over, 3 of them went home and they had not slept in days... After 2 of them had heart attacks after when they were walking together... Someone never knew they watched it and asked them do you want to go see it? They both immediately had heart attacks... Protesters were protesting against the film... Then rating for the fil was NC-17. It was way to gory and frightening. That is why it is restricted from tv. Also the exorcist is restricted from tv too. But when they play it on TV they must cut out scenes for both movies. The Evil Dead topped The Exorcist in being most frighning. Dead Alive(Braindead) was released in 93 and people said that it was a evil dead wannabe. I agree. Put it this way.. .Watch Evil Dead 2 which was released in 87 and look at Dead Alive(braindead). Comedy? Well so is Evil Dead... Evil Dead is comedy and horror. Most people find it scary and not funny. Dead Alive had a big notch hero and so did Evil Dead.. What a coinsedense. Dead Alive has alot of gore. And so does evil dead. Evil Dead may have less blood but it is gorier. They have white blood and it is disgusting. Zombies getting cut up and everything... It is just scary. Evil dead now is by far the best damn zombie movie in the world and 2nd in scariest movie in the world... first is the exorcist. 2nd best zombie movie ever is Dawn Of The Dead...Well Thank you.. I just cleared everything up..",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Masterpiece - I Love This Movie.,"This film is the definition of a horror film. It's a classic and I will never, EVER, get tired of watching it. If there is one film that I could have on a desert island, this is it. If there is one film to turn a person onto horror, this is it. If there is one film that got me into film-making, this is it.First, let me say Bruce Campbell is great, even though he is basically a chump in this outing. It's Scott who is the 'bad-ass', chopping up his possessed girlfriend with an ax. Seeing his transition from film to film is great, but here is where it all started.The film is scary as hell. I know there are people out there who thought it was too cheesy to be scary, but these are probably the same people who think Jason X is one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. Seeing Ash's girlfriend sit on the floor laughing in her high pitched tone is scary, the cabin is scary, the deadites are scary.The Evil Dead is still fresh, exciting and frightening as the day it was made. This is truly ""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"". Forget Spider-Man, this is Raimi's true baby. The camera work and what they did for the time and the budget is mind blowing (to me anyways). I credit this film with being a huge influence on me wanting to make films. I love the camera movement in this film, every small subtle thing works perfectly and all the obvious in your face Raimi style angles are great to see for the first time (which are still used to this day in his films).While the film is not as gory as it's sequel, it does have more cringe worthy bits. The Tree Rape scene is enough to make people's skin crawl. Or how about the 'original pencil trick'. I cheered in The Dark Knight and cringed my face in The Evil Dead. How many people still talk about this film today? Hundreds of thousands. It's been a huge impact on horror (see Cabin Fever).I always wonder about what I would do in this situation and it always ends up being the same, sitting in the corner with a shotgun and shooting anything that moves.

"""An horror masterpiece""","I remember when in the ending of the 70's the horror-terror movies was at its highest point movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th,Blue Sunshine,The Dawn of the Dead,The Omen II,Jaws 2,Phantasm, Alien,The Brood and many many more shine in the screen.Evil Dead,like a lot of this movies,showed that you not need a lot of millions to make people scream in the theaters (The movie cost $375.000)that's why the movie works great because the director and the crew used all their imagination to make a Really scare movie with a some gore.The Plot is like this:5 friends come to a abandoned cabin to spend some days there when one of them find a book and a recorder and play the recorder the evil entity try to possess every one of the 5.The big accomplished of the movie are that even that was make it why little budget you never feel it that the movie was cheap or bad make it and other big thing is you really scare because the movie focus in the cabin not the characters and that work very well.It's a shame that don't make movies like this anymore but if you really really want's to scare see it and enjoy (I recommended to see it later of 10 of night).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boring Plot And FX,"I ordered this ""classic"" on DVD and watched it again after a long time. The movie starts out slow-paced and gives you the feel of a campy low-budget horror flick, and it is. So, you watch and wait for the action to start and when it does, you are rewarded with plenty of gore but unfortunately, it's not very realistic gore. Most of the effects were done with clay and time-lapse cinema (yes, like those used in ""Santa Claus Is Comin To Town""). I felt the ""Violated by the Woods"" scene was rather dull. Gee, how difficult is it to think up a young woman having sex with trees? Not very. In other scenes, I felt they were plain annoying and stupid. The scene where Ash's girlfriend becomes a Cindy Brady demon is a perfect example. ""We're gonna get you, we're gonna get you..""). Ugh.I'm not a Raimi fan, but I thought this may have been the one good film he made. Not quite. I'd probably enjoy watching the idiotic ""Spiderman"" series more, at least the FX are not made with claymation!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Equal parts good and bad,"I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, it's truly scary, very disturbing + unsettling, quite well-directed, and incredibly influential. But I just can't overlook the terrible acting (outside of Bruce Campbell), cheezy dialogue, stupid characters, and slavish adherence to silly genre conventions. I mean, could the girl do something other than run into the haunted woods? It did scare me quite a bit, though, the first horror film to do so since The Descent. The scene where Ash's girlfriend is laughing maniacally - brrr. Gives me shivers just thinking about it. I think if it had taken a little more time getting set up (it feels really rushed at the beginning), had some decent actors, and a better script, I would have really liked it, as the direction and visuals are top-notch for such a low-budget film.

The original Ash vs. Deadites,"Classic low budget horror film that I love and can no longer objectively review. Directorial debut of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness"" ""A Simple Plan"" ""Spider-Man""), film debut of cult favorite Bruce Campbell in his most iconic role as Ash Williams (although his Elvis in ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" is my personal favorite), and the filmscore debut of prolific composer Joseph LoDuca (""Xena: Warrior Princess"" ""Spartacus"" ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""). The film was produced by Rob Tapert, who'd go on to produce many more films and TV shows with Raimi. Ash and his group of friends in their 73 Oldsmobile head to a remote cabin in the woods and inadvertently wake the evil dead when they read aloud from the Necrocomicon. Demonic possessions, evil trees, and all sorts of weirdness ensue. For such a low budget film, it's manages to to be visually inventive (particularly the evil spirit POV shots through the woods), shockingly gory (but in a fun over-the-top way), and also works wonderfully as a black comedy. ""Evil Dead 2"" does feature better special effects and is much more consistent in tone, staying consistent as a dark horror comedy than this first film, which at times wants to be a straight horror film and at other times wants to be tongue-in-check, but those are minor quibbles for a film that's terrifically fun and wildly inventive. A must see for horror fans, but maybe not a film for all tastes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
THE EVIL DEAD - The best horror movie ever made,"THE EVIL DEAD to me, is the best horror movie ever made. I still remember shivering and getting out of my mind when I snuck the VCR of this into the player while my parents slept back in the 80's.As of today, this is still the best horror movie I have ever seen. EVen though the film was low budget, it still managed to bring the scares and a bucketload (and more) of gore to the film.The first of a trilogy, it is this film which is strictly horror in every sense of the word. The comedy you may see in it now, was not intentional. Bruce Campbell is an absolute legend and this was one of his earliest films. WITHIN THE WOODS was the precusor to THE EVIL DEAD, and that is a brilliant nasty little film in its own right.If you are only familiar with EVIL DEAD 2, ARMY OF DARKNESS or ASH VS EVIL DEAD, then you need to do yourself a favor and watch the original film which started it all. It may start off slow, but when it gets to the horror, it does not stop. And it is not relenting.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is a solid 10/10 from me",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
