A very good film that apparently takes HUGE liberties with some facts to make for a more exciting film.,"Before I get to whether or not I liked this film, the history teacher in me thinks it's very important to set the record straight. Although the film is pretty accurate when it comes to the career of James Braddock, it's very inaccurate in portraying his opponent, Max Baer. The champion, Baer, is shown as a sadistic jerk who killed two men while boxing--and really delighted in taunting Braddock about this. In the film, the evil and filthy-mouthed Baer tells Braddock to bow out of the fight, as he could be the next to die in the ring--and he really seems to LIKE tormenting Braddock's wife about this. In reality, Baer killed one man in the ring. It was a horrible accident which occasionally happens in boxing--one which apparently haunted Baer for the rest of his life. In fact, he helped pay for his dead opponents to get educations and looked after this family--hardly the act of a sadist. I understand why the folks who made ""Cinderella Man"" changed this in an attempt to create tension, but the story would have STILL worked great if it had just stuck to the truth. Plus, think of how this film affected Baer's relatives when they saw it. Max Baer Jr. ('Jethro' from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") knew his father was not like this and I am sure it pained him to see him so badly misrepresented.As for the NON-Baer parts of the film, they are great. The look of the 1930s is exceptional--much more realistic than you often see in films. Also, the acting is terrific, the film VERY engaging and the story of Braddock very compelling. Without the misrepresentation of Baer's in the story, I would have given this one a 10. Really....it's that compelling and they did a great job. The acting, direction, designs...everything but the writing was perfect.By the way, this isn't so much a complaint as an observation. In this movie, like practically EVERY other boxing movie, there is hardly any defense (such as blocked shots) in the boxing matches--punch after punch that lands on the opponent. If fights REALLY were like this, they'd rarely go beyond the first round!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
James J. Braddock:  Gladiator of the Great Depression,"""Cinderella Man"" deserves to be placed alongside other great biographical films dealing with the lives and times of great boxers. Such films include ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Joe Louis Story,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Hurricane,"" and ""Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story.""These films share in common not just a documentary-like approach to boxing or a superficial biopic. They also portray the human side of a modern gladiator and the culture that produced him. In the case of ""Cinderella Man,"" we are given a detailed and heart-rending portrait of the Great Depression in American. The story of the gentleman pugilist James J. Braddock is the backdrop to the larger drama of Americans' struggle in the 1930s.Russell Crowe provides a brilliant interpretation of Braddock, capturing the decency of a man whose career as a boxer would appear to have peaked at just the wrong time prior to the Crash of 1929. After that momentous event, Braddock's boxing went into decline just like the lives of millions of Americans. The scenes of Braddock and his family living in squalid conditions and with uncertainty about such basics as heat and electricity were carefully developed in the film. Renée Zellweger was outstanding as Mae, the caring but feisty wife of Braddock. Paul Giamatti was also excellent as Braddock's handler-manager, Joe Gould. Joe tries to keep up appearances by sporting fancy clothes. But in one revealing scene in the film when we see the interior of Joe's ostensibly swanky apartment, there is no fancy furniture other than a dowdy table and some flimsy deck chairs. Everyone is reeling from the Depression. In the depiction of the massive unemployment, the ""Hoovervilles"" of the homeless residing in Central Park, and the desperate need for Americans for an optimistic icon like Braddock to raise their spirits, the film truly captured the tragedy of the Great American Depression.The film's director Ron Howard emphasized close-ups throughout the film with uneven results. In many of the boxing sequences, the close-ups and rapid editing made it difficult tell the fighters apart. The close-ups continued even into the domestic scenes and the outdoor sequences depicting Braddock working as a longshoreman. The film's dark cinematography conveyed the bleakness of the Depression years, but it worked against bringing out the buoyant spirit of Braddock himself and the optimism that he instilled in others. As a director, Howard's strength is not in film artistry or technique. As apparent in this and other films, his gift lies in narrative storytelling and the development of dramatic character.Indeed, the characters and the story were the strong points of ""Cinderella Man."" Much credit should go to Cliff Hollingsworth for a screenplay that included thoughtful dialogue, humor, and multi-dimensional characters. Daniel Orlandi also merits praise for the brilliant costumes that helped to recreate the period of the early 1930s.But the heart of this film experience is Russell Crowe's screen portrayal of Braddock. It was the colorful sportswriter and raconteur Damon Runyan who coined the nickname of ""Cinderella Man"" for Braddock. However, the real James J. Braddock was more than lucky. It was his strength of character in and out of the ring that captivated America. One of the most moving scenes of the film was a heated argument between Braddock and his wife Mae where Braddock insists that even in the most difficult of times, he would refuse to be separated from his children. As a boxer, he was fearless. But he demonstrated even more courage in fighting for family valuesa lesson from which we can learn a great deal today in reflecting on this sensitive film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Russell Crowe K.O.,"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference.It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant.Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent.Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock, and know the outcome of his fights, including the championship bout with Max Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know, DON'T look it up before you see the movie, and if you DO KNOW, DON'T TELL, but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch, but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae, I was unable to tear myself away.The audience was like a prize fight audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins, suffered his defeats. It is a great movie, with authentic heart. Solid A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very little to say...,"My heart was firmly lodged in my throat for the last hour and a half of The Cinderella Man. Nobody does true-story heroism like Ron Howard, and few can do heroes like Russell Crowe. Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects.Jim Braddock was a depression-era boxer who everybody thought was down for the count. Though there is a lot of boxing in this film, this is not a boxing movie, but rather his story and the story of the family that inspired him to fight back against prejudice and hopelessness, to rise to heights that would inspire a nation. Braddock is portrayed in a moving and powerful manner, with remarkable performances all around, one of the best scripts I can remember in recent years, and occasionally brutal action.Those who have run into my reviews may note that this is one of my shortest. Please understand that I really don't think there's much to say about this simple, beautiful and very human story, besides - see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Old story well told!,"Geez, another boxing movie! Yeah, Yeah, I know the story. Down and out guy gets a break and makes the most of it. He's fighting for his family, he's fighting for all those other hopeless people. Been there, done that.Oh, I forgot to mention one thing. This movie is about the best 140 minute I've spent in a movie theater since . . . . since . . . ., Oh, well, you get the picture. Better yet, instead of getting the picture, go see it.Russell Crowe owns the character of James Braddock, the unlikely hero who makes the most of his second chance. He's a good fighter turned hack. Injury, bad luck and this thing called the Depression sends him down the drain.His wife, Mae, played by Renee Zelleweger, wants to be his biggest fan, but the kids need a dad, the rent has to get paid and the money from boxing dried up along time ago. Her husband's courage is undoubted, but his nerve is killing her.And then there's Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.A boxer by the name of George Cochan once told me his manager was the bravest man he ever knew, he was willing to pit his man (Cochan) against anyone. As a result, Cochan had his head handed to him multiple times by the likes of Jake LaMotta and other class middle weights of the Forties and Fifties. Gould, is that brave manager, if not literally, in spirit. He pits Braddock, out of shape and with one day notice, against the number two heavy weight contender. Regardless of the risk, it's a pay day needed by both Gould and Braddock.The story, while familiar, is executed brilliantly. The camera work is both subtle and, in turn, spectacular. Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and the rest of the cast give flawless performances.Yes, been there, done that! And I'm ready to do it again for anyone who wants to go with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderful!,"This is a truly great film. Russel Crowe, Rene Zellweger and Paul Giametti were all fabulous. Russell Crowe is the best actor of our time. I am not a boxing fan, but I was so engrossed by the character of the Cinderalla Man that I was totally involved in every punch. I didn't know how the story would end, so I had the added thrill of suspense during the final fight.The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression was as compelling as the boxing story. The solid family man played by Russell gives us a much needed role model. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today. This is a classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best boxing movie made.,"Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s.

It is a must see.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Max Baer misrepresented,"This movie is really charming and enjoyable. But it totally misrepresents Baer. Consider two facts:-Baer killed one guy, not two. He was haunted by this for the rest of his life and paid for his victim's children's education.-Baer, though a Catholic, wore a Star of David to show solidarity with the the Jews during his fight with Max Schmeling, who he beat much to the Nazi's annoyance.(for more, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Baer )I don't think it was necessary to wrongfully represent Baer to sell Braddock as a hero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Living and Surviving During the Great Depression,"If the great depression of the 1930s is a mystery to you, then Cinderella Man can fix that. The story, about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer, is uplifting and entertaining. However, what makes this film more than that is its believable depiction of the great depression.The sets look similar to pictures I have seen in books I read about the depression, and the costumes are correct. But this is not just a ""period piece."" The behavior of everyone in the cast, and every extra, shows dedication to reproducing the gestures and attitudes I have observed in people I have personally known who lived through the depression.Take, for example, the scene at the dock where Braddock, the boxer, waits with dozens of other men for the chance to work a stevedore job for the day. ""We need ten,"" shouts the boss. Then he points, and counts. Every eye is trying to meet his, trying to be picked. Not a gesture is out of place.This kind of verisimilitude comes only from fanatics for accuracy. Look at drector Ron Howard and male lead Russell Crowe. Ron Howard also directed Cocoon, Willow, and -- for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Picture -- A Beautiful Mind, which also starred Crowe. He drove the set designers, the costumers, the cast, and the extras, with telling effect. Nothing is over-acted.Crowe trained for the film using the same, low-tech methods used in boxing in the 1930s. He also studied film footage of Braddock to master the real fighter's characteristic gestures. In the ring, said one of Crowe's trainers, he successfully duplicated Braddock's moves, his footwork, and his style.The boxing drives the story along. It is bloody, fierce boxing. Some people may find the fight scenes objectionably violent. Crowe broke his hand in training. Real fighters played most of his opponents. Sometimes they forgot they were supposed to fake punches, leading to the spilling of real blood, which was left in the final version. Crowe also landed a few real punches by mistake.The boxing, however, is overshadowed by life during the depression. Millions were out of work. Milk was delivered in bottles, by a milk man. People left their empty milk bottles out at night so the milk man could collect them early the next morning, and replace them with full bottles. When the dairy could no longer extend a family's credit, the empty bottles were still there in the morning with a note of apology stuck in the mouth of one of them.During the depression, there was no unemployment insurance, no Medicaid, and no Social Security. There was the dole, but it was new, humiliating, and under funded. You cold not get enough to keep your family fed and clothed.Braddock is shown waiting for and getting his dole, another moving scene in which everyone is stoically in character. The film also accurately depicts the huge gap that opened between the masses of the poor, and the few, fabulously wealthy.This is a very entertaining film. However, if you are just beginning to study the great depression, it can be a a great head start.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simple crowd pleaser,"Cinderella Man is the story of a Depression-era boxer and American hero Jim Braddock, but it contains enough love interest, family interest, and great-champion-of-the-people interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers. It's a total no-brainer, beautifully served up, and all the clichés delivered with such accurate emotional punch that you forgive it for being a tad unoriginal.Gladiator and bar-brawl man Russell Crowe plays the lead role and Renée Zellweger puts in a good performance as the ideal and very loving wife that supports her husband through thick and thin. The story starts in 1928 when Braddock is doing quite well, but the depression hits and, with an injured hand, he is forced to work in the shipyard. He and his family live in fairly abject poverty until a lucky break enables him to make a comeback.This is the working man's hero who never says a bad word, teaches his kids never to steal for food even when they are starving, and nobly gives back his social security money the minute he can afford to. Zellwegger is similarly faultless of course, striking the right balance between supportiveness and concern that her man could get his brains knocked out permanently. The last fight generates quite a lot of genuine excitement due largely to neat editing and intense cinematography - you can almost feel your nose bleed just watching it.This is classic American-style hero creation and worship and, on the face of it, healthy enough. So why the doubts? Sure you can sit back and just enjoy it, it's the type of story the U.S. has done well for a long time; but compare it with European cinema and it all seems very full of absolutes. The heroes don't have any failings. The choice is between total success and total failure, no half measures. Much as I admire the use of role models, I somehow wonder if more human heroes aren't sometimes called for, people who do quite well, who sincerely better themselves and others, but without becoming the most applauded individual on the continent. In watching the big picture we sometimes miss the detail that makes life real to everyone, not just the lucky few.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great movie!,"I also went to a sneak preview of this movie last night, and it was good enough for me to join this site and write my first review. It did start out kind of slow, but the complete rainbow of emotions was contained in this movie. There were parts that nearly made you cry. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. I could barely contain my excitement during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, I just wanted to scream out loud I was so excited. When we left the theater there was a ~60 year old woman delicately shadow boxing on her way out the door. Her husband asked her, ""Are you winning?"" She said, ""I'm going to have dreams about this movie tonight."" This was a great movie, and I would recommend it highly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Max Baer Sr Portrayal Inaccurate,"In Cinderella Man Max Baer Sr. was portrayed in a way that is very inaccurate to his real character. He was portrayed as a cruel and vicious boxer, and not someone who felt sad at Campbell's death. In real life Baer was deeply remorseful about killing an opponent in the ring and supported the man's widow and children even putting the man's children through college.

Wonderful!!!,"This is the best film Ron Howard has ever done. They really caught lightning in a bottle with this one. All the departments brought their A game to the table. I especially loved the editing and cinematography.The cast is perfect and, under Ron Howard's confident hand, all give amazing performances. Russel Crowe's soulful performance puts him back in Maximus territory here and, boy, was this cat born to play these types of roles. Bruce McGill is in it (San Antonio, represent!!!) and that's always a good thing.My only complaint (if it can be called that) is that the boxing sequences break no new ground. They are very reminiscent of the boxing sequences in Raging Bull. They are so well executed, however, that I quickly forgot about this small nitpick.The script works on so many levels, it's not even funny. There is plenty of time devoted to character development and it pays off handsomely in the long run as we really care about Jim Braddock every time he steps in the ring.All in all, Cinderella Man is a rousing, classy film that utterly satisfies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Excellent fiction treatment of historical boxer ""Humbling Bull""","Just saw a preview of this film (opens June 3) and as shamelessly emotional as it is, I liked it very much. It provides a more visceral view of the Great Depression era than did another fine film, Seabiscuit. Call it Seabiscuit with even more heart!Ron Howard teams with Russell Crowe (James J. Braddock) again and shows they can repeat with a winner. Like him as a person or not, Crowe puts forth another finely tuned, very convincing performance. Unlike in real life, he can be quite humble and sympathetic while beating the heck out of people. Really, his character is affecting, especially in his scenes with Braddock's children, and may be fairly reflective of the actual person of Braddock. (The fight game at that time, or any time, was not for saints but, whatever.) Renee Zellweger, who is not my favorite except for a brilliant portrayal in Cold Mountain, plays the wife effectively and mirrors the emotions for the females in the audience. (If my observations at the showing are typical, women fans will spend time alternately heading their eyes and virtually cheering out loud for Braddock/Crowe.)There are a number of good supporting actors but Paul Giamatti strikes again! He plays the manager who supports Braddock through thick and thin and his character recalls the era better than anyone in the film. I don't know what kind of research he did for this role but his Joe Gould is the archetypal boxing manager of the time or, at least, our cinema image of one. Here's hoping he pulled some big bucks for a role for once.(You will certainly recognize Bruce McGill, as the seemingly hard-hearted fight promoter who could care less about Braddock but really doesn't want to see him get killed in the ring, from many movie and TV appearances where he is always reliable and who may be remembered from an early exposure as ""D-Day"" in Animal House.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Certainly good, but more standard than sweeping","With Ron Howard directing and Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti starring, Cinderella Man was sure to be a worthwhile cinematic experience, if only it hadn't been released in the unsuitable summer months of blockbuster fever. It didn't help that previous DreamWorks summer hit Seabiscuit starred a horse (and was more emotionally uplifting without being too violent or predictable), or that Cinderella Man was preceded by last year's Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby or the lackluster NBC reality series The Contender. But even when taken out of context, Cinderella Man is a fine, elaborately and accurately produced (if minimalistic) Depression-era boxing-pic love story that simply doesn't go where no great movie hasn't gone before.Crowe, as always, gave a studied performance that reflected his involved physical and mental preparation, not to mention his accent! Zellweger, I thought, was the most underrated of the bunch because she really held her own opposite Crowe, stealing many of his scenes as the heart-tugging emotional core of the story. Giamatti's supporting perf should earn him his first (and overdue) Oscar nomination, since it was a fun, snarky kind of role infused with vigor and heart - great for a character actor. Otherwise, though, Ron Howard's direction might have made an already unoriginal subject matter more predictable. Still, it was, without a doubt, a good movie, if not a great one - a film that was well-made, if neither innovative nor emotionally sweeping.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent and truly inspiring movie to believe in one's self,"We went to this movie today at Albuquerque, New Mexico. My first impression upon looking at the title was ""sounds kinda girly movie"". I have no idea who Jim Braddock is until I saw this movie. Its truly inspiring and amazing. All actors excelled in their action. Its gripping all the way till the end. I don't want to tell the story and spoil the spirit. It was never boring the entire movie.Russell Crowe once again lived up to the expectations and did a very good job. Renee Zellweger played the role of a very supportive wife. Its about never giving up, fulfilling for your promises, staying together what may come, to fight back etc., Watch it and you won't regret I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Heartfelt and exciting boxing movie,"Cinderella Man tells the story of the titular boxer James Braddock, engaging in a desperate ""rags to riches"" story. Within the conditions of the Great Depression, Braddock (played by the stoic Russell Crowe) is forced to leave his sporadic job at the docks and take bigger risks to take care of his family, pushing him back into boxing. Despite the please of his wife and multiple injuries, Braddock tries his hardest despite the conditions. Sadly, it's not an idealistic feel-good movie, as he and even his manager are forced into humiliating desperation as the story progresses, with the actors bringing an appropriate level of gravity. Meanwhile, Mae (played by Zellweger) brings a level of conflicted love and anxiety that emotionally fuels the protagonist to triumph against the sadistic opponent Max Baer in an exciting climax that succeeds on many levels. Cinderella Man is an impactful movie, but too long and drawn-out in some parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I guess every Hollywood movie has to have a villain...,"... and this film based on the life of boxer Jim Braddock made Max Baer into one. Baer was actually a genuinely nice guy. He accidentally killed one man in the ring. He was ripped up emotionally by that and gave lots of money to his family. He was not a constantly partying womanizing guy who didn't want to fight Jim Braddock because he thought he was beneath him. He actually chose him because he thought he could beat him. However, Baer did embrace the identity of clown and did not like to train. And he starred in one of the oddest films ever made over at MGM - ""The Prizefighter and the Lady"" (1933). But I digress.What I say in the last paragraph is actually the reason I give the film 8 stars instead of 9 or 10, because the reputation and memory of a real person was so unjustly sullied. Now for what is right with the movie. It realistically portrays the violence of poverty, especially during the Great Depression when there was no real safety net for the poor. Kids went hungry, families were split up because parents couldn't afford to feed them, fighting for the right to unionize could get you killed. Great work went into the art design and cinematography of this film.Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger give very poignant and authentic portrayals of Jim and Mae Braddock, trying to keep their familiy together during the time when Jim cannot fight and can't get reliable work on the docks either. It's a great comeback story, and I think it might have done better at the box office and been better remembered if it had been released at Christmas of 2005 rather than during the summer, as it was. It is the real ""Rocky"" story, and I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dangerously close to being ""just another movie about boxing"", but the portrayal of an era saves it and Russell Crowe is great in roles like this","Now I know Russell Crowe may be a jerk in reality, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen so we can move past that. As a buff, bare-chested Gladiator-hero with a big ol' softie heart for his family, we love him in this film. It is set during the depression in the 1930s New York. The fact that he isn't fighting for glory but for for survival immediately makes his struggle much more poignant, and Ron Howard's Cinderella Man (2005) rides on this advantage throughout  this desperate depression time that drives a man to desperate measures.I think boxing is a truly inhumane sport. It shouldn't even qualify as a sport; it's two people inflicting maximum damage on each other. But Jim Bradock (that's Russell Crowe)'s fighting is something different  this isn't something he does for fun. In the beginning, after having lost a boxing match, a sponsor-person tells him ""Go home to your kids, Bradock"" to which Braddock replies, ""Go home? Go home with what?"" He needs to do it and it is apparent in the fighting.So in spite of my dislike for boxing, I have to credit this film for its dynamic, fast-paced and realistic games that even surpass those of Million Dollar Baby (2004). It's pretty damn exciting. Another plus for this film that elevates it above generic sports-movie formula is its setting. The murky, barren feel of the Depression invests the scenes in a kind of simplicity that is only ever present in Dogme 95. It places the environment in the backseat, with minimal visuals flair to detract, to make room for its realistic characters that consume the film.Ultimately, The Cinderella Man is a well-crafted and often entertaining film but it is extremely standard, safe, predictable, logical, been-there-done-that  there are no puzzling detours, twists, or unusual character developments. Sure, it is grounded as a reality-based biography but there is NO flair. Another director could have had more fun with the script. You've seen it all before, the build-up to that one final fight with the most ferocious and feared boxer, the wife's concern, not following the coach's instructions, the favouring crowd.Lastly, I have one more complaint: Cinderella Man could easily have been at least 40 minutes shorter. Not because it dawdled exactly, but by concentrating the key scenes into a shorter version, it would have been even more poignant.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Rename this one ""Schlocky I""Ron Howard once again makes us think we're eating prime rib when we're actually sucking on cardboard.","Perhaps I had a bad day yesterday before I sat down to watch ""Cinderella Man"", but let me try to convince you why I did not really like this film a lot.I wanted to love this film. I tried to really get into the Depression-era feel and the ""feel-good-everyman"" riches-to-rags to riches story of Jimmy Braddock, the underdog-cum-heavyweight-champion who outlasted a younger, more deadly Max Baer in 1935. This film is perhaps is the most historically realistic and visually stunning film that Ron Howard has ever directed. It may also be the most ambitious film that Brian Grazer and Penny Marshall have ever been involved in, including Marshall's ""A League of Their Own""). ""Cinderella Man"" has every stylistic element in the book going for it. Production design, costuming, set design, general casting, art direction, and music was created by the likes of people who made ""Chicago"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" (which I call ""A Beautiful Lie"", and if I have time one day I will write about why I call it that)"",""Apollo 13"",""Do the Right Thing"", and countless other great movies. This film has more heavyweight talent backing it up than Mohammed Ali every carried into a boxing ring during the height of his career. This film has the painted-portrait ambiance of Depression Era New York City.What could possibly be wrong with ""Cinderella Man""?For me, the real problem is that I have seen this kind of movie too many times before. Remove Sylvester Stallone's self-effacing ""bad-side-of-the-tracks"" Italian untermensch and insert Russell Crowe with his well-practiced but overly-understated Jersey accent and you have ""Rocky I"". Replace Rene Zellweger's half-Betty-Boop, half-horrible-imitation-of-Cyndi-Lauper rendition of Braddock's wife, Mae with Talia Shire, and you have Rocky's wife Adrienne from that same film. Paul Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, must have imitated every bad 1930's and 1940's formula picture actor to smooth out the stilted and wisecracking dialog he is given in this film. Let's also just be frank. Brain Grazer was one of the people responsible for the remake of ""Psycho"" which should, by law, prevent him from ever making another film in his life, if justice were truly blind. This film, basically, was made by a group of recyclers. This film is the equivalent of an EPA ""Super Fund"" project for cinematographers.In short, just about everything in ""Cinderella Man"" is too perfect. It is the same thing we get from Ron Howard every time (with the possible exception of ""Apollo 13""). It's the same old substance-less sentimentality wrapped up in a lovely cinematic package that we got in Cocoon, Splash, Far and Away, Willow, and countless other Howard projects.The real imperfections come from the extended length of the film, the predictable dialog, and the severe over-emoting of Renee Zellweger's Mae Braddock character at the end of the film. I am almost certain Ron Howard studied ""Rocky II"" a little too long when he copied the feel of the Stallone sequel for the last portion of this film. I also honestly believe the casting crew could have hired Cyndi Lauper for a lot less and gotten a better performance from her than they got from Ms. Zellweger in this movie. At least Ms. Lauper came from the same neighborhood upon which this film was based. She could even have been made up to look younger. Ms. Lauper also wouldn't have had to fake the Jersey smirk that Ms. Zellweger had to practice for months prior to doing this film.I am also tired of seeing Clint Howard, who still looks too young for his age, in any movie, let alone trying to portray a character much older than his age. Perhaps, when Ron Howard dies and no one else will hire him to act, he can write that New York Times Best Seller ""I Was Opie's Brother"". Until then, we will have to continue to endure his presence. (If you want to see Clint Howard in something truly funny, watch ""Evilspeak"", which is perhaps one of the worst horror films ever made).The politically correct will also likely be angry at the casting and make-up job of Craig Bierko as Max Baer, as well as his portrayal as a violent villain. This will be the second film in which Russell Crowe has been cast either as a character with supposed anti-Semitic views (John Nash) or opposing someone who supported Jewish causes like Baer (even though ethnically questionable to some). I have read that the Star of David was minimized on Baer's trunks to minimize any racial or religious association with Baer's trumped-up villainy in this film. Baer was more clown than villain in real life and was horribly shaken up by the deaths in the ring that he caused. And let's not forget, he was Jethro Bodine's (Max Baer, Junior's) dad. He could only be so mean, if you catch my drift.In the final analysis, we get what we always get from Ron Howard. We get the feel of eating fine prime rib when in reality we are simply sucking on dry cardboard. He has built one more fantastic cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing.This will be a wonderful film to rent at home, but I would save my money and not see this one in the theater. It will no doubt do well and I am certain the DVD will go into production very shortly after the film's theater run and will also be successful.I just think there are better films out there somewhere worth dodging commuter traffic to see on the big screen.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Seabiscuit' In Human Form,"Wow, this was an involving story and the best boxing movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them.It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another ""Seabiscuit,"" meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds.More than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here, who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal, while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife. After a string of some sleazy roles, it's nice to see Zellweger play this type of character. The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making. This is another reason why I label this an old-fashioned story. The primary subject's strengths, not flaws, are emphasized.Is it exaggerated? Probably, but I have no complaints seeing a good guy look better instead of worse. One gets tired of the modern-day age of the ""anti-hero."" It's nice once again to see a good man propped up instead of shot down.The third major character in the film is ""Joe Gould"" (Paul Giamatti), Braddock's trainer and loyal friend. Unfortunately, he spits out the Lord's name in vain so many times I lost count, the only objectionable aspect of this film. But Gould was the kind of friend every guy would want.Craig Bierko gets fourth billing as Max Baer, the reigning heavyweight champ whom Braddock has to beat to get the title. Now here is where I would not be surprised if his movie character was nothing like real life because Hollywood has to have a ""bad guy"" to counteract the ""good guy"" so here it is Baer, the last obstacle in the way of Braddock's quest to be heavyweight champion. Whatever the real Baer was like I don''t know but I know Bierko does a great job in this role.The boxing scenes, supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well-done. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. It's simply beautiful and director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The movie may not be a top contender for an Oscar but Crowe and Renee sure are,Great movie. Crowe is in for another Oscar. Coming close on the heels of million dollar baby and surviving is massive. Comparisons would be obvious but it stands apart as one of the boxing great movies though at times moving but great performances by Crowe and Renee. The movie may not be a top contender for an Oscar but Crowe and Renee sure are. A lot of people have filled in a lot of details so I guess I won't go there. But I particularly like that scene when Braddock is to fight Max and they meet in the hotel and later Mae is shown cleaning the dishes. Very true depiction of the era. Money's worth by all means though some scenes are very graphic and could have been avoided but I guess Crowe (or his directors) like gore just as in gladiator. The fight with Max is very well shown like history being retold. Roles like this come once in a career and Renee has given a winning punch. Lets see if the Oscar pundits agree.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fighting Intents,"Here's an interesting situation. Evil versus good, or if you prefer: a life of the purehearted versus that of the thuggish.Yes, its the story, but its also the form of the movie itself.The blunt, the stupid, the ugly is the movie itself. Howard and Grazier are so pedestrian it makes me cry. There isn't a shred of sophistication, elaboration or depth in this. Its one arc, unimpeded and unarticulated. Good man, Hard times, Comeback. The only slight elaboration is the worried-wife-as-watcher. Compare this to the richly woven ""Seabiscuit,"" essentially the same story but with all sorts of parallel threads and reflections.These two guys Howard and Grazier are the enemy of life with their industrial storytelling, their plywood narrative. It makes it all the worse that they have achieved a glossy style that looks competent, if you think manufactured cookies with artificial ingredients are competent. Zellweger is not a fine actress, so she goes with the manufactured sweep of the thing.The good which opposes it. Say what you will about Crowe's strutting, the man is an Australian actor and there's no escaping that. Even when told to be simple, and even in spite of his own imperfect and unformed soul, he just cannot avoid some depth, some parallel being  a reality under the cartoon.And also on the good side is the simple fact of boxing. Now boxing is brutal. And perhaps most people involved in it are simple. But they are real, and that's all the difference. And it is a real sport, perhaps the only real one. No complex rules and balls. No question of goals or finish lines, just a straightforward matter of the ability to give and take. Its genuine, and I'm sure that's why it was selected, to counter the cartoon limits of what the filmmaker could handle. And since Scorsece mapped the ring and Stallone in vented the slomo flying sweat, its been cinematic as well.So Its unintuitive that somethings that seem thuggish: Crowe and boxing, are the real things here, the pure and the good. And the bad, the evil, the thuggish; why they are our men behind the camera who make money from simplifying it for the goobs on the street.Who will win this fight, do you suppose?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Heartwarming Film,"The latest film from director Ron Howard follows the Depression-era boxing career of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), who retires after a number of defeats. Because he still has to support his wife (Renée Zellweger) and children, Braddock returns to boxing when he has a chance to fill-in for someone in a high profile match. His unexpected win over the #1 contender begins a series of victories that get the masses behind this true-life underdog.I love underdog movies. They're predictable and safe but still enjoyable and heartwarming. Cinderella Man is the perfect example of a good underdog story. It does feature a bunch of clichés but the film wins the viewer over by the end. I think Ron Howard is a very good director. He kept the film on a familiar path but he still kept it entertaining. He could have edited the movie though. It was overlong and the 140 minutes was not necessary at all. It didn't take away from the quality of the film too much though. Howard portrayed the good guy well, making him extremely likable. I didn't like the way the ""bad guy"" was portrayed though. In real life, Max Baer was a nice person but in Cinderella Man, he's portrayed as a cold and vile man. It was an unfair portrayal and Ron Howard shouldn't have gone over the top with it.The boxing scenes were exciting and well done. Howard captured the danger, fortitude and skill involved in boxing. The first half of the film was a little slow but still nicely done. The second half was faster and not as depressing. The ending was nicely done and very heartwarming. The film wasn't perfect though. The family scenes were too melodramatic. They all fell flat and the actors portraying the three kids weren't very good. There were also a few other cheesy moments that slowed the movie down. I blame screenwriter Akiva Goldsman for this. In my opinion, he's a weak writer and it amazes me that he was able to win an Oscar.The acting was great and pretty much everyone gave a good performance. Paul Giamatti gave a very engaging performance as Joe Gould. It was intense, realistic and he put a lot of soul into the role. Russell Crowe played Jim Braddock extremely well. His off screen behavior is questionable but he still delivers some nice performances. Renée Zellweger was just as good as Crowe and it's surprising that neither of them received nominations. After seeing Craig Bierko in Scary Movie 4, it was a little hard to take him seriously as Max Baer. He gave just an okay performance. In my opinion, Cinderella Man was a strong and heartwarming film but it wasn't anything amazing either. It was far from bland but it wasn't best picture worthy either. In the end, Cinderella Man is a fine film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great Movie, a must see!","I just saw the movie tonight at a special advanced screening here in Newport Beach, and it is so good. I cannot tell you one single performance in the film that wasn't terrific. I can only think of a couple negatives. One being the man coughing behind me the WHOLE time. In terms of the movie, the section where the Braddocks suffer in the Depression went on pretty long, and the Braddock's kids were WAY too cute. A little shamelessly so. As in, no three kids are that well-behaved,loving and adorable ALL THE TIME. Great points: There were a lot more funny moments than i had expected, but none were cheap laughs, all were just honest and nice little moments. The acting and directing are just incredible. Renee Zellweger, Russel Crowe, Paul Giamatti (who practically steals the show), even Craig Bierko as the boxing nemesis were so great! Oscars FOR EVERYONE! It's too bad this isn't Oscar season-- i really hope this doesn't get forgotten by the time nominations come out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I'd like to give it more stars but can't.,"This movie is a ten if the editor had done his job.The boxing sequences are the best of any boxing movie, hands down. Even my wife just loved them, and that's unheard of.My knock on the movie is it's 2:24 run time. That would be ok, if it was balanced, but it was not. I understand the need to emphasize how bad the Great Depression was. But they could've done that with a half an hour cut out of this movie.We own this on blu ray and have taken it in several times. We're not one's to take short cuts and believe in watching any film in its entirety as produced. We FF through thru this. Typically my wife would not like doing this, but with Cinderella Man, even Evelyn can't stomach the overdone misery.And it's not the duration by itself. We would NOT miss a second of 'The Green Mile', and it has a run time > 3 hours. Of course Darabont is a great director beyond description. His ""Shawshank Redemption"" is maybe the greatest flick ever made.But Ron Howard is a very good & proven director. But he has the tendency to pander and punish. His ridiculous over-emphasis around the misery in Cinderella Man, is not meant to merely entertain and educate, but to punish, because we're not only privileged, we're also, somehow guilty. Sound familiar? It should. Too bad he has the disease because he is a great director otherwise.So, I had to knock the score down because the movie is so overly long & poorly balanced. The boxing sequences though, are second to none.I do recommend.Bob R.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Split decision,"It seems today anything done by the Crowe-Howard combo is going to get rave reviews. ""Cinderella Man"" is a pretty good movie, just not a magnificent one. The script is paint-by- numbers. Renée Zellweger was as best mediocre (she has the most embarrassing line in the movie: ""You're the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!"") the rest of the acting was pretty good, but not as good as other past performances by Crowe and Giamatti.A terrible mistake in the movie was the demonization of champion Max Baer, who was as beloved as Braddock back in the day. As if the poverty and humiliation of Braddock wasn't enough to carry a story of redemption and second chances, they had to bring a villain. That's so Hollywood.Finally, there are two bigger problems with ""Cinderella Man"": The uplifting, true, sport story about people who win back a second chance from the Great Depression was seen years earlier in ""Seabiscuit"". The other problem is, despite being a true story, there was already a beloved boxer who came out of poverty and adversity to win our hearts. His name is Rocky. The real film version of this true story.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderful film of the best of the human spirit,"Let's get one thing out of the way right off...this isn't a movie about boxing. This is a movie about family, about the real responsibilities of being a parent, about meeting those responsibilities. Yes, boxing is the canvas and it is presented with no romance or softness. But the focus of this film is Jim Braddock and his wife Mae and how they faced and triumphed as a family in the face of horrible challenges. It has heart, humor and horror of life on the edge. The acting is uniformly superb. Russell Crowe once again shows his mastery of the small moment, the subtle facial expressions, the power of the eyes. Rene Zellwegger rises to his challenge and puts in a surprisingly restrained and powerful performance as his partner in life. Their children are allowed to be children, not sassy Hollywood smart mouths. While many in the supporting roles shine, Paul Giamatti is brilliant as manager Joe Gould. He and Russell create a rapport the likes of Hope and Crosby. This is a movie for adults and those with adult sensibilities. If all you want is special effects, pass this by.

Genteel and cheerful boxing movie.,"As boxing movies go, this one certainly can't compare to 2004's 'Million Dollar Baby' or the original 'Rocky'. However, Russell Crowe is convincing in the role of Jim Braddock, a man struggling to reach the top of his profession and while the underdog story has been done to death, audiences still love it because they always see themselves in their heroes' role. I liked the subject matter and the idea of the film a lot more than its execution, which admittedly, is flawed. Depression era people struggling to make something out of their lives. Crowe's children in the film represent my father's family and his siblings growing up. Something I've learned about in my life, and I'm glad there are those with big hearts like director Ron Howard, still brave enough to make these films in an era when no one seems to care about the impoverished anymore.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Charming boxing movie,"If you like boxing movies, Cinderella Man is a must-see. If you don't, this movie might just change your mind about the genre. It's very charming, and as it's a true story, it's extra heartwarming. Russell Crowe stars as Jim Braddock, a down-on-his-luck boxer during the Great Depression. With loyal love and support from his wife, Renée Zellweger, and regular bolstering from his manager, Paul Giamatti, he gets back up on his feet and tries to revive his career.Not only does this have a classically likable rags-to-riches story, but with the cars, clothes, and music from the 1930s, the entire atmosphere puts you in a good mood from the get-go. It has the aura of an old movie, and you can tell that everything's going to be alright. Plus, Rosemarie DeWitt has a small role in the film, and she's the granddaughter of Jim Braddock himself - talk about cute! I'd definitely recommend this one if you like tame boxing movies. This isn't gritty like The Fighter, even though that was based on a true story as well. This is sweet, like a fairy tale.

For Dignity and Milk.,"""In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of J J. Braddock"".Damon Runyan.Rags to riches films are notoriously divisive amongst critics and fans alike, often tagged derogative wise as Awards Baiters, one could be forgiven for thinking that uplifting pictures have no place in cinema society. On the surface, Cinderella Man was always going to struggle to totally capture the movie loving world. It's directed by Ron Howard, who seems to forever be charged with the crime of lacing his puddings with too much sugar, and it's written by the person who brought us Batman & Robin! So not a good start there for many. Add into the equation that Russell Crowe stars as Braddock, at a time when Crowe was gaining unfavourable press for anger issues and a love of poetry: And also that it's yet another boxing movie, this film was disliked before it had even been released. Which is a mighty shame as the finished product is a triumph of acting and story telling nous, in fact inspiring probably isn't the word to do it total justice.Much like with Apollo 13, Howard has managed to grab a story with a known ending and mold it into a heavyweight champion of a picture. Set as it is in the Great Depression, the amount of sentiment and heart tugging is naturally very high, but what would you have Howard do? Forgo the feeling of the time and Braddock's real life situation? Perhaps in favour of filler scenes that have no actual worth? Cinderella Man has no agenda other than to tell this incredible story of a good honest family man struggling to make ends meet. With a heart of a lion and a chin quarried from granite, Braddock {brilliantly realised by the irrepressible Crowe} went from top to bottom and rose like a phoenix to defy the odds and stun the boxing world at a time when morale was particularly low for many. This is no Rocky Balboa bunting strewn fanfare picture, this is a real story, from a real period, expertly told by all involved.This is not to say that Cinderella Man is a perfect piece, it most definitely isn't. My personal complaint rests with not fully fleshing out the friendship between Braddock and Mike Wilson, with the almost unforgivable crime of underusing the talent of Paddy Considine {Wilson} entered on to the charge sheet. Craig Bierko as the murderously ruthless champion boxer, Max Baer, has obviously studied the character, getting the movements of the champ down pat, but he just never fully convinces as a real life boxer of note, something that Crowe most assuredly manages to do. But they are minor quibbles to me, and offset by the wonderful Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould, every sequence featuring just him and Crowe are real cinema high points; an acting tour de force from two very talented men. A special mention has to go to Renee Zellweger, who as Braddock's devoted wife, gets arguably the toughest role in the picture, that she leaves a firm and emotionally enlightening impression is with much credit to the pretty and undervalued Texan.Rags to riches films are here to serve a purpose, they exist and will continue to be made because the world sometimes needs reminders that love, hope and respect can reign supreme, especially in trying and troubled times. Cinema is actually a form of medicine, especially when grounded in facts. Is it right to deny yourself a tonic when the need arises? Of course not, thankfully those involved with Cinderella Man knew exactly what to prescribe for the story of J J. Braddock. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

more unnecessary lies,"Why use real stories if you are going to ""make it better"" with lies? Just makeup your own original story and leave history alone. Couldn't we have cheered on the underdog without defaming the character of his opponent? It is an unnecessary detraction from the storyline to make it so black and white, feeds unsuspecting readers a lie that a generation comes to believe as truth, and creates a great deal of sorrow and pain for those who knew and loved Max Baer. Like a Beautiful Mind the truth has been twisted to tell a good story. Read the real stories of Nash and Baer. Nash's life was far more interesting and complex, he paid many times for his disease and certainly did not sit around the house and the college all those years till he could get back his life. It was a process that was far more interesting, less beautiful, and more really like schizophrenia than Howard's production. People said ""He made me really know what it is like to be schizophrenic."" Ha ha. Read the real story if you REALLY want to know what it is like to be schizophrenic. And look at the truth about the evil ""Black Bart"" Baer before deciding about the man.

Promotes the Human Element,"This is a story of a man, not just a boxer. We are never privy to all of the training and abuse Braddock must have been through. That's because we are as much a part of his family life and his dealings with the Depression as we are about the series of fights that he endured. He obviously was a great talent. The fact that he is held in such low esteem was a little surprising to me because he had not lost a fight. Granted, his injuries diminished his entertainment value and, as the film states, that's really what it was all about--tickets.But the real substance of the movie is Braddock and his family and the scenes where a man couldn't get work, even though he was able bodied and committed to the work. My parents told me that the word ""depression"" was more than an economic term at that time. Hope was taken away. The character represented as Braddock managed to maintain hopefulness and even had to debase himself to keep his family together. He was like millions of men and women. You could only do so much to hold it together.This is a film strong in cinematography. The fight sequences are very good. I don't know how anyone can step into a ring, knowing that another man is trying to knock your head off. The punches are seen landing. The endurance necessary to keep going for fifteen rounds had to be phenomenal. But the scenes of the depression are also beautiful framed. Not just the sadness but the joys people still create.

familiar but moving and triumphant just the same,"The producing-directing team of A Beautiful Mind crafted this true story of an impoverished Irish-American boxer from Jersey.

He takes an unsteady job as a longshoreman to support his wife and three kids until he's given a rare second chance to compete in the sport he loves, but at what cost? Not only an engaging sports bio, but also a close examination of domestic life and vivid reminder of the harsh reality that people faced while struggling to support themselves during a very bleak time in American history. Crowe looks stellar in the ring, but is equally good outside of it, and he's got admirable support from fiery Giamatti and empathetic Zellweger.

Well worn but worthwhile,"Dang, that Russell Crowe sure can take a licking and keep on ticking. I would have liked Cinderella Man a whole lot more if I hadn't already seen it at least a half dozen times, most recently in a Turner Classic screening of ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", with Paul Newman and Pier Angeli in the Crowe-Zellweger roles. ""Somebody"" inspired the Rocky series in the 70s after which karate had to be given its due, and most recently we saw Clint Eastwood's melancholy take on the gentle art.None of this is meant to take anything away from the acting or direction of this well-crafted but well-traveled story, which adds a new dimension by setting the action during the Depression. The character of James Braddock is given the burnished treatment of a mythical boxing hero: a ferocious animal in the ring, but a good-natured, loving man outside. Crowe renders this trope with his typically understated grace and intelligence, and the script gives him a lot to work with - as a former contender making a comeback during the 1930s, he has history on his side when tells a reporter the reason he fights is ""for milk"" for his family.Renee Zellweger seems so comfortable in the role of supportive mate that it required a look at her resume for me to realize that she has not played a similar part since she cut her teeth on the part of long-suffering Dorothy in Jerry Maguire. I look forward to seeing how she plays Janis in ""Piece Of My Heart"", which started production this year, according to IMDb.com.Although critics have raved about Paul Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, for the last 2 years, I haven't taken the bait. He may have been nominated for an Oscar for ""Sideways"", but that film would have been nothing without his three strong supporting actors. Although he tries, it's hard for us to picture the pasty, cerebral actor as a fight manager - even when he talks the talk, he almost sounds like he's explaining his approach to the role in front of Jim Lipton and an audience of hungry thespians. Placing Giamatti next to the legendary Angelo Dundee outside the ring might have sounded good, but it backfires.Apparently Max (""Jethro"") Baer, Jr., has taken Ron Howard to task for the movie's rendition of his father, the formidable heavyweight champion. Although Baer, Sr. did play a part in ending the lives of two of his opponents - one expired in the ring after a devastating blow to the head - the champ was said to have been tormented by guilt afterward. Even Jim Braddock, the model for Crowe's character, said that Baer was a genuinely good fellow who merely played the part of a villain to promote the sport of boxing. Apparently Howard found that to be an indispensable part for his movie, which graphically compares the horrors of the ring to the horrors of ""Hoovervilles"" in the 30s - as Braddock says in an argument with a leftist friend, ""you can't fight shadows,"" i.e., poverty and greed. Max Baer, whatever else he might have been, was definitely not a shadow, and the prospect of facing his lethal right hand causes Braddock some visible hesitation even after a string of upset victories.On one level, the movie is a commentary on human nature similar to ""Seabiscuit"": in difficult times we need heroes, two legged, four legged, or wherever we can get them. The title comes from a sportswriter's column referring to Braddock's return from obscurity and destitution.On another level, it is the story of one man's redemption. Jim Braddock may have had a gift that most men admire exactly because they lack it, but he too was faced with the breadline and might have lost his family and even his life except for a freakish bit of luck. Ron Howard and his lead actor never let us forget how close even a man of Braddock's apparently outstanding character and ability came to falling. It's a testament to this movie's quality that it conveys this theme so consistently while avoiding overstatement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Unoriginal, melodramatic & manipulative hooey!","I felt manipulated from beginning to end. The director and scriptwriter obviously do not respect the intelligence of their audience to manipulate us with such over the top melodrama. One example of the type of manipulation I am talking about is the scene with Crowe and the son when they are having the conversation that they will never give up their kids....and the son starts crying. Is this really necessary? They are poor, its hard times for the family....WE GET IT!!!Do we need to be hit over the head with this??I felt that so many of the elements in this film have been done before and done better in such films as ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"". The film never tried to be bold or original in its story telling.....it seemed just geared to please Oscar members...thats all. This film does not have the originality or complexity of other films released this year and SHOULD NOT be rewarded with any kind of nominations. If it does get noms...then Ron Howard will have succeeded in manipulating AMPAS. He didn't succeed in manipulating me and based on the mixed reviews and not entirely glowing reviews by most respectable critics.....he did not manipulate critics either.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Great Tale of Perseverance and Hope,"""Cinderella Man"" is a deeply moving and inspiring film that blends elements of sports, drama, and personal struggle. The story follows the life of James J. Braddock, a once-promising boxer who becomes an underdog during the Great Depression. The film showcases his determination to fight against all odds and provide for his family, making for an emotional and engaging journey.The performances are outstanding, with Russell Crowe delivering a powerful portrayal of Braddock, embodying both the physicality and emotional depth required for the role. Renee Zellweger is equally impressive as his supportive wife, whose resilience matches his own.

The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the tension high while allowing moments of reflection on the characters' lives outside the ring.

"A simple, moving and very human story about surviving and triumph","Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man' is the story of of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) and his wife Mae Braddock (Renee Zellweger). Howard gives us a glimpse through the ups and downs of their lives. In the beginning we see the Braddocks as a happy family and then we see them during the depression era: James struggling to find work at the docks, his fighting with a broken hand, giving his daughter his breakfast meal, Mae watching her children get ill, she and the children stealing wood from the sign to provide warmthwe are provided with many such hard hitting scenes. We see James trying to keep his head high until despair wins over when he begs for money to get his children back. Through it all the family stick together and their love and devotion to one another keeps them strong. Then things take a turn for the better, when Gould (his former manager) comes up with an opportunity to box. Braddock is back in the ring and continues climbing the ladder to success. He does not let success corrupt him. The Braddocks remain aware of where they have come from. In a wonderful restaurant dinner scene, we see Mae slip some meat in her purse (to feed the children at home). Mae tries her best to be supportive but she fears for his life and her fears become more apparent when James agrees to fight Max Baer.Howard's direction is good, nothing outstanding. There are several memorable scenes (some of which I've already mentioned) most of which is because of the actors' performances.Credit goes to Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti for turning this movie from good to great. Crowe fits his character like a glove and delivers one of his finest performances. His restraint makes his character human. His chemistry with Zellweger and with Giamatti stand out and make the scenes memorable. Zellweger is gold. Can this actress ever go wrong? Giamatti is outstanding. Check out his facial expression in various scenes especially the one where he requests McGill to take Braddock back. Bruce McGill is adequate and Paddy Considine does well (though his plot appears to deviate). Craig Bierko's Max Baer seems more like a typical one-dimensional villain, but then again, this is not his story.On the whole, this movie is more than worth a watch and one of my favorite 'boxing' movies. It's not just about winning but more about surviving. It's a wonderfully simple, moving and very human story even though it's predictable.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Made for the Oscars,"As much as Howard has captured the bleakness of the depression 30's era, and a well talented cast provides some good performances, Cinderella man is very much a formula picture where we all know how it is going to turn out, but will just go along with the ride.What I would call this ""Seabiscuit"" of boxing, is tailor made for the Oscars for its easy to identify story line and spirited typical feel good plot device.You know who the good guys are, and the bad guys are overplayed. So much so that Max Baer comes off as a complete psychopath in this film.If you like formula movies this one is tailor made for you, and the boxing scenes will leave you pummeled. I swear my hands hurt after watching this. But if you pine for something with a little more creativity and less paint by numbers I would steer clear of it.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A biographical sports drama,"""Cinderella Man"" is a 2005 biographical sports drama film directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe as James J.

As the Depression takes hold, Braddock loses his boxing career and is forced to take on grueling manual labor jobs to support his family.

A Tour-de-force acting of Rusell Crowe as a boxer desperately fights his way to save his family,"The legendary story of James J.

The violent boxing images shocked audiences and still retains quite power nowadays. It's a grueling boxing tale with tough realism full of face-blistering, punches, knocks in similar style to ¨Raging Bull¨. Impressive and breathtaking final combat between Braddock and Max Baer , in fact the stakes were 10 to 1 in favor of Baer . Top-notch acting by Russell Crowe as a good boxer in his usual hard-driving style along with his faithful wife marvellously performed by Renée Zellweger.

Typical journey through the formatted mangle,"Another boxing movie? Can nobody think of anything new? Obviously the Depression era is total news to today's Americans, but nary a hint in this picture that an economic depression is anything more than a force of nature, like the weather. Nor is there the slightest indication of any solution of the New Deal kind --- heaven forbid.Braddock and his wife are depicted as the ideal working class couple: devoted, devout and dutiful. Yep, it's ""family values"" territory. Wifey stays at home and takes in sewing (although we never see her sewing anything). Hubbie goes down and tries his luck as a navvy at the docks, when he can't get in a legal punch-up at Madison Square Gardens to earn some extra cash. It's enough to make the Bible belt go weak at the knees.When he is driven in desperation to take a welfare hand-out Braddock is depicted as profoundly humiliated and ashamed, and he actually turns up later with a wad of cash and pays it back --- as if his taxes and the human rights of his children did not merit the welfare payments. The conservative financiers of this picture (Ron Meyer/Universal and Miramax/Disney) would have lapped this up.I recommend to anyone fascinated by the climactic bout of this long, women-oriented flick to watch the video of the real thing that is included in the DVD package. They will see a sporting bout with no fireworks, and only a couple of sharp blows landed by either fighter. There's a clear winner on points and both fighters shake gloves at the end.In particular, they may be surprised to see in the genuine film the Baer character shown wearing a prominent Star of David on his trunks. Baer wore the star in honour of his Jewish father (although he was raised Catholic) when he fought Hitler's favourite boxer, Schmeling, and wore it thereafter. The star is unnoticeable in the movie's preposterously distorted version of the match, presumably because Baer was being built up as the big villain.In short the picture is a travesty, not only of the Depression era, but also of boxing history. Definitely avoidable.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ron Howard should take Russell Crowe to Disney World....,"I just can't say enough about Russell Crowe. Yet another, subtle, understated, nail-on-the- head performance. This guy is consummate! Too bad he won his Oscar for the wrong role. But hey, I guess he'll take what he can get. And a matching virtuoso directing job by Howard as well. The fight sequences were very effective, keeping me right in there with the clinches. Some have said that this is not a fight movie as much as a human-interest, character study. I find it eminently satisfying as both. I find myself fascinated, once again, with Howard's choice of subject matter and dedication to effective and entertaining presentation of the material. I really am not aware of all the liberties, if any, he has taken with the factual material, but as with ""A Beautiful Mind"" and many other such historical studies, I am not very concerned about them. I have always felt that movie directors should have as much literary license as other artists, since myth and legend is just as much an effective part of our culture as history and fact. I don't depend on movies for my knowledge of history, just as I don't depend on history texts for my amusement. As long as a film doesn't lie about the essentials of a story in a blatant attempt to mislead, it can still be effective and laudable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinderella Man and His Princess ***12,"""Cinderella Man"" beautifully captures the depression era when despair was constant and hope was nothing more than a dream. That dream is Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who captures the character. His talk, his walk, his style in the ring are all picture-perfect. You root for they guy because he is an underdog, a caring soul who gives back his relief money when things start to turn his way.The children have that depression look about them. You feel their hunger as well as their pride for their champion-bound father.Renee Zellwegger's finest hours come midway into the picture. I found her first part to be a contrived performance, best imitating a mixture of Alice Kramden and Sally Struthers. However, when the chips are down, she can pack an emotional wallop which the picture does as well.The scenes of Hoovervilles are realistic and compelling.Paul Giamatti has been nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Braddock's trainer. He is there all the way, especially in the fight scenes, giving much needed supported encouragement to Braddock.The film has been criticized for its depiction of Max Baer as a womanizer, and overall miserable character.The film may also promote an anti-boxing feeling given that Baer killed 2 people in the ring and seemed to get pleasure out of it. We must remember that Crowe, in the final analysis, is the real hero for fighting his way out of the depression as well as the emotional ""wallops"" that he takes as well in the ring.A memorable film which is well worth the effort.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Favourite from Ron Howard,"Great example of immersive storytelling.This movie sets stakes. All the time. It makes you pay close attention to the risks and rewards and invites you to be a part of the film by sharing in the concerns or contemplations of the film's characters. When they are worried, you are, when they root, you root. I can't even remember at which point in the film did I start liking the characters so much, in order to sympathise with them, I almost feel like it happened before the movie even began.It's probably because the movie's theme is set on such primal human virtues that we all can recognise are a part of us or at least deeply appreciate and wish they were, such as protecting the ones we love, doing the right thing in the face of danger, survival, camaraderie, having faith in people, having faith in yourself when no one has faith in you, having faith in others when no one has faith in them, taking risks and leaps, sacrifice and the list goes on.The movie explores all of these ideas in such a naturalistic, seamless, non-preachy ways, it doesn't feel like an implemented idea as much as an inevitability in this scenario.It was definitely worth the watch, and if you haven't seen it, don't be repulsed by the idea it's a boxing movie, you don't need to know boxing to enjoy this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Good but...,"I just watched Cinderella Man on DVD. It's a good movie: good story, good acting, good action, good setting, but still not quite there. The story is very well told. However, it's also quite clichéd. From the point when the Braddock family sank deep in the Depression, everything sounds too familiar. The rest of the film is the classical mix of melodrama: sickness, unhappiness, apprehension, quarrel... I don't have to wait till Renee opens her mouth to know what she's gonna say and how Crowe will reply. Also, too many films have already used boxing as their subject, which may I add is painfully short of variations. When there was Million Dollar Baby already last year, Cinderella Man doesn't seem fresh.It's a very well done movie. Yet it's built on a rather weak foundation that it simply can't make it up to the top tier however many buckets of tears it can win from the audience. Just as the Golden Globe has reflected, acting is its only big trump card.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It made me really like Russell Crowe!,"I finally watched this movie in January 2009. I should have seen it before, it was terrific! Maybe I subconsciously avoided Russell Crowe films.

The relationship she has with Crowe is so believable.The story is great. I suppose some would compare it to Rocky, but this was a true story. I really recommend it.Ron Howard's direction is superb.

Jim Braddock - people's champion,"If you are a fan of movies with a heart, such as Rocky or Seabiscuit, you will like Cinderella Man. Directed by Ron Howard, this movie is about gentleman Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who shows his dogged determination to overcome his underdog status in life and in the ring. After falling from a comfortable life with the onset of the Depression, he becomes an older and humbler man who must draw deep from within for the courage to eke out a living and do what is required for his wife and family.In his struggle, he has the undying support of his personal pillars - his wife (Renee Zellweger) and his trainer and friend (Paul Giamatti). Through it all, he never loses his large reserve of common sense or gives in to despair. He is rescued from the indignity of having to line up for work on a loading dock when he is offered the chance for comeback. Dismissed as a has-been, he struggles to regain his form. All along, the future of his wife and three children are uppermost in his mind.Before seeing this movie, I knew about the greats of the heavyweight boxing world...Johnston, Dempsey, Louis, Marciano and Ali but now, the name of Jim Braddock will come to mind. He was the hero of the downtrodden of New York (many were Irish like him) in the midst of the depression. He was a classy guy who went on to enjoy personal success. No one could deserve it more. In the Frank Capra tradition, this movie does what Hollywood does best, that is to inspire and show us how one individual can triumph in an ugly world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Great & Under Appreciated True Story,"Cinderella Man is a remarkable true story of an average heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock who against all the odds became heavyweight champion of the world during the depression era inter-war years.Ron Howard directs this superbly, using classy and intimate shots for the fight scenes but it is the tough depression backstory that he tells in excellent fashion which really elevates this movie. Crowe is perfect as a gentle and committed family man who happens to be a heavyweight boxer, and he plays both the in ring fight scenes and gentle family moments with his wife and kids with equal quality.In fact we have an all star cast with Renee Zellweger very believable as his wife and 1930's lady (she has that look somehow). It is however, Paul Giamatti who steals the show and puts in a career best performance and rightly received an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Manager & Coach to Braddock. He often gets thrown in to movies to give a fast talking comedic twist but he matches that here with real tenderness and compassion in his unwavering support for Braddock as both a boxer and a person.By the final fight we are rooting heavily for the underdog, and although I'm sure liberties were made with the movie adaptation of this true story, it is still nonetheless remarkable, and can be enjoyed in so many ways as an action movie, drama and period piece, that it deserves greater recognition than its modest box office returns merited.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

But who cares - the rest was stone brilliant. Paul Giometti should be a lock for best supporting actor - no way that performance is going to be forgotten come Oscar time. Russell Crowe was stellar. Great accent, totally ready for the role, conveyed a world of pain in the smallest ways. Totally believable.

Worth seeing!!,"This is a rich, poignant, full movie - full of real people, real life scenarios, real history, REALLY good performances and wonderful sets and camera work. I saw it yesterday afternoon and I am still affected by the sheer heart and soul of it. And, as Ron Howard can so magically do, I am still feeling a connection with the historical characters he brings to life on screen, such as in ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"". They linger in my mind as if I just spent a wonderful evening talking intimately with them over a few glasses of wine. Maybe it's because he deals with emotions in a direct and unsentimental fashion, and yet his respect for the human heart shines through. I dunno. I just know that I was deeply touched by this film from start to finish.Also, I am so pleased to finally see Russell Crowe playing a decent man (not a bully, a madman or a gladiator) in a major motion picture that mainstream America will see. Anyone who hasn't seen his delicate and convincing work in ""Proof"" and ""The Sum of Us"" (both Australian releases) still don't have a clue about this man's range and the depth of character he can somehow bring to his roles. Between his reputation as a bar brawler and the powerhouse characters he is famous for, not many Americans know this side of the man. The heart, decency and love inside of Jim Braddock comes through so convincingly that you ache for him ~ you can feel every punch, every indignity, every moment of despair as if he were sitting next to you. And yet, you CARE so darn much, you can't turn away.And Paul Giamatti (sp?) is incredible ~ funny, human, caring, cocky. This simply MUST be the year the Academy finally recognizes his work. His chemistry with Russell's character is very touching ~ even more so that with Renee Zellwegger (who does a credible job as the anxious wife.)

"""It's no joke, pal. People die in fairy tales all the time.""","FILM: 8.0
After having successfully collaborated for A Beautiful Mind four years earlier, director Ron Howard and star Russell Crowe reunite to take a shot at another biopic with Cinderella Man. Advertised as a true story, this film doesn't mind taking a few liberties to make the villains truly despicable, with Max Baer faring the worst in this respect, coming across as nearly comically villainous.Watching Cinderella Man, I am immediately struck by the strength of the performances. Russell Crowe delivers a compelling portrayal of Jim Braddock, capturing the essence of a man struggling against the odds. His dedication to the role is evident, and it's hard not to root for him as he battles his way back into the ring. Renée Zellweger is equally impressive as Mae Braddock, bringing warmth and resilience to her character.The production design is another standout aspect of the film. The 1930s are realised wonderfully, with detailed sets and costumes that transport me back to the Great Depression era. The bleakness of the period is palpable, yet there's a sense of hope and determination that permeates through the story.The boxing matches, while thrilling, have the usual Hollywood set-up: an insane number of punches, and little to no defence. Sure, it looks furious and keeps me engaged, but if fights really went punch for punch like this, both fighters would be knackered after three rounds. Despite this, the choreography and cinematography during these scenes are impressive, and they add to the film's overall excitement.One of the film's strengths is how it balances the personal and professional struggles of Braddock. It's not just about boxing; it's about a man fighting for his family and his dignity during tough times. The emotional depth adds layers to the narrative, making it more than just a sports film.Overall, my first watch of Cinderella Man leaves me largely impressed. It's a well-crafted biopic with strong performances, engaging storytelling, and a wonderful depiction of the 1930s. While it takes some creative liberties, it remains a compelling and inspiring film.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Cinderella Man: Film Review,"Released in theaters in 2005, this film Cinderella Man has earned its place among my personal favorites, within the Top 20 (at least). Based on a true story, this film is about the story of James Braddock and his boxing career during the late 1920's/early 1930's period. Once one of the greatest names in boxing, James Braddock went into a phase of bad luck with his boxing career getting worse and not to mention trying to survive during the Great Depression Era. With his wife and three children by his side, he does whatever he can to make money just to earn enough to pay for the electricity, heat, and even the milk. When things started to look worse for James Braddock; however, he gets a second chance in the boxing ring. This time, he is no longer fighting to stay on top. James Braddock is now driven to win for his family. Through this, he becomes a symbol of hope for the country and an inspiration for the American people living in the Great Depression. This story is a true underdog story.Other than the truly remarkable story, the performance from the top three actors and actresses (Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti) is superb. It is tough to say whether anybody else could play the role of James Braddock better than Russell Crowe, or even his boxing manager played by Paul Giamatti. Lately, all we see from Russell Crowe is the same old, same old; however, back in 2005 when he made this film Russell Crowe was actually pretty good. Not only does this film capture intense boxing matches, but it captures some of the harsh conditions of the Great Depression living conditions. Every scene in this film looks as though things might turn for the worst in an instant. However, James Braddock holds on for one more day and fights hard to keep his family going. Anyway, what makes this film so special is that it is based on a true story. I believe this film is among the best boxing films such as The Fighter and Rocky.If you are looking for a reason to hate this film, you will have a hard time trying to find one. If you are not into films with a long run time (two hours and twenty-five minutes) you might find this film unsatisfactory. As for me, I liked how this film played out, along with the runtime. They say this film is based on a true story, but I am pretty sure in some scenes the truth was bent by Hollywood for dramatic effect. Nevertheless, I believe the story wasn't affected in a negative way. If you are into boxing or any sport/drama films, this film is worth your time.In summary, with strong performances and incredible story this film will not disappoint you. I would recommend this film to whoever is interested.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"surprised, actually.","I began watching this and was completely roped in. From that opening shot, the grainy black and white photo of the boxer's jaw jutting at an impossible angle, and the it rocked right into live action. Also that opening quote about Jim Braddock was dang near perfect. I actually don't even like boxing movies, but there was something about Russell Crowes performance that was really solid and made you feel for him and the plight of his family. I think that's where it did get a bit thin for me -- the family dynamic. The kids really could have been drawn more fully -- but now that I write about it, it does't seem right. That probably would have only seemed like a easy way to make the audience feel pity. Speaking of family.... WHy does' Ron Howard keep putting his goofy brother in all his movies? Is that guy getting enough residuals from starring as a kid actor in GENTLE BEN? I don't know what that bothers me so much, perhaps because it takes me right out of the movie, makes me sit up and say, Oh, there's that goofy brother of Ron Howards again.... I'm sniping. I did like this movie. Good storytelling and Giamatti is fantastic -- He's so solid in everything he does.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Jewish boxer portrayed as a villain?  NO WAY!  What about Benny Leonard?,"A movie about James Braddock? Why not? He seemed like a good man, the salt of the earth, who overcomes all kinds of adversity to become the heavyweight champion. Not a bad story at all ... but so what? But if Hollywood is going to make a movie about boxing champions, how about making a movie about the life and career of Benny Leonard, arguably the greatest lightweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Carlos Monzon, arguably the greatest middleweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Barney Ross, who was world champion in three different weight classes and war hero? In fact, what about a movie about the life and times of Max Baer, who is portrayed as the ""bad guy"" in the movie, and who, by the way, wore the Star of David on his trunks, so how bad could he be? In fact, if Baer was such a bad guy, how could he have been the father of Max Baer, Jr. who played Jethro Bodine on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""? Any man who was the father of the actor who played Jethro Bodine could not have been all that bad of a guy. Max Baer was a boxer, boxing is a violent sport and naturally, and unfortunately, the contestants do get hurt or worse. But to imply that Max Baer was gratuitously violent is unfair, even for a movie. So, if you want to watch a movie about James Braddock, then this is probably the movie to watch, but don't come away thinking badly about Max Baer. Remember, if it wasn't for Max Baer, there may never have been a Jethro Bodine.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The best ever...,"You have to see this movie to believe that anything in life can be achieved. And this itself is the greatest achievement of this great movie. This is cinema at its best. The movie inspires you, motivates you and elates you. Russel Crowe, along with Edward Norton, is easily the actor of the generation. Its hard to believe that he did not get a nomination leave alone win the Oscar. But the real surprise was Rene Zewelleger. O boy! was she great in the movie!!

Review of the movie as it was intended.,"Reviewers, even those who claim the profession, often misinterpret the purpose of reviews, asking themselves how well the movie met their expectations rather than the more appropriate question, ""To what extent did the film achieve its intended purpose?"" Cinderella Man was quite purposefully not a documentary. For those looking for historical scholarship, they might try literature. However, it would be vulgar to cast this film as an inaccuracy. Though not a documentary, it is a biography, and the story of a person is as much about feelings as it is about facts. Doubtless, Jimmy Braddock was seen as a story of loss, hope, and heroism to the destitute in the New York area during the Great Depression. This is the story that Ron Howard is telling with the film.Howard attempts to transport the audience into the Depression and its perplexities through the story of one person. Slowly, Howard builds to a fever pitch at which point the audience feels the story multiplied by the thousands with the roar of the crowd in solidarity with the protagonist. To this end, Max Baer, stands between the hero and the goal like a final boss, making him the de facto antagonist. While some have protested the unfairness of this characterization, this was likely the way those listening on radios throughout Hooverville and the slums viewed the fight. Braddock was fighting the rich establishment with the odds stacked in their favor, their foots pressed firmly against the neck of the hapless poor. He represented the thrumming heart of a community who felt like their backs were against the wall.For those who cared enough to look into the career of Braddock, they likely learned that Max Baer was misrepresented in the film. It is unfortunate, but I assumed it understood that most major motion pictures contain very little in the way of fact. We watch films to experience the feelings of a story, and feelings are by nature distorted facts. Seeking to gain academic understanding through cinema is misplacing trust.So, how well was this story told? Are there specific changes that could have been made to improve the telling or the experience of the audience?I thought every character besides Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) and Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) was underdeveloped and thin. It felt like about 2 hours were cut from the script. Braddock's wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) was unbelievable as written. She was only saved thanks to Zellweger's simplicity and honesty in her acting. The story was a 6 as written. However, brilliant directing, exceptional cinematography, and Crowe and Giamatti acting in roles they were born for, resulted in a powerful movie that achieved its purpose with near perfection - the sum total was worth much more than the parts, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Dreams and the Common Man,"There is very little that a determined individual cannot do. Cinderella Man is a case in point. Thought of as an 'over-the-hill' boxer, the fanciful story of James Braddock (adroitly played by Russell Crowe) is a movie which should be seen by anyone who needs a second chance in life. Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident. The film itself is occasionally enhanced by tragic emotional segments which tends to argument the action sequences, but not so much as to diminish the overall structure of the movie. All in all, Crowe and his co-stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destine to please audiences for generations to come. A fun and compassionate film for those with heart. ***",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

You've seen it before but it is still professionally effective,"Once a young, promising boxer injury and back luck has seen Jim Braddock turn in one poor fight after another to the point where he is stripped of his boxing license and forced to looked for other work to support his wife and young children. This career change comes just as the country enters an economic depression and, like the rest of the country Jim and his family struggle to get by. Eventually he is forced to swallow his pride and start collecting welfare to get by. An injury to another fighter ahead of a big night gives Jim one last payday as his agent manages to talk the commission into letting him back due as nobody else will do it at short notice. Jim takes the fight for the money but knows that a win could start him back again  but he has no idea how important this fight is for more than just him.People on this site are praising this film and also wondering why it ""flopped"" (which is arguable but I'll let it stand) but to me it is perfectly understandable because the film is nothing wonderfully brilliant and is very much a package deal that perhaps people weren't in the mood for. I'm not sure if it is the presence of Crowe, Zellweger or what but here we are. What I mean by a ""package deal"" is that this is another one of those sports movies that follows the ""against all odds"" rise of the ""little fella"" when the rise takes on significant to the community/country. The obvious parallel is Seabiscuit and in a way Cinderella Man does the same thing in the same sort of way. So the sense of period is done really well through costumes and sets, the cast has big names, the big sporting events (in this case the fights) are done with a touch of slow-motion and, as the crowd rises, so does the music; whether you like it not, when they are done right they are very good at sweeping you up in the feelings.Cinderella Man is no exception and it does it all with a professional polish and grand sweep. The details of the story are different but essentially it is the same film and unlikely to be considered ""great"" on its own terms  because it doesn't really have any. That said, it is another good film in this mould and by the end, when the music came up at the end, of course I was into it. Crowe does well to hold back his usual arrogance to be quite a polite figurehead for the film and makes it easy for you to get behind his character even if you don't like him as a person. Zellweger doesn't quite manage the same feat though, and her pained look and trademark whine was quite annoying to me and I didn't like her performance. Giamatti embraces the trainer cliché and makes it work for him while support from Considine, McGill and others help round out a starry cast. Howard directs with a sturdy hand, doing well with the fight scenes in particular; it isn't all down to him but I did think he let the sweeping meaning of the final fight get away with him a little bit but to be honest by then I was swept up in it myself.Cinderella Man is nothing new or remarkable but it is still an easily enjoyable and warming sports movie in the mould of Seabiscuit and the like.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Its a good movie, but its a bit overrated","Good performances by all (I particularly liked Paul Giamatti). Howard didn't not try to strangle the movie with smurfy moments with the kids. The boxing matches got the blood up. But... eh. No great lesson to learn about life (other than to not give up, to show tenacity in the face of adversity, blah, blah blah). Nothing to ponder upon. I think the genius of Howard is that with this incredibly formulaic story, he managed not to overly bog it down with schmaltz, or loose tension throughout the movie. But it is a real formulaic story.It gets a plus for not avoiding to show uglier aspects of the Depression. It gets a minus for lying about Max Baer in order to make him look more like a villain.Maybe its me. Maybe I need more existential angst in a movie. Maybe these glowing comment reviews with almost no negative ones irk me. I never did like Rocky. But Million Dollar Baby was a much better boxing movie. Its a disgrace that Cinderella Man got killed in the box office by junk like Revenge of the Sith, or the Longest Yard, but this movie does not belong in the top 250 list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb Film,"Yesterday was Father's Day and, as usual, my kids took me and their mama to the movies. It is something that I like so it's very cool. The film du jour was Cinderella Man.First we had Rocky and then there was Raging Bull. Now we have James J. Braddock, the Cinderella Man. First and foremost let me say that this is easily the best film of the year, to date. It's a boxing film that isn't a boxing film. It leads you from good times in the twenties to the dire consequences of the depressive thirties. It's the story of a man, his wife, and his children. It's the story of the fat and the lean. It's the story of what you see isn't always what is real. It's the story of pride, passion, and existence. All told, it's a beautiful story.Russell Crowe plays Jimmy Braddock. Russell, well, is Russell, and that's a good thing, he gets so deeply into this role that you want to cheer with and for him. You want to weep with and for him. I left the theater wanting to hug him, what a role, what a character. Renée Zellweger plays Mae Braddock, Jimmy's wife. She is a typical wife of the time, she wants to make Jimmy happy, loves him to death and rears their children with so much love that you want to hug her as well. Paul Giamatti is Jimmy's manager. If Paul gets overlooked for supporting actor for this role, I'm going to give up Oscar. There is a scene with Jimmy and his son, Jay, played by Connor Price that makes you want to tear your heartstrings out. Opie, er, Ron Howard has his best directing effort yet. I told my son that I think Ron may well be the finest director of his day, and he's right up there with any day, yesterday and tomorrow. The entire supporting cast is simply wonderful. I wanted to strangle Max Baer, played by Craig Bierko. The fight scenes are well choreographed, maybe a bit bloody, but it's a bloody sport. I can see this film getting multiple Oscar nominations, even if it is early in the film season, it's that powerful. This is not a movie easily forgotten.Did I mention that I liked this film? I highly recommend it to all..........",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Uplifting and inspiring but could be more entertaining,"There is no denying that Cinderella Man is a feel-good movie. The true story of Depression-era boxer James Braddock is among the most uplifting that sport has to offer. The film does a great job of bringing that story to life. It draws you in in such a way that it is impossible not to be a huge James Braddock fan by the time the final scenes play out. You see what makes this amazing man tick, the love he has for his family, the willingness to do anything for those he loves. You see the courage and determination that was required just to get by in this poverty-stricken time. You see this seemingly broken, beaten-down fighter show the heart of a champion. You see all this and you can't help but be inspired as Braddock's amazing story plays out before you. But there's the sense that something's missing. For all that this film has going for it there is a certain energy missing. It takes a while to get going and while there are bursts of energy throughout that energy is never really sustained. The pacing, or rather the lack of pacing, keeps a very good movie from being something truly great.While the story may move a little slowly at times the fact does remain that it is a truly wonderful story. And the actors who bring this story to life all do a tremendous job. As Braddock, Russell Crowe gives another in a long line of remarkable performances. Balancing the heart of this amazing family man with the strength of this amazing champion is no small feat and Crowe is to be commended for pulling it off so brilliantly. Very few actors would have been up to the task. Also reliably terrific is Paul Giammati as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. Giammati may seem a little over the top at times in his portrayal but it works. Much of the energy the film does have comes from him. Portraying Braddock's wife, Renee Zellweger is solid if not spectacular. This is clearly Crowe's film all the way and Zellweger is left to play off of him and she does so admirably. Other familiar faces including Bruce McGill, Paddy Considine and Craig Bierko have smaller, but still important, roles and each of these actors also turns in fine work.So what we have is a terrific story which is wonderfully performed. Should be an absolute knockout. But Cinderella Man never quite hits the heights one might hope. It's certainly a very good film, one worth seeing especially if you need a little pick-me-up. You can't help but be inspired. But you may wish you were a little more entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The First ""10"" in MANY years !","I must tell anyone who reads this review, that this movie is the first movie I have given a score of ""10"" since Schindler's List back in 1993.

This picture had everything right on the money according to a very good friend of mine who grew up in the era this film depicted. The authenticity was simply as accurate as I could have ever imagined. This movie should win several Academy Awards, actor, actress, supporting actor, and director.

charming and mature,"Russel Crowe and Ron Howard are a really good combination and their efforts have been once again compounded for creating a great biopic.

Finally, the comparison with ""Million Dollar Baby"" doesn't stand up too much coz that movie was more tear jerker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Hoary boxing-movie clichés abound!,"Heavyweight champ James J. Braddock looks back on his humble beginnings as a washed-up boxer during the Depression with a broken hand and a revoked license who struggled to take care of his wife and three kids. Director Ron Howard builds every scene as if it were something extraordinary; though this isn't always a bad thing, even the filmmaker's throwaway bits--such as a married couple fighting in front of a church or a man walking out on his wife--are hammered home with little subtlety. The flashback segue shoehorned-in at about the seven-minute mark is the equivalent of a speedbump, merely serving to put us on the defensive. The leading actors look pained or perplexed, although Russell Crowe does have some strong scenes as Braddock (even if our introduction to him, smugly collecting his money after a fight, rings curiously sour). Renée Zellweger, playing Braddock's fiercely devoted wife Mae, gets the worst scenes; sewing under a single lamp, her kids always tucked away off-screen, she's stuck with lines like, ""When you get hit, I feel it, too"". This is the passive, loving movie-wife we've seen since the beginning of time, and Zellweger does nothing original with it; worse, the two stars have no screen chemistry whatsoever, and their dialects and acting styles clash. The smaller roles are filled with scenery-chewing overachievers, and Howard is shameless in allowing them to go for broke (everything is done 'colorfully', for effect, and the film plays like a ham sandwich). This true story comes hilariously ""pre-approved"" with a quote from Damon Runyan, with period detail that is careful but disappointing. The whole enterprise suffers from boxing fatigue. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

How the desire and the love of their ones can make a regular man a hero for them. About the other boxer.. i actually don't think he was portrayed in a wrong way.. we seems a gentleman.. tough (of course he is boxer also) and famous. What we see is from the point of view of the main character of the story. And probably he wasn't laughing because he kill someone, but for sure what i see is the adrenaline going to top fighting to keep his championship. Or people expect him to knockout someone and been able to have lovely eyes. They are fighting not blessing the people.. So he was portrayed as he was a fighter.

An indomitable America coming back.,"""Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep . . ."" HamletJames J. Braddock lived in the Depression Era and fought for his family's life while defeating Max Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world in 1935. Ron Howard directs Russell Crowe in the titular role with an obvious affection for depicting the difficult financial times, the fighter, and the actor. Comparisons to Seabiscuit, both racehorse and film about him, are inevitable and flattering on all sides. Comparisons to ""Rocky"" go only as far as boxing and the rise and fall and rise again of thoroughly American heroes. Crowe is far superior to Stallone; Braddock is the real thing, Rocky is a fiction. The authentic boxer is more compelling by the nature of the reality Howard meticulously recreates.I am always intrigued how a director can draw the audience into a drama when most already know the plot. But then Greek dramatists, and Shakespeare with his borrowed plots, have been doing that for centuries. Howard succeeds in making us care about this decent man with a gift, struggling in a time when the best were broken by the stock market crash of 1929. Much of the film chronicles Braddock's string of bad luck, most importantly a broken hand at the peak of his career, and the ambivalence of his wife, who would prefer he not fight anyone, much less the champ, who already killed two men in the ring.In the struggle between husband and wife, I find strains of the Ron Howard missing auteur-ship because of his penchant for the sentimental. Too much time in this overly long biography is taken with the debate over whether or not Braddock should fight; we get the idea early on that no loving wife would want her husband to take a pounding that sometimes actually loosens the brain from the cranium. So Howard should get on with what he does extremely well, depicting the drama of the actual fights in the ring and in the offices of the commissioner, who once suspended Braddock's license for poor fighting and threatens to deny him the chance at world champion Max Baer.That Braddock goes on to lose to Joe Louis is of little consequence for this film, just a footnote after the Baer fight. What is of real interest is that Ron Howard has grown as a filmmaker who can depict character and times in equal measure, Russell Crowe is an actor of enormous subtlety, and James Braddock was a true American hero, a fighter who came back, a symbol of an indomitable America coming back from economic failure.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Disappointingly routine sports biopic,"While I enjoyed this movie very much watching it, it's resonated with me so little I'd tell anyone who asks that it's just okay. I'd give it a slight recommendation, but only as a period piece, b/c it does a somewhat moving job recapturing the feel of the Great Depression. The characters are so flat I felt like I never even met them. The hero is just a complete saint and the villain so evil he brags about the fact that he killed an opponent. And of course, the hero must win so that he can keep his angelic family together and happy. When they pile stuff on like that, of course it's completely obvious what's gonna happen.Perhaps some more focus on Braddock's career would have established him as an underdog much better. As it is, we see his early great days, then jump ahead to the depression where we see how much pain his family's in, and when he decides to box again it's mentioned in passing how his career went downhill after one fight. We do see a fight where he does poorly, but that's not enough. The championship match is apparently the greatest upset in boxing history, and I wasn't getting that vibe at all.Perhaps some more focus on the depression would have been better. Paddy Considine had a memorable supporting character, but he's barely there. I think some newsreel clips or some more stuff in the ""Hoovervilles"" would have been great. The tagline says Braddock brought America to its feet when it was on its knees, so maybe if I got a better sense of how on its knees the country was the victory would have been much more inspiring. As it is almost everything is about Braddock and his wife, and they have such great hearts that of course they can't wind up unhappy! Maybe it would have been better if they gave the wife part to a character actress, instead of Renee Zellwegger who'd insist on hogging screen time. Oh excuse me, ACADEMY AWARD WINNER RENEE ZELWEGGER! Of course I'm biased b/c I can't stand her, so even though I love Russell Crowe I definitely didn't care about the family's togetherness.Perhaps some more focus on the opponent Max Baer would have been great. I heard the new book about the fight by Jeremy Schaap focuses on both fighters, and that sounds like an interesting read. Apparently Baer spent the rest of his life remorseful about the fighter he killed, and he was one of the most popular champions ever. In the movie he's such a monster I couldn't take him seriously-the character was out of place in a drama as serious in tone as this one. I at least liked the goofy charm Craig Bierko brought to the part, in what I hope's a star making performance. Baer seemed kind of like a dopey monster as played by him-he actually reminded me of Biff in Back to the Future. Again, not a serious threat, but the only character who I thought brought some life to the proceedings. Paul Giamatti's one of my favorite actors, but I just thought he was given a typical gruff trainer role to work with here.The movie's been mentioned as the first serious Oscar contender of the year, but I think the only areas where it deserves consideration are art decoration and cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I really hope this movie doesn't win many if any awards, there are plenty of contenders who deserve recognition more than this uninteresting movie. Renée Zellweger was decent in it but again it wasn't a performance worthy of any gratuitous attention. There are many bad shots in the movie, and they need to work on their lighting and sound skills. For such a Hollywoodized production you'd think they wouldn't mix shots of light and darkness for one scene (one in particular, when they were outside of the church) and the sound wouldn't crackle so much but maybe that is a theater problem.

a fantastic movie,"I have heard so many people talk about how much they disliked Cinderella Man and how it shouldn't have such a high rating on IMDb. I, on the other hand, consider this nothing short of an amazing achievement in acting, storytelling, directing, as well as choreography. I wasn't the biggest fan of Russell Crowe UNTIL THIS FILM! His portrayal of Jim Braddock completely altered my perception of him as an actor. His performance is so heartfelt, so honorable, it really gets to you while you're watching the film that he (Jim Braddock) and all of the other people who lived in during Depression era USA, are much stronger and tougher than we are now. Just watching this film inspires me to become a more wholesome man like Jim Braddock. The fight choreography is incredible, every fight looks as if you're the one receiving the punches to the face. The story is told masterfully, with the perfect combination of family, personal anguish and triumph, and ultimately, the perfect unfolding of Jim's quest for the title.

True talent shines from Blatant Sentimentalism,"Joe Gould says in the movie 'People are sentimental.."", I am sure the crew of this movie is! The story and the screenplay does some very overt attempts at tugging at the heart strings. Succeeds at times. I am not sure if putting subtler dialogs and scenes would have helped. There are some characters that are made fairy tale-ish one dimensional. Like Max Baer or Jimmy Johnston. Or Jimmy Braddock himself.But that being said, it is an excellent movie. Russel Crowe is brilliant. The helplessness, the power, the integrity he can bring on his face is amazing. Insider, LA Confidential, Gladiator, Beautiful Mind and this one.. he has perfected his nuances. Paul Giamatti is also amazing. He should be getting meatier roles after his last two performances. Craig Bierko pulls a pretty fine Max Baer. Its not hard to imagine his Max Baer as a Hollywood star and a ""Clown and a Killer"".Only (a very very tiny) disappointment in acting Renée Zellweger.

Uplifting Film Powered By Unconventional Story!,"Two years ago, during the summer of 2003, I was working at a movie theater in my home town. ""Seabiscuit"" was playing and this particular showing was on a run-of-the-mill Wednesday night. As the show was breaking, I opened the door to the house and saw the ending and the audience applauding. The result was the same when I saw the film a week prior on a Sunday afternoon. The new film, ""Cinderella Man,"" had the same effect on the audience the night I saw it. The movie is so inspiring and uplifting in the classic sense of Hollywood splendor, that one finds themselves moved to tears and cheering on the hero of the show. What makes this unique is the fact that this audience is in a movie theater. What we see on the screen is not live. Yet we feel transformed to Madison Square Garden during that amazing night in June of 1935 when James J. Braddock took on Max Baer for the Championship of the World. It is as close to the real thing as we can get these daysand what an experience it is at that. It is what makes going to the movies so magical.""Cinderella Man"" tells the story of once great boxer Jim Braddock played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Early on in his career, Braddock made lots of dough and was adored by family and fans. But after the stock market crash and during the Great Depression, his career goes down the tubes and his abilities dwindle as a fighter. He struggles to find work at the pier and to keep his family fed. It leads to desperate measures on the part of his son to stealing salami from a butcher, his wife sending their children to relatives because they cannot afford to take care of them, to Braddock having to beg for cash. After a time, Braddock's old manager Joe (Paul Giamatti) comes to him with an opportunity by chance to make some quick cash in the ring. SinceBraddock realizes the hardships he has faced, he takes the opportunity for exactly what it isan opportunity. To him, it is more than just a fight or something he loves; it is a chance to see Madison Square Garden again, a chance to hear the roar of the crowd. And a chance to show his children that he still has what it takes to be a champ. Braddock wins the fight and amazes the audience who barely remembered his existence. He generates a comeback and starts to win fights regardless of his age or condition. This is because his reasons for boxing have changed, ""This time around I know what I'm fightin' formilk!"" He has a family and needs to support them. However, the chances become far more dangerous when Braddock is asked to fight against Max Bear, a boxer who killed two men in the ring with his power punches to the head. Regardless of the danger, Braddock agrees to go ahead with the fight, even against his wife's urges to get out of it. It all leads to a stirring finally that will leave the audience breathless and emotional.One of the film's most touching moments comes when Braddock realizes that his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) has sent their children away to relatives because they can no longer afford to take care of them. He is deeply upset because he has made a promise to his son that no matter how bad things would get, he would never send the children away. As a desperate measure, he goes to see his old bosses and asks for any money they can spare. He holds out his hat and most drop some coins or a few dollars in. We see Crowe's face at this point, his eyes welling up. You feel his humility and how pathetic his existence has become by begging for money. And yet, he is not a beggar. He simply has nothing left and it is easy to sympathize with him.There are excellent uses of cinematography in this picture. As the film opens, the camera shots are steady as we see Braddock as a winner in his early days, living in a nice home in New Jersey with plen ty of worldly possessions. Then, as we see Braddock and his family living in a slum apartment, the camera shots become shaky and convey the lack of stability in his life. Some great moments of editing occur during scenes where Braddock gets injured. There is a slow motion shot of the blow to the body. Then the screen goes white momentarily with an ex-ray shot of Braddock,conveying the severity of the pain.What truly makes ""Cinderella Man"" go beyond the predictable aspect of an uplifting story is Braddock's merit for his comeback. He is no longer fighting with his passion for the sport or to gain a higher place in society. He fights so his children can eat and be brought up in a home with heat. What began as a man motivated by passion brought down by ability and circumstance, becomes a man motivated by the ability to exist and provide for his family. That, in and of itself, is the true greatness of this film. (***1/2 out of ****)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best sports movie ever made.,"Hollywood has shown it's true colors. By not even nominating the movie that should have been the best picture of the year, we can really see that it's all politics. This movie was so unbelievably good, the acting was more than first rate, everyone in it should have won academy awards! Watching this movie, you really see what it was like to live during the depression, but you see the determination of this boxer, and the love he and his family members had for each other. It's a real feel-good movie, whether you like boxing or not (and I never did before.) There isn't a moment in the movie where my attention wasn't held. I couldn't turn away for a second. It made me want to watch it again as soon as it was over! The only thing I didn't like is that it makes Max Baer out to be a monster, and I know from older people who actually lived through this time and followed his career, that he wasn't. But that was it, the only thing about the movie that wasn't good. It was absolutely the best, and I would recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Way Underrated,"This is easily the most underrated movie in film history. How could this have gotten snubbed so bad by the Academy? It's one of a few movies that literally sends chills down my spine when I watch it. It is a great story of what it means to be a good father, good husband, and most of all, a good person. It sends the viewer on an emotional roller coaster throughout the entire movie, and the suspense is at high levels throughout. You see Braddock at the both the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Crowe is perfect for this role, as is Giomatti for his character. And of course, Renee Zellweger captures the heart of us all as she tries to keep her composure in order to raise her family amidst the terror of the Depression. This movie cannot be missed. It is easily in my top 5 of best movies ever. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A nice movie about boxing...,"Ron Howard, the chronicler of the American Dream, the man who loves the happy endings with hurrays and violins strikes back with a new biopic (after ""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the life-story of John Nash), with a new story of long-suffering people who eventually get a well deserved reward. Well, who's the chosen one this time? It is Jim Braddock, a second rate boxer that won the Heavy Weights title in the years of the Great Depression. That way he became kind of a symbol for all the helpless people that were having a real bad time in those days.""Cinderella man"" have such a nice setting and an awesome production, the ones only the big Hollywood studios can provide. The boxing sequences are rather realistic (this is not ""Rocky"", the fighters don't punch in the nose each other 200 times by round), and the recreation of sweaty and filthy boxing world is superb (it will satisfy even the more fussy). Anyway, there's not much to say about boxing, there are hundreds of movies which talk about that sport.Russel Crowe plays Jim Braddock and he makes an awesome show of strength and charisma, he'll probably won the Oscar (that would be his second one, and his fifth nomination in 6 or 7 years). Renee Zelweeger plays the so loving and sympathetic wife of Braddock's. This woman looks like she's got rooted in Bridget Jones' character (please, no more pouting!!!), maybe with 30kg under. And last (but not least) we got Paul Giamatti, one of the actors of the moment. He plays Braddock's best friend and unselfish manager, and he plays it just brilliantly (he should win an Oscar as well).In short: a new Ronnie Howard's hit, a good film that belongs to a genre which has been so mistreated there in Tinseltown. It is not as good as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Fat city"", but it's surely worth watching.... oh, and God bless America!*My rate: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The haunting presentation of a much-told plot.,"A middle-aged man with three kids at home and a wife he forever loved, struggling through tough financial conditions in a society that has played hard on him, becomes a mass hero after his miraculous rise to fame.Yes, I've heard and seen such stories numerous times before. I know how this hero keeps idealism even under extreme poverty, I know what words he speaks when he tells his wife it'll be okay, I've seen how he remembers what he's fighting for every time he's down, I've seen how his faithful and loving wife always provides him support, and I know how common people always casts him as their idol in the struggle through life.Yet, when I see ""Cinderella Man"", I shed a couple of tears at two places, I sit tight holding my breath each time Braddock receives a punch, and I clap after the last fight. The passionate work by Ron Howard and the haunting performance by Russell Crowe makes me almost one of the thousand 'ugly Jersey friends' that supported Braddock that night.

"A good, but flawed, film.","Having just seen ""Cinderella Man,"" I am left with mixed feelings; there are things that I absolutely loved, but then again also an equal number of things that just disappointed me. Granted, I was not looking forward to seeing this film; from the trailer, it looked as if it were going to be a hackneyed, contrived hankie-wringer aimed solely at the heartstrings of Oscar voters and grandmothers. Now, having seen the film, this preconceived notion is both corroborated in some ways and dispelled in others. Let me proceed first with the latter.First: Paul Giamatti is outstanding. I can definitely see a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nod for him here as Russell Crowe's longtime manager and coach. In my opinion, he is the very best aspect of this film. His accent is dead-on (more about accents later, with respect to Ms. Zellweger especially), his execution is layered and nuanced without ever bringing his motives into question--he took what could have been a very one-dimensional character and truly brought him to life.Also, Mr. Crowe has turned in yet another excellent performance as the titular Runyonesque fighter, James J. Braddock. His tremendous chemistry with all of his colleagues truly brings a close ensemble feel to what otherwise might have been perceived as a loosely-drawn bunch of Depression-era ragamuffins. His rapport not only with Mr. Giamatti (which at first may seem like an unlikely pairing turns out to be spot-on) and also with the children--and even the insufferable Renee Zellweger--truly lends the sympathy that is so essential to successful execution of this film. Although this may not be as complex a role as John Nash, or even dare say Jeffrey Wigand, he still, much in the vein of Mr. Giamatti, pulls off an excellent deepening of the film's protagonist.The film truly centers around the fight scenes, which I found to be expertly choreographed, shot and edited. They were, much like those in ""Raging Bull"" and, more recently, ""Million Dollar Baby,"" extraordinarily involving. Do not be surprised if you find yourself throwing small punches in your seat as you watch these thoroughly immersing and lavishly entertaining sequences--not only great for the action itself, but also for the brilliant interplay between Mr. Crowe and Mr. Giamatti, hearkening images of De Niro and Pesci some 25 years ago.Finally, the overall film-making itself is top notch. Ron Howard, ever the picture of a well-polished storyteller is in his usual good form. Although the direction itself sometimes seems to range from heavily-involved and moving (the fight scenes) to distant and sluggish (the non-fight scenes--to be discussed in a moment), his hands are certainly some of the most competent in the business for delivering such a large-scale film while still retaining artistic credibility (not mentioning any recent sandal-and-toga epics.) However, the time has now come to examine some of the films pitfalls. First, the writing is stilted and, except during the fight scenes, rather false-sounding. The dialogue--especially Ms. Zellweger's--sounds as if she had written herself crib notes a few minutes before she prepared to say anything and then snuck a peek at them when the time came to whine whatever it is that she wanted to say. Coming from a tried-and-true--and Academy Award-winning--writer of the ilk of Akiva Goldsman, I expect more out of such a script.However, the film's principal problem is not the writing, but rather every scene that takes place outside of a boxing arena--i.e. every scene including Ms. Zellweger. These copious exhibitions of Mr. Braddock's unflappable integrity and love for his family, even in spite of the squalor in which they lived, were very nice, but truly dragged the pace of this film to a grinding halt. These lumbering scenes, which endeavored so to have dramatic weight and impact, only left the viewer looking at his/her watch until the next fight scene came. But, of course, they were necessary; they just felt so stagy which, of course, is perfectly fine if performed on a stage, but cinema is a medium in which actions are magnified thousandfold over live theater and, as such, steps must be taken to compensate. The film's ""dramatic"" scenes simply have a heavy flamboyance to them that screams for much-needed dilution.And now the unfortunate time has come to examine the absolute worst aspect of this film, Ms. Renee Zellweger, as Mr. Braddock's long-suffering wife Mae. I cannot understand the fame that Ms. Zellweger has managed to accrue for herself in light of her inability to deliver any sort of dramatic integrity to her roles. She comes off as a puckered, whining nag who, for the strong performance of Mr. Crowe, is simply eclipsed, leaving the viewer asking the question of why such a big-name actress was needed for such an overshadowed role (which I am convinced was blown up exponentially in order to give Ms. Zellweger screen time)? Not only is the rhythm with which she speaks distracting and irritating (it sounds as if she has sleep apnea even while awake), but her phony dialogue is not improved at all by her guttersnipe boo-hooing, as Henry Higgins might call it. Contrived lines such as ""...you are the champion of my heart"" (pronounced by Ms. Zellweger as ""haht,"" in perhaps the most phony North Jersey accent ever committed to celluloid--she would have been much better off using her own, undoctored voice) are likely to induce cringing and perhaps even nausea, as Ms. Zellweger's purveying of them does not improve at all their overwrought schmaltz. Ms. Zellweger is simply abhorrent and is one of the film's very biggest drawbacks.The quality of the film-making itself is top-notch, no corners cut, but even though the film is technically successful, dramatically it certainly is not. It simply has the look and feel of a 1950s formula studio picture, only sans the Dore Schary producer credit. Proceed with caution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"An astounding, inspiring film from Russell Crowe!","Chris Rock actually said it best during his opening monologue 3 1/2 months ago at the Kodak Theatre. ""If you're doing a movie about the past, you bet's to get Russell's ass.""When I left the sneak preview screening on Sunday afternoon, my expectations were not just met, they where exceeded and then some. I'm ashamed now for doubting this film at all, and I did. The cast looked too perfect, the trailer too manufactured to win Oscars and a crew and tech team to die for. It looked too good to be true. Well, it IS that good. Cinderella MAN is hands down the best film I have seen in 4 years. And in the theatre today, I was not alone in that thought. The entire packed theatre could be seen to be sniffing and wiping away tears at multiple points in the film, cheering and clapping for Braddock all the way and on the absolute edge of their seat for the entire final fight. I knew how is was going to end, and I my heart felt like it was going to have an attack. The guy next to me was dodging the punches with Crowe. The film is that good.The entire cast gives great performances all around and there are definitely noms heading towards Zellweger and Giamatti. Paul G., for that matter has a real shot at the win, and right now hes easily the front runner, helped by being snubbed for his turn as Miles last year in the wine-road-trip flick SIDEWAYS. Can the Academy give Best Supporting Actor to boxing trainers two years in a row? It is definitely possible. Especially if Giamatti can ride the wave of Cinderella MAN love which I guarantee will be rejuvenated by a timely December DVD release and maybe even a return to the theatres. But ultimately, like every film he's in, this picture is about Russell Crowe. What more can you say about an actor you goes from bad cop to gladiator, schizophrenic math genius to 19th-century ship captain, and then to a real-life boxer from 1930's New Jersey? What can you say? Possibly Oscar number two. Russell Crowe commands the film from start to finish and you can't help but notice that his marriage and new son have really loosened him up and actually probably helped him get into this role, a character you can't help but love and cheer for.The sets, cinematography and costumes are all Oscar worthy and will most likely land nominations. And Thomas Newman has a nomination in the bag and a huge shot at the win hes been depraved of for like the last 10 years. Newman's win for Best Score is extremely probable even if Cinderella MAN fails to win Best Picture or anything else come this March. He'll probably receive the win as a consolation prize if CM doesn't land anything else a la FINDING NEVERLAND this year. And the lighting for the film is so rich and the best work I've seen since the first couple of seasons of The West Wing.My only complaint about the film is that Craig Beirko's Max Baer, the ""villian"" of the flick who actually really did kill two men in the ring in the 1930's was at times, a little over-the-top in the ""I'm the bad guy"" department. The thing is, even with him hating Braddock a little too much, the rest of the film is so solid that we don't really care at all.Russell Crowe's second Oscar (which he really should have won in 2001 for ABM) is not a given -- nor is Cinderella MAN winning Best Picture come March 3rd. There are a number of hurdles. For one, it has to keep buzz and be remembered in awards season. And two, it has to generate a respectable box-office. However, people who see this movie will not stay quiet. And Universal knows this. Why put out 739 sneak peaks on Sunday if you don't think people will talk about how awesome your film is? People are going to talk. And already it has flat-out raves from all the biggest trade papers -- Variety and The Hollywood Reporter -- as well has Ebert and Roeper giving it ""Two thumbs, way, WAY, up"". Buzz for this film is going to be huge and if the big applause at the end of my screening was any indication, this one could go all the way. It has the cast, it has the size, and it has a heart the size of Madison Square Gardens.If Steven Spielberg's VENGEANCE or Rob Marshall's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA aren't big hits, then this is your winner for 2005's Best Picture Oscar.Cheers, Joshua Lawson",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Decent at best and getting over rated,"Not much for me to really say here. I do not like Ron Howard as a director. I find his style to border on ""emotional manipulation"" What I mean is that there always has to be a ""good guy"" and a ""bad guy"" in his films. Also, He is most unfair to Max Bear, portraying him as a type of lunatic Mr.T ala Rocky 3.Basic story told over and over many times.""Once a great talent, had bad luck, down in the dumps, 2nd chance, makes good."" Howard, as I have said before, just goes out of the way to manipulate an audience with stereo-typical ""ok now I am going to pull at your heartstrings"". Howard's movies for me just do not flow and seem once again, ""force manipulated"".Overall not a bad movie and the acting is great, but this film rating in at 8.2 is way too high.This over rating could be explained by the lack of good films being released today.6 to 7 at best.

The Braddock family in the Great Depresion,"Ron Howard's latest film ""Cinderella Man"" probably miscalculated its release date. Being a serious film about a real incident in a not too glamorous era, the movie arrives in the middle of the summer releases that seem to be made for action packed adventures or thrillers that don't require much of the viewer. That said, ""Cinderella Man"" presents a vivid portrait of one of the worst times in American history: The Great Depression.At the center of the story is James Bradock, a fighter that is seen at the beginning of the film with what appears an assured future. Then, the bad times that affected the country have a profound effect in the Braddock family. From living with a certain degree of comfort, they are relegated to eke out a living in order to survive.James Braddock's work in the New Jersey's piers becomes scarce, as only a few men are employed at a time. Early on, in a fight, Jimmy breaks a hand that puts him to a disadvantage among the men working at hauling cargo in and out of ships. Fortunately, Mike Wilson, a decent man, also impoverished by the situation, gives him a hand whenever they are teamed together. This will be a friendship that will last forever.At home, things go from bad to worse. Mae Braddock, the wife and mother of three children, tries to make do with whatever little she can lay her hands in. It's heart wrenching to watch her try to put food on the table, let alone something that might have any nourishment. Jimmy Braddock has to resort to get public assistance and even to beg from the people that congregate at a Madison Square Garden club.James Braddock's true friend turns out to be Joe Gould, who would guide him back to a phenomenal comeback that establishes him as one of the great fighters of the times. Jim Braddock goes to fight the powerful Max Baer, a man that has been notorious for killing a couple of opponents in the ring.The film is satisfying in spite of all the desolation and poverty one sees. Of course, it's evident we either never went through those bad times of the 30s, or have never been in Mr. Braddock's family position. In spite of all that is against them, the family made out well and even went to prosper, which says a lot for them. Above all, Mr. Braddock teaches us a lesson in how to keep his family united in spite of the rough times they were facing.As James Braddock, Russell Crowe makes a fabulous contribution. He transforms himself into the fighter that has to face poverty in order to appreciate what came afterward as a reward. Renee Zellwegger is fine as the suffering Mae. Paul Giamatti makes a tremendous appearance as Joe Gould. Paddy Considine plays Mike Wilson, the man who helped Braddock resume his work in the docks by carrying an extra weight when his friend was obviously in pain.The screen play by Cliff Hollinger and Akiva Goldsman takes an intelligent account of the era. Finally, Ron Howard scores a real winner with this film, that should be seen by more people because it presents a real portrait of a man that was genuine and loved his family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
No knock out,"After the success of A Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe and Ron Howard teamed up again for Cinderella Man.Now that Howard is an Oscar winning director, the story gets more ponderous and longer. He can also attract the best talent so we have Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger as part of the cast.Crowe plays Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who was down on his luck, in poverty who gets the chance to get back to boxing and ends up getting a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship.In that case it's an inspiring and uplifting tale. However one of the writers of this film is Akiva Goldsman, I do not care if he has an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He is a supreme hack. I refer you to Batman & Robin as Exhibit A.Howard who is one of the last protégé of Roger Corman who used to make zippy films in the 1980s but over the years has become more bloated.In this film you feel some of the moves the director will make will be telegraphed just like a bad boxer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Best boxing movie since Raging Bull,"I've never seen a movie about a boxer that is so humanist in its approach, it almost made me cry. Ron Howard might be panned for making a melodrama out of Braddocks life, but isn't life a continuing melodrama itself? I love Russel Crowe for his sincerity in breathing life to Braddock's character and Renee Zelwegger, as is usual, proves that her talent is not limited to playing Bridget Jones. This is an Oscar-worthy film, and if Crowe and Zelwegger don't earn nominations, I'd be disappointed. Howard's direction is quite focused. From the beginning to the end, we are hooked on Braddock's struggles to keep his family together despite money problems. Howard has struck the right chord in making the audience understand and appreciate Braddock's near forgotten life. And Crowe for making Braddock alive again, even for just a little more two hours. This is the best boxing movie since Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

If it doesn't win best picture at the Academy Awards this year, I will be very disappointed. It should win best picture of the decade (so far). If you see this movie, you will not walk away unmoved.

We stayed intact because of men like Braddock and the true marvel of this film is that one is able to personally feel every emotion displayed on the screen.

Shame on you Ron Howard,"When Americans are unemployed, they put even more out of work to make this movie. The highly publicized film ""Cinderella Man"" opened June 3. It is a classic American story in every way, with one exception: where it was made. It was filmed in Toronto instead of the United States, using labor heavily subsidized by the Canadian government. How ironic that this story of a man literally fighting to provide for his family at the height of the Depression should be filmed in a foreign country, costing America hundreds of middle-class jobs and contributing to the dangerous trade imbalance which now deeply concerns our economic experts.James J. Braddock, the ""Cinderella Man,"" was born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents. His is a real-life ""Rocky"" story. He was a poor local boxer struggling to support his family when, fighting as a ten-to-one underdog, he defeated Max Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world in 1935. Seventy years later, the crowds cheering him on to victory in the film about his life are no longer Americans because the background artists portraying them are Canadians, as is the overwhelming majority of people employed in the making of this movie. Material that should be triumphantly American is counterfeit, a cheap and tawdry imitation of who we are.In recent years millions of American jobs have been outsourced overseas to take advantage of lower labor rates. However, Canada and Australia, where ""Superman"" is now being filmed, are hardly third world nations. Unlike other industries, in the case of film and television production labor costs are made artificially lower in these and other countries by government subsidies which violate our trade agreements.When 28 members of Congress sent a letter of protest over the choice to film James Braddock's story in Canada, the studios which produced ""Cinderella Man"" claimed they went to Toronto because it was the only place that had the right architecture. That's a lame excuse for a purely monetary decision. Plenty of cities in the United States still have buildings with the historically correct ""look"" for this picture. The studios went to Canada because one third of their labor costs were kicked back by the government, pure and simple.The outsourcing of this and other productions in order to take advantage of illegal subsidies offered by foreign governments is more than just a moral and patriotic outrage. It doesn't only cost American jobs. It is also a very real threat to the economic stability of the United States. The filming of American movies and TV shows in foreign countries contributes to our ballooning trade deficit and the devaluation of our dollar against other currencies. As a result, outsourced production harms every single American citizen in a very real way.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The Violent Man Glorifed, and His Mistress Pleased","""Cinderalla Man"" is a movie about gendered confrontation between the heroic archetype of man, and the circumstances which vitiate ALL of men's struggles against adversity, and despair.The juxtaposition between ""cinderela"" and ""man"" provides us with an obvious, and most profound dichotomy between the spirit or male/female relationships. At once the man as dreamer, and the woman as hope/faith - the Saviour of our transgressions.Are we not going tired of this relational nexus? Perhaps this is an academic question. We are bound to relate to the desperation of the impoverished soul. The Man, qua provider, is guilt ridden, and rendered useless. As ""men"", as dutiful, subservient providers, the boxer is most comfortable with violence, the dull blunt blow to his opponents skull. This violence is simple, learned, refined.Men are at their finest when simplicity reigns, and the consequence of any action, any friction leads either to glory or shame. On this linear scale, men do not understand love without pride, victory without concomitant shame of the vanquished.A woman may not experience shame as her hungry kids run wild, pleading necessity as bread becomes their only sustenance. But a man will lose that which makes the man, pride, protection, reliance.This film reaffirms the gendered roles of Man and Woman. It does this in non-prejudicial fashion. Old-school feminists may cringe. But beauty is found in Man is Saviour, Jesus on the cross. Beauty in woman is grace, understanding, and deference to the man that acts out of instinct. The sharp blow - the temporary victory - and then he must return to face the sins of his progeny.This film describes the male condition. The pride that accompanies glorious victory, and the decrepitude that invades his soul upon defeat.The moral: man is moved and impoverished by love and desperation to avoid the stripping of his pride -- woman by pragmatics; woman by love, devotion.These ideas are indeed dated, but a careful observer of the husband/wife dynamics as so explicitly expressed by ""Cinderalla Man"" may shed the modern, and peel back to the fundamental difference in gender. And the contribution each makes to join, to live, to experience the ecstasy of existence.And happiness is lost in love, but found in the memories of the nostalgic. It was ""bad"" says our brains, but our heart - the biggest in boxing - relieves this naive premiss, and instructs on the give and take of love.Perhaps among the best boxing films of the twentieth century. Man against Man. Man against himself. And beauty in the heart that destroyed the body but cries out admit simultaneous bliss/defeat tethered to the loose strings of the ring. Boxing makes every brave should eternal, and this heart, this peace rings like the bell of the final round.Behing in the score card, bleeding, we are men that deserve the dulcimer forgiveness of Mary, of all women who spread their wisdom like fire. And place incest at the feet of our ruin.We run from this burn, but this burn is our Saviour. Hot, lamentable - BUT WE EXIST, and tip the sounder to quit the death knell, and let us resume the only role we know. We relax.

Heart of a Champion,"Director Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" was not what I was expecting. It is a touching love story, and a story of great character. It is the best movie of the year so far. Yes, is not just a movie about boxing. It is Ron Howard's best movie-- so moving and inspiring. Russell Crowe as Depression Era Heavyweight contender, James J. Braddock, is so powerful, compassionate, and inspiring. Though sometimes it takes a little to reconcile, Crowe's screen persona from his media celebrity, I think Crowe truly distinguishes himself as the movies' most powerful actor with almost limitless range. He is awesome in ""Cinderella Man"", and he may win another Oscar.I was familiar with Jim Braddock in the context of Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (played in the movie by Craig Bierko). Jim Braddock would become Heavyweight Champion by upsetting the arrogant Max Baer. I had read accounts for the accuracy in ""Cinderella Man"" depicting Baer as a smug, arrogant, partier. Baer even took pride in the fact that he killed 2 boxers in the ring. As excellently played by Bierko, Baer is basically a big bully, who thinks he can have his way, because he is stronger than everyone. But ultimately he is short on heart, and void of any character.Jim Braddock (Crowe) went down a different path, the fate of the Great Depression, and thus, his transformation was entirely distinct. In 1925 Jim was a number one Light Heavyweight contender managed by Joe Gould (the amazing Paul Giamatti). Jim had a lovely home with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger), and their 3 children: Jay (Connor Price), Howard (Patrick Louis), and Rosie (scene stealer Ariel Waller). Jim and Mae were so in love, and it is clear from the beginning that their relationship is a source of strength and courage. During the Depression the Braddocks are reduced to poverty, living in a run down apartment. Jim works at the docks, and takes fights for chump change. A series of events causes Jim to leave boxing, and the proud Jim vows to keep his family together. This is where the screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsmith (based on the story by Hollingsworth) transcends to a moving tale of love and family. There is a heart-wrenching scene where Jim (Crowe) asks for money from his former promoters so he can pay for the electricity for his family, saying to Joe Gould, ""I'm sorry..."" Through luck and accident Jim gets another shot back in boxing due to Joe. This time it is different. Jim eventually gets a shot at the World Title held by Max Baer. Even one the fighters Jim beats this time around says, ""He's not the same guy."" During a press conference prior to the Title Fight, when asked what was different this time around, Jim says he fights for ""milk""-- recalling a scene with his daughter Rosie. Ron Howard along with his writers Hollingsworth and Goldsmith are such compelling and moving storytellers. An amazingly strong and understated Renee Zellweger as Mae is terrified for her husband Jim who is fighting a giant who may literally kill her husband before the fight tells Jim, ""You are the champion of my heart."" That stopped me in my tracks. ""Cinderella Man"" is all heart, and is a movie that truly inspires us all. It is an amazing movie about character and ultimately the inherent greatness in us all.This is Russell Crowe's best performance to date. His power is tempered with great compassion and such a delicate tenderness. Renee Zellweger is a rock. Her performance is dead on for authenticity, and her understated strength is a joy to watch. Paul Giamatti is such a talented actor. He brings a lightness and humanity to ""Cinderella Man"". Director Howard direction is so natural and the performances of his actors are truly awesome. ""Cinderella Man"" may be the best movie of the year. It is a great movie about greatness. Now this is something we can all celebrate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Solid biopic with great performances,"The fact that this film is based on real-life events makes it all the more astonishing. I would still advise all people wanting to see this to know as little as possible about the back story as possible. I really didn't know how this one was going to pan out. And when it finished, it made it all the more invigorating.Russell Crowe plays James Braddock, a depression era boxer who loses everything after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After landing a temporary position as a dock yard worker, Braddock finds himself with little means to support his family. His old time manager - played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti - decides to get him in the ring for one last showdown, as the scheduled contender had to withdraw. Seeing this as a way of making a potentially life saving $250, Braddock accepts the challenge - much to the worry of his wife (Renee Zellwenger). The film then chronicles his subsequent re-rise through the boxing ranks, as he defies all the odds and becomes labelled ""The Cinderella Man"".As a spectacle, the film is wonderful. The boxing scenes are in my opinion the best filmed since Raging Bull - and I do not say that lightly. You really do feel like ribs are being crushed and craniums cracked. You will be gripping the edge of your seat. On an emotional level the film borderlines between warm sentiment and mawkish schmaltz, although it definitely evoked far more heartfelt smiles then it did rolled eyes.Russell Crowe is on top form. His best performance is still Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider (1999), but this one is definitely up there along with Gladiator (2000). Equally effective is Paul Giamatti, and I think both men deserve Oscar recognition, especially after Giamatti was completely overlooked for his wonderful turn in Sideways (2004).A really good, really exciting, heartfelt piece of work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A new Rocky for the ages!,"I wasn't really too interested in seeing Cinderella man, I'm not too into Russell Crowe movies, but my friend convinced me to take a peek at it and just give it a shot, so I figured why not? Over all, I'd have to say that I have to thank my friend tomorrow, because this was a wonderful and inspiring movie to go the distance.Set during the depression, this movie takes a dark tone to the story, I think that's the thing about this movie that I loved and most others did too. Almost all of the people on IMDb have not lived during the depression, we know that they were hard times, and Cinderella man got to take a glimpse at what it was like to live back then. It was so touching to see this family struggle but stick together. I can't imagine what Renee's character was going through every night not knowing if her husband was going to come back alive or not.This is a beautifully acted and sublimely directed filmed movie with magnificent sets and a terrific and inspiring story. I think anyone could get into this movie, even if you're not too into the boxing flicks, but believe me when I say if you enjoyed Rocky, there's no way in heck that you could not enjoy Cinderella Man, a new inspiring tale for generations to come.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"It's emotionally manipulative, but in a good way","I had some hope for this film, since I've yet to see a sub-par Russell Crowe movie (I've yet to see Proof of Life), and the promos were giving it a Rocky meets Seabiscuit vibe, and I dug those flicks. Also, I've enjoyed, if not loved, other Ron Howard films, so I figured I was in all right hands. At the very least, I was hoping to see some good boxing action. Who knows? Maybe it would even live up to the way-too-early Oscar hype it's gotten.Well, not quite. If this film had true Oscar-potential, it wouldn't be coming out in June. In fact, a good reason to release such a film in June is to get reviews that call it the best film of the year so far, because it looks like high art in comparison to films such as Madagascar, Star Wars, and The Longest Yard. It's a solid film with some excellent performances, but it's no Best Picture contender. At best, star Russell Crowe could get a nomination if this ends up a down year for movies, or Paul Giamatti could get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as recognition for his recent work, along with his excellent work in this film.Crowe and Giamatti are easily the highlights of this film, and without them, it would probably be a mere average film at best. Their combined brilliance pushes Cinderella Man into the above average category, with Crowe in particular inhabiting the real-life character of Jim Braddock stunningly well. Think whatever you want about Russell Crowe the man, but Crowe the actor is quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation (or, at the very least, is in the top percentile). Braddock isn't an easy character to play and make interesting, as Howard seems intent on deifying him, making him so inherently good that he could easily be bland and boring in the hands of a lesser performer.As for the film itself, it's well-worn territory in the standard Ron Howard form. Howard's M.O. is to grab, pull, and squish every ounce of sentimentality out of a story, and assault the viewer with it. It's not subtle, but, usually very effective. He did it in Backdraft, Apollo 13, and his award-winning A Beautiful Mind, and he pulls no punches in Cinderella Man (no pun intended. Or, perhaps it was intended, you decide). Braddock is a hero that all theatre-goers can get behind, beaten down by the Great Depression until he gets one last chance to make it in the boxing ring. He love his family, his wife, his country, and his friends. He's an honest man who is barely able to provide for his family, which kills him. Were it possible to view the movie with a cool detachment, you can see the parts of the movie where Howard is saying to the audience ""okay, cry... NOW!"" It's highly manipulative, but, it's effective. There were even instances that almost had me going.Howard similarly plays with the hopes and fears of the audience, injecting the movie with legitimate menace and fear in the final climactic match. He wants the audience to feel every blow in the ring, and to fear for the hero's life against the brutal champion Max Baer. And, for the most part, you do. Away from the ring, Howard wants the audience to feel the oppressive struggle many faced during the Great Depression, and pours on the sentiment to accomplish this, and, for the most part, it works.There's very little new to what Cinderella Man accomplishes. The boxing sequences are proficient, but the boxing-as-metaphor-for-human-struggle has been done many times before. The underdog sports hero capturing the heart of the nation theme was done two years ago in Seabiscuit. It's too bad that the material feels so recycled, because the story of Jim Braddock (nicknamed the Cinderella Man by a sportswriter during his miraculous comeback) is a compelling one. But, since the movie is so familiar, and Howard is so over the top with his sentimentality, the movie is no cinematic classic, and not the Oscar contender it so longs to be.However, it is an entertaining movie. My advice to those thinking of seeing it is to go in, allow yourself to be manipulated, ride the emotional roller coaster, and don't disrespect yourself in the morning. You'll have a good night out at the movies, and if you were truly inspired by the story it told, do some reading to find out all the details that were fudged in order to make you laugh, cry, and hold your breath.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great acting! - but it's a cheesy, formulaic movie","I just saw this movie and I'm pretty mixed. The acting was great: Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti are outstanding in their roles. Giamatti just about steals the whole movie, he is beyond great. Unfortunately, Zellweger's role was weakly-written and though she does an okay job, she doesn't come off nearly as well.The movie, on the other hand, is really simple and sappy. At first, it seemed like Ron Howard was going to make a truly great movie. There's real restraint and elegance for a while. But then he goes for the big, broad, sappy choices and the whole thing turns to mush. One of my biggest problems was that the script doesn't develop a truly interesting conflict. The ideas are there, but they're not developed in an interesting way.Overall, it feels trite, maudlin and overblown. Like most Ron Howard movies, it's a competently-made, softened-up version of better movies. There's definitely some suspense, and, yes, the fight scenes are compelling. But by the end, I wasn't very moved. I guess people will feel a big emotional payoff, but it didn't work on me (and I'm usually a big sap).",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Triumph against heavy odds.,"Ron Howard directs this heartwarming story of Jim J. Braddock(Russell Crowe), whose promising boxing career hit the skids about the time of the Great Depressions. Stuggeling to make ends meet for his family, his long time manager Joe Gould(Paul Giamatti)got him the chance to change his luck. Braddock, in 1934, had upset wins against Corn Griffin and John Henry Lewis. This set up the shot for the title against the much feared heavyweight champ Max Baer(Craig Bierko), who had already killed two men in the ring. Jim was a 10 to 1 underdog, but traded punches with the bigger Baer and won the championship. Two years later, Braddock lost the crown by a KO delivered by Joe Louis. Jim Braddock gave a down-trodden populace a hero to look up to and was bestowed the nickname of the Cinderella Man. Other cast members: Renee Zellweger as J.J.'s wife Mae along with Bruce McGill, David Huband and Paddy Considine. Once again director Howard evokes excellence providing some very realistic and graphic boxing scenes. He also found bit parts for his dad Rance and brother Clint. This movie could easily also be called a love story...as well as a story of patience, courage and determination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

My heart is still beating fast from the adrenaline, and just to make it clear, I'm female and have never watched a boxing match in my life. Don't rule this movie out girls because it's about a boxer, Crowe deserves an Oscar for his performance.

Hatchet Job,"I suppose when Hollywood tries to make an inspirational story about an underdog, it needs a villain too. Enter Max Baer. To suggest that he was proud of killing two men in the ring is both false and unfair. After Frankie Campbell's death from head injuries sustained in a fight with him, Baer was very upset, not proud. He was even (falsely) accused of manslaughter although the charges were later dropped. He donated subsequent purses to Campbell's family and put his children through college. Although somewhat of a clown in and out of the ring before this tragedy, some boxing historians suspect that Campbell's death also resulted in the death of Baer's ""killer instinct"" in the ring. If he really had tried to ""disconnect"" Braddock's brain, I don't think Opie Howard would have made a movie about The Cinderelle Man.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"fine, not certainly not best of the year.","i think ron howard is a gifted filmmaker. and i think russel crowe is a very good actor (he really does need to calm the hell down off camera, though -- sheesh) but this was not a *10* or even a *9* in my book. i think the primary reason for it is that i never quite believed any of the characters. somehow no one got under the skin of the story. i don't know whether it was the screenwriter's fault or howard's, but i never felt really committed to any of the characters -- ever.certainly, there were rousing moments - especially the last title bout. but the labored lead-in was painful. and the oft mentioned powerful emotional interludes fell 70% flat for me.Crowe is an incredibly charming presence - but that alone can't carry a film.for my money, if you're looking at moderate to big budget Hollywood movies this summer, CRASH was head and shoulders above Cinderalla Man",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Paul Giamatti gives a great performance in a supporting role that outshines the stars. Ron Howard does the best directing job of his career.I hadn't seen an uplifting depression era film since Seabiscuit. I hadn't seen an underdog boxing film since Million Dollar Baby.

more about boxing than about people,"As it turned out. I had watched ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""Rocky"" (the first one), in the past 3 months. Each was approached with the same mindset: I hate sports, and nothings worse that sweaty, bloody guys hitting each other. But I was delightfully surprised with each. I found that they really weren't about boxing at all, but about the people and their lives, boxing was a side-note and the outcomes of the actual fights were irrelevant to the story. This one is different. This one is about boxing. It pretends not to be. It pretends to be about the working class uniting with a hope for the underdog. The fight scene in the end feels like it must be at least 30 minutes long. It feels like we see the ENTIRE fight. this is the climax of the movie, does he win or lose? who cares? I thought it was about standing up for something. no. it all comes down to a simple yes or no question. the movie feels very very contrived. the score sounds forced and artificial, the acting mostly functions on a surface level and the camera-work, don't even get me started on that. it's trying to have a STYLE with unstable cameras, and out of focus lenses. It's just distracting. I don't care much for the traditional classic shot framing style, it's boring. But Salvatore Totino's compositions make you feel unsettled when you shouldn't feel unsettled. It's quite distracting to have the person's face at the bottom of the screen, it doesn't matter if you are showing the entire head in the shot, you cut off the neck, and the face is at the bottom. It's very inconsistent as well. He switches between this off-kilter photography to a standard form, mid-scene. This wasn't healthy experimentation, it was the work of someone inexperienced. I kept joking that this must be his first time with a camera. But it turns out it really is only his fourth outing as cinematographer. This will probably win best picture next year, because it's trying so damn hard, and kissing the academy's ass. But it falls flat on it's face.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Pop! Pop! Shazam!,"Like mythical alchemists, Russell Crowe, Ron Howard, & Brian Grazer have once again contrived to make movie gold from what could have been mere lead. Their latest collaboration, Cinderella Man, is PURE magic, despite the fact that from the title alone, most could discern the outcome. The riches-to-rags-to-riches theme may be more than familiar to us, but is never more convincingly retold than here.Based on fact, executed with uncanny skill, every scene of the movie, even the most brutal of boxing matches, is riveting. You can't take your eyes off the action, just in case you'll miss a single twitch of James Braddock (Crowe's) face or the infectious enthusiasm of a superb Paul Giammatti as his manager, Joe Gould.As in every role he's played to date, Crowe morphs entirely into his character. His body is sculpted to appear as if he's just stepped out of a '30s newsreel. If anyone has ever doubted the actor's commitment to a role, they need look no further than when he performs his training scenes. Kudos to the surgeon who performed a second shoulder repair upon him, due to the recurrence of an old injury which threatened to halt the production in its infancy. He should be acknowledged as one of the sorcerers responsible for preventing the project from dissolving into a puff of expensive smoke. Of enormous significance, there is also an elusive but palpable humility in Braddock's portrayal, a quality which we have heretofore not seen in a Russell Crowe film, happy proof that the man many call 'greatest living actor' continues to learn & evolve.Of course, there is the remainder of the superb cast: Renee Zellweger as Braddock's distraught & devoted wife, Craig Bierko as brutal playboy Max Baer (factual or not?), & Bruce McGill as slick promoter Jimmy Johnston, to name a few. Just as during any great sporting event, all the players perform to their highest abilities, the bar set by Crowe or perhaps, their mere collaboration. It matters not. The whole far outweighs the sum of the parts. Art direction, Costume design, Cinematography, Sound effects, & Score should be listed among these, since the look & sound of Cinderella Man is virtually another composite character, another ingredient in the magic formula. Let's hope the alchemy comes full circle, that the creators' bright & shiny alloy is fashioned into statuettes next February.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Bouts with Depression,"What is it about boxing stories that captivate filmmakers so? Because I am starting to feel like I've had my brain knocked loose watching these things. I realize they offer an easy device to externalize an actor's character, and they allow for lots of crazy hand-held shots in a smoky arena, but enough is enough. Do something different with the genre already. Million Dollar Baby substituted a girl for a man, but then fell into the same trap of clichés: the training, the rise to the big break, the title fight. Fortunately it wasn't really about fighting and transcended the average boxing sequences. The sequences in Cinderella Man are technically impressive enough, and so they should be: they were lifted almost directly from Raging Bull: one of the greatest films ever made. Russell Crowe's character is full of bull, too. His nickname is the Bulldog, and like De Niro, he studied the sweet science very closely and trained to look like a professional pugilist. However, out of the ring Crowe's portrayal of James Braddock is more staging than raging. The man is perfect. Doesn't have any bad habits, does all his fighting for his kids and wife, who have the happiest home life ever, even when they are destitute. And this is what makes Cinderella Man a contender that doesn't deserve a shot. In this film it's not the Great Depression, more like the Depression We Can Get Through If We Just Stick Together. The really interesting part of this story would have been if they showed us how this up-and-coming contender suddenly lost everything. We know he made some bad investments, but why didn't he reach out then to his boxing cronies? How did this affect his character? Because when we're thrust back into the story, now in the middle of the Depression, Braddock is just hunky-dory. Sure he's scrounging for shifts at the docks, and he breaks his fighting hand, but not once do we see him or his family break. Even when his son steals a salami, good IL' Dad makes him take it back, but then tells his son he understands that he was scared. Somehow, through a stacked, schmaltzy script, I honestly started wondering what was true about this ""true story."" Which seems to be to be a great disservice to the man, James J. Braddock, who really did accomplish these things. It was the Great Depression, for goodness sake, it's OK to show him really break down or have an argument with his wife. I'd admire him more, because he'd at least be more human. The film also does a great disservice to the Great Depression. Much like in Seabiscuit, another plucky character who spoke for the masses, the Depression is presented only in its appallingly worst and with no real analysis: For example, the stock market crashed, but no one can really tell you why, except for platitudes about greed. But the real reason crashes happen is because governments start insuring investors, who then over-invest (most recently in dot-com start- ups). Off topic I know, but the point is let's stop glorifying this one version of the Depression. I had no idea how great a film Grapes of Wrath was until watching these big-budget, studio films that miss the point: if you're making a film about the worst economic time in U.S. history, maybe you shouldn't be spending so much on extravagant boxing sequences and big-name salaries. Renée Zellwegger, a fine actress always, is not needed in the role of the perfectly supportive wife. Her casting only takes away from the real relationship in the film, that of Braddock and his trainer. Paul Giamatti really zings in this picture and his characterization is neither a grizzled, lovable old man ( Burgess Meredith in Rocky, Clint Eastwood in Baby) nor a shyster. He's somewhere in-between. Very strong work, back where he's best, in a supporting role. Crowe also does good work here, especially in the ring, but also in the unemployment lines. He's one of the best working, I just hope he tries picking more nuanced roles like his work in L.A. Confidential, and stops Oscar-baiting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Decent Flick, Unfortunate Title","Every year there are a handful of films released which seem destined for great things. This is no accident. Some movies seem to exist more for the Oscar potential of their stories than the stories themselves. Cinderella Man is 2005's first example of this familiar trend. It's the uplifting tale of one underdog boxer's triumph over adversity. Rocky spun a similar yarn nearly 30 years ago and took home the highly coveted Best Picture award. The same can be said for last year's outstanding Million Dollar Baby. Cinderella Man is not quite as good as those two films, but it does possess one unique benefit: it's a true story.Anyone who saw 2003's Seabiscuit has pretty much seen Cinderella Man. Simply replace the horse and its rider with Russell Crowe's rugged, determined boxer, James Braddock. Spurred on by the need to save his family from the terrors of the Great Depression, Braddock took his one last chance at pugilistic greatness and ran with it. Crowe does a typically admirable job of filling Braddock's gloves. Director Ron Howard essentially repeats his increasingly obvious formula: take a made-for-TV story and give it the high gloss treatment. It worked perfectly for his A Beautiful Mind, which undeservedly took home the top Oscar several years ago. Rounding out the cast are the delightful Paul Giamatti and one of Hollywood's most overrated enigmas, Renee Zellweger. This entertaining movie has a lot of heart, but falls just short of a knockout.Rating: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing!!!!,"Excellent movie! So good I felt I had to write and let people know. Initially, thought a movie about boxing would bore me to death. Got 5 mins into the story, and was in floods of tears throughout the whole movie. Is ideal for both women and men - women have the family, sensitive side to enjoy, men - the boxing action. It was also fascinating to see what actually went on during the Great Depression! Makes you value what you have now. Amazing to see what went on in Central Park, NY City.Will be watching again this evening to enjoy yet again the fantastic acting skills of Russell Crowe and Rene - truly had no idea he was such a great actor...will definitely be recommending this movie to friends on Monday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinderella Man (2005) ***,"A pretty good and surprisingly compelling biopic which, apart from obviously emphasizing the traditional elements of a boxing drama for commercial purposes, tries to faithfully portray its background of 1930s Depression America; this it does in meticulous detail but also excessive sentimentality, I think. Besides, the 'modern' (i.e. mannered) performances of its stars and the occasionally over-emphatic direction rather serve to detach oneself from that particular environment  which is not at all what the director intended!Still, the film's trump card remains its technically proficient and tremendously exciting boxing sequences (particularly the smooth transition from one fight to the next and the lengthy final bout between Braddock and Max Baer, though the latter is rather lazily presented as a one-dimensional villain in order to put the audience, no pun intended, firmly in Braddock's corner).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Raging Dull,"I cannot believe that this movie is on the IMDb top 250. It is a bore. There are closeups and dizzy camera moves. It reaches in for tears from the first five minutes. It seems as though it were written for a couple of housewives before their husbands come home. Just horrible.Ron Howard, the poor guy wants to be Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg, Kubrick... everything that he isn't. He wants to be Welles, Altman, Peckinpah... What I'm trying to say is that he wants so bad to be classic that he cannot settle for pretty good. And that, my friends, is what he is, pretty good at best. And he hasn't even been that for many years.A BEAUTIFUL MIND was overrated, but at least it was entertaining. This film was depressing. Yes, I know, it's about the depression, but it's so full of clichés my TV needed Pepto. Paul Giamati plays the manager, and swears for swearing sake, trying to be Joe Pesci in RAGING BULL, and so did the boxing/fight scenes, but it was just dull, dull, dull.Russel Crowe was boring. Renee what's her name was boring. None of the characters mattered. And Crowe's big claim to fame was that he beat up a guy who looked like a fat slob from Cheers for gods sakes.Ron Howard always shows us who is bad and who is good. Bad directors do this. Clint Eastwood, also overrated, does this. ""This character is bad, because he is a jerk, and this character is good, because he isn't"". This is what their movies tell us, as if we're children.But the fact that this film made the top 250, maybe we are children. Because anyone stupid enough to vote this as a classic should go back to kindergarten and finger paint with Opie Cuttingham.A horrible, horrible film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Outstanding,"May be the best film of the year (it is only May). Great performances by the entire cast. The boxing scenes are the best I've seen, and the emotional aspect of the story brings it all together. As a nation, I think we have forgotten what the depression of the thirties did to us. All the lives it ruined. This movie shows how one family was able to break out of all the squalor, and still remain a family unit. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this movie. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti are all Oscar worthy. This movie has it all. It is Ron Howard's best film. Special note about the music score by Thomas Newman.

I can't agree with those who complain about the fact that this film was ""over-emotional"". If the life of a man who got from working on the docks and not being able sometimes to provide food for his children to winning the heavyweight crown doesn't strike you as extraordinarily emotional, then you must be as sensitive as a kitchen knife.

Sure, Baer has his side of the story, but you can't dispute he was reprimanded for low blows and a back hand. Hmmmm?I am sure he wasn't a complete jerk, but I don't think the movie made him to be all that bad other than a very intimidating boxer who didn't take Braddock seriously.The boxing matches were not overdone but were enacted with enough grit and detail without upstaging the real story:::::A good man rising above adversity with dignity in a brutal and unforgiving sport for all the right reasons.

Typical Ron Howard commercial crowd pleaser,"Ron Howard makes the most commercial, feel good, crowd pleasing movies of today. That does not mean that they are the most thoughtful, insightful, expert, soulful, or innovative, but just that they are well crafted, basic and timeless morality tales that will be just as watchable 20 or 30 years down the road, as our hard wired human nature doesn't change enough in order to make his films outdated in that short time. His films are like ""The Wizard of Oz"" in their simple old fashioned morality that we quietly love but won't admit to anyone, and just as timeless. That is Cinderella Man in a nutshell.However, I can only stomach about one of his sugary films every few years, and am thankful that it takes him about that long to get another one out. Cinderella Man showed Braddock as a saint worthy of being selected the next pope, not a real man with faults, and even if it was a good tale it still hit that spot in me that yells, ""no way!"" History shows Braddock to have been a decent man and very tough fighter, but he had many well documented human failings that were not shown at all in the film. And the many shots of long wet kisses and fond caresses with his always responsive wife.....hot married romance with 3 starving kids and no food or heat or money?.......again, ""are you kidding?""! But the gals just eat this kind of phony stuff up and add greatly to ticket sales.My main concern was the same as with all phonied-up Hollywood films of today...the human body just realistically can't take anything near the brutal punishment these films show it can.... innumerable full force head punches, bomb explosions, hundreds of bullets, head on car wrecks or plunges off cliffs....and the lead character walks away just fine every time, just like Braddock did in this one after taking enough hard head punches to kill a hundred men. All baloney, but kids unfortunately believe a lot of it and sometimes kill themselves acting it out.This film was a human cartoon, no different than animated cartoons from Disney or Pixar.....with all of them having about the same believability, but it's the way Howard likes to see life through his films. The truth is, he never left Mayberry and Mayberry likes simple morality stories that end happily ever after, every single time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The emotion is overwhelmingly real, based on a true family story.  Awesome!","What an amazing movie. A drama full of every imaginable emotion. Boxing is quite an interesting sport. I've never really enjoyed its brutality, but I have to admire the boxers for their fitness and determination. I suppose it takes a different kind of man than myself to be a boxer. Cinderella Man contains all of the clichéd aspects of a classic boxing movie. The family is struggling to survive while the wife never approves of what her husband is doing, the underdog rises again to reclaim his glory, and the suspenseful fights keep you guessing who will win. The difference, however, is that this movie is based on a real man who experienced all of these things first hand. The delicate feelings and subtle changes of everyday life make the movie very real. I enjoyed the music the most in this movie. Crowe has always been a favorite actor of mine and while I don't like Zellweger, she played a good role nonetheless. I'll admit that I was pretty choked up throughout the movie and it wasn't just because I'm sick. The last thing that I really have to mention is the occasional, but not too frequent, use of the first-person camera angle. When it is used, its very, very impactive. Once again, it is an awesome movie and everyone should see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Now I know what I'm fighting for."" - Jim Braddock","I hate Russell Crowe. It's a fact, pure and simple, I just don't like anything about Russell Crowe. I love Ron Howard, and I think he is a marvelous filmmaker who is terribly underrated, but I just do not like Russell Crowe. So, you could imagine I was very skeptical about this film. Every time the previews would show for 'Cinderella Man', whether it be on television or in the movie theaters, I would cringe and sigh. It had nothing to do with Ron Howard, Renee Zellwegger or the brilliant Paul Giamatti, and it wasn't so much I thought the film had a bad premise. It's just like I said, I DON'T CARE FOR RUSSELL CROWE. That's not to say however, he's a bad actor. Crowe is a great actor, but he's just a bad, crude, annoying and disgusting human being. I don't like watching Crowe too much, but I still think he's a very good actor. Going into 'Cinderella Man' I was not expecting of a good film. Well, by some odd chance 'Cinderella Man' turned out to be actually a good film (not a great one), but a good one. It's entertaining and it really gets you into the mindset of boxing. Of course it's unbelievable, but it's just so damn fun to watch. Do I think it should be noticed during Oscar season? No. Would I watch it again? Probably, I might even pick it up on DVD if it's on sale.'Cinderella Man' is Ron Howard's boxing biopic on legend Jim Braddock(Crowe, of course). Jim was a heavyweight boxer during the Depression Era in New Jersey. Braddock lived like a king in the late 20s, but by the early 30s (right around the time of the Great Depression) Braddock was living in an almost closet-sized dirty home, because everyone had run out of money, and he and his family (his wife Mae (Zellwegger) and three kids) were struggling to get by. The film portrays Jim as an almost saint (although I'm extremely skeptical on how true that is). He is the perfect husband, loving, compassionate, honest and humble. Jim works when he can lifting crates at the docks, and boxing whenever he can. When Jim gets his boxing license revoked, he doesn't know what to do. He was struggling just to get by with the bucks he was getting from boxing. Jim begs to get a break, and eventually his promoter, Joe Gould (Giamatti) gets him a final fight at Madison Square Garden. Now, Braddock has the ultimate inspiration, he's fighting for food or 'milk' for his family so they can survive. May god have mercy on anyone who gets in the ring with Braddock. After Braddock is making bucks fighting, he eventually has to face off the legendary Max Baer (Craig Bierko), whose already murdered two men in the ring. Braddock's wife is scared for him to fight Baer, but in Braddock's heart he knows he has to, to support his family. 'Cinderella Man' is the title of the film because it was Braddock's nickname. They called him that because he he was an older tired boxer who started winning all of a sudden, they said he was like something out of a fairy tale (hence, 'Cinderella Man'.) The movie also stars Bruce McGill (D-Day from Animal House!) as Jimmy Johnston and Paddy Considine (In America) as Mike, Jim's best friend.'Cinderella Man' posses many good qualities. Ron Howard provides excellent direction and really nails the authenticity of the time period. The acting is very good for the most part, Russell Crowe gives a surprisingly great performance as Jim Braddock. It's one of the better roles I've seen Crowe in. Paul Giamatti (who was recently undeservedly ignored by the Academy last year for his incendiary work in 'Sideways'), is amazing and funny as usual as Braddock's promoter and semi-friend. Bierko is wonderful and frightening as Max Baer, and although Renee Zellwegger was good she is pretty annoying in this role. My biggest complaint about 'Cinderella Man' is it's screenplay. It's not that Academy Award winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman does a crappy job, it's just that he does a sappy job. 'Cinderella Man' unfortunately follows that all-to-familiar boxing movie formula (which only recently 'Million Dollar Baby' broke, and before that in 1980 'Raging Bull' broke it). You know exactly what is going to happen and when it's going to happen, even if you aren't familiar with Braddock's boxing history (I wasn't). The film doesn't throw any curve balls and it doesn't break the tired boxing movie formula for a second. It's an entertaining and easy to like flick, but don't let the film seduce you into thinking it's an Oscar contender. Although I liked the film, it's unoriginal and it's been done before, over and over and over again. Like I said earlier, it portrays Braddock like a saint, which I'm sure he's not. They make Braddock perfect so no matter what you'll cheer for him, when they could have created him with significant faults and still have you cheering for him, like 'Raging Bull'. But that would take one hell of a great screenplay (again, like 'Raging Bull'), and 'Cinderella Man' sadly doesn't have one. They also portray opposing boxer Max Baer as a villain on par with Hitler almost, but I'm sure Baer wasn't as nasty and cold-hearted (maybe). A lot of people kind of bought the whole Braddock being a great human being thing, but I didn't. I mean how could you be such an extraordinary, compassionate and perfect person and beat the crap out of people for a living. But, that's just me going off on a tangent, so I'll just stop talking about that. On another note, fans of the Rocky series will surly love and appreciate it's extraordinary fight sequences with beautiful cinematography and eye-popping direction from the immensely talented Ron Howard. The movie also achieves some heartfelt moments that will move you emotionally. I recommend it. Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Working Class Hero Is Something to Be,"""In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J. Braddock"" is how the famed writer (and boxing fan) Damon Runyon described the Boxer he dubbed ""Cinderella Man"". Director Ron Howard uses the quote to open the film. So, you are guaranteed a heartwarming story of a man who overcomes abject poverty.Russell Crowe (as Jim Braddock) begins as a moderately successful boxer, living with wife Renée Zellweger (as Mae) and their three young children. The Braddock family suffers through bad luck, cold New Jersey winters, and the Great Depression. If you've been cold and poor, you'll identify with warming socks in the stove and adding water to stretch a bottle of milk.The film's, and the leading character's, high moral tone is set when Mr. Crowe, in an early scene, brings his son to the local butcher shop; there, the boy returns a piece of meat he stole to feed the hungry Braddock family. ""No matter what happens, we don't steal,"" Crowe explains. Ever. He also promises the children, ""We will never send you away,"" and sobs when poverty dictates otherwise. His dedication and commitment to his wife and children are the driving force in the life of the boxer.Today, the boxing ring has been taken over, in popularity, by choreographed pretenders. But, once upon a time, you were to cause your opponent actual physical damage. Continuing to hit someone in the head until they fell, ""Knocked Out"", was the prime directive. During a fight, Crowe's manager Paul Giamatti (as Joe Gould) demands, ""Fill his face with blood!""Later, Crowe's Braddock is successful enough to face wicked champion Craig Bierko (as Max Baer), who is credited as having ""killed two men in the ring."" So, the fight is promoted as a chance to witness a potential murder. Boxing and morality make strange bedfellows. But, ""Cinderella Man"" is a pretty, predictable, and well-produced film.****** Cinderella Man (2005) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, Paul Giamatti",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Best Movie of 2005,"The best picture of 2005 and Russell Crowe should be the Best Actor. This story of former heavyweight champion Jim Braddock is superbly told with remarkable accuracy but it also is a history lesson. Most viewers don't have a clue as to how bad it was during the Great Depression but this movie will give them a clue. It would have been better except that a very revealing scene wound up on the cutting room floor during the director's cuts.In that scene, Braddock joins his family who are standing in a soup line. The significance of the scene is not that they are in a soup line but that Braddock has his boxing shoes hanging around his neck. After Braddock goes through the soup line, he then goes to his old gym to sell the shoes. He tries to get a dollar for them but he is so desperate he ends up selling them for a quarter. But the scene is also significant for another reason and should have been left in the movie.When he sells his shoes, his manager is lurking in the background and sees the sale and he knows Braddock is giving up fighting. Later, the manager is able to get Braddock a fight and when Braddock, who needs the money desperately, agrees, the manager gives him a pair of shoes. Because the earlier scene was cut, viewers are left guessing as to how the manager knew that Braddock needed the shoes.Another directors cut presents the same dilemma. Early in the movie, Braddock breaks his hand during a fight and the fight winds up a draw and he does not get paid. He is flat broke. Yet when he gets home his hand is in a cast and the cast is significant in the movie. The viewer has to wonder how did Braddock pay for the cast when he is so broke? What was cut was a scene in which after the fight, we see Braddock's manager prepare a splint and bandage up the hand for a cast. That scene should have been left in the movie.Director Ron Howard made few mistakes and these were two . But he was smart enough to get former heavyweight boxing manager Angelo Dundee not only as an adviser but a role in the movie. It improved the realism immensely. And if the viewer has watched the actual films of Braddock's championship fight, the viewer can see how realistically the fight was duplicated in the movie. For a rank amateur Crowe did a superb job of boxing.I am not a fan of Renée Zellweger. I usually can't stand her but she was perfectly cast as Braddock's wife and she plays the part exceptionally well.One omission in the film. Max Baer, the heavyweight champion Braddock defeated, always wore a big Star of David on the left leg of his boxing trunks. Baer did this to show support of the Jews who were being badly persecuted in Nazi Germany at the time. It wasn't seen in the movie. The movie makes Baer out to be a very obnoxious person and possibly Howard was concerned that it would be considered anti-Semitic to make Baer look like a loud mouthed Jew.In a way this movie is nostalgic in that I grew up during the Great Depression. However, I was too young to have heard the Baer-Braddock fight. Besides like many at that time, we didn't have electricity so we didn't have a radio. Moreover, Jim Braddock was kind of an in betweener among heavyweight boxers. In between Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney and Joe Louis. Champions such as Primo Carnera, the Argentine Bull, and German Max Schmelling were more famous and Braddock was a forgotten man until Ron Howard and Russell Crowe resurrected him in Cinderella Man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Year's Best offer So Far,"Films about the Great Depression are tricky, because in a time when one must pay nine dollars to see a movie, it is hard to make an audience understand the level of desperation people lived in during that time. Ron Howard's Cinderella Man, starring Russell Crowe as long shot heavyweight contender Jim Braddock, skillfully and subtly weaves in stories of daily life during the depression, into the fabric of what could have been a conventional boxing story. Superbly acted and flawlessly made, Cinderella Man is a depression piece worth the price of admission.The film begins in 1929 where a young Jim Braddock is close to a shot at the heavyweight championship. The main characters are quickly introduced before the film jumps ahead five years, where an older Braddock loses his boxing license after an ugly fight. We learn he lost his championship bout as well as most of his money in stocks, and that age and injury have stripped away any promise he once had. Struggling to pay the bills, Braddock is forced to freelance work on the New York docks where a broken hand hurts his chances of being hired for a day's work.During the early parts of the film it would have been easy for Ron Howard to try and drum up sympathy for the common American man by inserting overhead shots of long lines at soup kitchens, while some languid score played on. Instead Howard chooses smaller scale scenes to punctuate the harsh realities of daily life. In the films most powerful moment, Jim goes down to Madison Square Garden and in front of sportswriters and boxing promoters, who once knew him as a powerful fighter, begs for spare change so he can have the heat turned back on at his home.Eventually Braddock's longtime trainer Joe Gould (the brilliant Paul Giamatti) gets him a fight against a heavily favored opponent. Braddock, whose injuries have healed, wins and keeps winning, building a large working class fan base and re-building his reputation as a boxer. This leads to a showdown match with killer heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), and Braddock's last chance to achieve financial security.Crowe's performance is the heart of the film, because with Braddock he creates a layered character instead of a Rockyesque thug. In the film's best scene, boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) tries to convince Braddock to back out of the championship fight lest Braddock get hurt and Johnston become liable. Braddock explains, with just a hint of disgust at Johnston's lack of understanding, that fighting Bierko is no less dangerous than working as cheap labor at the docks, and at least in the ring he knows where all the punches are coming from.Cinderella Man should contend for several Oscars come next February and is another notch in the belts of both Crowe and Howard. The film never becomes a conventional boxing story or tries to generalize depression suffering. It stays true to its main character, a man who fights so he can have a say in his family's economic situation, allowing it to resonate with its audience throughout its entirety.Four out of Four Stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Story,"Cinderella Man (2005)**** (out of 4)Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career as James Braddock, a boxer who loses it all during the Great Depression only to get one more chance inside the ring. While watching the film I couldn't believe Crowe didn't get an Oscar nomination but then it reminded me of everyone who did this year. Which, in return, got me thinking how weak roles are for women. Every year there's always one woman who can walk away with the prize but when it comes time to the men you've got five people who didn't get nominated that could have won. Anyway, this is certainly the best film of director Ron Howard's career since we've seen this story so many times before yet he keeps it fresh and interesting down to the final fight. The scene where Crowe has to beg for money from the boxing commission is the best work he's ever done and heartbreaking work from Crowe. Paul Giamatti is very good in his role and Renee Zellweger is good as well even though her role really isn't written very well.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I realize that you have to tell the story of the hardships that Jim Braddock and his family suffered, but I think this was overdone. I thought the part played by Renee Zelweger was one that could have been played by anyone and was a waste of talent. Paul Giamatti did an excellent job in his part as Braddock's manager.

I just watched a sneak preview of CM...and I:  Loved it!,"If you think your going to just a boxing movie you have underestimated the story of James J. Braddock. Damon Runyan, the great scribe who specialized in writing about the unusual characters that spiced the stories of life in New York, thought the true story of James J. Braddock...the Jersey fighter with a heart that wouldn't quit...to be that of a Cinderella story. Braddock, a successful light heavyweight fighter in the late 20's career took a dive with the stock market...and soon, instead of leading the fat life of a successful professional boxer...lost his skills due to injury and his money to the depression. So, we see the beginning of the movie with Braddock, a dedicated family man...knocking out Tuffy Griffith, ironically, I almost jumped out of my theater chair...for Mr Griffith was in my fathers Marine Corps outfit in WWII. As Braddock returns home to his lovely wife, finely portrayed by Rene Zellwiger, he is seen taking off his watch, after the 1929 fight. We are transported in time to four years later...and the suburban home is replaced by a shanty tenement in Jersey, where Braddock and family are faced with the harsh reality of living in depression era America. Not enough food for his family or enough milk for them to drink...Braddock is now a club fighter...routinely getting beaten by lesser opponents for fifty dollar purses. His last fight was deemed no contest as Braddock breaks his hand in three places but continues to fight on..until the ref stops the contest. Braddock's purse was withheld and his hand placed in a cast...with no money or steady work...services are disconnected and the final humiliation, his wife has to send their children to other family members to survive. The harsh reality of depression pulls no punches and Braddock and his family and religion/faith, is ultimately put to the test. Forced to beg in the club at Madison Square Garden..he needed forty dollars to get his electricity turned on and have his family returned. Crowe, one of the finest actors around to day...was again magnificent as the genuinely honest and modest Braddock. Whose Cinderella story is a remarkable tale told masterfully by Ron Howard. Go see it and see it often... I just watched the actual Baer vs Braddock heavyweight championship fight and the clowning, talkative Baer did just that...he was penalized for low blows and backhanding tactics in the fight...Baer took Braddock for granted and paid the price with his title. Also note, that Braddock lost his title to Joe Louis. For Louis to get the fight he had to give 10% of all his future fight earnings to Braddock. I don't think that deal was arranged by Braddock...but more his manager.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Cinderella Man An Excellent Movie Based On A True Story,"Cinderella Man is an excellent movie based on a true story with equally impressive performances by Russell Crowe, Renee Zellwegger, and Paul Giamatti. Director Ron Howard is admirable in making this movie continuing to show his talent as filmmaker despite it's flaws. Howard has shown again and again his skill as a director and this film is no different. Russell Crowe turns in a great as Jim Braddock a supposedly washed up boxer who came back to become a champion and an inspiration in the 1930s. Renee Zellwegger is just as good as his wife Mae but she isn't given much to do. Zellwegger is solid in the role none the less. Paul Giamatti is equally impressive as Braddock's manager and best friend Joe Gould. The rest of the cast including Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, and Rosemarie DeWitt are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The intense boxing sequences are well executed and you find yourself cheering for Crowe's character whenever he steps into that ring. The pacing was slow at times but the effort put in by the director and the lead actors make up for the films few flaws. If you're a big fan of Howard or any of the actors than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cinderella Man was better than expected with an inspiring true story, characters we come to care about, drama, intense realistic boxing action, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Crowe and Giamatti) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Cinderella man!,"I'm going to be honest, I was not excited to watch this movie. A movie about boxing during the great depression didn't really pique my interest.

I truly loved the good characters (Gould) and really hated the bad characters (Baer). The acting and commitment in this movie is on an entirely different level. But what really takes this movie over the edge is Russel Crowe as James J. Braddock. He told this story with so much care and earnestly that you could not tell me that isn't the real Jimmy Braddock.

"Cinderella Man, gives people hope","Apparently,after ""A beautiful mind"", another extra ordinary movie is bade by Ron Howard - Cinderella Man. The same production group, the same director, the same leading actor, and the same producer. This great and moving movie basically tells the same boxing movie - just like other boxing movie - put a person into the difficulty and then he eventually gains back what he deserves. However, this touching movie is different, in addition to the realistic boxing sequence, the setting can bring audiences back to the 30's. Russell Crowe once again plays an excellent job in this movie. At first, I assumed that ""Cinderella Man"" will be another ""A Beautiful Mind"", however, I was wrong after seeing this movie. This time, the director Ron Howard tries to tell a touching story in a normal and slight way. He did not put too much things into this film, but this common story makes people feel more. Anyway, go see this movie - another beautiful movie.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Poignant and well acted.,"If Ron Howard knows how to do anything, it's how to make a cinematic but bland movie. If I was watching this in 2005, then Cinderella Man would feel like shameless Oscar bait, but one that would be a little worthy. Unlike most baity films like this, people really love Ron Howard's stuff, though this film didn't do too well at the box office at the time. With a good A-list cast and a decent true story, it's not fluff that just flutters into its the mess of its year. It can at least hold onto another 10 years. With a blend of depression-era domestic struggles and adrenaline- pumping fighting, it tries to tick boxes for everything and relatively succeeds in an involving way, if brazenly saccharine. But it fully embraces that and the conviction of the acting makes it work. I usually don't like Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. I usually love Paul Giamatti but I was unsure at first.However, they all won me over by the end, especially Crowe who brought rare heart to his performance along with his natural visceral grit. Granted, the film is still quite derivative at times. It brings nothing new to the boxing ring, besides perhaps a small innovation of a way of shooting POV. It frequently uses the disorientating flash of the 1920s camera which it fails to justify. The film has nothing to do with media tension, only fleeting mentions of how things will look in the press. It's purely surface, not adding anything besides mood. The film doesn't really have any themes rather than perseverance and universal emotions. But it's fine as a piece of easy entertainment, though it would've been best off not villainizing its eventual antagonist in such a cartoonish way, especially as the portrayal was nothing like the actual boxer. Clunky execution of certain things aside, Cinderella Man is a good and somewhat poignant film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Also the very end of the movie had me so emotional inside I got goosebumps and all but I'm not going to spoil it.

Painfully slow first hour weakens a very good Depression era drama,"This is the story of Jim Braddock a ""washed up"" fighter and one time championship contender who manages to turn a fluke chance into something more. Its a rousing story about a man who although appears to have hit bottom manages to pull himself up again for the sake of his family.Word has this as an early contender for numerous Oscars, unfortunately audiences have yet to find this film, which as of this writing is disappearing from theaters. Having seen the film I can understand why people are staying away from this screenings, its badly paced and at two and a half hours it seems twice that.(This will play better on cable and DVD) This isn't to say that its a bad film, its not, its just that the film takes about an hour before it shows any real signs of life. Its not the fault of the actors, who are pretty much excellent across the board. You can't really blame the director, Ron Howard, either since this is a beautifully made film. The fight scenes are simply some of the best ever put on the screen. The fault is squarely on the script which takes forever to get where its going. Its a solid hour of how bad life is in the Depression and how hard it is for Braddock to support his family. It just seems to go on and on and on. Later in the film the seems to repeat the same notes again and again as if to show how far Braddock has risen. I got the point early and didn't need to be reminded over and over. I 'm of the opinion that you could probably remove thirty minutes out of this with out losing anything.I must say that this is a very good film once it gets moving and absolutely worth seeing, though its probably going to play better sitting on your couch where you can stretch out during the opening slow bits.Seven out of ten.(really seven and a half)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinderella Man : Stamina and Heart,"In the last few decades there has been a drought of good films about the Great Depression, or at least ones that weren't about bootleggers and Italian mobsters. Cinderella Man recounts the true story of an on-his-way-out boxer and longshoreman whose family is down to their last penny.James Braddock's unlikely last hope is his boxing career. While slumming it to the dock every single day to find scarce work, he hides his injuries to take a crack at the younger up-and-coming professional fighters at first just for the pay. But his stamina and heart, and ability to withstand a beating (both in life and boxing) gifts him with a few knockouts and an underdog's chance to challenge the great killer champion Max Baer for the title.If you ever have spent a day of your life feeling useless or defeated, watch this film and it will put your attitude and your head straight.written by Andy Frye, MySportsComplex.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Is this your kind of film?  Go see it.  Otherwise.......,"People apparently need people on pedestals. The film indicates that depression era people considered James Braddock a hero, an underdog who gave them hope. That's nice. I have no use for sports heroes and I convey unto them no supernatural expectations. I have no use for Depression era movies or stories. Boxing to me is a modern day version barbarism. I do, however, insist that I can overlook all those caveats if the resultant film warrants. ""Cinderella Man"" fails. Russell Crowe can play a rugged well-meaning person and Renee Zellweger is a sufficiently capable actress. Still, there is a dullness and shallowness to their characters. The lives of real people can fail to be cinematic  perhaps that's the problem: if so, why make the movie at all? Oh, I forgot: people need heroes. Director Ron Howard has all the subtlety of a ballerina in cement overshoes and this film continues that tradition. Unobtrusive camera work is a foreign concept to the man. Brief street scenes suffer equally with the fight scenes. Music? Even Thomas Newton's soundtrack fails: ""listen to his ""Road to Perdition"" instead. As the credits rolled, I considered: my companion enjoyed the film (she is a dedicated Russell Crowe-phile) and the Diet Pepsi was cold and bubbly. It was ultimately the film that lacked fizz.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best in Sports Movies,"I don't know how many times I watched this movie. But the truth is it still entertains me. The movie clearly shows the pains and struggles that James Braddock had to face in his real life.

Russel Crow has given a solid performance, whereas it is Rene Zellweger and Paul Gimatti who wows me with their stellar performance. The boxing scenes were absolutely jaw dropping and thrilling enough to feel the intensity of the match.

One of the better movies.,"Cinderella Man will be one of the most underrated films of all time. Because most audiences will associate Ron Howard, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti with other, perhaps, through perspective, more successful films. But the story of James J. Braddock was a brilliant choice to base upon and the movie is by far one of the best for the year. As far as inspirational stories go, Cinderella Man is among the best.The story of boxer James J. Braddock and his fall from heavyweight championship contention, plagued by injuries and the Great Depression. His comeback story gives him a true title of the term, Cinderella Man.Set in Depression-era New York makes the city an interesting side-story in itself. We see the enormity of Central Park's Hooverville, husbands just giving up, the line-ups for emergency relief. And with Braddock, we see the story of a man who not only refuses to back down on his career, but maintains his already strong integrity by never giving up on his family and country. Ron Howard ensures the film remains crisp and sharp, and Cinderella Man holds excellent build-up right to the very end where Braddock faces Max Baer. An excellent movie, Cinderella Man would be a worthy addition to your movie library.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good Russell Crowe in conventional risk-averse film,"This was one of those films that began really well but ultimately felt rather conventional. It's basically a depression-era 'Rocky' directed with little risk by Ron Howard. Russell Crowe is competent as usual, but is never allowed to fully break loose. He does have one scene, (MINOR SPOILERS) where he is is left literally begging for money that had me in tears. If only the rest of the film matched the intensity of that scene. Renee Zellwege is bland in a straightforward role as the loving wife. The fight scenes are good though uninspired. Still watchable as long as you keep reasonable expectations.Overall 6/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very good boxing drama,"When I first went to see this film, all that I knew about it was that it starred Russell Crowe and it was based around the life of a boxer. Of course, it ended up being much more complicated than that.Russell Crowe is James Braddock, a boxer rising up from the bottom in 1930's New York City, during the peak of the Great Depression. After several fights (including one in which he breaks his hand and loses his boxing license), Braddock attempts to get financial assistance and he and his wife are in danger of having to send their children away due to the fact that they may not be able to support them in such a difficult time. However, Braddock is offered (even after his loss-of-license) yet a chance for one more fight for $250... he not only wins the fight and the money, but he is propelled back into the dramatic world of boxing (not to mention the betting/gambling based upon its fights) and media spotlight. He eventually rises to the top and finally becomes the prime opponent for the current world heavyweight boxing champion, Max Baer. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job as playing the reluctant wife-of-a-celebrity and caring mother of several starving children.Overall, this film was great. It was much better than my other favorite boxing film, ""Undisputed"", and it was, to put it simply, a masterpiece that made you feel as though you were on the frontline of the boxing matches and gambling scene of the 1930's. While it could get boring at times and was somewhat long, this was still a great film that I recommend with pleasure to all.

"Due to flaws in the extremely manichaean script, it ends up taking away much of its emotional and narrative impact. However, Ron Howard delivers an emotional boxing drama film","Boxing films usually do well at the Oscars, see ""Rocky"", ""The Wrestler"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"", mainly when they concentrate their focus not on the action of the combat, but on the psychological work of the characters to win something greater than a simple fight. Fully aware of this, Miramax launched: ""Cinderella Man"", drama about the life of boxer Jim Braddock, who overcame the great obstacles of a dark era in American history for the love of his family and sport. In addition to the theme, the studio also brings together the Oscar-winning duo of 2002, director Ron Howard and colossal actor Russell Crowe, who together collaborated on the winner ""A Beautiful Mind"" - another work with a pre-Oscar formula, which further proved more the intentions of the studio.There is a clear tendency in The Fight for Hope to get carried away by all the sentimentality that is involved in the real story of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe). He, a great boxing prodigy, is affected by the arrival of the Great Depression and a series of defeats in the rings that force him to retire prematurely from the sport and live on odd jobs on the docks in the United States. Having to support his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger, who not long ago was awarded by Cold Mountain) and three children, Jim finds another opportunity to return to the world of boxing when he is scheduled to fight against the 2nd boxer in the search for the world title, Max Baer (Craig Bierko).With no affection for subtleties (and if he did, he would hardly have been as quoted for the awards season as he was in his time), Goldsman and Howard appeal to the most classic of Hollywood clichés to narrate a story that needs to overcome the meager interest of a good portion of the public for the sport itself, investing in the emotional catharsis of Jim and Mae's family situation. With more than obvious inspirations in Raging Bull, Rocky, a Fighter and The Invincible, classic from the 40s starring Kirk Douglas (and such obvious inspirations are far from being the real problem), the Goldsman script weighs in hand in what is to Manichaean in that story, building Jim as an absolutely incorruptible man, establishing Mae as the typical concerned and devoted wife and mother, turning Max Baer into the villainous, caricatured and inhuman presence we know so well, and closing the package with the trainer, manager and best friend from Jim, Joe (Paul Giamatti, Oscar-nominated for the role), who plays a key role in Jim's wins and common sense.It is not enough for Howard to go beyond the conventionalism that is characteristic of him, and in an attempt to confer some authenticity that makes the story valid, the director appeals to the most basic resources to build his narrative, from ellipses that situate the ascension and Jim's initial fall in a didactic way, crude flashbacks amidst the fight scenes and a whole technical pomposity (open shots and framings that emphasize the historical recreation in the art direction of Peter Grundy and the desaturated photography of Salvatore Totino) that, accompanied by the soundtrack desperate for emotion by Thomas Newman, sink Jim's rich story into an absurdly circular, calculated narrative, which gives little or no room for the catharsis of the journey of the protagonist and his family, in fact, is conveyed to the audience with greater naturalness . Incidentally, the scriptwriters' interest in melodrama is such that, when dealing with the fighter's decline, the film chooses to show him rich and happy to, in an abrupt cut, portray him in misery four years later, providing the explanation for this it falls only later, through terribly expository, artificial dialogue (as in broadcast by an announcer). That is: narrative clarity and elegance are replaced by cheap shock and cliché.The great asset of the director and Russel Crowe is being able to show all the despair of Braddock (Crowe) and his countrymen. More than a film about a boxer who managed to resurface in the sport after a series of setbacks, the feature is a drama about one of the toughest phases of the powerful economy of the United States. With the aim of drawing the viewer's attention to the poverty in which Braddock finds himself after the great depression, Ron Howard does not hesitate to cut a piece of sophisticated furniture full of jewels to then show the character sitting in a dark environment. Of a single room to accommodate the whole family, including three children. This type of cut is used in two other moments of the film: during a fight by Braddock, to show the continuous flow of fights he went through, and when his wife Mae lowers her head in front of a burial and then raises it up in front of reporters and photographers. But if Ron Howard's camera manages to show thematic dichotomies, the same cannot be said of the script regarding the characters. The big problem with the film is precisely having such one-sided characters. Braddock is the good family man who, even in an environment full of troubled parents, strives to help his wife raise the children and even gives moral lessons to his son who, in need, steals a salami from the butcher shop.Of course, the script does everything to portray Braddock as a perfect being (""Who would root for an individual with character flaws?"", the writers must think): the fighter seems incapable of committing slips that would even be forgivable for someone in a desperate situation like yours. Braddock doesn't drink, he doesn't argue with his wife, he doesn't scold his kids, he doesn't get angry with his enemies, he never loses hope and, of course, he treats his opponents with immense respect, unlike the ""despicable"" Max Baer. Even so, Crowe transforms the character into a plausible figure, almost leading the viewer to ignore his implausible perfection by giving Braddock a sad and tired look, standing out mainly in the scene in which he, humiliated, turns to his former companions in search of peace. Financial assistance.In the same way, Paul Giamatti, always an efficient actor, does a beautiful job as Joe Gould, manager and Braddock's best friend (although the poor script confuses the functions of ""manager"" and ""coach""): experienced, Gould plays a fundamental role in the fighter's victories, offering advice and playing psychological games to shake the opponents. On the other hand, Renée Zellweger's work turns out to be one of the worst of her career: affected to the extreme, she plays Mae, Braddock's wife, in an artificial, technical way, seeming to calculate the exact second in which she must tremble her voice or start a crying, throwing down the essential role of the character as someone who, despite not taking the physical blows, goes through a pain as great as that of her husband.Unfortunately, the script and direction still allow more problems for the film. In the third act of the film, the character Max Baer (Craig Bierko) appears. With little time to delineate the character on the screen, the script goes so far as to show him as a true monster, who fights violently, fights with women for no reason and even calls Braddock an idiot without any explanation - besides offering ""consolation"" to the opponent's wife out of sheer provocation. As if the poorly made one-sided view of the ""last minute villain"" was not enough, actor Craig Bierko exaggerates with his bulging eyes, giving a performance far below the average of actors in this film - and here, I criticize the character, disregarding the true story of boxer Max Baer, apparently more interesting than the film can show.The fight sequences are performed competently, but that's all: compared to the clashes in the ""Rocky"" or ""Raging Bull"" series, they become almost bureaucratic - mainly thanks to director of photography Salvatore Totino's insistence on repeating some of the tricks he had used on Any Given Sunday to increase the impact of the fighters' strikes, using whip-pans (dry and abrupt cuts), out-of-focus shots and flashes of light. Although the scenes are shot in just the ordinary way, they are well choreographed and shot with an elegant intensity on Howard's part, but before you know it, ""Cinderella Man"" ends as yet another heightened drama formally envisioned for the tears to flow. On the public's face.Braddock at the time was dubbed the Cinderella-Man by sportswriter Damon Runyon, which sums up the real fairy tale that is the story of Braddock and his family, which inspired the entire nation in that difficult period. The story had everything to be one of the best that cinema has ever produced, but due to flaws in the extremely Manichaean script, it ends up taking away much of its emotional and narrative impact. However, Ron Howard knows well the audience for whom he speaks and explains - just once, but in a very didactic way - the real motivation that keeps Braddock standing even after so many punches that life has thrown at him: he didn't fight for the love of sport, but against poverty and that's what made him an example for so many people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Crowe and Howard are a winning combination,"Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have something going on. As Kauffman and Hart were to the screwball comedy, as Rogers and Hammerstein were to the Broadway musical, and as Burns and Allen were to banter comedy, Howard and Crowe should go down in entertainment history as the team that perfected the biographical movie. As an encore to their amazing collaboration in ""A Beautiful Mind"" the actor/director team has created a brooding, harrowing, and soulful journey through a slice of the life of boxer Jimmy Braddock, an unlikely heavyweight champ of the depression wracked 1930's. Given the success of ""Cinderella Man"" it seems apparent that this is a franchise in the making. The movie itself is simple. It follows a relatively short time in the life of boxer Braddock and his family and does not rely on an entire lifetime to make its point. No study of childhood psychological baggage here. It is very simply the gritty nature of Braddock's quest, the interplay between him, his wife, his kids and his always supportive manager, and the oppression of the era that are the recipe that makes this move a compelling work.Set during a period in our history where the real consequences of the Great Depression are oftentimes either ignored or caricaturized, Howard pulls no punches in depicting the inhumanity of that slice of our history. Using an almost sepiaesque tone to the color, an era of gloom and doom is aptly created, throwing the viewer into a realistic reality of calamity. We are even taken on a not so pretty tour of ""Hoover Ville"" in 1930's Central Park that cannot help but move even the most stalwart of movie goers. Effectively using this as his backdrop, Howard paces the film so that the last hour is literally breathtaking as we follow Braddock through his final trek toward and into the title fight. The fight scenes themselves are remarkable in their ability to get the audience involved in each. Even with full knowledge of the outcome, Braddock's journey is exciting and suspenseful. This is great film-making.Crowe is quite simply a great actor. His chameleon like ability to ""become"" is a joy to experience. Together with his character we feel his frustration, his angst, and almost overwhelmingly, his pain, both physically and emotionally. When he has to ask for public assistance and is forced to ""beg"" from boxing fat cats so as not to break a promise to his little boy that he would never send him away to live in their desperate times, it is almost excruciating to watch. We feel what he feels, we know what he knows, and we hurt like he hurts. This is great acting.The supporting cast is great also. Rene' Zellweger is understated as ever in her long suffering support of the title character. She has the ability to pull us equally into the story and creates a great role out of a weakly written part. She is truly the great woman behind this man. Equally effective in his role is Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manger. He is always there for Braddock. He seems almost like a guardian angel in his ""never say die"" demeanor, and his quest to continue Braddock's career. When he tells Braddock that they are revoking his license, we feel all the pain associated with having to break bad news to those we care about. His exuberance during the final fight is contagious. Craig Bierko as killer fighter Max Baer and Paddy Considine as Braddock's friend on the docks also turn in excellent performances.As Howard continues to prove himself a truly great director, Crowe continues to pad his resume' with meaty and heartfelt performances in the vein of the best movie actors like Brando, Bogart, and Stewart. Mr. Crowe's ability to re-create himself in the context of every character he tackles puts him in a very small class with a very high caliber of movie actor. Howard just might be the consummate ""actor's"" director. His ability to glean stellar performances out of every actor in his movies from the smallest walk across to his biggest stars is nothing short of phenomenal, and certainly no fluke. Over and over again, Howard has proved himself. ""Cinderella Man"" will take it's place on his already prestigious resume' as one of his best, and hopefully this will not be the last we see of these two working together.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Another lifeless Howard film. A really expensive episode of 'BIOGRAPHY'.,"Everyone that I know who has seen Cinderella Man shares the same opinion as mine - an okay movie, but not really worth recommending or wasting money on to see. It's pretty lifeless and limps along at a snails pace. There is zero emotional impact delivered. What could Ron Howard possibly know about poverty? I find it like all his movies - slow, deliberate and passionless; sure, I shed a tear when Russell Crowe's mad professor gets the Nobel prize but that's about it. The production designer and art director are the only champions in this movie and should get nominated for their beautiful work.I've read many of the comments and am pretty confident that the slew of '10s' you see as votes for this movie are the result of some massive email forward that got everyone involved with the movie to vote. Even people that do like it would never give it a 10. But 35% of IMDb voters give it a ten? Give me a break.Save your money. Ron Howard grew up with a craft table next to him, what does he know about hunger? It's like he just picks up a script and says to himself 'ooh, this would be good with a crane shot, and this would be great at 60 frames a second, and when they kiss, we'll play some violins' He's like a movie professor that knows all of the ingredients to a good film but can't mix them together properly. There's no synergy. He will always make films because Hollywood likes him. Mr. Aw Shucks Howard wants to make a movie? Sure, is 100 million enough? Why Roger Ebert touts this movie so much is beyond me. The only reason I can figure is because it's the kind of movie they want Hollywood to make more of - big old fashioned sets - larger than life story - James Horner does the score. It's got all the elements of a great movie but it ISN'T!! I truly believe that if somebody else had directed this it would have been a great movie. It's an unbelievable but true story. But it was really just a way for Howard to waste 120 million of Universal's money.Let's hope he doesn't screw up The DaVinci code.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
There's always that one character..,"This film was fine but really, I'm pretty sure every other review here has stated the same.My main beef though is THAT character. The wife/girlfriend/mother in all these sorts of films who when the hero is on the verge of achieving their wildest dreams, starts saying, ""don't do it, it's not worth it!""In Cinderella man, Renee Zellweger, the wife of hero, tries to make him pull out of the world championship fight on the basis this man once accidentally killed a man in the ring. Does it get much more selfish than that? This woman clearly has no faith in her husband or respect everything he has done in his entire life that has led up to this once in a life time opportunity . This character always seems to plague these sorts of films. It's just absurd a character this selfish could even exist, let alone be loved by the hero. Of course this character always sees the error of their ways but its ridiculous this situation even existed.

Channeling Frank Capra,"Cinderella Man is the kind of irresistible malarkey that Hollywood used to be founded on - the kind of cornball triumph-of-the-common man stuff Capra used to peddle, presented with all the slickness modern Hollywood can muster. It's almost impossible not to root for its hero, James Braddock, a punching-bag who becomes Heavyweight Champeen despite being old, broke and saddled with three kids and a nagging wife. And it's almost equally impossible not to snicker at one's own gullibility at being carried along by the movie's tide of populist bull-crap emotion.Ron Howard is better at this kind of movie than almost anyone, even Spielberg, mostly because with Howard you don't have to worry about any messy imagination getting in the way. Too much original thinking would just bog-down a movie like Cinderella Man, which needs to be all about the surface emotions, and there's no director in Hollywood better qualified to skate along the exterior of a story than Howard. To call Howard proficient would be understating things - he has achieved a level of skill at standard storytelling that can only be described as super-proficient. There isn't a moment of Cinderella Man that doesn't display Howard's command of the medium - and there isn't a moment that doesn't demonstrate his complete mediocrity as a cinematic thinker. They used to call guys like this ""shooters"" back in the day, directors who knew how to interpret a script without jazzing things up too much. There are moments in Cinderella Man where Howard seems to be injecting a bit of style, but what he's really doing is aping. The boxing scenes may recall Raging Bull for a second or two, but mostly they're just competent. At times the depiction of Depression-era squalor may appear grimly realistic, but there's always a storybook sheen over everything, the sense of reality filtered through a strictly pedestrian, basically clean-minded point-of-view. Howard may seem to want to press the violence, the seedier aspects of the story, but he's too decent and unperverse to really achieve this. There's no sense whatsoever of the real brutality of boxing, just the mock-brutality of movie-boxing filmed so close-in that we can't see how bad the actors' footwork is.The film revolves around three strong central performances. Russell Crowe brings warmth to Braddock, the lovable lug, and has the right physical presence to capture the character's bruising prowess. Braddock's manager/trainer, Joe Gould, is played by Paul Giamatti with a crackling Lee Tracy sense of verbal acrobatics and timing, his rapport with Crowe becoming almost vaudevillian. And Renee Zellweger plays Crowe's loyal, long-suffering wife Mae with enough of her signature screwy-but-down-to-earth charm to distract us from the fact that the character is basically a fretful stereotype. It's a novelty for three such dynamic performers to find their way into the same movie - yet despite the strength of these performances there is a nagging sense of shallowness to the characterizations. We get to like Jim Braddock, to see his honorable nature and his toughness, but we never get very deep into the character, we never get a sense of the undercurrents of violence and rage that must, at least partly, motivate him. The movie goes out of its way to visualize the character's motivations at key moments, showing us flashes from his miserable home-life while he's knocking the snot out of someone, but this is no more than psychological window-dressing. Crowe is certainly a powerful enough actor to bring us deeper inside Braddock, but the mainstream, audience-friendly conception, and Ron Howard's own populist tendencies, preclude this. The film needs Braddock to be a straight-forward hero, the champion of the common-man, and that is what we are given. The actors only skim the surfaces of their characters, portraying the kinds of emotions that will contribute to the sense of inspiration. It's effective acting but it's not very interesting acting.The same could be said about the movie as a whole - it's effective but not very interesting. It gets the job done as they say, but the job it's doing is a rather routine, unremarkable one.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This film goes the distance....,"9.0/10This was my first time seeing this film, and I must say that it was great. It had me crying for the first hour or so while all the trouble and turmoil took place. Even watching the triumphant rise of an underdog had me shedding a tear. In this film Russel Crowe brought a great game. He has always been great when it comes to fighting movies and he played it off well here too.The cinematography was fantastic with all the action shots and the blurred effects after a knock to the head. Everything sounded fantastic most of the time, but I noticed a few times that the punch sounds were landing just too early or too late, but it didn't takeaway from the film.Chemistry was great amongst characters/actors whether it was love, friendship, camaraderie, or opponents. I found that the cast was very well chosen.The story was great. While the outcome is pretty much predictable they've done a well enough job to keep the tension going, and the ""unknown"" pretty engaging. I also found that the runtime was a bit too long. I think they could've gotten the story told in and around two hours, but truly it was well done.My takeaway on the theme of the movies was never quit. You may be down, you may need a breather, but never quit. Find the inner strength to overcome the obstacle because you've got at least one supporter cheering you on in yourself. And you may never know who is encouraged by your resolute spirit.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. Loved the actors/characters. Chemistry was key. Visuals were fantastic with a few hiccups from sound, but still enjoyable.Thank you for reading my review. I'll have a bit of trivia in the comments, but until next time....

Usual,"Well, this movie doesn't bring anything to the genre. Though it is a true story, it is told in a very common way. It seems to follow the never failing recipe for success that so many American movies have followed before. It doesn't bring anything new to the boxing movies type either. If you want to see a good one, try ""The Boxer"" instead. Finally, it's a very average performance of actors, but, luckily, Paul Giamatti saves the day. I'm not saying it's bad, but then again, I don't like movies where the whole plot is timed, sequence by sequence, and programmed to generate the right emotion at the right time. Or it mustn't show.

"Good, but could have been 'Great'!","The moment I finished ""Cinderella Man,"" I was overwhelmed with positive emotion; I wanted to give it a nine-star rating out of ten. But it's a biography movie, so I went on to check the authenticity of the story. What I found afterwards wasn't amusing; the depiction of Max Baer's character in the movie wasn't quite accurate; he is shown as a despicable villain in the movie. As a fighter, Max was formidable, but his real character off the ring doesn't corroborate the movie plot. The real Max was not familiar as a terrible human being. The director made a not-guilty person look bad to make more profit from the movie; it was immoral and it hurt Max's family's feelings. Hollywood should be more careful about portraying historical figures on the silver screen; they should change names if they want to show fictitious drama.The movie would also be a hit without the antagonist's negative portrayal, and James Braddock's real-life story is inspirational and dramatic enough to make a blockbuster movie. Had it not been marred by a fabricated depiction of an original character, ""Cinderella Man"" would have been one of the greatest biographical movies ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hot Take: Better Than 'Rocky',"Yeah, yeah besmirching the GOAT. I'm grinding inspirational films...
What I like about 'Cinderella Man' is that he didn't start off dislikable. Similar to Will Smith's character in 'Pursuit of Happiness', 'Cinderella Man' is about a guy who tries real hard but keeps losing anyways. The difference with 'Rocky' is that Rocky had more of a personal motive since it was at its core a love story, as opposed to Crowe/Smith's characters who are driven by a sense to do right for their families and communities. 'Cinderella Man' is a more ""altruistic"" film than many of the other inspirational films.Everyone involved knocked it out of the park, and I will probably come back to this film the next time life hands me another giant bag of...

Wonderful--This movie has everything!,"Inspiring, earthy, historical, brilliantly shot, well acted--there's nothing missing in this movie except high audience attendance, and that is the latest great mystery of my life. I don't even LIKE boxing, and I love this movie! But if you DO like boxing, you'll like ""Cinderella Man"": there is powerful cinematography of about 5 great fights. After the movie ended, I felt myself finally relaxing and taking big sighs of relief, as I felt I'd just gone 60 rounds! And it was apparent that everyone else in the theater felt that way, too, as we all kind of stumbled out of our chairs and down the aisles, our legs almost giving out from the pummeling we'd just experienced. But ""Cinderella Man"" is more than just a boxing movie--way more! Go see for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Non-formulaic formula,"""Cinderella Man"" immediately corners itself with its name alone. Why give 2 plus hours of your life to a movie that telegraphs its intentions in the very title? Yet Ron Howard's film seems to relish the challenge of giving heft to a story that doggedly follows formula; the title could describe the film itself as well as the story it tells.Russell Crowe gives a performance of quiet intensity as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock. It's good to see Crowe channeling his penchant for fisticuffs toward the screen for once, and it pays off in his restrained, yet fully realized, portrayal of a man trying to keep his family afloat while seemingly everyone sinks around him. Well, not everyone. Braddock is fortunate to have connections among wealthy boxing promoters, who keep him fighting until a broken hand leads to his decommission, and destitution. He can't fight, and the dock bosses aren't likely to pick a gimp for a day's work. Already having promised his worried son that he'll never send him away, Braddock's situation soon looks as hopeless as nearly everyone else's. There's a powerful scene of him showing up to his former promoters, hat literally in hand, pleading for a few bucks to keep the lights on at home.But this being a comeback story, we know ""the Bulldog"" Braddock will be back in the ring, jabbing his way toward improbable glory. It's no surprise, then, when he surprisingly knocks out a heavyweight contender for whom he was supposed to be a tune up. Nor do we expect a seemingly debilitating rib injury to stand too much in the way of Braddock's victory march. As for his final title fight, could it go any shorter than a full 15 rounds, or feature anything less than a seemingly invincible opponent with a habit of leaving corpses in the ring? If you're unsure of any of this, kindly refer back to the title.Howard is smart with this stuff, though, and keeps pugilistic matters mostly in the background. There's no waxing poetic about the purity of boxing; no paeans to the sweetness of its science. Braddock doesn't even seem to enjoy his profession much more than he would a round of darts with the boys at the pub. It's a job when few are available, a chance to keep his family fed and sheltered when no other options are open. Crowe's Braddock tries hard to keep cool in the worst of adversity; he doesn't rise to the provocations of title-holder Max Baer at a pre-fight banquet, and calmly understands his wife's near-hysteria at the prospect of widowhood. Things are tough enough without flying off the handle. Paul Giamatti, always fun to watch, does a nice turn as Braddock's sincere manager who sells all he has to finance his man's training. It's great to see Hollywood taking notice of Giamatti, who seems to inhabit fully all of his roles in spite of his untraditional profile.By openly copping to a by-the-numbers underdog story, ""Cinderella Man"" frees itself up to focus on the much more interesting hardscrabble lives of its characters outside the ring. This film deftly reminds us that formula doesn't have to be formulaic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Whaddamovie!!,"9/10 hands down, and I feel that I am being far too harsh. What else can you say. In the movie, Paul Giamatti's character says, 'Sometimes you see something in a fighter. You don't even know if it real, you're looking for it so bad'. The same can be said of this movie. You look and look through a hundred films and then suddenly you stumble upon one that makes you sway, gives you goosebumps, and 'you don't know if it's real', it's so good. It changes who you are.The eternal struggle of the middle class and the dogged, silent determination to fight against unearthly odds is the substrate on which this boxing movie is built, and it has been executed to perfection. The movie is Russell Crowe all the way and in my personal opinion this performance of his is better than The Maximus Decimus Meridius. When he stands amidst the club members begging for alms with tears of shame in his eyes you really get to see what metal he is made of.Renee Zellweger's short role is articulated with such finesse that you do not even realise that it has relatively so little screen time. She and Crowe share such a chemistry, even in their zero-glamour looks in zero-glamour surroundings.Another standout performer is Paul Giamatti. The man always delivers but this one is out-of-the-blue extraordinary. The ramble he goes on after the first comeback fight is what I can watch all day long and not get bored. An Oscar was what was truly deserved, but I guess the judges didn't see the things I saw.The final fight has been picturised as if it were a battle for life, not the title. The commentary and Round 11 makes your hair stand on end. You get so involved that you do not even realise that lasts for almost the entire last half-hour of the movie. Craig Bierko delivers a little gem as Max Baer. An unexpected yet pleasant surprise.And finally, Ron Howard. Always been a fan of the man, but this movie points a finger to your eye and shows what a great director can achieve with a good script. He has even outdone himself in Cinderella Man and he has set the bar so high that none of his subsequent films have quite been upto the mark, in spite of them all being pretty good movies on their own.It's not a movie, it's a legacy. It's a way of life.It's just a rags to riches story, but it is the greatest one ever told.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Russell Has Heart,Cinderella man is a good hearty movie to go see. I am not a fan of Russell Crowe. With the exception to 'Gladiator' and 'A beautiful Mind' I have not followed his acting history. However I must commend his performance in this movie. He sold me and I actually like the guy in this movie. The story of course helps his case. An Irish hard-luck guy in the midst of the great depression maintains his integrity and shines. I do like boxing I must admit that. The boxing shots in this movie were intense like a true good match should be. Ron Howard was able to capture that fighting spirit and determination of a fighter.

An Insult,"Even if we ignore the mawkish sentimentality of the Depression-era scenes, intended to produce sympathy for the Braddocks but inducing only pain in the audience, the film would have benefited from a ""based on"" disclaimer. It is untrue to the history it depicts. Corn Griffin was not a top contender when Braddock fought him. Braddock had been knocked out, by Lou Scozza in Nov. '32. (On checking, I find the Scozza fight was a TKO, resulting from Braddock's cut eye, so the film gets by on that point). Refs did not say ""Touch gloves."" They said, ""Shake hands."" Body punches were not said to ""pay dividends"" (as we are twice told). And refs did not wipe off the gloves of the man knocked down. They directed the man who had scored the knockout to a neutral corner (after the ""Long Count"") and made sure the other man was up before he could be hit again. In other words, the film pulls a lot of current jargon and practice into the 1930s, making it painfully anachronistic. The treatment of Max Baer is inexcusable. He had killed Frankie Campbell, brother of great Dodgers' first-baseman, Dolph Camilli, but Ernie Schaaf (another Jersey boy) died almost six months after his fight with Baer and after 4 more fights -- after being kayoed by Primo Carnera in 13. Baer took Braddock lightly, did not train for the 1935 fight, and clowned around during the fight, waving to his bimbos at ring side. Braddock did pound out a decision, but the fight was not the brutal brawl depicted in the film. Nor -- though I am open to correction on this point -- did Baer deliberately foul Braddock with two low blows and a vicious backhand. It is unfortunate that Ron Howard took a compelling story about a decent and hard-working man, Jimmy Braddock, and ""Hollywoodized"" it by demonizing Maxie Baer. The film ends before the fight with Joe Louis. Louis said that the right hand with which he knocked Braddock out was the hardest punch he ever threw. Braddock sagged like one of those sacks he had been hauling on the Hoboken docks. The great film about those docks, of course, is ""On the Waterfront,"" which features three fighters whom Louis knocked out: Tony Galento, Abe Simon, and Tami Mauriello. ""Cinderella Man"" resembles ""Rocky,"" of course, but the fight scenes are better in the former. Not as good as ""Champion,"" though, where the shots were reversed, so that a slow punch and a quick withdrawal of the glove looked like the opposite. The movie is Crowecentric, which is good. He is completely convincing as Braddock, particularly in his expert work with the fast bag. It is unfortunate that the history in which he is placed is so patently phony. I just watched the film of Braddock-Baer. It was a clean fight. Baer was warned for shoving Braddock in the 4th. Braddock butted Baer in the 7th -- but it was a product of a shorter man who kept his head down. Braddock delivered a light backhand to Baer in the 11th. Baer complained in mock anger about Braddock's hitting on the break in the 12th. At times Baer held his open left hand out in Braddock's face -- illegal, but hardly the blatant fouling shown in the film. At the end, Baer kissed Braddock on the right cheek. After the decision, Braddock ran across the ring and the two fighters embraced. You can't judge a fight by a film, but it was closer than Charley Lynch's 11-4. Ref Johnny McEvoy had it 9-5-1, and George Kelly had it 7-7-1, with Braddock winning on the supplementary point system that New York had in place at that time. Kelly's verdict looked accurate. Braddock landed some good rights over Baer's low left. Baer hit Braddock with some great right hands, but Braddock almost invariably fought back. Had Baer used a left jab more often he would have dominated. He had a left jab -- not a good one -- but he simply did not set up his right hand with his left often enough vs Braddock. Braddock fought a gritty, gutsy fight. Baer did backhand Max Schmeling in the '33 fight before Baer knocked Schmeling out. The film of that fight does not show any warning from the ref to Baer, though it might have been delivered verbally. Perhaps the critic who claims that Baer repeatedly fouled Braddock is thinking of the earlier fight.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinderella Man was brilliant and you know it,"I'm sorry, but I find it completely ridiculous that people push aside and insult any movie dealing with boxing because they claim it is a remake of Rocky. I often hear people complain about how Maggie Fitzgerald from Million Dollar Baby was made out to be a fem-Rocky Balboa, and, despite how ridiculous it seems, even how Jake La Motta's life was depicted incorrectly in Raging Bull to make him emulate the desperate lifestyle of Balboa. I mean, come on! There's no doubt in my mind that Cinderella Man has proved to be one of the most entertaining and most inspirational movies of our time. Maybe it's just that people like to complain, or that they've naturally associated any and every boxing movie following the latest of the Rocky franchise with weak imitation and unoriginality, or maybe their opinions are focused too much on the way that the pessimistic critics of big-time newspapers tend to find something horribly wrong with every movie ever brought into existence. Okay, I'm through with my rant now. Besides, another unarguable point (which many individuals have brought up before)is that Cinderella Man is in fact based on the life of James Braddock. They lived during the Depression and people actually did live like Braddock and his family did in the movie. He actually was an underdog who was forced to fight in order to provide food for his family, even after he was supposedly retired and past his prime. And there actually was a heavy-hitting machine of a world champion named Max Baer who Braddock had to step into the ring with... okay I'm done with my rant now. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Hackiva Goldsman strikes again,"How on earth does Akiva Goldsman continue to get work as a screenwriter in Hollywood? The man's a hack, responsible for such unforgettable masterpieces as ""Silent Fall"" (1994), ""Batman Forever"" (1995), ""Batman and Robin"" (1997), ""Lost in Space"" (1998), ""Practical Magic"" (1998) and ""I, Robot"" (2004). When you watch such tripe, what can one say but Akiva Goldsman! Yes, he won an Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), when Academy voters went completely bonkers and decided to honor claptrap over quality.I wonder how much of what Cliff Hollingsworth wrote made it into the shooting script. Because this film has all the trademarks of yet another hackneyed job by Goldsman. He doesn't have a clue how to find grey areas in his characters. They're either good or bad. That's it. He hasn't seen a cinematic cliché he doesn't embrace. That's what's wrong with Ron Howard's film, ""Cinderella Man."" Apparently, boxer James J. Braddock's life was nothing but a series of clichés. That this film remains partially interesting is due to Russell Crowe's uncanny ability to disappear into a character and Paul Giamatti's sensationally terrific performance as Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould. Renée Zellweger gets a poorly written role as Braddock's long-suffering wife.""Cinderella Man"" is the ideal film for the George W. Bush administration. It's shamelessly manipulative, alters reality to suit its needs and comes with such jingoistic fervor that you feel like a pariah for not liking it. Not liking this film could be downright un-American. And, as we all know, these days, being called unpatriotic is worse than being called a pedophile.""Cinderella Man"" is the kind of film so seeped in its own sense of righteous goodness that it seems destined to be embraced by Academy voters next year. At least, that could very well result in Giamatti finally getting an Oscar nomination, something he was shamefully denied for his performances in ""American Splendor"" (2003) and ""Sideways"" (2004).In this film, Braddock doesn't just pull himself up by his bootstraps. The guy's too poor to own boots. So he pulls himself up on borrowed bootstraps! I've no doubt the real Braddock was a decent chap who boxed to save his family from dire straits. But I doubt he was as uncomplex a person as Goldsman made him. Also, Max Baer wasn't the ogre Howard and Goldsman make him out to be. In this film, Baer (Craig Bierko) is an obnoxious, insensitive, womanizing brute who gloats about killing two men in the ring.There've been some great boxing films throughout history, including ""Body and Soul"" (1947), ""The Set-Up"" (1949), ""Fat City"" (1972) and Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, ""Raging Bull"" (1980). ""Cinderella Man"" isn't one of them. Though, there were times during Howard's film when I was convinced I was watching Scorsese's movie. Not because ""Cinderella Man"" rekindled the brilliance, but because Howard clearly borrowed so heavily from ""Raging Bull"" for his boxing sequences.Incidentally, while much of the art direction capturing the Great Depression is impressive, what happened when it came to recreating Braddock's ramshackle apartment? Quite frankly, it looked like the set of an amateur theatrical production, and a bad one at that.""Cinderella Man"" could've been a trenchant, powerful, gritty film about an honorable man's fight to remain true to himself and his family and his struggle to overcome great adversity. But every momentous occasion - and this film's riddled with them - is telegraphed so broadly and blatantly that it's difficult to be wowed by any of it. You know promises will be broken, ""important"" scenes of families coming apart will be shown, flashbacks to hammer home sledgehammer-like what Braddock is fighting for will pop up at the right moments.

Moving story that puts you in the depression...,I never heard of Jim Braddock nor Max Baer which helps in the suspense of this movie. It's well played by Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger as a couple that lost everything in the stock market crash. Jim is desperate to keep the family together as the sensible thing to do is send the kids off to relatives until they can get back on their feet. Jim makes a promise to his oldest son that he will not let that happen. Having kids myself I could really relate to the fear of your family living on the street. The movie does a really good job in showing how bad it was to be able to work and yet have no work. With no way to take care of your family you feel the helplessness of the people. The boxing in the movie is a means to an end. This isn't Rocky. This movie has a lot more heart. IMHO.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
For anyone in need of a good love story without too much cliché',"Cinderella Man always lifts me up, not only for the impressive underdog display.The marriage triumph on the side of the boxing struggles is not underplayed. Russell Crowe is beautiful as usual, and his scenes with his wife, played by Miss Zellweger, are what keep me watching this movie over and over. Ron Howard creates a story that casts light on the struggles presented to families during the great depression without the expected scene of the family's love conquering all. Rather, scenes throughout the movie weave together a lovable family with a reasonable amount of problems. Unusually, the love involved isn't filled with too much physical demonstrations and I believe, because of this,the Braddock's love story is one of the best in the movies I've seen from this decade.While, I will not admit to being a true romantic, this love story is one that definitely makes me hopeful that my husband will follow in Braddock's footsteps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
solid Depression Era drama,"Although the comparisons may not be entirely obvious at first, could it be that Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" is actually a sly, under-the-radar remake of ""Seabiscuit"" - albeit with a boxer rather than a racehorse as its inspirational underdog character? In a performance of immense restraint and subtlety, Russell Crowe plays James J Braddock, a Depression era fighter who, at one point, was so hard up that he could barely afford to feed his wife and three small children. For awhile it seemed as if Braddock was all washed up as a boxer, a has-been whose body seemed incapable of taking any further punishment and whose glory days all lay behind him. However, when his luck turned and he began to make a comeback in the ring, knocking off one sure-bet opponent after another, Braddock caught the imagination of a suffering nation, becoming in many ways a symbol of hope and renewal for the beleaguered, downtrodden, out-of-work masses who flocked to his bouts or listened to them enraptured on the radio at home. It was for this reason that he was dubbed Cinderella Man by an astute and appreciative newspaper columnist.Let us say, first of all, that Braddock was no Jake La Motta, either in the ring or out. From what we see of him in the film, Braddock was a kind, gentle man who loved his wife and tried to be the best father he could to his adoring children. It is always more difficult to weave an interesting drama around a ""good"" character than a ""bad"" one, and Howard's film can't always overcome that limitation. Frequently the film feels a mite softer and less hard-edged than we would like it to be, more ""Rocky"" than ""Raging Bull."" Still, I guess the makers of the film were simply trying to remain true to their subject and for that they are to be commended. The scenes between Crowe and Renee Zellweger as Mae, Braddock's concerned but supportive wife, serve as the fulcrum that keeps the story balanced and interesting. Ditto for the relationship between Braddock and Joe Gould, his devoted manager, beautifully played by Paul Giamatti. We also see Braddock instilling a strong sense of moral values into his children despite the harsh conditions under which they live. For ""Cinderella Man"" effectively conveys just how difficult life was for many ordinary Americans in the 1930's, just how close to starvation many of them came in their daily struggle with poverty. Braddock's tale is emblematic of life in that difficult era.Howard generates a tremendous amount of suspense in his closing scenes in which Braddock challenges the world's reigning champ, Max Baer, in a bout in Madison Square Garden Garden. Howard brilliantly intercuts between the boxers, the fans and Mae, who is listening to the fight on the radio at home, terrified that her beloved husband may not survive the bout.Thus, despite the occasionally lackluster storytelling and overindulgence in sentimentality, ""Cinderella Man"" scores as a moving tribute to a decent man who never gave up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Outstanding film, enormously authentic","One major point of controversy on this film was its apparent demonizing of Max Baer, in particular, the restaurant scene where Baer almost gloats over killing two men in the ring. In fact, for the rest of his life, he wept or got teary whenever Frankie Campbell's name was mentioned; he lost all his passion for boxing when Campbell died; and never again fully opened up on an opponent.It is also hard to imagine Baer, playboy that he was, openly propositioning Braddock's wife. Not impossible, but I would think it unlikely. Max Baer was an enormously gifted but inconsistent fighter, and preferred to play the clown; but, by all accounts he was a nice man, tender-hearted and loving. Otherwise, he is captured authentically, and for weeks before the fight he belittled Braddock publicly, until he read the relief story and realized the caliber of opponent he was about to face.Also reproduced authentically are the fights. Ron Howard took great care, not only to tell the story accurately, which he did, but to choreograph the fights according to how they really went. I have the Baer-Carnera and Baer-Braddock fights on DVD, and Howard reproduced them very accurately, including the fouls Baer committed during the fight (three rounds were taken away from Baer for low blows and back-handing, and he back-handed other fighters as well, including Max Schmeling). And, in some of his fights, you can see him bowing and waving to his opponent at the end of a round as he did in the film.I am a fan of authentically accurate films, something Hollywood has produced far more of in the last three decades; and this is the most authentic I have ever seen. It is wonderfully written, beautifully directed, and superlatively acted. And, it's a true story.Do not miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Could of been a contender!,"This movie came out almost 30 years after Rocky(1976) and yet THIS movie was almost like watching Rocky all over again! The Max Baer character was Mr. T and even did the Mr. T ""why don't you come over to my apartment and I'll show you a real man"" bit when they were in that fancy restaurant and he insulted Braddocks wife! C'mon! You know that did not happen back then! That was inserted by Ron Howard! And the turtles that Rocky had..Cuff and Link..remember those? And CM also had turtles! The down on his luck fighter who caught a big break and ended up winning a fight he had no business winning? I was really into this movie until the last 30 minutes when they made Max Baer look like a Mr. T clone! I wanted to really like the movie and it really painted a great picture of a man trying to keep his family together in really tough times. But the last 30 minutes ruined it. Too many similarities too Rocky even though this movie was supposed to be about a fighter from the 1930's! Another case of Hollywood recreating history as it DID NOT happen!

Flawed yet lovable film,"To be perfectly honest, most of the theater applauded throughout the movie, and frankly I can see why. However, while it may please the general mob, Cinderella Man was flawed. Though it shows a very realistic and strong depiction of the depression, it goes over the top in attempting to draw emotion out of their poverty. And at 2 and a half hours, when an hour of it is devoted to ""oh look at how poor everyone is it's the president's fault"" you can't help but wonder if the studio is demanding some tear-jerking scenes. However, Russell Crowe delivers fantastic acting, blowing everyone else away, and the fight scenes are top-notch. You will love this movie, but it isn't perfect, and is sometimes over the top. However, this doesn't stop it from being the feel good movie of the year so far, and you will leave with a smile on your face and a bounce in your step.

I liked it but I didn't like the depiction of Baer,"I understand it's a movie and not a documentary, therefore they take dramatic liberties, but they are depicting real people. Max Baer was not a monster.

Imagine how hurtful it must have been for his family to watch a movie what depicts Baer in such a vicious manner.Aside from that- I really do enjoy this movie. Phenomenal acting by all parties.

The love, warmth and devotion shown in the Braddock family is inspiring.I took my mother to see the movie. I warned her it was about boxing and had some violent scenes in it. ""Sure, I know Jim Braddock, we used to listen to the fights on the radio when we were kids."" She remembered the Baer-Braddock and Baer-Carnera fights. My mother! After the movie she started talking about her childhood, which she has always been reluctant to do, and some of the hardships her family had. She remembered all the men out of work on the streets and many calling at the door looking for any kind of work. I got a better understanding of how difficult it really was and a better appreciation of her. She called me later to tell me how much she liked the movie and how much it meant to her.An excellent movie which I highly recommend, even if you think you won't like a boxing movie.

film-making by the numbers,"There's currently quite a bit of apprehension in Hollywood regarding box office numbers, and the production of films like these doesn't reassure the marketing teams out there. When the preview first showed up a few months ago, I was underwhelmed by the fact that I could almost see the strings being pulled, the music cued in, and the fingers pointing to what we were supposed to react. I was hoping that those warning signals would be dispelled by the actual film. Let's just say that a train wreck wouldn't be an appropriate comparison to ""Cinderella Man""... at least there would be something real and moving in the disaster.There are problems when: 1) The art direction overwhelms the story. 2) The leading actress has only expression throughout the film. 3) There are several shots of children while the big event is going on. 4) The camera spends more time away from the actual action in the ring. 5) One starts rooting for the ""evil"" contender. 6) Tributes to other films start popping all over the big dramatic scenes. For a while I thought I saw a shot of Robert DeNiro in color doing his ""Raging Bull"" close-up in a couple of the fights. 7) The pacing drags only to be broken by corny jokes... ""turtles"" anyone? 8) There is no suspense. 9) Transitions are at best muddled. 10) The film feels longer than the three extended versions of the LOTR put together.Too bad...

"Going the Distance, both in and out of the Ring","(Some Spoilers) Increidable but true depression era rags to riches ""Cinderella Story"" about the amazing comeback of boxer James ""The Bergen New Jersey Bulldog"" Braddock, Russell Crowe, who went from having to go on welfare, which he later honestly paid back, to be able to care for his family to become the Heavyweight Champion of the World. All this within the space of less then two short but unforgettable years.A major prospect for becoming the Light-Heavyweight Champion of the world back in the late 1920's Braddock was soundly beaten on July 18, 1929 in a match with the fast fisted and fleet footed light heavyweight Tommy Loughran. Three months after the Loughran bout the Stock Market crashed and Jimmy, like tens of millions of fellow Americans, faced a bleak future with the high-living and fast-spending years of the 1920's becoming a distant memory with the Great Depresion descending upon America.We see Jimmy four years later in 1933 at the end of the line as a professional boxer in his dull and boring match with Abe Feldman ,which ended after six rounds as a no contest. In his dressing room Jimmy is found to have broken his right hand and the New York State Boxing Commission has his boxing license revoked. The winter of 1933/34 was a cold and bitter one for the Braddock's with the heat turned off, because Jimmy was unable to pay the utilities, and with the Baddock's children being sent away, for a short time, to family members in Brooklyn because him and his wife Mae, Renee Zellweger, couldn't care for them. This really hurt Jimmy since he swore to his young son Jay never to give him or his brother and sister Howard & Rosey away to relatives no matter what happened.By the late spring of 1934 Jimmy was at the end of his rope with little or no work on the Jersey docks, because of his broken right hand, and no chance to get back in the ring. It's then just like in the movies, mind you this is a true story, a miracle happened to Jimmy which also reflected, and uplifted, his friends and family and everyone else in America who had their hopes and dreams dashed to pieces by the Great Depression. It's was then that Jimmy's former manager Joe Gould, Paul Glamatti, got him a match, as well as his license back to box with his right hand having mended,on the under-card of the Heavyweight Championship fight between the champ Primo Carnera, Matthew G. Taylor, and the very dangerous challenger Max Baer, Craig Blerko.Jimmy was picked by boxing promoter James Johnston, Bruce McGill,as a sacrificial lamb to be knocked out by the highly touted Corn Griffin, Art Binkowski. In the fight the desperate and brave Jimmy Barddock, after taking everything that Griffin threw at him,floored Griffin in the third round to the astonishment of everyone watching! With his boxing career now back on track Jimmy went on to beat John Henry Lewis, who beat Jimmy in a ten round decision in San Fanciso two years earlier, on Nevember 16, 1934. Jimmy then went on to defeat the very powerful and hard hitting Art Lasky on March 22, 1935 with is fancy footwork and superior boxing abilities.This set the scene up for the Heavyweight Championship bout between Jimmy and Max Baer in the Long Island Bowl on June 13, 1935. Exactly a year after he began his comeback by knocking out Corn Griffin in the same arena, Madison Square Garden, that Max Baer won the coveted title.Jimmy, given no chance at all by the experts to defeat the ""Big Bad Baer"", In one of the most exciting and heart lifting boxing sequences ever put in a movie, as well as happening in real life, took the fight to Baer right from the opening bell. Freely mixing it with the champ Jimmy took everything that the ""Killer"" Max Baer could hit him with and gave back as good as he got in return. Clowning around at first Baer got serious later opening up on Jimmy with all the heavy artillery he had in his boxing gloves.With tremendous courage, and ring savvy and boxing finesse, Jimmy fending off Baer's wild and desperate assaults in the late rounds was still holding on to a slim, but diminishing, lead as the bout went the full distance going into the 15th round.In the fateful last round with him ahead on all cards Jimmy instead of trying to avoid Baer's punches, and run out the clock in order to win the Heavyweight Championship, mixed it up and stood toe to toe with the champ in the most exciting round of the entire fight. In the end Jimmy walked away with the title in a unanimous decision that left the crowd, at first quite and sullen, at the Long Island Bowl in complete pandemonium.Jimmy Braddock's amazing victory gave the American people something to cheer about during those dark and bleak depression years. Jimmy Bradock was an underdog in every sense of the word yet overcame all the obstacles that were placed in front of him. In the end Jimmy showed that no matter how bad things are faith and belief in oneself is the most powerful force that one can have. And with that faith one can not only succeed over unbelievable odds but inspire others to do the same as well.One of the most moving scenes in the movie ""Cinderella Man"" came just before the fight between Jimmy Braddock and Max Baer as Jimmy's wife Mae went into her church to light a candle and say a prayer for her courageous and valiant husband. To Mae's astonishment she saw that almost the entire town of North Bergen New Jersey were in the church doing the exact same thing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Might I ask of Hollywood just one thing?,"From this point forward, Ron Howard should be allowed only to direct period-piece biopics starring Russell Crowe and an Oscar-caliber Hollywood sweetheart as Crowe's supportive wife. Just as this acting-directing duo did with their award-winning ""Beautiful Mind"" audiences are again treated to a true story of triumph over adversity played up with sepia-toned cinematography, lovely attention to period detail, and a swelling music score.There's just something about Ron Howard's hackneyed mediocre directing style that allows for Russell Crowe's scenery chewing chameleon-like performances to shine at their brightest. He is the greatest actor of this generation, and here there is not one false note in his portrayal of scrappy under-dog boxer James Braddock, who went from the bread lines to the ring during the Great Depression and brought a nation on their knees back to their feet (or so the producers would like us to believe in their fairy-tale story). Likewise, Renee Zelwegger, like Jennifer Connolly before her, is pitch-perfect at Braddock's lovely wife, Mae. Please, Hollywood, from here on out let's cast Zelwegger only in movies taking place in the 1920's and 1930's. Just like in ""Chicago"" she looks perfect in the part, as if she was born in that era. The rest of the supporting cast (especially Giamatti as Braddock's tongue-lashing manager) is top notch.Howard leaves no cliché unturned and no heart-string unplucked (cute kids getting sick in the cold or shedding a tear at a father's promise, a boxing opponent of pure swagger and spite, a grieving widow finding hope in cheering for Braddock, cynical reporters and other rich-people type becoming overwhelmed by Braddock's show of heart). As predictable as it all was, it was still nicely uplifting, and proof positive this is the only type of movie Howard should touch, and Crowe the only star he should ever work with.

Cinderella Man,"Once Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) breaks his hand in a fight, he discovers that his previously reasonably successful life in the ring has come to an end - and that puts him, wife ""Mae"" (Renée Zellweger) and their kids on skid row. He's gone from making $8,000 from a fight to ferreting around the docks looking for work and taking state welfare funds so they can keep their children in their now electricity-free apartment. Then serendipity takes an hand as his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) arranges a last-minute fight for him that might garner a meagre $250. It's not a fight he's expected to fare well in, but against the odds he triumphs and that enables Gould to engage with his former backer Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) and that could, ultimately, lead to a world title tight fight against Max Baer (Craig Bierko). It's a pretty savage indictment of urban American life in the 1930s and it also serves well at illustrating just how boxing so often proved the most appealing and available conduit for many an uneducated man to escape the poverty trap that would embrace not just him but his family, too. As to Braddock, his story also involves his close friend ""Mike"" (Paddy Considine) who embarks on a similar career path, only he has neither the skill nor the sense to make it work. For that, Braddock is especially fortunate to have Gould in his corner, a man who is less venal than many who would hire and fire at the drop of an hat. It's the boxing action that really works well here, though, with Crowe putting heart and soul into a character that is designed to demonstrate fortitude and determination, sure, but also humanity and humility too. Giamatti steals the scenes, but Zellweger also contributes well as Ron Howard presents us with a poignant, violent and plausible story of a man motivated by family and friends who epitomised his own version of the pioneering spirit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Ignore the critics.,"Those who criticize Cinderella Man are the same who criticize Finding Neverland. They have the same, tired argument: Cinderella Man doesn't represent the truth; Finding Neverland doesn't represent the truth! What these people don't quite seem to grasp is that neither of these movies (make that NO movie) owes us the complete truth. Cinderella Man isn't a documentary. If Braddock needs to be made out as a bigger hero than he really was -- and if Baer needs to be made out as a bigger villain than he really was -- then so be it.I didn't go to the theater to watch a 3 hour history lesson -- I went to be entertained. I went to be inspired. I went to be moved. I went to laugh. Cinderella Man succeeds in all these areas and more.Although the fight scenes were the best I have ever seen, this isn't a boxing movie -- my wife loved it just as much as I did. This is a story of love, determination and will-power. This movie is an all-too-rare thing: a reason to go to the theater. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Captivating,"I went to this film with a certain amount of scepticism having never been a fan of either boxing or Russell Crowe. However, I was hooked from almost the first shot - the acting is top notch from Crowe as the courageous Jim Braddock through Connor Price,Ariel Waller,Patrick Louis as his three children (the first good performances I've seen from child actors all year). The direction from Howard is superb capturing the savagery of the sport perfectly (the theatre I was in gasped and winced during the fight scenes) and drawing the viewer deeply into such a dark period of America's history. This story of Braddock's rise, fall and rise is well-paced, brilliantly scripted and as captivating as any film of recent times. The characters act believably and are crafted to perfectly elicit the required reactions that the film-makers want the cinema-goer to feel. Overall this is a superb must see movie and I hope it garners some Oscar nominations at least, certainly Crowe deserves a nomination(Best Actor) and possibly Paul Giamatti (Best Supporting) for a considered portrayal as Braddock's manager Joe Gould.Overall, I would say along with Crash this is the best film of 2005 so far and, in the genre of Boxing films is second only to (obviously) Scorsese/De Niro's Raging Bull.8/10 - Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! Hits my top 5 list,"I went to a sneak preview of this movie 2 times before opening day. I love the ups and downs of the emotion. The audience was clapping, cheering and crying throughout the movie!!!! There is great chemistry between Crowe and Zellweger. They put you right in the movie with them. Russell Crowe did a fabulous job again!! He is James J Braddock in this movie and no on else. Now that is acting! This movie again keeps you on the edge of your seat clapping and cheering and again crying.to see what happens. The acting is A+++++ Hope this movie wins a lot of awards.I am going to see it again!!

"""CINDERELLA MAN"" delivers a knockout!","It's somewhat early in the season to predict the Oscars, but ""CINDERELLA MAN"" is a sure bet for multiple nominations.Ron Howard has, once again, directed a winning film, and this one makes you ""feel""! Boxing legend Jim Braddock, having fought his way from rags to mediocrity in the ring is hardly able to provide for his family during the horrible depths of the Great Depression. The intensity of his love for his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) and his three children drives him to elevate himself beyond the pain of broken wrist and rib to fight in the ring, work the docks, achieve an impossible dream and bring hope to the downtrodden masses of an entire country.This is perhaps one of the best performances by Russell Crowe who shows powerful sentiments as Jim Braddock and whose boxing prowess makes you want to see more of the fights. In ""Cinderella Man"", Ron Howard has put you in the ring, facing Max Baer!!! An incredible feat of creativity gets you to follow the fight's connecting punches all the way to their impact on the cheering crowds. You are there  in the ring as well as in the audience! Renée Zellweger, as Mae Braddock is the Mom who had us at ""Hello"". Without her endless love, support and understanding, Jim Braddock is alone. She is the glue that keeps this family together, without lights, heat or milk.See you at the Oscars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cheesier than Iron Will,"In this late-blooming Rocky clone you're going to get the same formula you get in most cheesy feel-good boxing movies:Protagonist = nice guy + down on his luck + bad boxer that suddenly becomes world class because he just has more ""heart"" + gets some debilitating injury that makes it seem like he has to quit his boxing careerWife = devoted + doesn't want husband to box because she's worried he'll get hurtVillain = one-dimensional + ""bad"" (sleeps with many women and doesn't mind killing people in the ring) + cruel + arrogant + BM (bad-mannered) playerPlot = Protagonist is a mediocre boxer who somehow gets good and puts up a good fight against the best boxer in the world at the end of movie even though everybody thinks he's going to get creamed and tells him he'd better cancel it.But there's a nacho twist to this predictable cheese puff of a movie because we get the Russell Crowe ""Gladiator"" (2000) effect where the protagonist is an absolute saint who would never lie, cheat, steal, be unfaithful, or even lose his temper. In short, a perfect good vs. Evil matchup settled WITH FISTS like the plot of a King of Fighters Game.Ohh, also the Great Depression's going on in the background and one of his friends is a communist and an alcoholic... umm, something about unions... yada, yada, yada.Why did this movie get made? Why does it have such a high rating on IMBD? It must be something political because this movie is no better than any cheap Turkish boxing B-movie from the 80s except for the fact that it has high production values.It's predictable, it's long, it's boring, it's unfocused. Watch Rocky + Rocky II instead. It's the same thing but better.Honourable Mentions: Watch a documentary or read a book on Jack Johnson or Johann Trollman, two boxers with stories that were actually INTERESTING, unique, and fresh.Unfortunately, their careers were cut short by societies that didn't find their ""physical characteristics"" to be acceptable in polite society (if you know what I mean). Furthermore, their stories continue to be passed up for big-budget feature-length movies, which go to people like like what's-his-face from Cinderella Man instead for reasons you can probably guess.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked","Ron Howard is an interesting director, because that there's nothing interesting about him at all. He doesn't wear all black and make spooky Gothic movies; he doesn't wear thick-rimmed glasses, talk nervously and make movies about himself; he doesn't have three names. He is just a regular person who makes totally regular movies. The thing is, he makes GOOD regular movies. They don't have anything particularly special or unique about them, but they're just good all around. It was true with 'Willow', it was true with 'Apollo 13', and it was true with 'A Beautiful Mind'. Now, it's true with 'Cinderella Man'. And this isn't a bad thing at all  on the contrary.Jim Braddock's character is masterfully constructed. Not in a very long time has anybody played such a downright nice man as Jim Braddock. Despite the poverty, the hopelessness, and his losing fights during the Great Depression, Braddock always remains levelheaded, sweet-tempered and concerned about his family above all. I can't recall one boxing movie in which the boxer wasn't a mean, grumpy man (Raging Bull) or single and tough ('Rocky'). This is the only boxing movie I know in which the boxer is a sweet, loving family man, married and with children nonetheless.The acting is superb all around, and I couldn't expect less of the performers involved. Russell Crowe ('Gladiator', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Master & Commander'), while unpredictable and hard to control, is still, I believe, one of the most talented actors working today. His performance in this film is beyond sensational. It's not just in the dramatic moments: it's also the little nuances he includes in his performance, such as in the scene in which he returns to his old boxing bosses and asks them for money to help him pay the electric bill. The look of humiliation and humbleness in his eyes when he walks into that room is priceless. Renee Zelwegger ('Bridget Jones's Diary', 'Chicago', 'Cold Mountain'), another one of my favorite working actresses, also delivers a strong and brilliant performance. She plays Braddock's wife, Mae. Paul Giamatti truly stands out, though, as Joe Gould, Braddock's manager. I believe that Giamatti, a rising lead actor in recent films 'American Splendor' and 'Sideways', is one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood today. His acting is esteemed by critics, but is shunned by his peers in Hollywood. Perhaps his performance in Cinderella Man will finally get him the Oscar nomination he deserved for American Splendor and Sideways.The editing is outstanding. The fights are particularly well edited. The pace is fast, but the editing isn't quick, or rushed. It really pulls you right into the fight, though, and totally engages you. The cinematography, too, is impressive, especially during the boxing scenes. The inter-cutting of point-of-view shots with subjective shots of the two boxers is executed excellently. The cuts occur at just the right times, and the overall effect really lets you feel the adrenaline of the fight.Like most boxing movies (Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby, at least), Cinderella Man isn't even about the boxing. In fact, for most of the middle part of the movie there is no boxing at all: instead, the film portrays how Braddock, his wife, Mae, and their three kids, struggle to survive in the poverty of the Great Depression. The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression is as compelling as the boxing story. Braddock portrays a much-needed role model, devoted first and foremost to his family. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today.But the audience's involvement reaches a peak during the boxing scenes. A combination of identification with Braddock's sympathetic character, masterful directing and flawless editing and cinematography make the boxing scenes, especially the final one, heart pounding, compelling and totally gripping. My heart jumped with every swing, and my grip on the seat handle tightened with every punch. When the audience becomes SO involved with what occurs on the screen, that's the single most prominent sign of good film-making.Of course, the more minor technical aspects of the film are perfect. You couldn't expect less of a period film, really, but it's still an aspect to note: The costumes, sets, production design, lighting, even the props are all top-notch.The film tries its best to avoid clichés, but in some instances, it's hard to do so. It's a regular riches-to rags-to riches story, and the boxing scenes also don't have anything ground-breaking and different about them, but you have to remember that this is a biographical film, and the events that occur in it are all true. Sure, the riches-to rags-to riches story in the film does seem a little far-fetched, but this was the true story of Jim Braddock, and so all clichés in the film are forgiven.Unfortunately and disappointingly, Cinderella Man was not a success in North America, even though it has all the signs to be a real winning and successful movie. Although the movie received very good reviews from critics and audiences, it faired relatively poorly at the box office. Perhaps it was the timing, as these ""Oscar"" movies are usually released in November and December, and not in June, when Cinderella Man was released in North America. Moviegoers look for summer blockbusters in June, and not dramas such as this one. Or perhaps Russell Crowe's hotel phone-throwing fiasco turned audiences off. Whatever the reason, I hope the movie's DVD release will incite a new interest in it, just in time for the Oscars.This is a truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked, and I hope will impress some Oscar voters. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not Just a Boxing Picture,"When we were looking for a movie to see that particular evening a few months ago,my wife protested that Cinderella MAN was a boxing film and that it would be better suited for my brothers,buddies and myself. Well, we wound up going in anyway and, boy was she glad.While it's true that Cinderella MAN is a story of the prize ring, it is much more than that. It's a boxing story, a biography and a period piece as well as a love story of sorts.Now, that is not to say that the fisticuffs of the film were sub standard in any way. Both the demonstration of the ""Sweet Science"" by the individual actors and the recreation of historical bouts from the depression era are all top notch.To start with it is based on the true story of one James J.Braddock who was a sort of Journeyman Light Heavyweight Boxer in the 1920's. Braddock had to give up his pugilistic career due to some recurring injury to his hand. Some time later, he gets back into the game and works his way up to the Heavyweight Crown. This is all common knowledge to most any sports fan.The film is also a great biopic in that it has been said to capture the essence of the real man. At times the character seems almost too good to be true. But those who knew him have insisted that the real man was as portrayed.As a ""Love Story"", well love is all portrayed all throughout this story. We see the love and devotion of a man and woman to each other and to their family.The love of the children for their folks when the financial condition of the country and the whole world is at its very worst.And finally, the love of a public for a true champion for them to revere.Lastly, the film was a period piece. It paints a very good picture of the depression years and what it was (and still is) like to be among the working poor. Mr.Braddock was representative of that generation of people who bravely fought their way through the Great Depression, only to immediately face the dangers and come out victorous in World War II.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Ron Howard on top of his game,"Cinderella Man follows the life and career of boxer James Braddock during the Great Depression. After sustaining a string of injuries, Braddock, once a champion fighter, is thrown out of the boxing league. As boxing was his main source of income, Braddock must seek alternative means to pay the bills and to feed his family. A fortunate string of events leads to Braddock's being given a second chance, although his wife is reluctant to subject him to such brutality once again. I don't want to take away from the experience by giving away any more of the plot, but anyone who is familiar with Braddock's story knows this will be a phenomenal film. Ron Howard simultaneously captures the brutality of Braddock's fights and his gentle nature. Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger brilliantly portray Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, and Paul Giamatti gives a fabulous performance as Braddock's manager and friend. Take my word for it, Cinderella Man is definitely worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I have never felt so much like I was in New York with them and believed the worst could happen any minute. Better than a thriller! WELL DONE!!! What is wrong with Hollywood when they ignore this one? Maybe two years in a row for fight movies was too much. I did like last year's but a fem ale fight movie is not representative of the sports as a whole. The historical angle was also thoroughly researched. I have often heard and seen and read many stories about the Depression but I have never felt the impact and reality of the societal loss as I did in this film. So many aspects of excellence and still ignored. In a way I can understand because it was an emotionally grueling movie and not just entertainment....but the fight scenes were great!

Inevitably Predictable And Boring,"Why, can you tell me, the Hollywood production may be so boring? If there is a movie about any sportsman, then the film starts usually with him being OK, then, all of a sudden (irony included) he gets into a deep, bottomless pit of a despair or problem, then slowly he starts his way up and on. Cinderella Man is exactly this kind of a movie. Apart from brutally detailed boxing scenes, this is a sweaty, sugary sweetish family drama of a hero rising back from bad to good. The plot is so predictable that we could comment what was going to happen 10 minutes prior to the very event. The performance of Russell Crowe is never more terrible than here, as well as Renee Zellwegger is so pathetic with all her sad and happy faces she tries to put on from time to time.

Another Oscar Worthy performance from Russell Crowe.,"I love boxing movies! Forget ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Against The Ropes"", Cinderella Man takes the cake! Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as Jim Braddock. A boxer who struggled to make ends meet to provide for his family during The Great Depression. He goes against a lot of boxers, including Max Baer, the famous boxer who's son went on to play Jethro from The Beverly Hillbillies. While he's struggling to get a job after injuring his hand, his family suffers from poverty, and has to go look for work. I recommend this movie for boxing fans, Russell Crowe fans, or fans of the sports genre. Too bad Cinderella Man only came in at #4 on the Top 5 Box Office. It should have won an Oscar.

Crowe was perfect in this film. He was tough, sympathetic and a great father figure. The boxing scenes seemed very realistic and the way injuries were portrayed were very inventive.

"Really, Really Good...But Coulda Been Great","""Cinderella Man"" is a really, really good movie that will work flawlessly for many viewers.It's just short of being a great film, though.""Cinderella Man"" tells a true and remarkable story, and it tells it well. It aims for tears and cheers and it earns both.Russel Crowe, as Depression-era boxer James Braddock, is his usual charismatic, handsome, masculine presence, and a fine actor. There isn't anyone else like him out there among English-speaking American / British / Aussie / Kiwi actors. He alone is worth the price of admission.Paul Giamatti, as fight manager Joe Gould, is brilliant, as one would expect.Craig Bierko, as a swaggering, sexily satanic Max Baer, is as scary and fun to watch as Darth Vader was in the first ""Star Wars."" Director Ron Howard seems to be trying to film fights in a whole new way, trying to top films like Martin Scorcese's ""Raging Bull."" He does a really good job.So, what's not to like in a movie this good?* Women. This movie caters to its male viewers. That's not a bad thing, but it made this female viewer waiting for a depth that the movie could not deliver.The film makes clear that Russel Crowe / James Braddock, single-handedly carries the whole world on his shoulders. He sacrifices his breakfast so that his daughter may eat. He humiliates himself in front of his former peers so he can pay the electric bill. Etc.How did his wife Mae, Renee Zellweger, spend the Depression? Whining, nagging, and otherwise doing not much of anything.She mentions in passing that she takes in sewing, but this throwaway comment is easily missed, and gives Mae no life.Zellweger is a Kewpie Doll here trying to express the gravitas of a wife and mother. She fails. She comes across as grating; her dark helmet-style hair emphasizes her lack of appeal.My teeth were on edge throughout her scenes.Love between James and Mae is meant to be a centerpiece of the movie and Braddock's motivation; Crowe communicates his love; Zellweger never conveys that she is his worthy mate.There's actually a scene where Mae and Mrs. Joe Gould sit down and say to each other, paraphrase, ""Men do everything and we do nothing."" Well, thanks for pointing that out.That's not how the women in my family spent the Depression, but that's what the movie wants us to believe, and that failure to acknowledge women as full human beings cheats the movie.""Cinderella Man"" would have been a much better movie if it, like other boxing films, mated its male lead, through the script and through casting, with a worthy partner. Think of Eva Marie Saint opposite Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront,"" Talia Shire opposite Sly Stallone in ""Rocky,"" Lili Palmer opposite John Garfield in ""Body and Soul.""* Murky Cinematography. People living a long time ago looked as crisp and clear to each other as we do today; they didn't look like antique, stained, sepia photographs. Howard tries to make the movie look ""old"" and this just makes it look murky.* More background. ""Seabiscuit"" erred on the other side, adding too much expository prose about the history of the Depression. ""Cinderella Man"" didn't tell us enough. In one scene, Braddock is a wealthy man, a home-owner, with his own driver. In the next, he is living in an unheated hovel.I know that this is a historical reality, and yet the movie never made me believe it.There is a character, Mike, who seems to be a bit of an anarchist who apparently dies in a Hooverville, but this is never made clear or interesting, which is too bad.One final note: boxing matches make up a lot of the running time of this movie. If you are the type who needs to look away when two characters on screen are pummeling each other into bloody wads of flesh, you may end up not seeing a lot of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This film's point is to remind us that with enough determination one man can accomplish anything and that all life's hardships do is make us stronger for having faced them and in the case of Braddock, overcome them.

"Powerful, Inspirational Story!","Ron Howard's Cinderella Man is certainly a true Hollywood Cinderella story. This film has the distinction of being one of the better boxing movies ever made. I think it's better than such classics like Rocky, Raging Bull, and The Fighter. I think what makes this story so powerful and motivating is the setting. This takes place during the Great Depression where nearly everyone was affected one way or the other.This film is based on the true story of Jim Braddock. Braddock is a former boxer whose family has fallen on hard times. When he gets an opportunity to earn money as part of a one-game comeback, he has no idea how special this comeback will be.The acting is really good. Russell Crowe puts up another fine performance as Braddock. Renee Zellweger is really good as Braddock's wife who cares deeply for her husband. Paul Giamatti is especially good as Braddock's manager.Overall, this is a film that looks to provide some meaningful inspiration. This is a film not really about boxing, but how a struggling family persevered with little or no money. All the boxing scenes were executed well and I have never felt tense watching a on-screen boxing match as I did with the final battle in this movie.

"One Way Ticket From Palookaville, and Dogville","Braddock lost everything because of injuries and 1929. He didn't take it out on his family, or society or look for scapegoats. He got a second chance, culminating in a title shot in 1935, as a long shot (apparently 10-1). At about the same time, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote ""There are no second acts in American lives"" (ironically, Fitzgerald was only considered ""great"" posthumously). The film ""Dogville"" proposed an America whose ""true"" ugliness would be exposed by poverty. www.nydailynews.com has reprinted some of its 1935 articles about the fight, including one that depicted a different America: ""Braddock has been kicked around. He has been down and out on relief, and all but counted out in the game of life.

An excellent film that recalls the hardships that most Americans...,"The reality of the film is the best feature. For those of us that are too young to have lived through the depression (my parents did), it is hard to relate to the sheer enormity of the economic collapse that occurred from 1929 through 1936/7. Especially in light of the great country that we have become: EVERYONE has color TV's, and even those living below the poverty line, have it far better than the poor and even middle class of the 1930's.Crowe provides a very credible boxer of yester-year and Rene Z is simply perfect! Paul G is his typical excellent as a main supporting character, you really take a strong liking to him, as he believes in his friend, Braddock.The only criticism is that the movie editing lingers a bit too much on the fear that Mrs. Braddock displays. No, I am not into the gore, but the movie was about very tough times and how one man survived the Great Depression and survived some very brutal fights, more than 100 in his lifetime. The average Heavy Weight boxer today will have less than 25 fights in his career and less than 10 fights after he takes the title.Go see the film, as it is worth the full price admission.

And even though Cinderella Man is actually about a man willing to risk it all for his wife and children, that final fight against Max Baer is up there with the greatest movie boxing matches of all time.Cinderella Man being 2 hours and 24 minutes long is probably why people like it so much, but I think cutting down on the time would've made it less good but more enjoyable.Cinderella Man's ""greatness"" is up there with Rocky and Raging Bull with emotion, but I only gave it a 7 because it's not the most fun popcorn-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good Film, not Great","Cinderella Man is a good film but not a great one. Crowe is his usual excellent self in a role that would be a mere cliché with a lessor actor, however all the other roles are just that. The film is enjoyable on a strictly feel good level, which is fine, but because its aim is so obviously manipulative (ie I expected Dickens' Tiny Tim on crutches to show up at any moment) it becomes very formulaic and entirely predictable. Nothing wrong with that however, just nothing special. It is definitely worth seeing for Crowe's performance and the excellent set decoration, but it is not one of the top ten movies of 2005....at least I hope not.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great emotional story,"James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful up and coming fighter. By 1933, he is broken down and like the rest of the world impoverished. He can't pay his bills. His family is suffering. He struggles on with smaller fights, nagging injuries, and little work. Then they revoke his license to fight. He hits bottom. His kids are sent away. He goes on public assistance and ends up begging for money. His long time trainer Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gets a short notice fight with the number 2 heavyweight contender but he surprised everybody by winning.The one word for the Braddock character is dignity. He never lost his even as he hit rock bottom. It's a very compelling character, and Russell Crowe plays it perfectly. Both Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are terrific in this. The fight action is well done and exciting. The best part of the movie is probably when the family is down to nothing. It's a superb movie from a great director with a compelling story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Determination and Integrity,"My fiancé and I both loved this movie. It's a great movie about hope, determination, love and supporting one's spouse, fighting for one's family, and INTEGRITY. Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger are convincing actors as they portray a couple living through the Great Depression, struggling to feed their three children. Russell Crowe, as Jimmy Braddock (Cinderella Man), beats all odds, including a broken wrist and broken a ribs and losing his boxing license, to make a phenomenal comeback, winning the title. Jimmy's integrity remains intact after he wins the title, as at the end of the movie viewers are informed that he served faithfully in the war, bought a home for his family in NJ, and then owned and operated machines where he used to work the few shifts he could get during the oppression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
extraordinary...,"i loved this movie. In my opinion, it was the best movie of 2005. Russell Crowe gave an amazing performance and Ron Howard did a great job really bringing you into this time period. It is not like every other boxing movie. It is about a man trying to keep his family together and happy during the great depression. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! When i found out that it didn't do well at the box office, i was in shock! I loved this movie and the fact that not as many people saw it as they should have made me mad. It is a wonderful film and should be recognized a one. The acting is amazing, the directing is phenomenal, and the movie in general is great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simply beautiful,"In 1928, James. J. Braddock was a champion light-heavyweight prizefighter. By 1933, though, he'd hit some pretty hard times, along with most of the rest of America. With a broken right hand and a doused spirit, Braddock was so pathetic in the ring that his license to fight was revoked. Unable to pay the bills, Braddock's family has to sell off nearly everything it owns to survive. Braddock can't even get steady work at the docks, as there are precious few jobs each day. In celebration of the indomitable American spirit, Braddock rises from his squalor ashes to challenge the legendary - and murderous - Max Baer for the heavyweight championship at Madison Square Garden.Braddock (Russell Crowe) isn't fighting for himself; he's fighting for his wife Mae (Rene Zellweger) and their three kids and the entirety of the impoverished populace of America, people utterly destroyed and broken by the Great Depression. Crowe's Braddock is resilient and courageous, undergoing tremendous suffering to keep his family honorably fed. Crowe himself is amazing, grim-faced, intrepid, humble, and noble. He doesn't see boxing as his right, but as a distinct privilege. Crowe's performance is gutsy, physically demanding, and so evocative that the viewer can feel the punches he's taking - and dishing out.Standing behind Braddock and his career choice is his long-suffering wife Mae, although it takes her some time to fully comprehend what Braddock's struggles really mean. Zellweger portrays Mae as no wilting flower, able to love her husband for his boxing and in spite of it. Braddock's other main source of inspiration comes in the person of his trainer/manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti, who was nominated for an Oscar - finally). Gould cares very deeply about the welfare of his fighter, almost to the exclusion of everything else. He proves himself to be a true friend to Braddock, remaining with him through even the toughest times. Giamatti delivers a powerhouse performance as the cagey ringhand; it's hard to imagine a runty looking guy like Giamatti could play such a tough-as-nails character, but he pulls it off, seemingly effortlessly.Although this is a sports biopic, the movie never veers to the maudlin, never choosing melodrama over sincerity. Moving, compassionate, and beautiful, Cinderella Man is the kind of movie that makes even the manliest men weep openly and certainly leaves an indelible mark on your heart. The violence is brutal - particularly the final fight against Baer - but never gratuitously so, showing that the steady hand of director Ron Howard once again has produced a honest winner. The entire cast is magnificent (and look for Howard's brother Clint in a small role).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazing Intensity & honesty,"The movie Cinderella Man has amazing visceral intensity. Russell Crowe once again excels & gets deep into the character of JAMES J. BRADDOCK. Right through the movie i felt like being with him in all his vicissitudes living the emotions for full 144 minutes. Renee Zellweger never looked so convincing as the 'lady' before this movie. The chemistry between the two completely justifying the strong trustful bond Jim shared with his wife. Paul Giamatti as his indefatigable manager simply rocks. His sharp tongue & self-sacrifice in following his instincts & thus managing one of the greatest comebacks of all times is one of the high-points of the movie. The scene in which Mrs. Jim goes to this guy's house, knocking the door hard, hurling invectives at him only to find a single table with a couple of chairs in the house is simply terrific. Words are simply redundant in this case. An awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I did not like this movie,"I was excited to see this movie because I thought that Russel Crowe was going to wear a pretty gown and finally meet his prince charming, instead Paul Giamatti groomed him a lot while he trudged around with a long face and dull glassy eyes and pretended that he walked upright. While normally I think that watching boxing is right up there with golf and nascar this film elevated its boxing sequences to a new level of boredom making them something akin to curling. Similar to Seabiscuit, Cinderella Man is an inspiration movie about a hero that uplifted the American spirit during the Great Depression. And what I mean by similar is exactly. Exactly like Seabiscuit. In fact this movie should have been titled, Seabiscuit Fights Craig Bierko. I swear the same guy was doing the announcing and they may have even used the same score and was it just me or did anyone else see Chris Cooper hiding in the back of the gym. If these movies have taught me anything its that the Great Depression wasn't so bad. I mean sure no one had anything to eat but with great heroes, like boxers and horses, to look up to American could thrive on the inspirational music that would swell as yet another underdog beats the odds and succeeds in a stupid violet sport tailored perfectly to make rich men richer and poor shlubs loose money gambling.

A Must See!!!,"I have to say honestly that when I first started seeing trailers for this movie I had no intentions whatsoever of seeing it at all. I had seen the previews and they just didn't really spark my interest.I have just seen this movie for the first time tonight and I can say that it would have been a huge mistake for me not to see it,as well as it will be a huge mistake for you should you choose not to see this movie. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that after watching it with my parents and other miscellaneous family members, that I borrowed it from them and took it home to watch with my wife. She loved the film as much as I did.It is a great movie for either gender, male or female. Perfect for watching whether by yourself, or with friends, but best watched with a loved one. Enough romance to keep the ladies happy but not so much that it turns it solely into a ""Chick Flick"".Don't even waste your time or money with bothering to rent this movie. Just go buy it. Definitely one you will want in your collection.I give it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Another Beautiful Mind,"This is a true story about Jim Braddock (Crowe) who boxes and works on the docks to keep his family going during the Great Depression.Ron Howard seems to find beautiful minds to tell a story about. He directed Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind; and here he directs Russell Crowe in The Cinderella Man. But, this beautiful mind is not filled with math equations, but instead a mind consumed with doing the right thing no matter how difficult life turns out to be, and believe me it was a difficult life. He is as perfect or beautiful a human being as anyone can get. He is a good husband, father, and friend no matter what was thrown at him. If we could all wake up the next morning and say, ""I want to be like Jim Braddock"" this would be a better world. I am a little older than most and I still want to grow up to be like Jim Braddock.If it weren't for people like Ron Howard and producers who take the risks of presenting stories like this we would have no clue, and they must be thanked time and time again.Yes, I have heard about Max Baer (former Heavyweight champion of the world), but I had never heard the name Jim Braddock when anyone talked about the fight game. What a story!The supporting cast was nothing short of perfect or beautiful too. Renee Zellweger, as Braddock's wife, lost that facial grimace that seemed to tell the world, ""I just ate a lemon."" I almost didn't recognize her and she is truly beautiful and one of our best actresses. Paul Giamatti lost that Richard Shiff (Toby, on the West Wing TV show) look and delivery (see Sideways) and was outstanding as Braddock's manager and trainer. Everyone was great. Can't say enough about the cast.I think all the performances were truly great, however, if anyone is talking Oscar, I would have to say the story and the direction overpowered everything. What a story! And, we are just learning about this now?Oh, yes there was some boxing in here too. Okay, a lot of boxing. The fight scenes were very good, but it's Braddock's story that is the most compelling. Actually, it is Braddock who is the most compelling.I think it's safe to say that Damon Runyon in one of his columns called Jim Braddock The Cinderella Man. Braddock's wife mentions that it sounded ""girly."" Believe me, there is nothing girly about Braddock.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Touching,If someone love his family that what he or she has to do. To jump over the prejudice of his times and to fight. That what the film does. Let us to dream maybe just for two hours that we van change the world around us. And that it's a brilliant goal. Some of us forget in what world we live now. And a remind of great crises in history is a subtle way to remind us that from the top of the mountain down to the deep of the seas is just one step. The cast is marvelous. We feel the fight with are souls and every punch hurts us. I think everyone who like's classic movies should watch this film. Great movie.

Unbelievable!!!,"This was without a doubt one of the best sports movies ever made. Although it was more about the hardships that Jim Braddock had to endure. When you see what he went through you truly feel for him, and you want him to win. You find yourself cheering for him. He really epitomizes the word underdog in every sense of the word. Crowe was outstanding and this in my opinion will be the role he is most remembered for. Zellweger and Giamati also gave career performances.I was truly stunned at how good this movie was and I would recommend it to anyone.

Oscar Oscar!  This movie is The Real Deal Folks!,"WOW!Just let me say right off - I'm a huge Boxing fan and something of an amateur 'boxing historian' so I want to state that Bias up front. Having said that - It gave me all the more reason to pay attention to this film and honestly I went in with some doubt about the Critical Acclaim that has been touting this film as if it were a masterpiece or some sort of secret weapon to sweep the Oscars. THE CRITICS WERE RIGHT THIS TIME and Cinderella Man is The Real Deal!Everything is right with this movie, starting off with one of the most inspiring, moving stories in American History - about a man who was everything right and good about the USA once!I promise you do not need to be a Boxing Fan to love this movie - but if you are you will be astonished at how fantastic those aspects are. You can barely believe the attention to the times of the sport, from the equipment to the arenas to the fighters styles to the fighters physiques even. I swear that WAS Max Baer or Primo Carnera in there!!Everything is right from the sets, the historical instances, the cars, the visual image and look of the film. Its just wonderful in its visual appeal, the depression dull while the wealthy areas are so elegant and rich to look at. The Acting is AMAZING and there is not a bad performance .. heck, performances which are not even meant to be 'performances' are amazing from Max Baer to The NBC Announcer to the Braddock children , not to mention Crowe and Zellwiger! Everyone delivers MORE than you would even ask for! Giamatti is now forever impressed on me as THE new cinema caricature of Coach (Angelo Dundee thank you!)Well sorry if I'm ranting and raving folks but I'm not even going to bother with detailed analysis or go through the plot line which many already know as its historical. Instead Let me just say that if you are like me, you have been a little disappointed with a string of recent films being touted as 'incredible' or 'masterpieces' and then finding out that while 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Mystic River' were good and all.. they were not exactly in the realm of 'Truly Great Films'. Get ready for a treat because Cinderella Man IS a contender for a spot among the truly great films ever made!Amazing shots in this movie too (look for fantastic techniques where Braddock views footage and how its done.. awesome!) Fantastic choice to focus the action in words over the radio.. at some points you are not even watching the fight but listening to it just as people did on Radios back then.. and you experience it like they did and what a great job on that! You will find yourself laughing out loud in this movie - believe it or not it has sincerely comedic moments too. You can catch yourself wanting to cry (warning: Women AND Men both at risk) and I caught myself literally cheering out loud at the screen!Everything is right about this incredible Ron Howard film and I sincerely hope everyone takes a break from the 'Fantastic Four' and 'Goofball Comedies' for just one evening to sit down to a truly magnificent and destined to be classic film called Cinderella Man.If you see this movie for no other reason than to visit the Great Depression and learn about a truly fantastic hero in more ways than his career - Its worth it all! Finally a Movie with Skill, Heart and Soul!*Just shy of a Perfect Ten for relatively nitpicky reasons of a 'best friend' character that doesn't seem to really fit in the movie right and with the bar this high I would have maybe liked to see something new with the 'fighters point of view' shots, even as great as the scenes were. 9.4 if I could heh.Cinderella Man is the Real Deal!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Haven't Rocky and De Niro Pretty Much Said All There Is to Say About Boxing?,"Ron Howard has carved a niche for himself as creator of treacly populist hokum, and it seems pointless to criticize his movies again and again for being maudlin, manipulative and pandering. To his credit, he knows how to put a movie together, and by now everyone should know what to expect from a Howard film and not complain when that's exactly what they get.For the first two-thirds of ""Cinderella Man,"" Howard appears to be bucking his own trend. It's quite respectable, fairly reserved and well acted. O.k., so Howard's version of Depression-era America still looks as glossy as a home decorating magazine, but I'll let that go. Russell Crowe is an actor who can make any movie better than it has any right to be, and Renee Zellweger is nowhere nearly as squinty and mealy as I thought she would be playing this character. And then we entered the final third of the film, and....Oh my. Watch out ""Seabiscuit,"" there's another huge piece of corn coming up fast on your tail.In case you're not sure which boxer you should be rooting for in this movie, we get lots of closeup shots of big-eyed kids looking pleadingly at Russell Crowe like a bunch of little Oliver Twists. We get a scene in a church on the night of the big obligatory show-down match that all boxing movies must have, in which every pew is filled with people praying for Jim Braddock to win his fight, and we get a priest delivering the following subtle line to wife Renee Zellweger: ""In a way, he's (Braddock) fighting for them (the lowly downtrodden)."" If you're still not sure who to root for, Braddock's arch nemesis, Max Baer (played campily by Craig Bierko), makes lewd comments about Braddock's wife in a nightclub a few weeks before the match. And in the ring, he continues to make nasty comments in between slow-mo shots of him leering like a sadistic psycho. And if you're STILL not sure who to root for, Baer punches Braddock in the balls a couple of times during their match for good measure. Not since Rocky Balboa faced off against Drago (or whatever that big heap of Russian was called in ""Rocky IV""--or was it ""V?"") has a more cartoonish boxing villain stepped foot in a make-believe ring.There's some scary talk here and there about Braddock possibly dying during the big fight, because he's old and past his prime. But since his kids are listening to the fight at home, and since this is a Ron Howard movie, we're pretty sure that he's not going to die. In fact, we're pretty sure he's probably going to win, or there would be no purpose for the film's existence. Howard dutifully connects all the dots, stealing from every other boxing movie ever made, throwing in lots of rapid-fire editing and thundering sound effects to make the fight scenes exciting.It's sad and yet typical that Paul Giamatti, who gave two of the greatest film performances in the last few years (""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways"") would only be recognized by the mainstream Hollywood constituency for the hammy, dreadful role he's saddled with here. I only hope he was given a hefty paycheck to offset all the scenery he was forced to chew as Joe Gould, Braddock's wise-cracking manager.It figures that in a year that gave us hard-hitting film after hard-hitting film that took critical and thought-provoking looks at current trends in American culture, Ron Howard would deliver a product as sanitized, safe and bland as this piece of instantly forgettable ""entertainment."" It looks good and has a solid performance from Crowe--I can't recommend it for any other reasons.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant,"Boxing is not my favourite sport. In fact, it is not even a sport. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. I got it as a Christmas pressie and had never heard of it. When I discovered it was a Ron Howard film that peaked my interest. Having watched it, I found it compelling and almost as good as Howard's Appollo 13. For anyone who enjoyed that movie they should watch this one. For anyone who likes Boxing it is as riviting as Raging Bull. Like the Scorcese film, it has a fine cast but lacks something which I cannot figure out. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed movies about Boxing, the Depression, and about the struggles of a family.

Sensational Film on Every Level,"Cinderella Man was certainly the best film I saw last year, and will rank among the best films I have ever seen. Ron Howard continues to excel as a brilliantly gifted, responsible, director-producer of films that do not conform to the pressures of commercial popularity. I know that my time watching any one of his movies is time well spent. Any cinema award organization that misses this one should be terminally embarrassed. It deserves a place among the greatest films of all time. So deserving a film, that even with some violence, it earned a PG13 rating!We seldom see such a skillfully honest, beautifully crafted, occasionally shocking, entertaining, and fascinating portrayal of our nation's recent history that has shaped our present. Cinderella Man has a lot to offer from the realistic settings, to the incredible performances, and well written story line, which both moves and inspires the viewer.Renee Zellweiger was fabulous as the female lead to Crowe's equally brilliant portrayal of the male lead, and there is hardly a word spoken of her excellent work in any review I have seen. I refuse to believe that it is because she does not play on surface glamor and sexuality to craft her role, popular commercially, but believe that accolades for her deep performance will emerge as more people see the film, now that it has been released on DVD. Esconsed within the story is a tender romance. Crowe continues to amaze with his ability to become another man, and engage us with his character, and the actors in supporting roles were equally excellent and deserving. Paul Giamatti as the agent was compelling, and the bad guys were great also.Somewhere I saw a review that said that this is film-making the way it once was, and should be, and that is the truth. It deserves top honors for all categories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Jimmy Braddock: not your average boxer,"Most biopics made are interesting because of either the person, or the event the person was involved in. The actual person and/or the event do not guarantee that a movie about them will be good, of course the movie has to be done well also. Well, Ron Howard has definitely proved himself a capable director, with films such as ""Far and Away"" and ""Beautiful Mind"", so I expected nothing short of excellence from him in this film. Russell Crowe has established himself as a capable actor from such films as ""Gladiator"" and the afore-mentioned ""Beautiful Mind."" Those two made this movie work, and they made me genuinely interested in the story of Jimmy Braddock.Jimmy Braddock was a boxer that wasn't that great, but boxing was all he knew. Since Jimmy wasn't that flashy or stunning as a fighter he eventually got ran out of boxing. What was so compelling about his story was that he boxed to feed his family. When the depression hit, everyone felt the squeeze. Jimmy did what he could to find work and provide food, so when boxing came calling back to him he answered the call immediately; even though he was just to be a warm up fight for another boxer.In so many sports stories the athletes are propelled to prove something to someone even if it is to themselves. They may have to overcome an obstacle to achieve their dream, but it usually ends up being more for self satisfaction. Jimmy Braddock, on the other hand, didn't box to prove anything to anyone, he didn't box to become the heavy weight champion of the world or to prove he was the best, he boxed to feed his family. That motivation may seem simple, but it holds a lot of weight. Most people would die for their families, even kill for their families, so to box for one's family is a nominal act in comparison. Its significance lies in the comparison of one man's goal in sports to the goal of so many others in the sports arena.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
American Cinema at its Finest,"If you care in the least about American Cinema - Go see this film! It is absolutely spectacular, and exactly the kind of thing we must encourage Hollywood to make. A must see for all ages it's an emotion evoking story about where America has been and where it is going. Superbly balanced, It pulls at the heart-string, makes you grind your teeth in suspense, and make you want to jump from your seat. My audience actually applauded this movie TWICE; once at the end and also during the movie at a particularly poignant moment. Now get this: The women liked it. My audience was a good mix of all ages, and after the film I heard a woman in her forties say ""This is the first boxing movie I ever liked"", another random woman answered her, ""Yeah because it wasn't really about boxing"". And she was right. It is a redemption story, one of the best ever put on screen. And it had just the right amount of solid boxing action, again very well done. They didn't cheat. No fancy camera work of frenetic editing was used in the normal lame attempts to punch up the action. This was shot true, with smooth shots, cut at a pace that allowed you to absorb what you were seeing. No jerky cliché steady cam that makes your head hurt. It was visually perfect. And what a story! A true story. An American story. I can't remember any film that so pulls the viewer in to the difficulty that so many suffered during the great depression of the twenties.

Braddock is forced to find odd jobs to support his family until he steps back into the ring again to prove to himself that he's still got what it takes. The acting is great (Craig Bierko, normally a comedic actor, gives a surprisingly great performance as the antagonist Max Baer), but what I also loved was the boxing action in it and the intensity of it Ron Howard was able to put together.

This is not a boxing movie. It's a triumph of the human will epic. That is why it succeeds.I was willing to overlook the Adam Carolla look-alike playing Baer.

I was hooked, not the punching hook that will knock me down till I sleep, but the hook where I felt like sleeping but I couldn't. This is like one of those movies that will get you going from the beginning to end. You could almost feel like you're in Jim's shoes as he struggles through the Great Deppresion. The story line was very consistent, I never got lost with what's going on. Every scene prepared you for the next scene, and if ever you get lost with the story, either by a disturbance or you needed to do something, and then return to the film, the action and suspense will keep you from getting lost. The boxing scenes were superb, more realistic than if you were to watch the real fight from an old boxing film.

PLEASE support this movie!,"Cinderella MAN. An actual original historical movie, with academy award winners Russel Crowe, Renee Zellwinger, and director Ron Howard. What could go wrong? Other than its slow initial pace of this movie, it eventually catches up when he gets fighting again (so be patient!), its quite an excellent movie. So why the poor box office? I think earlier or later in the year would have fared better financially as its not a typical summer blockbuster (like was Star Wars 3 and Madagascar that it was up against). Still it has the legs and is still not out in the count (excuse the pun), although Russell Crowe (who played fighter Jimmy Braddock) may feel the disappointment, which might have prompted him to throw a phone at a hotel staff worker on opening weekend. Still history will look favorably on this movie and earn some academy award nominations to boot (so far this year there's very little to compete against it). I also think Howard could have traded some earlier drama and continued right till the end of Braddocks career and his final fight against Joe Louis. Which was considered his best test of bravery, even Joe Louis agrees he never fought a tougher fighter, although Braddock would lose in the 7th, (maybe Cinderella man 2 is in the works? Oh never mind). Still that is my only criticism, as this movie will stand the test of time verses the the fickle and dull box office.

A Heart and Head Pounding Cheer for the Good Guy,"""Cinderella Man"" is a shameless, old-fashioned sentimental bio-pic. And it works.As one character says ""It ain't about pugilism."" But director Ron Howard pounds away at our emotions as much as Russell Crowe pounds his boxing opponents in the ring. Howard doesn't just push every emotional button in telling the amazing story of Jim Braddock, he milks every incident in what is just in its basic outline anyway a heart tugging story of the fall and rise of a decent dad battling the Great Depression. And, through frequent tears, it works.Despite serious flaws, it works because of the central acting and the period recreation.Once again Crowe completely transforms himself for a role, not only unsurprisingly physically for the boxing rounds, as he spends a good part of the movie in nothing but trunks, and with a hard-scrabbled Joisey accent, but as a devoted, romantic family man. Crowe certainly sets a new standard of portraying masculinity on the screen as equally about being a devoted and responsible husband and father even while engaging in the most physical of occupations. The closest we've seen him reveal the other side was briefly in ""The Insider,"" but we've never seen him play such an unassuming good guy, such that scenes when Braddock has to put aside his masculine pride to provide for his family are staggeringly moving. His frequent gentle giant interaction with the wonderfully natural young children, in particular, are almost too sweetly touching.He is so captivating that you can see most of the actors in one-on-one with him rise to his level. Paul Giamatti as his manager matches him in duets as they ping pong concentration and humor.Renée Zellweger with a wandering Jersey accent, though, doesn't have much to do in her passive loyal wife scenes with him and is actually stronger when she gets to flex some separate personality or where briefly there's some flare of conflict with her husband. Crowe's intensity envelops both of them, as we see her melt more beautifully here than we've seen her on film in years.Surrounding Crowe like a Daumier tableau are marvelous character actors whose faces seem to be out of the gritty boxing game classic ""Body and Soul.""It is like two films. One is a sweet Father Courage tale bathed in beautifully golden brown chiaroscuro by cinematographer Salvatore Totino that makes you feel you are looking at tinted photographs from the 1930's, complimented by marvelous costumes from individuals to the crowd scenes. But then he equally puts us directly in the ring, as brutally as he captured football in ""Any Given Sunday"" and you do feel every punch, such that you involuntarily grunt out loud. Helped by the masterful editing by Howard's usual partners Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill you also get inside Braddock's state of mind in each fight, a sympathetic technique I don't recall from other boxing films, including ""Raging Bull."" Giamatti's chattering, in combination with the ring side announcers, explains the basics of the sweet science to seamlessly help you see the strategy with each competitor so they are not just repetitive slug fests but are each exciting matches.But what probably leads people to be able to criticize the Max Baer portrayal as unidimensionally villainous, which I don't think it is, is that so much of the period context is missing in the film or selectively stuck in, particularly as we haven't seen too many urban Depression movies and certainly not recently. Howard deliberately avoided the Ken Burnsian technique used so effectively in ""Seabiscuit"" of editing in newsreel footage or photographs to get across the impact of the Depression. Instead we literally get one headline on a fallen newspaper.The limited exposition, unfortunately, is put in the mouth of Paddy Considine, as a fictional unemployed broker turned drunken longshoreman and sometime vaguely Socialist community organizer and his dialog and role are just confusing and clumsily inserted. While the bulk of the film takes place 1933- 1935 when the New Deal was just getting off the ground, his stilted mouthing of working class resentments and activist solutions makes Braddock's apolitical responses sound practically Republican, as Braddock, in not seeing a governmental role in either the causes or the solutions, more than once refers to the Depression as a natural phenomenon, as if the docks are the Dust Bowl (and this is the best documentation of the actual work of grappling-hook wielding longshoremen since ""On the Waterfront"" as that accidentally was Braddock's training regimen). The Hooverville in Central Park where Considine somehow ends up is factual, but Mayor LaGuardia did not send in violent cops to break it up; instead the squatters were given work in WPA-type projects.There's certainly no sense of the desperate optimism attached to Roosevelt's ambitious government employment plans (including bailing out the overwhelmed state home relief offices that Braddock pridefully detests applying to) as if showing how FDR used radio as a lifeline to stir people (and my mom still enthuses how those fireside chats were inspiring) would undercut the visual images of people listening to Braddock's fights.The lack of period context is not helped by the music. While Thomas Newman's score is effective at building the tensions with each fight, particularly the throbbing percussion, it is simply odd that virtually only one period song is heard on the soundtrack, and the same cynical Eddie Cantor song is used twice, unlike the series ""Carnivale"" which so effectively set the mis en scene with music, or how T. Bone Burnett could have advised, though again perhaps Howard didn't want anything else on his radio other than fight broadcasts.Despite Howard's manipulative schmaltz that almost drowns the film, it is impossible to come out without cheers and tears and pride in basic human goodness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Paul Giamatti ROCKS!,"Fans of Paul Giamatti grab a seat and what ever you do DO NOT miss this staggering performance! If you don't know Paul Giamatti then I suggest you grab a seat and witness first hand pure, raw and completely flawless talent! WOW! He gave a great performance in Sideways but after this performance it would be a crime if he was not welcomed warmly into the world of Stardom. In the movie world there is a lot of good talent out there, Russell Crow. Now I'm not a big Crow fan but he has talent, but every now and again we catch a glimpse of a star, Paul Giamatti is such a person. Russell Crow gave a good performance as Bradock, Zelwegger was totally awful, Paddy Constantine was his usual great self, almost as great a performance here as he gave in In America. So in a nut shell spots fans, it's a great film with great performances all round apart from Zelwegger.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Why did it flop?,"Why did this flop at the box-office? Everyone says it's not a summer flick but my guess is that the sissy name scared people off.All my friends thought that it was either a sentimental drama or freakish porn, judging by the name. I'm just being mean here, but seriously it was a great movie(perhaps too emotional-the scene with the dream and his little girl was just cheesy), it really made you feel the horrors of the Great Depression, plus it was a great human story,presenting a traditional hero, with no dark side, not too complex, but none-the-less interesting.Russell Crowe was great, with his Dumbo years and stupid accent and I definitely think he'll be up for a pity Oscar.Paul Giamatti has finally established himself as a great actor(not being nominated for an Academy Award for Sideways was a crime).The movie will surely cash in on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This was a masterpiece,"There have been several great boxing movies made throughout the years, particularly Raging Bull and the more recent Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man is right up there with the best of them.Director Ron Howard has proved himself as being one of the best film directors of our time. he has a great understanding in the complex aesthetics of film making, different film stocks, and an uncanny ability to work with actors. Much of the film was stylized but not to the point that it subtracted from the effectiveness of the story, rather it enhanced it.The cinematography was very well done for the most part. Simply the choice of film stock gave scene's new meaning and an enhanced feel. The only problem was unnecessary camera movement. It is definitely justified during the actual boxing sequences but there were several scene's that were not very intense that still had the camera bouncing around all over the place. It served as a distraction more than a dramatic effect.The performances were really good. Russell Crow has again shown the extent of his talent in a nearly flawless portrayal of Braddok. I haven't been too thrilled with Renee Zelwigger recently, especially after her woefully over the top performance in Cold Mountain but Ron Howard was able to bring her down to a believable level. Paul Gamatti is still one of the best, yet most overlooked actors out there and he gave another Oscar caliber performance in this film.Still, the story in and of itself was great. In most cases when it comes boxing movies the main character's are complete schmucks and completely unlikable. Braddok was one boxer that was also a truly good person, a man fighting for his home and his family, simply for the ability to live. He was grateful for everything that he had and his story was definitely worth telling.I hope people don't look at this and say, ""just another boxer film"". because that isn't how I saw it. This was a true work of art about a man who's resolve, perseverance, and devotion allowed him to capture the imaginations of an entire nation. This was a truly great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Way over-rated mediocrity,"So now that the bandwagon appears to be full, let me jump off of it.I went to see this movie with mixed feelings, but the understanding that I needed to experience it before reading any more reviews. I love Ron Howard and he will forever be a hero of mine simply because of his involvement in Arrested Development, the best television show of the last several years. I've had my problems with some of his movies, however, particularly A Beautiful Mind with its drastically skewed version of the reality of John Nash. As for this one, although the true story of Braddock is very compelling, the film ends up drowning in its own predictability. We know what's coming around every corner and which characters are doomed to the opposite fate of our hero. We know our guy will come out on top, despite the misgivings of his long-suffering wife Mae (even if she doesn't bother voicing them until the climax). All the lead characters are saintly to the point of nausea and, again excepting sadly misguided Mae, never make any actual mistakes. Nothing that goes wrong is their fault, but they find a way to rise above it nonetheless and we (literally and audibly) cheer them on for it.The boxing scenes are nearly impossible to decipher. The editing is so disjointed that we can never tell who is hitting who and why the crowd is cheering.Paul Giamatti is good, but he's back to his usual buddy/ manager/ co-worker role that we now know is far beneath his talents. Renee Zellweger plays the role that she is given, not that there's much to it. She only exists to stay in the basement with the children and remind Braddock when bills are due and so she fades into the background where she was intended to stay. And, to put it bluntly, I'm over Russell Crow as a brooding, reluctant hero.Overall, there's not much to rave about here. The one or two effective scenes are swallowed up by the cheese that makes up the rest of the movie.I think I'll change my vote from 6 to 5.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Film I've Seen In Years--It made me want to go back to the theater!,"My friends, family and I have waited so long to see a film like this made, I must thank every person involved in its production. If it does not take every major award at the Oscars, Golden Globes, People's Choice, and every other contest, I will completely give up on Hollywood, because it will have failed to answer my needs. I go to the movies to escape, to learn something, and to be enriched. This film accomplished all that, and so much more. I was so grateful my two sons, ages 14 and 16 went with us. Going to the movies with your parents is so ""uncool"" at those ages, but as we shared our popcorn and the root beer we knew we couldn't really afford, we learned so much about the reality of The Depression, the bond of family, the importance of integrity, and the lessons we have always taught our children about what is right and wrong, and why. Our daughter, Rachel Youngberg, knew from a very early age that her calling in life was to become an actor, and we fought her tooth and nail, knowing how corrupt and evil people can become here in Hollywood. After seeing this film, I came away proud of her decision to stay and fight to make great films like Cinderella Man. I finally see what she has been trying to tell me for the past 15 years--how film can lift the human spirit, teach others, and be a light to this war-torn world. Ron Howard proved it can be done, and I hope the next time he needs a convincing cast for a creative film, he'll give my daughter a chance to audition for him. You've come a long way, ""Opie"", and when I see that Best Director Oscar in your hand, I will cry, but I will also pump the air with my fist, jubilate, and scream, ""Yes!"" Your victory will feel like one for me, and one especially for my daughter. Long may you live, and direct and produce to your dying day, at the age of 129, or so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Real Man !,"I went for Beautiful Mind years ago. The great pictures and acting brought me to the night for Cinderella Man again. This time, i have expected nothing but cruel. If you are expecting a bloody screen, it will disappoint you. BUT , if you expect for knowing one of a TRUE TRUE man in the world, it's fantastic! Never know whom is it about Jims Bradock, since tonight. What a gorgeous picture that brings a positive message to the world, which tells us, in Chinese ""There's something worth for uphold, no matter when: Ambition"" This inspires me much on how people should be; & what really makes people to survive! And it's true, there's a GOOD man who won the country gloriously with his ambition. I appreciate such director, can have that brave to bring this movie on the stage. It contributes! For sure that the movie wouldn't be success without the splendid acting from Russell and Renee.

great effects and editing,"Among the many good things about this movie are the perfectly fabulous special effects and editing, notably of the fight scenes. Normally I do not like to watch fighting, but this movie takes you to the insides of what happens to all the people, not just the pugilists.And I am wondering, as an editor myself, exactly what was used to make the noises of the punches. Perhaps it's best not to know. At any rate, the sound track was terrific, including of course the special music, the music we hear but to which we pay no attention.Other aspects of the movie have already been commented on very well and at length.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Cinderella Story without the Glass Shoes,"From acclaimed director Ron Howard comes the mesmerizing and tantalizing Cinderella Man starring Oscar winners Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. Crowe plays James J. Braddock, a boxer in the 1920s who lost nearly everything he had in the great stock market crash. After his finances diminish, the boxer hits a losing streak and when all hope is lost, a sudden surge of luck comes to the noble James.When it comes to Crowe, he turns in one amazing performance after another. With previous nominated and awarded works in The Insider, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, Crowe still doesn't fail to impress the viewer. The vulnerability that Crowe lacks often in his tough guy roles is more evident than ever. It's his demeanor, dedication and well written character by Cliff Collingsworth and Akiva Goldsman that makes the film work so well.Zellweger, who plays Mae Braddock, the supportive wife of James gives a quite dull and mediocre performance. Zellweger who has been a top talent for the past ten years is suffering from over-exposure and not being able to bring new things to her roles she chooses. Bridget Jones' Diary, Chicago, Cold Mountain, we've seen it all yet she still lands these well written roles which could be home run hit for many other talented actresses.The entire cast of the film is quite superb; Craig Bierko as Max Baer, the reigning champion that Braddock must dare face. Bierko has a great screen presence that draws the viewer to him. A quality possessed by veteran actors Robert Duvall and Anthony Hopkins and newcomers Clive Owen and Ryan Gosling.The revelation of the picture is from the Oscar snubbed actor for Sideways, Paul Giamatti. Playing Joe Gould, James' boxing trainer could be a very cliché role for any performer taking it yet Giamatti elevates the role and material. Joe's charisma, laughter and beautiful soul captures the audience first frame of his presence. Giamatti might be one of the finest actors underused in every way. We wait to see what his future could possibly hold.Director Ron Howard has a beautiful style of film-making but for some reason, he doesn't always seem to peak out of his films like Spielberg, Coppola, or Eastwood. Howard has a tough time with it and you seem to feel that it's the actors that do the grunt of the work. I'm not sure if that's a bunch of crap I'm talking but its just something I feel about Howard.The cinematography and film editing are definitely that standout technical aspects of the film. Add that with Thomas Newman's score and you have a visually stunning piece of cinema. An enjoyable time of Crowe boxing around indeed.Grade: ***½/****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A triumph of the human spirit!,"At first, I was a bit hesitant to watch this film because I thought it would be just another boxing movie. After all, we have been inundated lately with million dollar baby but after seeing the 1st few minutes of this film I knew that this was just not your ordinary boxing triumph film. This was a real story with real characters. Not the card board cut outs that we're used to that Hollywood dishes out. This was truly an inspiring story that will reach the heart of any person who watches it. It touches the heart with the superb performances of Russell Crowe, Renee Zelweger & Paul Giamatti (who I think will win the Oscar this time. I thought he was robbed of it last year.)The story of Jimmy Braddock should serve as an example to all of us as a testament to perseverance against adversity and a triumph of the human spirit. Truly an awe inspiring film. This has Oscar written all over it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Boxing movie with heart and soul!,"Fantastic boxing movie, the period feel is convincing and having read the autobiography of James Bradock by Michael DeLisa, the picture fulfills all expectations. Russell Crowe does a great job of portraying the down at heel boxer who wants to provide for his family but is rendered impotent by the recession and lack of work. Rene Zelweger provides a convincing and grounded portrayal of the pugilists wife with a sensitivity only dreamt of in the Rocky movie concept.The best ring scene for me is during Bradocks second comeback bout when he takes a phenomenal punch from Art Lasky and looks doomed to fall. The camera hits slow motion with flashbacks of Bradock reeling whilst thinking about his wife and children. He then regains his composure and smiles bloodily at Lasky (who drops his gloves in amazement) before going on to dramatically win the bout. Wonderful heart searching stuff,even for none boxing fans.

Cinderella Man Delivers More Than Body Blows,"Cinderella Man, director Ron Howard's newest film, raises your spirit, along with your blood pressure, as you watch the talented actor Russell Crowe take, and give, tremendous beatings in the boxing ring.As the ultimate rags to riches story, this film, which tracks the comeback career of boxing legend Jimmy Braddock, is not only about a man's man, and a man's sport, it also jerks those tears until they stream down your face. I predict box office gold: this is the ultimate summer date movie. And yes, even my teenager liked it.Be aware that the movie has more than a tad of violence. It is about boxing after all. Or is it? This is sports legend come to life with a plot that gave first life to the phrase ""Cinderella story."" Russell Crowe does his stoic warrior best and Paul Giamatti (late of the movie Sideways) is remarkable in his performance as Joe Gould, the boxer Braddock's trainer/manager. Giamatti's everyman face, his exuberance and pain, are all up there on the screen. His performance alone is worth the price of admission. Give this man an Oscar already! At times this movie can be hard to take: The fact that it is based on a true story is not lost on the audience; in fact, it makes the Depression-era scenes of sacrifice and deprivation that much sharper, that more painful. And in these days of (let's not yet call it a) Recession, the faces of the unemployed at the New Jersey Relief office take on a familiarity very close to home.Renee Zellweger's performance is admirable despite being trapped in the paper doll role of loyal wife. In a scene where she and her children salvage wood from a roadside billboard in order to stay warm, her character shows true grit and determination, not the expected shame or lack of pride. I would match this film against John Ford's Grapes of Wrath for its gritty and unflinching portrayal of survival in the Great Depression and the subtle art of conveying dignity in the face of true desperation.Rated PG-13 for intense boxing violence and some language. Take everyone over age 14.

one of the best boxing shows of all time,"Another stellar performance by Russell Crowe and Renne Zellweger really shines in her ever supportive wife role. Honestly i went into the cinema with no expectations whatsoever but the build up to the fights were simple brilliant, classic Ron Howard stuff. Cinematography was very good for the fight scenes but i particularly liked the character build up for all the main casts; i found the manager's role played by Paul Giamatti, who was superb in sideways just a year ago, character build up was very progressive. He shed his ol pinot noir self to a very dedicated manager, not in it for the money only, but a lot more than that, kinda non don king type. Well, the film sheds new light on the fight industry during the 1929 depression and Jim Braddock proves to all that there's some light left at the end of the tunnel for all of us...if we believed in themi'm a sucker for true stories and Cinderella man scores a perfect 10go watch it if it's the last show you'll watch this year, brilliant stuff, kudos to all who made it possible!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I can't wait to see it again,"I saw a sneak preview last night and was blown away. This may be Ron Howard's best movie. I knew the story of Jim Braddock before I saw it, but I was still on the edge of my seat guessing the ending. Ron Howard has now done two films(Cinderella Man and Apollo 13) where the true life outcome is known by many. But somehow he keeps the tension.The casting is flawless. Russell Crowe is more convincing as Jim Braddock than he was as Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Paul Giamatti is amazing as well. Even the actors that play the children were great. I haven't even mentioned Renee Zewelleger. I was afraid that she would go over the top like she did in Cold Mountain, but she nailed it.I have never seen The Depression filmed better. Howard makes us feel The Depression, and it hurts. To see what Jim Braddock had to go through to get the film conclusion is gut wrenching. The only negative about the movie is subplot about a relationship that JIm has with a co-worker on the Jersey docks.This might be the best sports movie I have ever seen...and its much more than just a sports movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good but to long,The story was kind of good but the movie was way to long for me.

Maybe thats why it was so boring for me because I'm not really a box fan even tho i gave 10/10 to Ali (2001) with Will Smith (Awesome movie).I see that many people enjoyed and loved this movie but for me it was just waste of time.

Braddocks trainer is also performed brilliantly but the name of the actor escapes me I'm sorry . Renne Zellweeger is also very stoical as his loving devoted life .I just really loved the way that this film did not pull punches it showed how Braddock fell but never gave up hope and belief in himself or his family . and then finally he begins his remarkable rise back to the top of his boxing profession .

Well I proved you wrong didn't I? Huh, Didn't I?"" and yes he did, Ronnie showed me, he really can make great movies after great movies after great movies, like Pixar makes all those great cartoons.I really recommend this movie as an appetizer to Steven Spielberg's ""War Of The Worlds"", which is totally beyond Cinderella Man, I mean come on it's Steven Spielberg, were are talking about here. :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Restore your faith in movies,"As I left the theater after seeing Cinderella Man, I was perplexed by a feeling I couldn't identify. It wasn't until I was in my car beginning the journey home that I realized what I had been feeling. I had been moved by this movie. I had experienced the full-hearted, satisfied, thrilled sensation of having seen something wonderful.It is a cliché that people need heroes. Cliché it may be, but people do need heroes; more so during times of great trouble. Cinderella Man tells the story of a man who became a hero for millions of Americans during the Great Depression. As the film opens, James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a boxer on the way up. The year is 1929 and he is on the fast track to a contention bout for the Light Heavyweight world championship title. But the time frame of the film quickly changes to 1933 and we learn that Braddock was soundly beaten early on his path to the title and is considered washed up by the 1930's. The Depression is in full, horrible swing and Braddock works on the loading docks when he can. He also gets an occasional boxing match, which helps pay the bills and keep poverty just barely outside the door. He is a family man, in love with his wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) and a caring father to his children. He boxes because, as a newspaper headline informs us, 15,000,000 people are out of work. He boxes when he shouldn't, with a hand not properly healed from a break and it shows in his performance. In a bout which is, to Braddock, just about the money to pay bills, he re-breaks his hand and spends the rest of the fight dancing and weaving. Because of his poor performance, the fight is stopped. The fight promoter, Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill, whose face will certainly be recognizable to many viewers), enraged at Braddock's poor showing, revokes his license to fight. Just like that, the main source of income, solvency and pride for Braddock and his family is gone.Braddock's situation, as it did for so many Americans in those years only worsens. Braddock humbles himself more than once, but counts it all as worth it to keep his family together. After weathering a Winter that almost destroys the family, Braddock is visited by his former Trainer/Manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti). Gould brings news that the boxing commission is willing to allow Braddock to fight one more fight because they are desperate for a last minute replacement opponent for a fight the next day at Madison Square Garden. For Braddock, it is a chance to make $250, and also a chance to perform his swan song at Madison Square Garden. The result of that fight isn't hard to imagine, but it is thrilling to watch. And as Braddock's story unfolds, it provides humor, exceptional thrills and deep satisfaction for the viewer.It is always a difficult task for filmmakers to tell a sports related story. Every single cast and crew member must be at the peak of their game if it is to be done successfully. Sports fan viewers will want a movie filled with sporting (in this case boxing) scenes, but a two hour film cannot be sustained by just sports scenes. Otherwise, why not just put a recording of the fight/baseball game/soccer match on screen for two hours. No, a sports movie must have an underlying reason for us to root for the hero of the tale. To root for a person you must understand what drives them, what makes them happy and what saddens them. In this case, it is the mix of the tale of the boxing ring and the tale of the wedding ring that gives this story it's depth. For Braddock lives to provide as well as he can for his wife and family in some of the worst times in recent history. Without doubt, the boxing scenes are thrilling and well staged. Each punch reverberates through the viewer's senses and shatters a little more of their reticence. Until finally the viewer is completely immersed in the battle between the opponents. Not just because it is thrilling to watch, but because we know what every punch thrown and landed means to Braddock.The film is executed so well that it is worth reminding oneself that the writers, actors and director of Cinderella Man are so often so superb at what they do that one might begin to take it for granted. Instead, savor the grace and recognize the purity that is this movie. From Akiva Goldsman's (A Beautiful Mind) deft screenplay (co-written with Cliff Hollingsworth from a story by Hollingsworth) to Ron Howard's willingness to allow his actor's eyes to speak for them when words would be less effective, to actors Zellweger, Giamatti and Crowe. Crowe, in particular surprises as he delves into territory we have not seen him visit before. Whereas in the past he has excelled at playing tortured, wise or strong souls, here he inhabits the nice, loving man that is Braddock. A skin that is as difficult to wear as any of the others he has slipped into in the past.Cinderella Man is more than an antidote to all the bluster and hype that is the Summer movie season. It is a truly great film on many levels. One that may leave you with a feeling you haven't had in a long time when leaving a theater. Allow me to identify it for you. You have been moved.

Plain Old Boxing Movie.,This is just your average boxing movie. It isn't the best i have ever seen but hey it was okay. Rob Crowe was okay but Renee Zelwegger was horrible. I thought she was odd and it ruined this movie. It was just okay because it didn't have things most boxing movies did it was hard to sit through cause it was boring and strange. It was a five outta ten because it was a tad odd on some levels but hey I still enjoyed watching it. I think that it was good but not great and I think that other people could have got better cast memebers though. I thought that it was okay once again and it was worth the whole ticket price and other things.,5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Awesome!! Sueshot Oscar winner.,"This is a truly awesome movie.Rusell Crowe and Ron Howard have teamed up to deliver a truly knockout punch. By all standards this is the best movie of this year I have seen so far.Paul Giamatti is at his best.Despite the negative portrayal of Max Baer Cinderella Man will be one of the top contenders for the Academy Awards.The screenplay is amazing. If you liked Million Dollar Baby you will just love Cinderella Man. Audiences may find some similarities with Ron Howard's Oscar winning movie "" The Beautiful Mind"" because of the same director ,lead actor & scriptwriter only Cinderella Man is much better in every aspect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
another knockout for director ron howard,"I watched Cinderella Man recently and highly recommend it. The story revolves around depression-era boxer (J. Braddock) played by Russell Crowe. His wife is played by Renee Z. and Paul Giametti plays his manager. The story is basically about his fall from near glory and his amazing comeback. Now, we have seen this formula before, but there's several reasons that for this movie that doesn't really matter. First of all, this is a true story (or based on a true story of J. Braddock), although I was not familiar with the man when I saw this film. Secondly, the way this story is unfolded, you will be rooting for him and hanging off the edge of your seat whether you know how the story ends or not. The last 20 minutes are especially exciting and we all love movies that end well. Lastly, this film is also the story of the Great Depression, and let me tell you, the hopelessness of the people of that era is well conveyed. For me it really put into perspective just how much Americans before us have suffered, and how good we have it now. Better than any point in our history really. Russell C. becomes the humble soft-spoken Braddock, and his performance seemed flawless to me. I felt every line he spoke in the movie was appropriately delivered and felt real. I always look forward to seeing Paul Giamatti in a film, regardless of what film it is, and he sure doesn't disappoint here. His performance just in the corner of the boxing ring watching Braddock box is almost as intense as the fighting itself. Of course Rene Z. is perfect in her role as always, and never seems to have a trace of ""Hollywood"" in her, but instead all you'll see is a desperate depression era housewife. It seems that director Ron Howard is incapable of making a mediocre movie, almost as if he doesn't know how to fail. His track record, while not producing the huge talked about blockbusters like some directors, is really an amazing string of consistently great movies, and this one is even one of the better of his collection. Chalk this up as one of the best boxing movies made. Put it up there with Rocky (the first one), Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby. If you don't have it yet, add it too your collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Cinderella's dream,"Sad story, poor family, no food, no milk, nothing that could help a family, but with a god's hand and with a freelancer fight a man changed his life.

If you have a dream do not stop fighting for it, because one day you would reach it. Fight for a better live, for you and for your family.

This film should have been a big hit,"This film is the most under rated movie of last year. I have tried to analyze why it was such a bomb at the box office but I cannot figure it out. The film was perfect, probably the best boxing movie ever made, beating out Rocky (which is hard to beat) and at least having a tie if not winning by a nose against Raging Bull (which is impossible to beat). The reasons why it is so great is as follows... 1. The fights are the best ever 2. It is a true story and an uplifting one 3. the performances are stellar (granted the performances in Raging Bull were the best in the business). 4. The manager was the best ever (Paul G.) and he really showed how the relationship between a manager and a boxer works. 5. This film meant a lot to me. I was going through some hard times and it gave me hope and inspiration. Any movies that can reach into a life and change it get's my vote. 6. It has a great soundtrack.And so I give it a ten, and I hope that it has a more successful afterlife.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Superb movie and dialogs.,"It reminds me of ""RagingBull"" and equals it.Ron Howard does it again. Some people think he makes movies to win Oscars. So be it, and Let us all hope ""Cinderella Man"" wins a couple of those Oscars. One for Paul Giamatti, outstanding support acting as Joe and the other for Russel Crowe. For showing us that the Gladiator in him is still alive and fighting. Literally.There isn't much in the story to say about. It is about a Fighter who never gives up during great depression of USA. He fights back ( with support from Joe and his wife ). And he wins. The movie teaches us a lesson or two without any long speeches. I like this movie for showing how difficult life can be, and how important every piece of bread is.The boxing scenes are well made. Every time someone got hit, I was saying ""Ouch"". The cinematography is very good, and gave the feel of 1930s to all of us. It has cool screenplay and excellent dialogs. On the whole it is a Must watch movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Brilliant film, too bad it never got the credit it deserved.","An excellent film about the great depression fighter Jim Braddock who started as a poor has been prizefighter because of a broken right arm, and does everything he can for his family, driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. And he kept winning and inspired many people who are suffering under the great depression, because even though he is old and a bit of a has been, he never gave up, and he revived the American Spirit of 'never giving up' to them(which is why he is called the Cinderlla Man). Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring. But I think Max Baer portrayed as that was a little too much, but ya gotta love Craig Bierko's performance. Ron Howard did quite a good job at this, but too bad it didn't sell too well at the box office, this is great stuff here, too bad all the attention went to other overrated blockbusters such as 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Bewitched'.

But apparently there's only one boxing movie that can be made, and it's called Rocky. This is just another remake of Rocky. And Rocky's already been remade four times.Prepare to be manipulated shamelessly. Not that it didn't work on me -- it did, I just resented it. I enjoyed watching Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. They're pretty people and they get dressed in pretty clothes. They play nice people, who have three adorable children. You want nice things to happen to them. When bad things happen to them, you feel bad. (Hope that's not a spoiler for anybody.)

Boxing scenes to rival Raging Bull!,"I didn't think there could be better movie boxing action than in Raging Bull, but I should know by now to never say never. I was completely absorbed in this period piece from director Ron Howard, with Russel Crowe as protagonist Jim Braddock. Crowe is excellent as always - probably my favorite contemporary actor (despite his asinine off-screen antics). I recall when this movie was released that there was some controversy over the negative portrayal of heavyweight champion Max Baer (nicely portrayed by Craig Bierko).

"Excellent movie of the times, a must see.","The story takes place in New York and New Jersey during the Great Depression, a time when people experienced the worst economic hardship in U.S. history. James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a light heavyweight boxer, who was forced to retired from the ring after breaking his hand in his last fight. His wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) had prayed for years that he would quit boxing, before becoming permanently injured. To support his family, Braddock works as a laborer at the docks, but he still has a dream to box. Several years after his last fight, Braddock's old manager wants him to be a last-minute substitute to fight against the second-ranked world contender. In this case, Braddock is one of those hungry fighters who astonishes everyone by winning the fight. Braddock is back in the ring and begins to win all his fights against younger, stronger, and heavier boxers. In a sports article, Braddock is named the ""Cinderella Man"" for his miraculous comeback. Braddock gets a chance to fight the heavyweight champion, Max Baer (Craig Bierko), for the title. Max Baer had killed two men in the ring, and everybody believed Braddock would be number three. As the underdog, Braddock became the champion of the downtrodden masses.This is one of the best movies of the year. This time, the ads about the movie are correct and not hyped. The storyline and acting is great. You are taken back in time, and you feel the pain of the Great Depression. The fighting is brutal and looks so real. Actually, I was tired after the movie, because I was fighting with Braddock. This movie will win several Academy Awards and is a must see.

Crowe Superb in Extraordinary Film Bio...,"""Cinderella Man"", Ron Howard's heart-felt film biography of boxing legend James J. Braddock, never received the recognition it deserved when first released, due, in large part, to Russell Crowe's bad press following a telephone-throwing incident. Overzealous critics tended to lump the incident and film together, and despite Crowe's public apology, many moviegoers skipped it. Now that the film is available on DVD, it's time to acknowledge the film for what it always HAS been; director Howard and star Crowe's FINEST film, together!Braddock's story is so amazing and inspirational, that it is astonishing that it's taken nearly sixty years to tell it. Sylvester Stallone 'borrowed' from it, extensively, in creating ""Rocky"", and in viewing the film, the parallels between fact and fiction are obvious; Braddock had been an 'up and comer' in the twenties, but broken bones and ill-advised matches had cost him a championship. Then the Depression struck, Braddock was wiped out, financially, and he struggled to support his wife and family through the most harrowing period in American history. Considered 'washed up' and too old for a comeback, all the boxer had going for him was his wife's love, his manager's faith, and his personal integrity, which refused to allow him to give up. Slowly he climbed back up the ranks of younger contenders, earning the adoration of a country trying to rebuild their own lives, as well, until, finally, he had his championship match, against ruthless 'killing machine' Max Baer. Their match would become the stuff of legends!To director Howard's credit, he never 'over-sentimentalizes' the story, or tries to turn it into a soft-focus 'fairy tale'. His vision of the Depression is the most accurate and heartbreaking since the documentaries of the '30s, and will come as a revelation to those whose only knowledge of the period is a paragraph in a history book. Jim Braddock is not a 'Superman', but a hard-working, decent man with no higher vision than to provide his family a better life, and as magnificently portrayed by Crowe, he embodies qualities of honesty and dignity that many of us dream of, but seldom achieve. In any other year, he'd be a shoo-in for an Oscar for his performance, it's that good!Matching Crowe's portrayal are Renée Zellweger, as his loyal wife, Mae, who perfectly channels a '30s 'style', as well as a gutsiness that is timeless, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti, as manager Joe Gould, who would sell everything he owned, rather than see Braddock give up. Giamatti, a veteran character actor who finally saw his 'breakthrough' in last year's ""Sideways"", should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, for this role.""Cinderella Man"" is a film that will continue to be cherished long after the filmmakers are gone, a tale rooted in an earlier era, but still timeless.Movies just don't get better than this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Truly one of the best underdog stories of all time,"You want my review of Cinderella Man? Here you go: Best. Boxing. Movie. Ever. Period. And yes, I'm aware of the existence of Rocky. As entertaining as Stallone's little slugfest is, Cinderella Man is just better on all fronts - better acting, better drama, and more realistic boxing. I've boxed before, and I can say with a straight face that this is the most realistic boxing I've ever seen in a movie. Plus, and this is the best part, it's a true story. And quite an amazing one at that. Why don't we have cool sports stories like this anymore?Nowadays all we have to cheer for are overpaid athletes who are willing to sacrifice an entire season of their sport if they don't get a few million more bucks to line their pockets. But James J. Braddock? He fought for something more. He fought to put milk on the table, to put a little more distance between his children and the street, to have a better way of life.You want drama? Cinderella Man effectively shows us the impact of the Great Depression on the average family. This was a time when unemployment hit a record high of 15,000,000 people. Once Braddock is unable to box, he is left hoping and praying for a one-day pay at the docks. When he can't pay the milk bill, his wife has to dilute what little they have with water to stretch it as far as they can.Then when Braddock doesn't have the money to pay his power bill during the snowy winter, his wife sends the children to live with her sister, breaking a promise Braddock made to his son. Desperate to get his children back, Braddock is forced to get government assistance and to beg everybody he knows for $20 so he can pay his bills and get his children back.Braddock's family is struggling, so you can feel how huge it is when he's offered the chance to make $250 as a last-minute fill-in against the 2nd-ranked contender. You want excitement? Well, this is when the boxing side of the story really kicks in. Braddock gets a very surprising knockout, he gets his boxing license back, and he starts training to compete in some elimination fights for the championship.Everything builds up to the championship match against the feared Max Baer, a man who is so brutal that he has killed two men in the ring. And he's not nice about it either. He mocks Braddock, talks about taking care of his wife after killing him in the ring, and reminds James that ""people die in fairy tales all the time.""Once the championship fight starts - whew. Not to sound too corny, but it really does feel like you're at the fight. When the crowd in the movie starts chanting ""Braddock, Braddock, Braddock,"" I wanted to start chanting also. But I didn't because that'd just be too gay. But I was completely pulled into the action.""But Johnny, I'm not a huge fan of boxing! I doubt I'd like a boxing movie.""But it's much more than a ""boxing movie."" Neither Stephanie nor my sister are boxing fans, but they both loved it. I'm not a huge boxing fan either, but if boxing had fighters and stories like this these days then I certainly would be. So yes, in my opinion it's the best boxing movie I've ever seen. But quite simply it's just a great movie with a great story that happens to be told within the confines of the boxing world.This is as upbeat and inspirational as Million Dollar Baby is depressing. After watching Cinderella Man you'll leave the theater feeling good about life and being inspired to try to accomplish something yourself. For a brief second you might toy with the idea of getting your fat, chubby little legs off the couch and doing something with life other than watching movies and playing video games all the time. It may be a fleeting fancy, but the spark will be there.My 20-year-old cousin walked out of the theater claiming, ""I want to be a boxer now."" Mr. Shade and I both want to start kickboxing again. And everybody was doing an Internet search afterwards to find out where we could read or watch more about the real-life James J. Braddock. And you know what? I'm even man enough to admit to the following conversation after the movie:Johnny: So, did you cry? Amber: I got teary-eyed when he was telling his children bye. Steph: Me too.*Stephanie and Amber stare at me for a few seconds*Steph: Well? Johnny: What? Amber: Come on... Johnny: All right, fine. My eyes started to perspire just a little. You happy?Hey, don't look at me like that, guys. I have feelings just like everybody else.

Every bit for the family,"The movie is about the boxer James J. Braddock (Jim), the once down and out boxer who re-enters the ring purely for keeping his family alive and together. It is his love for his wife and three kids that sees him go on to become the world champion. What appealed to me was not the gory boxing bouts, shot realistically, but the tender sentiments of a man who promises to his eldest son never to let go of him, even in the worst of situations. The father keeps that promise!Some of the most touching scenes: the moment Jim takes his son to the butcher shop to return the salami he stole and there outside promises never to let go of him; getting ready for the fight, on an empty stomach, he eats from the bowl straight with his mouth; when he tells his daughter a dream about him eating full and then drops his share of meat into her plate for her (thereby going hungry himself); when Mae enters the Church to pray for Jim and is told that so are all those who are there; the silence when Jim enters the ring for the championship bout...All said and done why this movie appealed to me so much was not the movie itself (though superb acting by Crowe, Zewellger and Paul Giamatti) but because the movie in every way showed me what Papa was to us in our younger days. The same grit, same passion, the only dream to see us all happy and contented, the same LOVE MY PARENTS had for the family, especially when the going was tough! I still remember the days when money was hard in coming. Yet we, my brother and I, always had good things (not the best) but the way Papa and Mummy slogged for us, that what they gave us was the best of all! They fasted or ate stale food so that we could have the fresh meal.

I have never seen the crowd holding their nerve but this was really something different. Especially in the second half of the movie, the fight between James J.

"Exciting and Magical Directing, Acting and Writing Moments","When I chose this film, I was looking forward to a predictable feel good story with a few actors I enjoy watching. I knew this was a Ron Howard/Brian Grazer project (now I see Penny Marshall produced alongside them) and I looked forward to that as well. What I didn't expect is to be surprised continually in and at this film.I didn't know the Jim Braddock story going in, yet I don't believe that this would have taken from my enjoyment if I had. The writing, directing and acting of the character played by Paul Giamatti was unexpected, exciting and deserves a best supporting actor award without question. Russell is as expected magnetic and perfect for this role. He and Paul together are dynamite.Ron Howard added at least one special effect that was subtle but shot through in a poignant moment to enhance the narrative in a surprising and wonderful way. Howard holds the film to a realist, tight narrative that doesn't overplay a card and especially not in moments that you would most expect him to. But he also lets the film breathe, thus allowing for a film over 2 hours, which I generally resent, feeling the length is more about flexing a director's ego with floppy biceps (and lazying, indulgent editing). But with Howard I did not squirm and place him on a red flag list, because egomaniacal driven, lazy editing is not the reason and it doesn't feel even once that is why it is longer than the usual 90 minutes. He wants to cover the full spectrum of this story and it's an enjoyable journey with him-with a treasure like this I am glad he went with his instincts.Howard lets the emotion of the piece drive its own in the viewer, as opposed to the force feeding that one gets so much of these days from Hollywood; Howard wowed and surprised me with this directorial decision, so rarely risked these days. I believe the breathing room he gives the audience will pay off generously for him though and add to the list director instincts that will signal him more and more over time as the great artist that he is and will probably not be noticed for until long after his time.This movie is a great inspiration to anyone. If you have ever felt as though you needed renewed faith in yourself or even just in the story tellers of our time go see this film. This is a movie for men and women a like.

I don't want to give anything away, but this is a Must See. Russell Crowe gives a stunning performance of a humble and loving father of three. Renee Zelwiger deserves an Oscar she too is terrific.

It really has it all from excitement to humor to tremendous amounts of pure raw emotion. I was almost moved to tears on a few occasions and that just doesn't happen to me normally. Seeing what this man went through and what that era must have been like for families was just unbelievably touching to watch.

"Excellent acting, great direction and worth the price of the rental","Whenever I see a Russell Crowe movie, I expect it to be good. Same goes for movies directed by Ron Howard. I was not disappointed by Cinderella Man, which was far better than all the Rockys put together. Maybe it's because it was based on a true story. Maybe it's because the fight scenes seemed believable. If you look at film of the real Braddock-Baer fight, you know that the fighting in the movie was a little more lively and exaggerated. But it was still believable, unlike the footage from a typical Rocky movie. And what can I say about the performance by Paul Giamatti. Never heard of the guy before, but I want to see him in another movie to see if his great performance was due to a perfect role for him or because he's a great actor. No question about Crowe's acting ability. One recommendation I would have, even if you have great hearing, is to run the captioning when you watch the movie. There are lots of low points and instances, such as right before the start of the championship fight, where lots of people are talking at the same time.

"An Inspirational, Moving Story...","Obviously, if you want to see a movie about actual boxing, this is not the one for you. The story is about a struggling boxer and the great depression; boxing itself is not the focal point. But it DOES have more ring scenes than ""Rocky""...Movies like ""Cinderella Man"" tend to have one major issue: they often feel too ritzy, which renders them unconvincing. This was one of the few movies that managed to portray the period of the great depression very believably. The movie is quite atmospheric and has a genuine feel of despair to it.The acting is impeccable. In the beginning, I was not sure about Renee Z.; they didn't seem to be a good match, but both actors are very good, so they pulled it off. The chemistry was probably fake, but it was present. The supporting actors, including the kids, were also very good.The movie was not exactly suspenseful, but there were practically no cheesy moments and it wasn't predictable, which is something I greatly appreciate in a film. There was some humour, too. All in all, the movie feels realistic, the story is compelling, and the lead characters are likable and charismatic.A heart-warming, inspirational movie. Definitely worth adding to your movie collection, even if you're not a huge fan of drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An ""almost-accurate"" account of a real-life event","This movie was truly inspirational and entertaining, HOWEVER, a few days after viewing it, I read not one, but two articles in The Kansas City Star, in which Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" fame) criticized the director, Ron Howard, for portraying Max Baer, his father, to be a monster. In real life, Max Baer had nightmares about the boxer who died as a result of injuries sustained in one of his fights. He even gave up boxing for a time. When he returned to the ring, he lost four of his next six fights because he was so overcome with grief. What Mr. Howard didn't bring to light was the fact that Max Baer was so remorseful over his opponent's death that he paid for the college education of each of that fighter's sons. While Max Baer WAS a wise-cracking person, he took no joy in being responsible for the death of an opponent. I believe that that fact should have been brought out. Indeed! It was a stimulating, RAH-RAH movie, but Max Baer Jr. has a legitimate complaint. While I enjoyed the movie, seeing Jethro's comments in print dimmed the luster of a great performance by Russell Crowe. No disrespect to Russell, but I believe that Ron Howard could and should have been a bit more objective in his portrayal of Max Baer. That's why my rating dropped it from a 9 to an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Knockout Movie!,"Russell Crowe's performance is awesome. This movie makes you realize how people struggled during the great depression. His wife doesn't like for him to box because of the risks involved, but he realizes it's the only way to take care of his family. The story is wonderful, based on the true life story of James J. Braddock. In the beginning he is a contender for the world heavyweight championship, but then he loses his license to box due to a few bad performances. He struggles to feed his family and pay his bills. A once well to do family now is dependent on welfare and Braddock even has to beg to pay his bills. After not having boxed for for a few years he has an opportunity to fight again because the number two world heavy weight contender has an upcoming fight and his opponent pulls out of the fight and no one is willing to fight him. His ex-manager comes to see him and asks him if he wants the fight which pays $250.00. He jumps at the opportunity because of his financial situation. I enjoyed the movie and I would see it again. The movie is definitely worth the price of admission. Very realistic and believable.

Excellent.,"An interesting story about an interesting man.This is a nice true story about a boxer who was decent, likable and honest. That in itself makes it unusual for a boxing film.The acting is excellent, Crowe is on fine form and nails the character being equally believable when he is on top of the world or when he is beat down and desperate and everything in between. The supporting cast almost all deliver fine realistic performances with Giamatti being especially good.The one issue with the acting, or casting, is Renée Zellweger. It is quite distracting to see someone with no facial movement trying to emote, the best she manages is to crinkle her eyes and look like she is in pain.The writing is good with the plot flowing at speed always showing the darkness of the era but not trying to bludgeon us into depression, the dialogue at times is snappy and funny and at other times is genuinely touching.Braddock does seem to have been an exceptional man pushed to the limits by hard times and it is easy to like him.The fight scenes are very well choreographed with the brutality of extreme close up being interspersed with commentary, tactics and other extraneous detail.All in all a great film, not mind-blowing but good to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Big Fight Era,"Heard my grandfather talk about Jim Braddock and what a real down to earth man he was living in New Jersey and this film is truly a great tribute to a down on his luck prize fighter who had a second chance and even fought with the great Joe Lewis. Jim Braddock was played by Russell Crowe and he did one of the best performance I have ever seen, along with the great acting performed by Renee Zellweger as his wife Mae Braddock. There were many great boxers during those years, Willie Peppe, Jack Dempsey, John L.

A Truly Remarkable Film,"I just saw Cinderella Man last night, 5/29/05. I was one of the first crowds in Madison WI to see it. And let me tell you it was amazing. If this is what happens when Ron Howard and Russell Crowe work together, they should line up a few more movies. They already struck gold in ""A Beautiful Mind"", and now ""Cinderella Man"".The Story follows a Great Depression era Boxer (James J. Braddock) who lost it all when the stock market crashed. He ran into bad luck when he broke his hand and could not even continue boxing well, so the Boxing commission repealed his boxing license. And he could not really take care of his family. But then a year later his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) said he could get Braddock one more fight, against a Heavy-Weight champion. Braddock actually won the fight, and then became America's favorite new under-dog, winning all kinds of challenging fights. He finally got the chance to fight Max Baer, a champ who had killed two people in the ring. Braddock's wife (Renée Zellweger) begged him not to take the fight, for fear of her husband's safety. But he still goes, and fights his heart out. He beats Max Baer, and he has been called the ""Cinderella Man"" for that, and his other fights.Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Gimatti all deliver Oscar-worthy performances. Crowe as a the kind hearted under-dog boxer, Zellweger as his loving and caring wife, and Giamatti as his confident and inspiring manager. If you like a good film, with romance, drama, action, a happy ending, and a heart, then you should definitely see ""Cinderella Man"", it may just be the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Hard-hitting boxing, and sentiment that works!","Ron Howard has made a name for himself for directing dull, politically correct Academy award favourites; and it is with that in mind that I decided that I didn't want to see this film. But I'm glad I changed my mind! Cinderella Man is more than just a follow-up to Clint Eastwood boxing success with 'Million Dollar Baby', and reunites the 'Best Picture winning team of Russell Crowe and Ron Howard, for the story of depression era boxer, Jim J. Braddock. Braddock was more than just a boxer in his time; he became the hope of the United States for the working class; so you've got to expect a lot of sentiment from this film. But, that is where Cinderella Man stands out; both from other films in it's class, and the rest of Howard's oeuvre - there is sentiment here, but it's not of the 'fake' kind - Howard builds it up excellently. By keeping the focus on the main character, the director is able to explore both the central figure and the era in which the film is set; and after showing the audience Braddock's first fight, and the situation that he and his family have found themselves in; it really is impossible not to only feel for this man, but get behind him as he tries to fight his way to the World Heavyweight Title.I don't profess to be the biggest fan of Russell Crowe, but you can always count on a strong lead performance from him, and that is what he delivers in this film. His acting here isn't great; but he portrays the right image that you would associate with his character, and his in-ring performance massively outweighs his performance outside of it. The fights in Cinderella Man are well choreographed, and thanks to some excellent first person cinematography; are always exciting, and it really feels like the boxers are actually being hurt! The support cast isn't bad, and it's Paul Giamatti who stands out the most there. His Oscar nomination seems more to be compensation for the film not receiving a 'Best Picture' nomination than anything; but as I say, he's not bad. Renee Zellweger is the weak link for me; I haven't been impressed with her so far, and her role here doesn't even give her a chance to change that. This film could be classified as 'predictable', but it wasn't for me as I've never heard of Jim Braddock, and therefore don't know the results of his fights; meaning that anything could have happened. Overall; I dint rate this as the best film of the year, but it is a milestone for its director. It's taken him a while, but Ron Howard has finally directed a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The entire film plays the entire spectrum of human emotions masterfully -- It tugs at your heartstrings. Now, this is not to say that this is a dull movie; all the action sequences (i.e. boxing) are very, very well done and leave you holding your breath time after time.

Brother can you spare a dime...,"Not being a fan of boxing I usually avoid movies about the sport unless there is some other reason for watching (as in Million Dollar Baby, the initial Rocky film): the idea of watching two people beat each other bloody while crazy crowds cheer just doesn't register as entertainment (the American gladiator syndrome). And while Cinderella MAN is clearly about the game of boxing, the true story of a real boxer, and contains long spans of beatings, this film is not so much about boxing as it is about the indomitable human spirit. It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember...In 1928 Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a top contender for boxing fame, supporting his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) and three children, wisely investing his earnings form his winning fights in the reliable stock market, devoting his time to his family and securing their future. Then 1929 happened and the stock market crash destroyed his savings and damaged his ability to fight, plunging him into the mass of poverty accompanied by nearly all Americans. Jim and Mae struggle to feed and clothe their children, and Jim is unable to win at boxing, becomes a 'loser', loses his license, and survives by daily showing up at the docks for the negligible chance of work. The times are bleak, and there is a moment when Mae shifts the children around to family members because they have no food or heat. But Jim's fight manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), himself surviving the bad times under a hollow facade, manages to gain Jim a fight. Despite his advancing age, broken hands, fallen reputation, and challenged ego, Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family. The rest is history.Ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time. With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date. There are small supporting roles that truly shine: the grossly underused Paddy Considine, Craig Bierko, and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations. Russell Crowe gives his most understated, credible role and truly inhabits 'Cinderella Man' (his moniker) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era. Renée Zellweger once again plays, well...Renée Zellweger. The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti. If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching! Cinderella MAN is a strong film, one that sweeps you up and carries you along - even if you don't care about boxing!

A brilliantly competent drama,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe scene is New York, 1930s. The Wall Street Crash has taken a devastating toll on the people of the Big Apple and the great depression is in full swing, with many of the population living below the poverty line. One of those people is former champion fighter James J Braddock (Russell Crowe), his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their two children. Braddock's career slumped years ago, and now he's getting by with the occasional work at a docking yard and even living off Relief Aid. But he becomes determined to regain his self esteem, get himself in shape and re-train to once again become the people's champion, this time managing to lift the spirits of the nation as well as reclaiming his honour as one of the greatest boxing heroes ever.There's just too many films released these days, and no matter what sort of great reviews or cult acclaim they get, I just don't get enough time to see them all and am most likely only to be guaranteed to see the big name, box office hits. Cinderella Man was one of those films that just went right over my head when it first came out, and I've only got round to seeing on the off chance now. I'm quite glad I did, though, because although it's not overly memorable or inspiring, it is a very rewarding and absorbing film to sit down and watch. The main star and the director may have been one reason why I never rushed out to see it, as they're the same team behind, IMHO, the slightly over-rated (especially in light of 2001's other Oscar nominated heavy-weight Training Day!) A Beautiful Mind but messrs Crowe and Ron Howard have pulled this film off with considerable aplomb. None of the performances are particularly brilliant, but Crowe, Zellweger and a supporting cast including Paul Giamatti and some recognizable bit part actors manage to keep things moving engagingly enough and then some.So then we are left with a film that didn't make a huge impact at the box office and was shadowed over by some (even with it's Oscar nominations) but is beyond watchable nonetheless. The story of the under dog rising to the top through boxing has been done before in films like Rocky and it doesn't do anything particularly surprising or exceptional, but it's a believable, well made and fairly well acted tale that is well worth seeing. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Braddock High!,"I had a pugilistic ball watching ""Cinderella Man"". Director Ron Howard's bio of Great Depression boxer Jim Braddock is the most inspiring film of the year. Russell Crowe was a knockout as Braddock. Do not get so hung up on Crowe's real life phone banging ordeal. His uppercut performance as Braddock was of the heavyweight thespian class. Braddock was an upstart boxer of the late 20's when his fate turned for the worse and was heavily affected by the Great Depression of the 30's. He started losing fights, losing money, and close to even losing life. However, he had the tenacious courage to comeback and re-energize his boxing career and eventually became a champion pugilist! It is a real Cinderella story! Renee Zelweger plays his devoted wife Mae. Mae I say that I was impressed by Renee's performance here. Paul Giamatti diverse acting training came in handy with his hands-on charismatic performance as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould. Giamatti keeps proving that he is as good as ""Gould"" with each acting project he undertakes. Howard masterfully directed the film and was a technical artist with the exceptional champion boxing scenes. Probably the supreme boxing scenes in movie history! Sly Stallone and Martin Scorsese probably want to punch me out by that last comment. So before the clock strikes twelve, make all your boxing film dreams come true and visit the true fairy tale of ""Cinderella Man"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Old-Fashioned Story Strong on Historical Context and the One-Two Punch of Crowe and Giamatti,"As he proved with 1995's ""Apollo 13"", director Ron Howard has an innate capacity of taking a well-known historical event and building suspense around an inevitable outcome. That's because he is adept at developing characters that reach deeper than the facts presented in standard docudramas. This time out, he takes a well-worn leitmotif in movies, the underdog overriding the odds to become a world champion, and puts a plush, sepia-toned design to this Depression-era story about light heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock. The movie is as old-fashioned as Hollywood movies come, but Howard also seems intent on presenting an interesting period of American history that has often been overlooked in recent films.Starting as a contender in late 1928, he deteriorates into fighting second-rate bouts five years later until he breaks his hand, at which point he is relegated to ad hoc longshoremen jobs on the New Jersey docks. Braddock gets a chance at redemption when his former manager, Joe Gould, offers him $250 to fight a heavyweight contender. He unexpectedly confounds the bookmakers and wins, which eventually leads him to a shot at the title against the heavily-favored opponent, Max Baer. Since the main story structure is rather predictable, Howard, driven by a period-authentic script by Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth, focuses on the atmosphere and the effect of the Depression on families struggling to survive. For example, the details around Madison Square Garden and the ""Hooverville"" in Central Park feel genuine, and when Braddock hits rock bottom and begs for money from his backers, the scene has an unflinching honesty about how his humiliation has been superseded by his need to get his children back from relatives.It certainly helps to have Russell Crowe portray Braddock in a committed performance that would make Spencer Tracy proud. While it doesn't rank with his subtly complex work in ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", his heroic performance is top-notch for this type of venture. The film's other sturdy performance comes from Paul Giamatti, who gives Joe a humanistic spirit that provides Braddock his path toward victory. I wish I could say the same for Renée Zellweger, who plays the June Allyson role of Braddock's wife Mae, with squinty-eyed worry and stiff upper-lip devotion, spouting the script's most sentimental lines (""You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!""). It just seems like a sophomoric role for such a proved actress. Smaller roles are filled out expertly, in particular, Paddy Considine as a Communist colleague who wants to force anarchy to make the government respond to the starving masses; Bruce McGill as the mercenary promoter; and Craig Bierko - who seems to be finally graduating from his golden-boy TV-movie roles - as the boastful, menacing Baer (probably an unfair portrait but one that works within this narrative).It's intriguing that for all the old-fashioned drama developed toward the final bout, that the more penetrating insight in the movie comes from how the period of FDR's New Deal really did not provide a timely response to the people who faced the degradation of poverty and starvation. Braddock is shown as a symbol for the downtrodden which the administration could not fathom in resuscitating hope for people. The DVD contains an insightful audio commentary track with Howard accompanied by screenwriters Goldman and Hollingsworth, as well as deleted scenes and several featurettes about the production. The most interesting addition though is about the subject himself, ""Jim Braddock: The Friends & Family Behind The Legend"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Emotionally draining,"The screening I went to in mid-May 2005 was attended with great anticipation by a mixed demographic in downtown Minneapolis. Graced with an award winning cast (Russell Crowe, René Zellweger, Paul Giamatti), CINDERALLA MAN is clearly a film made with great care by master producers (Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Penny Marshall), director (Ron Howard), and screenwriters (Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman). And yet, when the film ended, I had the sinking feeling that this pedigreed and worthy film was going to be a box office disappointment. Often billed as SEABISCUIT with two legs, this film indeed is a similar inspirational tale about how individual conviction and perseverance can prevail against overwhelming odds to emerge victorious, just as we and our Nation survived the depths of the Great Depression. In this case, the character of the man that was Jim Braddock, his unwavering support by a manager and wife who believed in him, were finely drawn and superbly executed by exceptional actors. The journey of the man, his tenacious hold to personal and professional principles, could not have been depicted better. The boxing action shots, the set design, the deft outline of Braddock's adversaries  poverty and physical danger  were clear and convincing. Despite all this, my concern at the end of the movie was that it was depressing, rather than uplifting. It went so deep that I was emotionally washed out at the end and even a good ending didn't make me right. Perhaps it has a little to do with my personal concern with the present American economy that made me wonder if the Great Depression could ever happen again, and what if it did. I knew it wasn't a film I'd be recommending to my friends for a fun evening out. The other concern I had while watching the film, was that I didn't know enough about this man Braddock and his family during the good days. The film opens with Braddock a winner, and very shortly thereafter the black clouds roll in and the majority of the movie is the dark story about a man from whom we have no expectation who turns out to be a great man. Perhaps it would have been good to spend a little more time showing us how Braddock first made it to the top, and how he became a little cocky, and then how he weathered the great storm with principles intact despite being severely tested. If any fault can be given at all to the design of the story telling, this would be it -- That short shrift was given to background on Braddock, his little human failings and his relationship with his wife, before their mettle was tested.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This is without a doubt Crowe's and Zellwegger's finest performances ever.( i know i sound like James Lipton) There portrayals of these characters made me forget that i was watching Russel Crowe and Renee Zellewgger but instead James J. and Mae Braddock. This movie was so good that I wanted to put eight dollars in an envelope and send it to Ron Howard for not going to see this in theaters. Sure the movie is two and a half hours long but it flows so smoothly that its seems like its over as soon as it starts. it has some of the greatest boxing scenes I've ever seen it blows all the Rocky's and million dollar baby and raging bull out of the water and takes the crown as the greatest boxing movie ever and i would ever argue the greatest sports movie ever but calling it a sports movie is unfair because it is so much more. This movie has it all it will make you laugh make you cry and at the end it will get your blood pumping and adrenaline flowing and you'll be on your feet rooting on Jimmy like it was a real fighting happening right now. The camera work is amazing and the look and feel of the move make you feel like your right there with these people and as cheesy as it may be you root for these people and win they succeed it makes you feel like you have too. This story can still inspire people to this day more than seventies years after it happened. This movie was not done justice at the box office and I'm sorry to say I was part of the problem. IT was a perfect 10/10 I can't find anything wrong with it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Brilliant,"As usual Paul Giamatti puts in one of his brilliant performances, this guy should win an Oscar very soon, Crowe and Rene were also very good, for anyone who does not like boxing movies could not help but love this movie, its about hunger and survival and Crowe portrays that to his finest, I thoroughly enjoyed Cinderella man, will definitely be watching it again and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys excellent drama and acting, to think that Cradock actually gave all the relief money he was given back to the city is incredible in itself.Paul.New Zealand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Geeky Randy's summary,"An overall entertaining film about American boxer James J. Braddock, world heavyweight champion from 1935–37. A little melodramatic at times with interchangeable acting to go along, but ultimately a really good outing. Gordon Sim's set decoration and Daniel Orlandi's costume design fit the Great Depression-era tone perfectly, and Ron Howard's directing of the fight scenes create a wickedly superb realism that makes the audience feel like they're the ones giving and taking the punches. Neighbor DeWitt is the granddaughter of the real Braddock. Craig Bierko is incredibly interesting as challenger Max Baer, though Baer is portrayed as a harsher person than he was in real life.***½ (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Heartfelt Movie,"Cinderella Man, based on a true story, provides some very good character development. I had read about the Braddock-Baer fight years ago and felt that this movie captured the essence of it. It seems worthy of an Oscar nomination or two. I'm glad that it came out in the summer because it balances drama with the other action flicks that have come out. Crowe really draws in the viewer and takes him/her through a range of emotions. I was particularly struck when Braddock begs money from his former promoter and others working with him. It was a moving moment. I always thought of the real Jimmy Braddock as a decent man and Crowe played him that way. Great job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"not just a good movie, a must see for teenagers","Not that Cinderella Man needs any more positive reviews, there is a noteworthy observation I wanted to share: while Cinderella Man is the Jim Braddock story, it an equally worthy presentation of the Depression era, and the great struggles that faced Americans only 75 years ago. This is a movie which represents how art can make a dignified and powerful connection to its audience, and communicate something more than just a personal saga, a great love, fast action, or a confusing canvas with paint splattered on it. This movie would do commendable service as a screening film in high-school auditoriums for all kids, especially young boys. A compelling story, action, excellent acting and the excellent script will keep their attention, and exposure to an era of hardship and hard work will make for a lesson well learned to a young generation in which dignity, character, and values seem otherwise lost.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A beautifully crafted, well-told underdog tale about the triumph of the human spirit","Directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Paddy Constantine and Craig Bierko.The movie tells the true tale of James Braddock who turns to the boxing ring as a way of earning a living to ensure his family 's survival. Set in Depression-era New York, Howard quickly paints a grim picture of loss in the shape of wealth and separated families . The film resonates as if it were the Director' s personal story and largely on this tenet, it succeeds marvelously. The stunning screenplay of Akiva Goldsman (who scored an Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind "" ) and Cliff Hollingsworth, chronologically unfolds Braddock' s career, against the Great Depression with the realization of the heart-breaking impact upon not only his family but the working class.As with movies of this genre, its success depends largely on the credibility of circumstances surrounding the underdog, the actual underdog and the nemesis. The lead up to the big fight with the nemesis features Bierko in a devilish performance, which transcends being a mere cardboard cut out of a character. Crowe continues to astound with his consummate brilliance. Touches of subtlety, machismo, open emotion are all the right reasons why he will receive another Oscar nomination in the lead actor category. The audience never questions the heart of Braddock, and credit must go to Crowe and his Director for that.Braddock is supported by his trainer (Giammati) and to a more reserved extent his wife (Zellweger). As if the script and directing were not enough, the supporting cast members themselves spar thus constantly improving each other' s game. Giammati is dynamite, brash, able to be both overwhelming motivational and a mouse, when necessary . The chemistry between Zellweger and Crowe hits you squarely in the gut, as we witness the sacrifices they both attempt to make in adjusting to the prevailing socio-economic conditions. She is strong for her kids and her husband, even though she dislikes his profession. However, retains her vulnerability and musings as she comes to realize the importance of Braddock to the working class and how different things could be, in a very mild, yet thoroughly involving subplot with Paddy Constantine.Although the boxing ring encounters on at least two occasions seemed shoddily shot, the involvement of the audience by using radio coverage vs. ringside views, coupled with the ready buy-in of the characters, easily outweigh this minor transgression.During and even after viewing this film, I was reminded of the equally terrific, Seabiscuit. On a technical level, Gary Ross' hand was steady in purpose, the script was well written and the supporting cast, turned in stellar performances. On a thematic basis, the destitution and despair of the Depression, the comeback story, the value of friendships/family, and the moral of perseverance against extraneous odds brought about the same range of emotions.Alternatively titled, ""Cinder-Biscuit"" is Howard's best work to date and one of the year's great films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Strikingly traditionalist,"The overall structure of this film and the characterization of Braddock is straight forwardly traditionalist. Whether it is Braddock returning the relief money, or him trying to save a friend from his dangerous leftist ways the film strikes the notes of family, faith, and classic Americana. Likewise, the plotting of promise, fall, redemption and victory conform to what is expected of a sports drama in a pleasantly straightforward way. Of note, Baer is characterized as everything Braddock isn't-he's an arrogant playboy with a sadistic streak. It adds up to a comforting underdog story that is especially resonant during times of economic toughness. This film would have been a bigger hit if it was released a few years later.The real strength of the film is Howard's direction. He pushes the visuals into noir-ish moody lighting and color scheme that fits the story rather well. The fights themselves are quite good; the editing flourishes of incorporating subjective POV, memory and (seeming) archival footage provide good uniqueness to them. The film's look does a great job of balance the hope and despair of the story and the depression.Crowe is engaging here. Solid and sturdy he is daddylicious in the role. But the real standout is Giamatti as Joe. Funny and wise in the ways of the world he provides much needed acidic tenor to dull the sweet edges of the underdog story. I had forgotten just how violent Joe is. Giamatti has turned in better performances but this is a very good role for the character actor.Good film.

Cinderella Man,"I thought Cinderella Man was such a wonderful movie! I have seen several boxing films and was not expecting a lot from this one. Although this film tells a story similar to most other sports filmsone of redemption and successit made me feel like I have never seen a film with this particular theme. Jimmy Braddock portrays the human Seabiscuit and struggles through the Great Depression like most other families during the early 1930s. The film's plot kept me interested and I really enjoyed the classical music throughout. The cinematography and editing were also outstanding! I think the boxing matches showed the skilled cinematographer's and editor's talent and creativity. There were several quick shots throughout the matches and I felt close to Jimmy as he was seeing it in his perspective. After Jimmy got hit, the camera blurred and during the flashbacks the camera used darker colors to show his past. The mise en scene was excellent as well. The setting seemed accurate and it really did look like it was shot in New York and New Jersey. The lighting was appropriate in each situation; darker during the harder times and golden and lighter near the end and at the very beginning. The costumes also seemed a great fit and throughout the movie the men wore their suits and ties, which I read was what they really did. This showed they had not given up hope and it kept up their appearances, which was one of the only things many American citizens still had after they were hit hard by the Great Depression.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wise Words from C.P.A,"Cinderella Man was surprising in the sense of performance. I honestly wasn't expecting the actors to bring this story to life so much and so well at that. Though in moments the sudden change in setting did throw me off but not enough to not like the movie. The struggles of the great depression were so well acted and presented by the settings and sets. The pain and suffering were most definitely brought by the actors which I have to applaud. But not just the actors but the filming and writers and more then likely the director. The filming and writing said just as much as the actors by sharing pieces of information that were not necessary but gave you more of a deeper understanding of how one truly had to live and survive during the great depression. Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie for the acting, filming, and lastly the bring to the light just how the great depression shattered peoples worlds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The film was spectacular,"Cinderella man, the title has a typical romance movie ring to it, but it's not. Cinderella man (played by Russell Crowe) is a story about the real life boxer James Braddock, and how he made his way from living in the poor neighborhoods with his kids and wife Mae Braddock (Played by Rene Zellweger), to being a famous boxer who has become an inspiration all over the world. The movie has done an excellent job at portraying feelings and emotions. Director Ron Howard and screenwriters Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman did and excellent job at including important history, keeping the audience on their toes and craving more. They captured the human journey by artistically expressing failure and hope. This is not your usual romance/drama movie, it had a great deal of love in it in another way. In my opinion, it was beautifully expressed.The fact that this movie is based on true events is not groundbreaking, but using real life events is a splendid way of having an interesting movie plot and making the film important. It's sublime. Cinderella man takes us through all of the journeys, it makes us feel the rush at the boxing matches, the unconditional love when Mae and James show each other deep love. It makes us cry with happiness whenever the children feel joy and it makes us laugh with the characters whenever jokes are being made. The actors did a great job at the accents which made it more real. As I have expressed, the movie is filled with joyous moments but I would have wanted the movie to give some of the other characters more personal background. It would have created more pity, if you will, among the audience with some of the characters.James Braddock, the Cinderella man. He is a hero to his children and his wife. The film was spectacular and I strongly suggest that everyone takes their time to watch it.

Cinderella Man Is a Crowning Achievement,"For a quarter century, director Ron Howard has shown consistent film-making prowess in a wide range of genres. In Cinderella Man, he goes back to real life (previously he did the fact-based A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13) and recreates the boxing hero, James Braddock, whose life parallels the fortunes of Depression-era New York. It is one of Howard's best films.A talented boxer, Jim Braddock, ascends the ranks of boxing in the late 1920's and finds his career is jeopardized by a chance injury which cuts short any championship aspirations. Furthermore, he shows a limited boxing style that favored one arm over the other. When his boxing license is stripped and the Great Depression hits, Braddock must literally struggle to keep his family afloat as even the poorest paying jobs on the loading docks are scarce. Love and sacrifice might not be enough until a fateful opportunity comes knocking in the form of a last minute substitute in a boxing match. It seems that Braddock has become a more complete fighter by working on the docks and strengthening both of his arms.What follows is an improbable series of bouts that leads to a heavyweight championship fight with Max Baer, a legendary giant. This is Braddock's second chance, and although he has everything to gain, he knows it is the biggest risk of his life; Baer has killed two opponents in the ring. Braddock becomes a symbol of hope as the nation begins to embrace him. As the whole country hangs on every punch via radio broadcast, Braddock is in the fight of his life.What is basically a boxing movie is also a touching love story. You grow to understand Braddock and his wife as partners and lovers whose plight during the Depression adds resonance to the climactic bout. It is also noteworthy how the film depicts the reverence with which the populace embraced Braddock amid troubled economic times. Just as the horse, Seabiscuit, inspired a nation, so did Braddock.Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator) is such a chameleon of an actor; he seems to effortlessly embody this legendary fighter by demonstrating tremendous physical abilities in the boxing ring while maintaining focus as the everyman who has to live by his wits. Not only did Crowe severely trim down in weight and train to be a convincing fighter (he looks to be in incredible condition), he effortlessly inflects a New Jersey accent and inhabits a proud family man whose love for his wife and three children is matched only by his heart and desire in the boxing ring.Renée Zellweger (Cold Mountain and Chicago) does a serviceable job as Braddock's wife, Mae. A better written character would have given the actress more to work with. Her shining moment comes during a fateful meeting with Max Baer at a posh restaurant where she more than holds her own. Paul Giamatti (Sideways and American Splendor) takes his role as Braddock's trainer and owns it. He breathes three-dimensional life into what could have been a cardboard, supporting role. Particularly in the last fight, he gives Braddock advice and suggestions to the point you actually believe he knows what he is talking about. It is surely an Oscar caliber performance.There is a subplot involving Braddock's friend from the docks named Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine) who is involved in soliciting union support which culminates in violence in Hooverville. It would have been interesting to have explored this world a bit more, but instead, it is given relatively short shrift. One minor controversy is the portrayal of Baer (Craig Bierko is quite menacing) as an unsympathetic brute of a fighter which was probably done to contrast him with Braddock. Also unfortunate is the timing of the film's release on the heels of a sleeper like Million Dollar Baby which surely invited comparisons in subject matter and Oscar pedigree.Kudos go to the production staff for vividly reconstructing the period as costumers and set decorators reimagine a dark period of history. The infamous tents and shacks that became Hooverville are depicted faithfully. The film never drags or seems padded. It is as lean as Crowe. The boxing scenes are well shot and edited in a refreshing way. It is so easy to fall into clichés, but these fights are staged with great care and realism. When the punches connect, there are stunningly brief, close-up frames of the impact. Howard also employs split second flashback imagery to illustrate Braddock's thought processes whether it be the funeral of a close friend or remembrance of a small apartment without heat or electricity. Editing transitions are done with good effect.Ron Howard (working off a well written screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman) does such a good job that the film doesn't feel like it is being directed but rather, it feels like it just happens as in real life. While not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man is a well made film about an amazing comeback story with real life people that gets better as it goes along until its gutsy ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Crowe is once again great,"Russell Crowe once again gives an A performance as real life boxer, James J Braddock. Renee Zellweger also does a good job as his wife. Braddock lost about everything during the great depression and he struggles to put food on the table for the couples 3 kids. His boxing license gets taken away because he just isn't delivering entertaining bouts. He is forced to work at the docks and beg for money. Then his luck changes; his old manager comes by asking him to take a fight at last minute notice. Of course, he jumps at the chance to make a little money, and he wins. His left hand has become more powerful from all the hard work at the docks. He keeps winning fights and gets a chance at the champ, Max Baer.His story is about triumph during the depression. He is an inspiration for the down trodden, who are rooting for him. If someone who was in the red could come back to be heavy weight champion, it gave hope to all. That is the message of the story. Very similar to the race horse story, Sea biscuit.But, it is a good story, great acting, and beautiful imagery. The film makers capture the early 30s look.FINAL VERDICT: Everyone should watch this. It's not just a boxing movie, it's an emotional drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the greats,"Before I went and payed my seven bucks to watch this film....I was hoping that it would measure up to the previous movies that Russell Crowe had taken part in. I shelled out a couple of bucks (and by a couple I mean several) for food and drink before taking a seat in a half full theater....mostly guys with their girl friends. I had no idea what was about to hit me.The movie starts off a little slow....so I was thinking it was going to be a slow paced.....kindly moving story. However, as the story progressed....so did my urge to see what was going to happen next. Like every good movie, it pushed and pulled and me....made me wonder what it was like to live in the same conditions that James J. Braddock had lived in so long ago. Crowe did a great job at playing his role... grade A acting all the way around. Paul Giamatti stole the show. Renée Zellweger, excluding a couple of stupid lines, did a great job at supporting Crowe....didn't over do it...gave just enough to play her part.I don't care who you are. I don't care if you hate every movie you've ever seen....I don't even care if you are blind. You MUST see this movie (I know it's impossible to see a movie if you are blind....but science is making progress...)at all costs.

"As a True-Grit Tale of Redemption, Cinderella Man Packs a Punch!","When we first meet our eponymous boxing-hero Jim Braddock (Crowe), he's living the high-life of the roaring '20s as a distinguished boxer. By 1929, after piling up an impressive record in over 40 professional bouts, he lands a title fight. However, what turns out to be worse for his fate than his loss to the champion Tommy Loughran, is the stock market crash later that year, which plunges the country into the Great Depression. Wiped out financially, Braddock and his family - wife Mae (Zellweger) and three kids – are relegated to a cramped basement apartment and he begins to support his family by finding occasional work as a longshoreman. His boxing license is also eventually revoked as our erstwhile champion loses fight after fight and he soon goes on welfare in order to subsist. Soon, his plight becomes a public source of shame, when his being on welfare gets reported in the local tabloids. Somehow summoning up a combination of grace, courage, and confidence in the face of humiliation, Braddock chooses to train again, this time as a heavyweight. When his former manager Joe Gould (Giamatti) gets him a lucrative break as dead-meat for a heavyweight challenger, it kick- starts one of the most remarkable career revivals in sporting history. Beating the odds again and again in a series of surprising upsets, he becomes a source of hope for the common American man by conquering the boxing world, while still struggling through the daily grind of poverty and gets christened as 'Cinderella Man'. With Braddock winning fights in convincing fashion, he is given a shot at the title held by the malicious Max Baer, a vicious fighter who has killed two men in the ring. Does he emerge victorious from this ominous fight, or does this turn out to be the night when the fairytale ends for our 'Cinderella Man'?Ron Howard's Cinderella Man skillfully delivers a primal, heart- pounding satisfaction as he directs this rousing saga with an admirable sense of restraint, which works to underscore the resilience of characters and allows the actors and the story enough time to breathe. His presentation of the bout is dynamic and tense, not giving into histrionic display. He keeps a consistent, sharp tone throughout, not resorting to any overtly sappy moments which many films of this ilk have a tendency to do. Renee Zellweger rises to the challenge and delivers an earnest performance. A delightfully scene-stealing Paul Giamatti shows us the raw excitable emotions that keep breaking the surface of Gould's fast-talking tough-guy facade. But it is Russell Crowe who steals the show with his towering performance. He adopts a flawless period 'Noo-Yawk' accent, a tough guy attitude, and undergoes a physical transformation to look remarkably like Braddock. But he ensures that the character does not fall into these superficial accoutrements and carries the film forward with a kind of quiet dignity only he can.As a true-grit tale of redemption, Cinderella Man lands one solid body punch after another!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

If you care at all about the depression and the people that persevered, you should take 2 hours.I have enjoyed a lot of movies in the past, especially many of Mr. Howard's, however this was emotional without being obnoxious, capturing the essential moments without moving far away from the essence of the movie.

Great Movie!,"I loved the movie - its portrayal of character in the face of adversity is a tale for the ages. My only complaint is its unfair treatment of Max Baer... Contrary to the movie, Baer did not gloat over the death of an opponent in the ring. He actually took care of the man's family and put the man's children through school. Also, to the consternation of Hitler, Baer beat the German boxer, Max Schmeling, while wearing a ""Star of David"" on his trunks. (The Nazis subsequently banned all media of Baer, by the way - Baer was raised Catholic.) Cinderella Man is an excellent movie. But I think Max Baer deserves better treatment.

You're watching a destitute family struggling to survive surrounded by others just like them.

Best Movie I Have Seen All Year!!!,"This was one of the best movies I have seen all year.I am not a fan of Russell Crowe, although, I do like Renee Zellweiger. Russell Crowe was fabulous in this movie.The movie starts out slow, as it introduces you to the family, but once it gets going, it truly delivers.It has all of the elements of a great movie. Ron Howard is proving himself to be an awesome director! This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.The fighting scenes were not too graphic that you could not look, and yet intense enough to cause you to feel the fighter's pain. I would rank this with the original Rocky films. A very inspirational movie that keeps you entertained.FANTASTIC!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What a Knockout,"Washed up boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is longing for another chance at the glory he once had. With the help of his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) he is given one more shot at the belt. He goes up against Max Baer. Baer has already killed two men in the ring. Will Jim be the third? ""Cinderella Man"" is a truly spectacular picture with supporting roles from Renee Zellwegger and Craig Bierko. Films like this show us that a second chance is possible. All you need is hope. Someone deserves and Oscar.""Cinderella Man"" is rated PG-13 for Intense Boxing Violence and Some Language.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cinderllaman,"I really enjoyed this movie. It, like Seabiscuit, showed how sports helped people deal with the depression. Sports are a short break from the hardships of life. The overall story was entertaining. The technical aspect of the movie was also well. The sound was used to create two different feelings. The big band music was played when Jim's life was going well and he had no financial problems. The classical music was used throughout the entire movie. The fight with the most important sound was the fight with Max Baer. When Max decided to fight and stop goofing around, a harsh sound was played. Another harsh sound was played when Max hit Jimmie the first of the two punches that kill men. The editing and cinematography was fantastic! At the last fight with Max Baer, the editing is quick with straight cuts. The angles switch constantly to create chaos. The color of the film also changes when Jimmie remembers the film he saw of Max killing a man in the ring. The view from Jimmie's eyes is a blurry Max who is moving slowly towards him. This shows how scary Max is in the ring. This movie was excellent. The story line was easy and interesting to follow. It depicts the emotions and hardships of those that lived during the Great Depression. The sound created the mood, and the editing and cinematography made the movie great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Feel Good Movie Of The Year,"I went to this movie not to sure how it would be mainly due to its title.

Cinderella MAN is well worth your time & your $$$,"It's not just your ordinary boxing movie! It has heart, soul & passion!!! Men, women & children will love this film and it is rated PG-13 so I hope kids everywhere will see this film. Braddock's amazing story has more life lessons on what it means to be a REAL man as opposed to what is perceived by today's society to be strength. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Braddock is flawless. Braddock himself had such an overabundance of the best of human qualities. When things were at their worst, he exhibited more genuine character, ethics and love for his wife and family than I've seen in any movie that's been made in DECADES!!! AND, due to Braddock's sheer heart & determination... he becomes a true champion of & hero to the Depression Era downtrodden American people! To the impeccable Cast, Director, Writers & Jim J.

Against All Odds,"Cinderella Man movie is a wonderful portrayal of the human spirit's resilience. Ron Howard directed the film, which stars Russell Crowe as James J. Braddock, whose boxing return symbolizes hope during the Great Depression. Crowe provides a subtle performance that captures Braddock's tenacity and humility. Renée Zellweger excels as his supporting wife, Mae, providing emotional dimension to the story. The film's accurate portrayal of the 1930s, paired with its thrilling boxing scenes, sets it apart. It's more than just a biography movie, it's a celebration of endurance, family, and integrity. This cinematic gem resonates with its portrayal of a guy who battled against all odds, both inside and outside the ring. It's a great movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good old fashioned movie-making,"I was impressed by the way this movie told two stories, one about a down-and-out fighter and another about the Great Depression. Either story was important enough, but when woven together it becomes one of the greatest American stories of all time. Each was told well enough to stand on its own, but again, together they comprise a truly great motion picture. As if this story and the way it was told weren't enough, the movie is spectacular to look at, and the acting jobs are transcendent, particularly Paul Giamatti, who takes a simple role and infuses it with something riveting. Russell Crowe, who I've never liked, is fantastic, and Renee Zellweger is, well, Renee Zellweiger. Nothing beats a story that should be told when it is told really well. Sit back with your popcorn and take the ride. Opie has done it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Another knockout for Howard and Crowe,"As much as I love APOLLO 13 I have to say that this may be Ron Howard's best film yet. Cinderella MAN is that rare adult-aimed film that you can take your kids and grandmother to see (like APOLLO 13 for that matter). It is a warm and vibrant film that earns in heart-in-your-throat moments with some vivid depictions of The Great Depression and very exciting boxing scenes. I think Russell Crowe is the best actor working right now because he disappears into a role and becomes it like DeNiro did when he made films for art and not $$$. James Braddock's story is more compelling than Rocky Balboa's because his fairy tale was true. Crowe makes this uncomplicated good guy really interesting which is almost a miracle in itself. This a guy you honestly root for (forgive me Australia) and Crowe and Howard never telegraph their intentions. BUT they also have the talents of Paul Giamatti (better here than he ever has been) and Renee Zellweger in key supporting roles. And let's not forget Craig Bierko as Max Baer who makes a ""bad guy"" 3-D. I don't really like boxing (that b-tch Tyson still owes me $35 for that Holyfield rip-off and I hope you read this you vicious thug quitter), but now Cinderella MAN comes on the heals of MILLION DOLLAR BABY (which the Oscars got right) within a year and you gotta wonder when Don Kings dies maybe the sport can revive itself like it has on screen. (At least the filmmakers are honest.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Down but not out...,"Braddock's remains one of the most inspiring boxing stories ever- and Ron Howard's version of it just may be the finest cinematic treatment of the subject we've had so far. Crowe is outstanding, as are Zellweger and Giamatti; but it's Howard, the director, who deserves praise in the highest. I made a point of seeing this one on the big screen, but it took me a while to get around to commenting on it (in great part because watching it causes in me a welling in the throat and a mistiness in the eyes). Cinderella MAN, despite what some may have taken to be melodramatics, happens to be a genuinely dramatic Real Life Story with few equals. ROCKY? Forget it. Compared to Cinderella MAN, ROCKY (and all its sequels) are tantamount to some of the cornier GODZILLA movies, with Rocco battling one giant monster after another. (Yes, I realize that Stallone was simply taking a page from Real Life when he wrote a script based on Chuck Wepner's fight with Muhammad Ali, but he subsequently turned it all into one big comic book series.) One of the more interesting aspects of Cinderella MAN was the depiction of Max Baer. The fact that Baer DID, in fact, kill a man in the ring made him a fighter to be reckoned with (although the beating began with a rabbit punch- a blow to the back of his opponent's head) and the filmmaker's milk that notoriety for all it's worth. As a screen villain, ""Max Baer"" is akin to the likes of Real Life full contact Middleweight Karate Champion Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace in A FORCE OF ONE: he comes across as a man fully capable of KILLING someone in the ring. In The Real World, Baer was ""The Clown Prince of Boxing,"" and he often smiled or laughed aloud or even TAUNTED his opponents. In his dismantling of Primo Carnera (a former circus strongman who'd ALSO killed a man in the ring), he was at his belligerent best- but it took him longer than one might've imagined to do away with Carnera: he seemed to tire midway through the fight- but the reprieve was short-lived and the hapless Carnera eventually succumbed. Against Braddock, Baer never seemed to be able to get untracked. He often stiff-armed Braddock with his left to try to measure him for a right, but Braddock invariably derailed him by popping him in the mouth with a solid left jab. It's hard to tell from the fight films I've watched, but it LOOKS like Braddock bloodies Baer's mouth with that jab. Baer grinned once or twice when Braddock jabbed him in the mouth, but it quickly became clear that he didn't find it all that funny. He tried desperately to end it in the fifteenth and final round, but the thing that surprised me most was the fact that Braddock stood his ground and traded punches with Baer until the final bell. He had handily outboxed Baer. It remains to this day an inspirational Real Life success story. (And it didn't end with THIS fight: before he put the title on the line against Joe Louis, Braddock had a stipulation put into their contract that, should Louis win (he did), Braddock would get a percentage of his subsequent title defenses. Which he did.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
outstanding and heartwarming,"Just a great sport movie!!!A boxing movie that is everything and I don't know know how to describe such a beautiful movie, it's really really amazing.Braddock could be anyone, but he was a boxer and he did whatever it took to provide for his family.

An Incredible Motion Picture....,"I've always thought that the greatest sports films focused less on the actual sports and more on the various plights of the principals. Obviously, Ron Howard agrees with this sentiment. He has presented extraordinarily choreographed fight sequences(probably the most realistic fight scenes put to screen!) but with the bulk of ""Cinderella Man""'s screen time, we are given a foray into the hardships of James J. Braddock and his family. We are also given a view of the starkly contrasting lifestyles of those that were able to escape the ""Great Depression""'s poverty; men like boxing champion Max Baer and New York boxing promoter Jim Johnston. The two worlds those characters embody collide in a climactic ending duel for the heavyweight championship of the world. Considering his three prior hand fractures and rib injuries incurred during a car accident AND the fact that his opponent Max Baer literally killed two of his previous opponents, James J. Braddock may have been the greatest underdog in organized sports. This film tells his story and it tells it well. Thomas Newman contributes yet another incredible score.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great,"Even tough this is not a boxing movie, it is the movie that inspired me to look up classic boxing and learn about people like Jim Braddock, Muhammad Ali and their story. Before this movie, for me classic boxing was a black and white picture with two men punching random blows.Actors like Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger and a outstanding atmosphere of the time period takes you back then at those moments in time with their performance, the actors get a clean 10/10.⭐Personally I never heard much of Director Ron Howard but he did an excellent job, kept the CGI to a minimum and let the actors improvise very often and with good success he gets 8/10.⭐A true story of a man and his family surviving in a difficult period for New Jersey, using box as a main means to provide for the family and facing extreme bad luck for 2 years, he has to make it with the support of a strong wife.This is a strong movie and it is recommended to watch with family on a nice Sunday evening.8⭐

The way in which the director built up the movie was a thing of beauty. There were times when the movie was gentle and other times when it was violent and furious. Romance meets savagery...

"Well acted, engaging, and entertaining.","""Cinderella Man"" was one of very few movies I enjoyed in 2005. Before the movie I had barely heard of James Braddock or Max Baer. The movie motivated me to read several books/commentaries on boxing in the US during the 20's and 30's. I'm convinced James Braddock was one of the most courageous athletes in boxing or ANY sport. Motivated almost entirely in supporting and providing for his family, Mr. Braddock stands in stark contrast to the current crop with multiple ""world champions"" motivated almost entirely by money and narcissism. Though not a Russell Crowe fan he does an outstanding job in playing a self-deprecating, humble James Braddock. Craig Bierko was superb as Max Baer, although the Baer of this movie bears little resemblance to the ""real life"" Max Baer, that real life man who put through college the children of the fighter he ""killed"" in the ring. Paul Giamatti does his usual superb job. This movie was one of the best of the last 10 years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Whilst a lot more schmaltzy than Raging Bull (although that's a cruel word to use for emotional)it is every bit as convincing in the ring.Russell Crowe has just made his best movie (he way outscores his overbearing performance in A Beautiful Mind). He carries the movie impressively, although he is ably supported by one of America's greatest emerging actors, Paul Giametti.

Pretty darn good,"I love how all the historians of boxing and the Great Depression and the haters just down play this movie like it's completely false. Are all the parts of this movie the absolute truth? Probably not. With that said, I believe Ron Howard was trying to capture the goodness and heart of the main character Jim Braddock, played by Russell Crowe. It's Hollywood folks and the truth can be slightly twisted to blown out of proportion in movies. I really enjoyed the movie and thought the boxing scenes were filmed perfectly. Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould was brilliant. I felt his character pieced the movie together. Now, if I am not mistaken, the real life Joe Gould had run ins with the law later on. In the movie they make him out to be a great guy and maybe he was. Some of the acting is a tad bit cheesy but not over bearing or unwatchable. I believe Ron Howard was just trying to capture the feel of someone living through the depression and what one person did to save his family and he did. If your stomach didn't have a little lump in it seeing how tough it was then you just didn't get it. Most of us here wouldn't understand. As far as Max Baer, he is painted as somewhat of a monster. My guess is he wasn't and was given that image as the ""bad guy"" for the movie. Overall, this movie is worth the watch and more than once.

Triumphant Tribute to a Real-Life Rocky,"""The Bulldog of Bergen,"" Jim Braddock was a fighter who came out of the depths of the Depression to win the World Heavyweight Championship against incredible odds, one who lived to see himself honored as a folk hero, a legend of sports, and one of New Jersey's first citizens. Had he lived long enough to see Ron Howard's excellent film on his life, ""Cinderella Man,"" he would have almost certainly approved.A box-office disappointment when released, and all but overlooked at the Oscars, ""Cinderella Man"" is, nonetheless, one of the best films of 2005 in the opinion of everyone I've known who has seen it, as well as myself. As much as Peter Jackson in ""King Kong,"" Howard and his team take a grimy, unsentimental look at the Depression Era that is both fascinating and unsettling at the same time. The New Jersey/New York area of Braddock's time, as well as such venues as the old Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City, are faithfully and meticulously recreated. Howard's direction is, as always, right on top of things. The pace doesn't slacken for a minute, the storytelling always grabs you.But technical aspects are only part of what makes a movie great. There are also the performances, and in this respect, ""Cinderella Man""'s cast doesn't disappoint. Russell Crowe gives his best performance yet (And, no, I'm not forgetting Howard's earlier ""A Beautiful Mind"") as Braddock. He doesn't play the part, he IS the part, gentle and loving with his family, a hard worker on the docks, a tiger in the ring. Renee Zellweger effectively de-glamorizes herself as Braddock's loving wife, Mae, tender yet tough. Paul Giamatti definitely earned his Oscar nomination as Braddock's best friend/manager Joe Gould, who won't give up on Jim even when everybody else has. And Craig Bierko gives an appropriately over-the-top performance as Max Baer, Sr., the flamboyant champ, a devil with the ladies and in the ring, whom Braddock challenges for the championship. This was the performance that motivated Baer's son, actor/producer Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), to sue the producers, claiming, justifiably, that they presented a very one-sided view of his father, turning him, for the sake of a good story, into a villain he was far from being.All in all, a great movie about the triumph of the human spirit. Once you see it, you will never forget it, and always want to come back again.Incidentally, the DVD of ""Cinderella Man"" (a nickname for Braddock coined by Damon Runyon) features several interesting bonus features. There is a commentary track by Ron Howard, cut scenes, newsreel footage of Braddock in action, and interviews with Braddock's family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Follows the ""Boxing Movie"" Cliché, But Still A Good Filim","Cinderella Man is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe as James Braddock, a rags to riches boxer that tries to make a life during the Great Depression. The story follows Braddock, and his wife (Renee Zellweger) as he rises from a very bad boxer, to a very good boxer, and the conflicts that this causes in his marriage, and the ever so hard time known as the Depression.Ron Howard, the director, is known by many people as Opie Taylor. However, he is also a pretty good, and well known, director in Hollywood. He's directed such movies as The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind (also with Russell Crowe), and even Apollo 13. He's done some pretty good films, and this one lives up to the others. While on the topic of Ron Howard, I might as well mention the directing. The directing in this movie is actually pretty good. During the fight scenes, he films the action pretty well. There aren't an overabundance of cuts, and he used a lot of wide shots when Braddock was in the ring. I was impressed with the directing.The cinematography was also pretty good. Some people may not like it, because it's dark and dreary, but I liked that quite a bit. It expresses how hard the Depression was, and it symbolizes the people's' lives. Their lives were dark, and nothing seemed to work out. This is also true for the story's protagonist, which leads me into my next positive.The characters were very likable. I truly understood why James had to fight, and I also understood why his wife, Mae, didn't want him to. She needed him to be able to take care of the family, and he thought he was doing so by fighting. He saw fighting as a way to make money, and she saw it as an easy way to get killed. These characters are a literary device known as a foil; they contrast each other. However, this somewhat reflected on another couple involved with the boxing business, and for those of you who have seen the Rocky films, you know exactly what I'm talking about. James and Mae are a pretty clear image of Rocky and Adrian, which could easily bring the movie down, if not set in such a specific time period as the Depression was.Speaking of the Rocky films, James' final opponent, Max Baer, reminded me of Ivan Drago, from Rocky IV. Both men were known for killing opponents in the ring, and being very strong, yet the protagonist still insists on fighting them. The last two points could easily be summarized by the ""boxing movie"" cliché. This cliché is abundant through all boxing films, not just this one. It is easily recognizable in other movies, such as The Fighter, Raging Bull, or Southpaw. This, however, can be excused by the difficulty to differentiate themselves from other boxing films.So, overall, my main problem with the film is it's obvious cliché, yet I liked almost everything else about the movie. I think Cinderella Man should receive a B, or an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great!,"This was the word that exit from my lips when I finished showing ""Cinderella Man"".

Love in the worst situations, love when they haven't milk, when they haven't light. But there is a light more powerful than the material light: the light of the heart.The story of Jimmy Braddock is the story of the power of love.

Courage.,"This is one of those movies that is very strong from beginning to end. It has such strong characters and relationships, that even if they aren't perfect, you feel for them and what they are doing to get through their struggles between the great depression, work, family, and pride. Sports movies can be hit or miss, for the sport itself it really has to build on the tension, the stakes, and the framework; this movie is excellent in all departments of it. There are moments in this movie where there's that sense of hopelessness, like you're really there with them at that time. But that human drive to continue to care for your family and keep your life on track is something that is relatable even to the people of today. The family was a very strong point in this movie, and part of the moral compass of our main character. They are like his guiding light. There are definitely those unlikable characters in this movie that they do so well with making us hate, and we root for the ones we have been following all along. Overall, I thought the camerawork in this movie was very good, and all of the actors did a great job portraying these characters, even if there were exaggerations from reality. I also think the casting choices were very good, and looked pretty similar to the real life counterparts. A very enjoyable, encouraging watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Maybe Greatest Sports Movie Since Rocky,"I cannot believe this movie is not grossing more than what is listed on IMDb, especially considering the rating that it is carrying.I am from the Notre Dame area and so very partial to ""Rudy"". Therefore discarding my love of that movie (since most would not be so sentimental about Notre Dame as I) this is the best sports movie I can recall seeing since Rocky. I am sure I have not seen every sports movie since Rocky, but surely I have seen most of the great ones.Perhaps this movie seems so wonderful because it is based on a true story. They did a great job of putting the viewer in the depression without depressing us all too much. This is a story about a family that suffers and perseveres through that era. I doubt most of us today would have remained married let alone persevered through such financial hardship.I thought perhaps the music could have been much better to enhance the movie, but maybe it would have distracted us from the reality of it. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 was because I wondered if the music could have been better.There is some language in this, especially misuse of the Lord's name etc.. but not too much cursing; there is no inappropriate sexual content that I recall.When this comes out on DVD we will show it to our children, and use it to discuss not only boxing and its dangers, but also the depression era. If you have a TV Guardian in your DVD player this movie should be totally suitable for even young children to watch with you. A great movie about a man trying to provide for his family during very difficult times; a man who is even humble enough to ask for help when he really needs it. And we could all learn a lesson from that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Second best boxing movie, ever!","Falling just behind Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull,"" ""Cinderella Man"" is a magnificent masterpiece accurately depicting the life of Jim Braddock, the story of a man who was on top of the boxing world, fell to the Depression, and was able to build himself up to fight again for his family and his friends. Ron Howard did an extraordinary job of portraying Braddock's life and the Great Depression. Using unique and new camera angles that show not only the boxer's perspective of the fight, but also those of the audience, Howard made the film seem very neat and always kept you watching and wondering what was going to happen next. He also used much of that new amateur-like style of filming with the camera, making the shots unsteady and trembling to build up tension in the audience, almost as if the camera itself is an audience member trying to see the fight and what the opponents are doing when in their corners. And although much of the film's fight scenes are greatly inspired and ""copied"" off of ""Raging Bull,"" Howard was able to make them seem new and different with the incorporation technology and his own filming style.Russell Crowe, after watching this movie, is one of the few great actors we have left who knows how to choose a good movie and make the character seem real. His portrayal of Jim Braddock is no different. Once in the depression, the audience is supposed to truly feel bad for him as he tries to survive without money and a job. Crowe does this very well and is able to look the part as well, much like he did in ""A Beautiful Mind"" in some scenes. He then further builds on his performance when in the ring, appearing exhausted at times, and strong at others. He also appears much like any other normal man who knows what he has to do and how he has to do it. Paul Giamatti plays Braddock's trainer and manager, Joe Gould, and does a fabulous job doing it. At times he is the ""comic relief,"" being able to take a crappy situation and make it funny. But, he is then able to take that attitude and push it aside as he becomes worried or anxious when Braddock is in the ring, knowing it is his fault if anything happens. Renee Zellweger also does a good job portraying Jim Braddock's wife, Mae. Although not as good as Crowe, she does a wonderful job making the audience feel her pain as she is concerned before and after every fight for Braddock's health. One also feels her pain when she tries to bring up her family in the middle of the Depression with no money and a very small house, relying on her husband to hopefully get some work and bring home some money. One final note on performances, Craig Bierko plays Max Baer, the heavyweight champion Braddock has to face in 1935, and does a good job doing it. He is just the guy you love to hate as you watch the movie and is very creepy and evil like.All in all, ""Cinderella Man"" is an awesome movie that everyone should see before they die, regardless of if they like boxing or not. It is a film that accurately portrays the life of one of America's greatest men who brought inspiration and hope to those who had nothing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
No Academy Award?,"This film didn't get a nod for the Academy Award in 2005. The reason, many reasons, but I might sum up Liberal Hollywood's aversion to a conservative manly man, succeeding against all odds in a tough world isn't the same as two less manly men, Truman Capote, race obsessed cops, or an effeminate Transsexual whining about a tough world run by gasp, Bush!!!! Those warm sepia toned 1930's are recreated for us by Ron Howard. Not much fun starving to death is there? Yet Crowe's Braddock, an injured fighter working the docks to support his family, he doesn't cry. He does what he has to do without stealing or sniveling. He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks. He is a beacon of light for his hungry family. This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.Forget Rocky, CM has the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Sure, they are choreographed, but who cares. We really hated Max Baer and Braddock handles the fool, no prob. Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron Howard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Russell Crowe and Ron Howard win on points.,"I'm not a fan of boxing, and I'm certainly not an admirer of Russell Crowe - but ""Cinderella Man"" may well be Ron Howard's best movie since ""Apollo 13"" (I've yet to see ""A Beautiful Mind,"" but since Akiva Goldsman is the primary writer on that, I'm not holding my breath), and a rare sports movie that even I like.At heart it's a feelgood movie, but the kind that reviewers can like without feeling guilty - no actual gloss, plenty of grit, and no cheating. Done with skill and care by the director and writers Cliff Hollingsworth and Goldsman, the story of boxer Jim Braddock's early promise and his toils through the Depression may wear its bid for Oscar glory a bit too obviously sometimes, but with Crowe as Braddock, the excellent Paul Giamatti as his trainer, Renee Zellweger as his wife and the rest of the cast on top form, you just don't notice enough for it to matter.The boxing scenes are far from ""Rocky""-type showbiz, though for some reason Braddock's fight against Lasky seems a bit more dramatic than his climax against Max Baer; but the best thing about the movie is that it would be just as gripping even without the violence (witness the second scene where he goes to the relief office). A few of the relationships are a bit sketchy - certainly that with his best friend could have been dealt with a bit more - but ultimately the movie keeps you going right up to the finish.I'm finding it a lot easier to write about bad movies than good ones, so I'll just say that in spite of it not having Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, ""Cinderella Man"" is a genuine million dollar baby.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Ballerina boy,"Cinderella Man is a great movie set in the Great Depression and shows the differences of a man's success before the Great Depression and after. It shows the struggles normal families went through such as finding paying jobs, rationing food, and even sometimes having to send family members away. While it shows all these struggles it also has a story of a boxer which makes the movie exciting and high action. Without the story of his boxing career the movie would just be another Great Depression movie with an awful storyline but the way the movie is set up creates the perfect story that keeps the audience entertained while teaching what it is like to be in the midst of an economic disaster. If they didn't use boxing it probably wouldn't have been as interesting as if they used a different sport like soccer or baseball it wouldn't have made the movie as entertaining. The use of boxing makes the movie perfectly balanced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Sleeping Gem,This is brilliant movie - Not since Raging Bull has there been a film that takes you on a an emotionally charged roller coaster as this one. Itdemonstrates the human spirit and determination of a man who endures physical and mental hardship to become one of the greatest fighters. This a gem of a movie and easily rates alongside Raging Bull with fight scenes that make you wince. The other stars are equally superb and how this film missed out on Oscars I have no idea it is criminal that it was overlooked and more criminal if you miss a piece of movie brilliance. You will definitely not be disappointed it was like watching the rags and riches story of Rocky only it is a true story and the acting is top drawer. Russel Crowe does the character of Jim Braddock great credit and Ron Howard does a great job in making you feel that you were there with the hardships of the depression and the feeling of hope and this film fills you with every kind of emotion from start to finish - it is simply a gem.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

One of if not the greatest boxing biopic .,James J. Braddock was in the mid to late 20's a very gifted Light heavyweight. Braddock chased the Light heavy title and never got it. By 1928 Braddock owned a taxi cab company was well invested in the stock market and was considered rich. Then the stock market crash hit and Braddock lost his money and his company and bad luck stalked him. From 1930 until roughly 1933 Braddock suffered a run of bad luck that almost broke him. Braddock's fighting career almost came to a halt when he broke his right hand more then once and suffered career ending defeats. by the time 1933 came Braddock like many others struggled to find work and found it on the docks. With his boxing career basically over And Work hard to find Braddock held onto his pride and refused to go on government relief. There are others worse off he often said. By the end of 33 Braddock was broken to the point where he had no choice but to go on Government relief and Braddock swore to pay them back. Soon after Braddock was given a match a last minute replacement match against Corn Griffin a top ranked contender for the heavyweight Championship. Braddock surprised himself and everyone else by winning. This led to other fights which Braddock won. By then the people of America saw their struggle in Braddock and embraced him. Braddock became Their Champion. When Braddock finally got a shot at the Heavyweight Championship against Max Baer. The match was a clash of the titans. In one corner the everyman and in the other the Champion of the world the rich man's Champion. Baer was a killer in the ring and a Clown. but he was as serious a threat as a bullet from a gun. Braddock entered the underdog and no one gave him a chance. Then James J. Braddock made history by knocking out Max Baer for the Title. True to his vow Braddock paid back the relief money. And held on to the Championship for two years until he lost it to Joe Louis .Ron Howard's Telling of the Braddock Legend is an excellent example of how to tell a story. First off Russell Crowe captures the shy nature of Braddock a honest man caught in try times that made good people Evil. that is driven home when you see the conditions in which they live . And when his oldest child steals to put food on the table and Braddock makes him return the meat. That is the finest scene in the movie. The acting is so pure and you are caught up in it . The Struggles they face and the bravery they had to have. The movie itself is a time machine that lets us peer into a window and see just how terrible the depression was and how it killed people in one way or the other. And how one man gave them hope and became their Champion.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good movie with a bad timing and early release,"There's a curse that every year an inspiration movie from a true event needs to come and touch our hearts.Here's the next movie: Cinderella Man.Russell Crowe plays James Braddock, a champion boxer who does what he can to make ends meet on the side where every night he wins the fights to provide for his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and children. Years later when the depression hits, James and the family falls through the riches to rags era where James can't even find work while their bills are overdue, their power is shut off, and even to a point one of the kids goes far in stealing food fearing that he'll be taken away if his parents can't provide for him and his siblings.The Braddocks go through rough times until James former promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gives his old client another chance where the boxer is back on his feet after winning a fight. The money is back where James can put food on the table with Mae fearing for her life that if anything were to happen to her husband, what would happen to her? Who would provide for her kids? Just like most movies, there's the rival. (Note: This was one of the elements that was part of Cinderella Man's downfall) The rival is Max Baer (Craig Bierko), an undefeated championship who has killed his opponents in the ring where not only does James have to fight him but the publicity grows high leaving people to root for the underdog.""Cinderella Man"" is a good effort from director Ron Howard while the performances from Crowe and Zellweger are strong and Paul Giamatti is the show stealer who deserved the nomination for best supporting actor showing that he's a dynamite actor.Despite the fact that the film is loaded with good actors and a famous director, the downfall for this good epic was the fact that this movie was released too early for Oscar contenders in the summer of 2005 just three months after Clint Eastwood's epic ""Million Dollar Baby"" snag home the top award for best picture along with director and the acting awards (Actress, best supporting actor), including Crowe's brawl with a hotel manager along with other stuff.No matter, I still enjoyed this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Touching..,"While some may say that this film is more depressing, than anything else, I found it uplifting. It's the struggle of one poor family in the 1930's during the Great Depression, trying to find hope through one man's dreams.Based on true events, the story of James (Crowe), circles around his family; his wife and three small children, during tough times in American economy. His dream is to be able to box, and while having broken his hand earlier on in the story, and find scarce work, it seems as though his hope for his family's lives and his own, is barely worth holding on to. But, through the help of a friend, and a lot of belief in himself, tragedy turns into fairy tale, and the rest is the making of an amazing film and true story.Renee Zellwiger was great as usual, and Paul Giamanti was terrific as well, as he always is in character-driven roles such as these. And, although I'm not a Russel Crowe fan, I was very impressed with his work in this film. He was very real, and his accent was amazing for an Australian.During the whole movie, it sort of reminded me in the tiniest way of 'Far and Away' the early 1990's movie with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, and it came as no surprise why, when the credits ran at the end of this picture, that it had been a Ron Howard film, who also did 'Away'. It had the same feel and appearance and sort of the same theme (boxing) as the other film had.I found the whole movie to be quite enjoyable and well told. I recommend it to anyone over fourteen, for the strong violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Film Phenomenon!!!,"I just want to say first off that Ron Howard is an incredible director and movies like this prove it. Even before I saw the film I had a feeling that it was going to be a real winner. I was right. This is Ron Howards finest moment in filming. Also, this is (in my opinion) Russell Crowe's best performance. The sincerity of this film is unreal and part of that is due to the fact this film is based on a true story. Movies like this are what inspire me to get into the filming industry. From the moment this film starts till the moment it ends, it's like the movie just wraps it's arms up around you and pulls you into the story and makes you a part of it.

The touching story makes you ache for those that suffered through the great depression while the final fight leaves you tensed at the edge of your seat.Russell Crowe puts forth another Oscar worthy performance while Renee Zellweger exhibits why she is currently one of the hottest stars in Hollywood. However, the unexpected surprise is Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Jim Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould, which is more than on par with the two Tinseltown heavyweights and may even getting him an Oscar nod.There are few movies that provoke an audience to holler and applause and Cinderella Man does that and more and when the viewers did, for once it didn't irritate me.A must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

One of the greater boxing movies! Please don't miss it.,Russel Crowe was outstanding. He really brought this character to life. The visual look at how far this family fell during the depression was incredible. We today have no idea what our parents & grandparents went through. Ron Howard really brought this to home with the lines outside the shipyards & the lines waiting to get go on the dole. Excellent job! The only thing I was disappointed in was Renee. She looked a bit too Roxie Heart to me. In the beginning that was all I could see & hear. She made me think of that character. I did think however that she & Russell have good chemistry together. I however was more focused on his character throughout the film. I also was impressed with the kids. They did a great job playing off the parents. I believe Russell as the parent more than Renee.I also was very impressed with Paul Giamatti's character. He played the rich hustler/promoter very well. It was a shock to find that he was essentially as poor as the Braddocks. You could tell he really believed in Braddock.Bruce McGill was very compelling as the rich promoter. He played the jerk very well.My favorite part in the film was when Braddock went to Johnston & the rest of the rich promoters begging for money to put the electricity back on. It really showed the lack of empathy on the part of the people who had against the people who didn't.The only other part I was unsure of was the Max Baer character. Was he really so brash & mean? I kind of looked at this as the way boxers are. Look at the way Mahommad Ali & Mike Tyson have acted when trying to promote fights.Good film - great fight - great suspense.....,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Nutshell Review: Cinderella Man,"""In all the history of the boxing game, you'll find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J. Braddock."" - Damon Runyon (1936) Yet another boxing movie on the heels of Ali and Million Dollar Baby you might add? Yes, and agreeing with Runyon, this movie, director Ron Hward's second collaboration with Russell Crowe (the first being A Beautiful Mind), about the Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock packs a wallop like Ali and brings on some sniffles like Baby.James Braddock is on track to take a shot at the heavyweight boxing title, living the life with his family of 3 kids, until the Great Depression sets in. Braddock too was affected after poor investment calls, and hence join the millions who are jobless and penniless. Given a second chance by Fate to re-enter the boxing arena, he finds himself back into a sport which had forgotten him, and is determined to succeed in order to sustain his family through the Depression. He isn't boxing for himself, for fame and glory, but more so to bring back the bacon for his hungry children.I haven't seen many dramatic films set during the Great Depression, and this meshing of boxing and drama set against that background worked extremely well, with its majestic sets. Family is important to Jim, and he goes to great pains to ensure his family is able to stay together during these turbulent times. Personifying Hope, he's the working class' underdog hero, during a time when the very rich were still living it off comfortably.The transition style used, though not new, are well executed, like the mirror cum dressing table scene from pre-Depression to Depression era, and the transition from match to match using overhead shots. The boxing action sequences are extremely well choreographed, and you'll feel every urge to get up and shadow box alongside Jim as well. Every hit in the cheeks, in the chest, smack on the kisser, at times slow down to a photographic moment, complete with old fashioned camera flashes. Unlike Million Dollar Baby's bailing of the sport to end with euthanasia, this one is boxing out and out, right until the gruelling 15 round finale with champ Max Baer.Much is said about Russell Crowe's performance as Jim Braddock, and I'd say he deserved the praises. Ranging as the tough as nails fighter in the ring, to tender loving husband and father, his role as Jim allowed him to showcase his acting chops yet again. He has a charismatic screen presence, be it general-turned-gladiator, or schizophrenic genius, he never fails to draw the audience into his role. Renee Zellweger was cast in a safe role as Jim's dutiful wife Mae, looking after the household as Jim seeked dough, always backing and supporting her husband, yet always worrying about his injuries, or worse, death. Put both of them together, and you'll see a lovely couple who sticks with each other through good times and bad.But the surprise scene stealer was Paul Giamatti (Sideways' Miles) as Jim's manager Joe Gould, the ever encouraging, ever opportunity seeker and chief adviser of Jim's gameplay. In one particularly moving scene, he explained the need for keeping up appearances, and staked almost everything he had to back their boxing comeback. And EPL Soccer Man Utd fans, is it just me, or does Max Baer (Craig Bierko), the heavyweight champ in the final fight, resemble Ruud Van Nistelrooy from certain angles (attitude too)? Amongst the slew of releases this week, Cinderella Man ranks as number One on the ""To-Watch"" list. Some might criticise the lack of sophistication in telling a Hollywood tale, but it is precisely this familiarity which allows you to connect. Does this movie scream Oscar? Probably, but given boxing cousin Million Dollar Baby snagging most of the previous awards, Cinderella Man might be in for a tough fight to convince voters. Nonetheless, it's highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Not bad, could be better","Cinderella Man did a good job of defying expectations. First and foremost, it delivered a surprisingly endearing performance from Russell Crowe. He is one of those actors that I struggle with because I'm not convinced he's a very good actor. I often wonder if he has any talent at all, and sometimes suspect that his constant journey to conceal his native accent takes all his concentration so he has nothing left for emoting. Yet here, he did a decent job of playing this boxer who is fighting for a career and to support his family. The other surprise that Cinderella Man delivered was making me care about boxing again. This isn't a sport I like, and it seems like every time I sit down to one of these movies I'm always convinced I won't like it because the sport is so stupid. Yet, there is a compelling nature to watching one man going head to head with another that locks me in despite my better judgement. It is a rather cinematic sport, and has the kind of risk factor that can keep an audience on the edge of their seat.That's not to say Cinderella Man was a perfect film, or even the best boxing film. I'd say there are a few movies in the Rocky franchise that outclass this one, even though this is based on reality. One of my struggles with this movie is that it lays on the cliche rather aggressively. It was hard for me to get deeply emotional, because the movie felt manipulative rather than truly affecting. I still wanted to see the good guy come out on top, but the way they played up the villain was excessive. I also find, with all boxing movies, that one of the challenges is making the action look realistic. We all know the two actors aren't really trading blows and busting each other's faces. That means you need a great combination of director, cinematographer, and fight choreographer to make it all look natural and authentic. Sadly, I often saw the seams in Cinderella Man, and sensed that it was all staged. Many of the blows didn't feel like they landed, and certainly not with the strength shown by the one getting hit. Despite this, I still enjoyed my time with Cinderella Man, and was fully entertained (even though I could see places where it could have been better.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Gripping Story,"If you've ever heard people who grew up in the nineteen-thirties talk about hardships they either endured or witnessed, you'll notice that Cinderella MAN deals realistically with that era. Russell Crowe was born to act. Zellwegger does very well in the always-thankless role of a sports hero's wife. Jimmy Braddock's situation is compelling and the story moves along. The boxing scenes are very suspenseful. Paul Giamatti is the heart of the movie, perhaps. He's got a sense of pathos. This is an evenhanded movie with shades of ROCKY, ON THE WATERFRONT and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Clint Howard is a perfect referee. Running commentary by a radio reporter during the boxing matches helps evoke the era. It's an involving, diverting and thoughtful movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Familiar story, but entertaining nevertheless","Cinderella Man has a sentiment that has you rooting for the long shot and live his dream with him, even though the theme of a has-been or underdog given a second chance to prove himself has been adopted numerous times in sports stories.What struck me most was the parallels to the fictional Rocky story; even some of the boxing choreography looks the same. Of course, that may be unavoidable; there's only so many variations on a boxing match available--the sport by its nature is fairly predictable. However, this time the story is based on a real person, and the film is adept at making that person real up there on the screen. Jim Braddock, an apparent has-been boxer, gets back in the ring again due to an act of fate, and makes good with the opportunity. He was a symbol of hope for the little guy during the Depression, having been on some of those bread lines himself.Russel Crowe is excellent as Braddock. You see every thought of the man, told through some clever filtered shots. I love one shot of Paul Giamatti (who is great, too), as his manager, getting in his face, shouting and screaming to him to kill the guy. (It reminded me of those Twilight Zone shots where someone is losing their sanity, and other characters are taunting them.) My favorite in the supporting cast was Rene Zellweger, who is wonderful as Braddock's wife. She matched the wonderful job of Talia Shire as Rocky's girl--the same touchingly real terror that her man could very easily get his head bashed in at any second. Craig Beirko as Max Baer, the champion, is excellent in his nasty rival persona, although I think they took some artistic license on Baer's true character, to evoke more rooting for Braddock as the ""good guy.""

Cinderella Man Movie Review,"I found this movie to be very bittersweet. This film wasn't just about boxing, it is about a man and his wife trying to raise their family through really tough times during the 1920s. From what I know about the Great Depression, this movie portrayed the time period very well. Having to see the struggles that Jim Braddock and his wife were faced with and what they did in order to handle it said a lot about their characters. It was also really inspiring to see the example Jim set for his children during those times. He taught them to never give up and to work hard for everything. Braddock showed us what a classic American hero looks like and this movie summed up his story in a beautiful way.

Very Good Movie,"Great performance by Crowe, almost as good as his performance in ""A Brilliant Mind"" for which he should have received the best actor Oscar.If there is any justice in the world, he should get an Academy Award for this performance.If nothing else a good old fashioned ""against the odds"" type of movie, without being boring, repetitive or corny.Being set in the depression era, it was not too far off base with shots of the life people lived at the time, but perhaps was a bit sanitised as the version of the movie I saw was on-board an aeroplane. That being said the fact that it impressed me so much, and that I enjoyed it so much when watching it on the aeroplane makes me want to wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it again. Not many movies can have that influence on me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
will do down as the greatest movie viewers will never see,"The cell phone throwing Russell Crowe plays the underdog and lovable James J. Braddock, a boxer who is hit hard financially and emotionally by the great depression in Cinderella Man. The always brilliant Paul Giamatti (who is most deserving of a best supporting actor nod come awards season) plays Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould. Renee Zellweger is just as impressive as Mae Braddock, the strong-willed wife and mother. Ron Howard successfully directs this riches to rags story of the Braddock family, who once lived with luxury in a beautiful home, now scrap for food and heat as tenants of an awful ""apartment."" With the success of such boxing flicks as Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man struck me as very unique due to the underlying story of a family binding together to survive in very dangerous times. I would say only about one-third of this film is dedicated to boxing, the rest following the character's long battle with poverty (not to take away from the visually grueling boxing matches).I've said this since its release in June of 2005, this films only mistake is not waiting until the fall and winter months for its release. It will get some love come awards season, but will do down as the greatest movie viewers will never see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Better Everytime,"Like most Ron Howard directed Films, Cinderella Man is Easy to Watch again and again.

Great Movie,"I must say, I was anticipating this movie very much. This movie was quite simply brilliant. It captivated me from the very start, emotionally as well as spiritually as it portrayed the perseverance of the human heart. This movie will leave you breathless and trust me, u want to see it in the theater. Don't wait until the DVD comes out. If u do, u will be missing out. Russel Crowe puts on a performance that is second to none in this fine piece of art that will undoubtedly acclaim some sort of award in the future. It may seem that Crowe is on a real hot streak, as he further cements his Hollywood ""a-list"" status with yet another gripping yet harrowing tale of a man's passion.I don't want to give anything away about this movie, however I can say that this movie is not predictable at all, well maybe a little if you don't watch a lot of movies. But if you are a seasoned buff the things that you have become accustomed to seeing in these sorts of films is totally twisted away.The only gripe I have about this film is that at the end they should've showed a photo of the real life man him self with a date of birth to death. Other than that none at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Two-thirds of a near-great movie,"This is the kind of big, populist entertainment that just screams 'Oscar'. The only problem with ""Cinderella Man"" is that it hasn't done the kind of business at the box-office that Oscar seems to demand and has, therefore, been relegated to the sidelines. And yet, of all Ron Howard's films it may be the best thing he's done to date, (he doesn't have much of a pedigree, I admit). OK, ditch all the scenes with the wife, (a game, but monstrously underused Renee Zellweger) and kids and scrap the scenes with an equally underused Paddy Considine, which seem to belong to a different picture entirely and what you are left with is one hell of a great fight picture, magnificently shot (by Salvatore Totino) and edited (by Daniel Henlay and Mike Hill).Howard may be a shameless charlatan who messes with our emotions but he is a great showman and in the fight scenes he pushes all the right buttons. You may hate yourself in the morning but this is the kind of triumphalist entertainment that could bring an audience to its feet. It's the story of James Braddock, an outsider who became World Heavyweight Champion in 1935 after defeating Max Baer. But Braddock wasn't just an outsider; he was the personification of everything that is decent and good about the human race. Laid low, he goes on Welfare. Back on his feet again, he gives the welfare money back. Any resemblance to a certain man from Nazareth is purely intentional.Given Howard's penchant for this kind of gross sentimentality it ought not to work at all. But it does, and in spades, largely due to two terrific performances. As Braddock, Russell Crowe has never been better. He is, of course, wonderful in the ring and, no pun intended, he doesn't pull any punches but it is in the potentially mawkish moments away from the ring that he totally transforms the material and makes us believe in Braddock. One of the film's best scenes has him begging, quite literally cap in hand, for handouts from the boxing fraternity. And as his manager the great Paul Giametti gives an Oscar-worthy performance. He is like a cross between Bambi and a pit-bull terrier and his scenes at the ringside are electrifying. So what we have here is about two-thirds of a near-great movie and for that I am willing to forgive Ron Howard just about anything.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
When formula rises far and above the norm.,"It's not like there haven't already been any boxing movies (Million Dollar Baby), or Depression era ""underdog sports icon gives hope to the common man"" movies (Seabiscuit) done in the last couple years. Even Russell Crowe seemed at times to be retreading his role from Gladiator, the former hero who meets misfortune but rises back up against the odds. But although Cinderalla Man doesn't bring any new themes to the screen, and yes, is a little on the formulaic side, somehow it does everything so -right- that it's easily one of the top films of the year.Crowe, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti form a triumvirate of strong performances, each complementing the other and not one overacting his or her role. Some superb directing and camera-work led to the most intense fight scenes I've ever seen in a movie about boxing, as well as memorable moments outside of the ring (my favorites include a clever bit of bait-and-switch perspective at Joe's apartment, and a priceless shot when Jimmy teaches his young daughter how to punch him in the head).The period sets are beautifully crafted and believable, to the point where you can almost taste the hunger and desperation felt by all but the wealthiest. There's also something to be said about the value of understatement, of which Cinderella Man does a very good job; the story moves along from scene to scene without coddling the audience by showing everything, and as a result never drags or has a dull moment.In a couple small spots, formula rears its head - most noticeably the ""time to get in shape"" training montage seen in just about every sports movie in existence - but luckily the quality of direction, acting, and production value is enough to set this one apart from average fare. A masterful setup going into the third act gives you a very real sense of fear and uncertainty right before that final fight everyone knows is coming; all but the most jaded film viewers are guaranteed to be on edge because by this time, you'll genuinely care about Jim's survival.With so many things done well, I can think of very little that needs to be changed. Top-notch material all around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Greatest movie of all time!,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. It is that damn good.The acting is great, the story is incredible, and anyone who has ever faced hardship will relate to this movie. Don't skip this movie if you're a young couple or young parents starting out on your own. This movie embodies fighting for what you want, and taking care of what matters most, your family.Congrats to Ron Howard and the cast for such a magnificent movie! Worth every penny!Get. This. Movie.

top movie of 2005,"""Cinderella Man"", rated PG-13, is a solid four and a half ""popcorns"". The 2005 drama, is brought to the big screen by the award winning director Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, EDtv, The Missing). With the outstanding performances of the trio: Russell Crow, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti, Howard brought yet another story to the big screen, loaded it with both tear-jerking and heart-swelling moments; packed it with honorable leading characters, and artistically conveyed good morals.I took my 16 year old friend, 18 and 13 year old sisters, along with my 14 year old brother to see ""Cinderella Man"". We all loved it. In our opinion it is the best movie of the year. Ron Howard brought a great story of perseverance, romance, drama, and action to moviegoers in ""Cinderella Man"". This movie has great morals for all ages as it teaches you to never give up and keep pressing forward. It inspires men to be strong fathers and husbands no matter what happens and to teach their children right from wrong. The scene where Jim's son returns the stolen food also teaches people to be honest and that they should work for what they need. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody over 10 years old. Parents this is a boxing movie so the violence may be too intense in spots for younger viewers. There is some profanity in this movie that was not needed, however, there wasn't the use of the F-word in this movie like most of your PG-13 movies.The ""Cinderella Man"" is a wonderful true story of a professional boxer, James J. Braddock (Russell Crow). Not only was he a great boxer, he was also an admirable father and husband dedicated to keeping his wife ( Renée Zellweger) and their three children together during the Great Depression. Over-due bills, electricity out and with only five dollars to his name, ""The Bulldog of Bergen"" has all but lost his boxing bite and is scrambling for work alongside 15 million other unemployed Americans. Finally after a long time of despair, a little light shines though the darkness when Jim's boxing manager, Joe Gould( Paul Giamatti), shows up out of the blue with a proposition. It turns out that the number two heavyweight in the world needs a last minute replacement to fight for $250. The fact that Jim has never been knocked out makes him an attractive story line. Sporting makeshift gloves and a fighter's robe with the wrong name on it, Jim is simply expected to show up, take a few hits and collect his paycheck. But the unexpected happens... Jim KO's his opponent! Jim now has new life breathed into his previously dismal existence, another chance. One victory leads to another ... and another and another ... until Jim has suddenly rekindled hope among the down-and-out Irish-American community rallying around its newfound underdog hero. Jim, now dubbed the ""Cinderella Man,"" is lined up to fight the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, Max Baer( Craig Bierko), an arrogant giant who has already killed two men in the ring.Again not like your average PG-13 or PG movie, ""Cinderella Man"" has absolutely no sexual content. Men are shown smoking in some scenes. Parents this is one of the cleanest movies out there. It's powerful in its portrayal of life. ""Cinderella Man"" is as powerful as its hero's punches.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Movie.,"This is hands down one of the best movies ever made and I will die on that hill.Rocky wishes it was this movie.I am rarely invested in a story. But by the end of this movie I was on edge of my seat. I had laughed, I had cried, I had felt every concealable human emotion. I will watch this movie every day til I die.All jokes aside this is an amazing movie that tells the story of James J. Braddock perfectly. I really enjoyed it more on a second viewing and was seriously so anxious for the ending.I recommend this movie to literally everyone. EVERYONE.

"As of late November, the Best Picture of the Year","Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger & Paul Giamatti all give Oscar caliber performances in this film based on the true story of Jim Braddock. Crowe's performance is his best since ""The Insider"". Zellweger's Mae is loving and warm and the chemistry between she and Crowe is palpable on screen. Giamatti should get (& hopefully receive) a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Braddock's agent, who bends over backwards to help his fighter support his family through the Depression. I did find some of the boxing scenes to be a bit brutal, but I think it was because I quickly became emotionally invested in all the characters in this film. Other than that, this is a beautifully filmed, wonderfully directed, honest and heart-wrenching movie that has Best Film written all over it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Good movie, but let's be honest, it belongs nowhere near the top 250","This was a good sports movie, I'll admit that I really enjoyed it, but I also sadly have to conclude, after seeing it's extremely high rating on IMDb, that it's a bit overrated. It is a good film with some solid acting performances, but it is not as excellent as other sports or boxing films such as Rocky or Raging Bull. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it's honestly a bit too formulaic and cliched to warrant such a high rating. It's a very likable boxing movie, but it is also filled with blatant schmaltz and unabashed sentimentality. I'd say it deserves more like 7.0-7.1 in my opinion than an 8.0.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Life of James J. Braddock,"The movie has the mood of a classic due to the times it depicts and the beautiful cinematography. It has generally a very nice narrative but there are some overdramatization in places. The performance of Russell Crowe is above average, although not the greatest I have seen. Some of the supporting cast like Paul Giamatti was also fun to watch. Overall, I recommend it for boxing fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Magnificent Film, with one unconscionable failure","This film was so absorbing, so believable, with every moment and relationship depicted with a sense of truth, that I was motivated to go on Wikipedia to see how close it was to reality.I stopped the video at one point when Jim was having a heart to heart talk with his wife, stepping out to the sidewalk so the kids wouldn't overhear it. I went back to listen again to the distant sound of a dog barking, ever so faintly. Few were aware of this and you can't stop a film in a theatre, but this exemplified the multitude of touches that was everywhere.No throwaway scenes or conversations that didn't advance the characters and the story. In my research I noted that most everything was as is happened, all except this, which is the depiction of Max Baer, who he fought for the heavyweight title.It wasn't that they were just opponents, but beyond the inherent violence in boxing, he was depicted as egregiously vicious, gaining pleasure not just winning but destroying his opponents, on and off the ring. So, in reading about him, I discovered this was not the man at all. He courageously wore a Star of David on his trunks, since he was a quarter Jewish, as an personal statement to the Nazis in Germany and the America of that time. He did cause the death of two of his opponents, but suffered great emotional pain, and did what he could for the families.The turning of him into a caricature of evil personified, didn't even add to the quality of the film, as in retrospect he should have been depicted as the full human being, that was so well done for the rest of the cast.Max Baer has descendants who don't need to have their forebear defamed, for no reason at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Great Film!,"Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" should rank among the best films for this year's awards. This movie, in addition to being entertaining and engrossing, is truly a work of art! Howard's directorial skills continue to improve with each and every effort. And, even though there are graphically-violent scenes in the boxing ring, this is a family film which can be appreciated by the young and old alike. My wife and I agree that ""Cinderella Man"" is among the best motion pictures we've seen over the past several years. Everything in the film... the camera work, and its unique angles... the sepia tone which emphasizes the period it represents; that of the national depression of the 1930s... the music... and the positive messages conveyed throughout the story... GREAT JOB, RON HOWARD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
