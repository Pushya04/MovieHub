One of the best martial art films of this decade,"Excellent direction, photography and set design enliven this account of Wing Chun instructor Yip Man's life before he moved to Hong Kong. Every Wing Chun instructor today tries to make a lineage connection to Yip Man to legitimize their teaching so he is a very important figure in Kung Fu. Donnie Yen portrays the master with intense reserve and is possibly the best acting in his career. It surprised me for sure.The story line of this film is invented as historical accounts show Yip Man to have been a police officer in the time frame this film covers, not staying at home and only practicing kung fu as depicted here. Also the film claims that he refused to teach anybody but that is also not true. He left for Hong Kong a few years after WW2 not in the middle of it as this film presents. The plot with the Japanese army seems invented although they did ask him to teach the troops which he refused.However the film muddies up the historical record, that is not to say it isn't a great film. Sammo Hung's choreography is exceptional and a throwback to his great kung fu films of the early 1980's. The martial arts are done with great respect to traditional styles although some wire work is used to assist the actors with the difficult acrobatic moves. No flying across the room in this film.Although the ending is a little abrupt, this is one kung fu film that can be recommended to people who don't like these films. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerhouse performance by Donnie Yen,"Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine, although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man (or Ye Wen, as they were shouting in the seats next to mine) he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side, carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas, at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again, moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.I'm not going to delve deeper into plot details. The basic stuff is already outlined above, and I also feel the historical accuracy of certain events depicted can be debated. That's a bit of a moot point, though, since most people will watch this for the action scenes. Nobody will be disappointed. Donnie kicks twelve kinds of ass in this movie, and it is all accompanied by some of the meanest sound design I've ever heard. Every one of his rapid punches can be felt as he pummels the poor bastards in his way with the Ip Man-style of martial arts (imdb won't let me spell out the name for some reason). The final bout is epic,but for me it was one scene about halfway through that got my heart beating faster. It involves Donnie, ten Japanese karate practitioners and some of the most furious fighting I've ever seen on screen. You can really sense the anger of his character in this scene. Great stuff.The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. It totally lacks the vintage over-the-top-aesthetics of Donnie Yen's films of the 80's and 90's, but for some people that's a good thing. I personally think this is his finest performance to date.Highly recommended for fans of martial arts cinema!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Donnie Yuen finally gets the spotlight he always deserves,"Ip Man has quenched our thirst of a real good martial art movie where we don't just watch man kicking asses but where we can appreciate the man's moral and virtues.The movie flows well, from the view of the kungfu street of Fo Shan, to the introduction of Ip Man, and so on. Scene by scene are there in a well done play, and when someone had to display martial art act, they don't just throw bunch of minions out from nowhere to have him beating them all over. I think the scenario is well written.Fight choreography is great. Different approach from what we usually see, people doing flashy flying kicks and sorts; since it is about wing chun, feet hardly ever leave the ground but it doesn't decrease the beauty and flashiness of the fights.People may complain about bits that might not fit the real condition of those era. Well, I think producers have to make sure they made entertaining movies, not documentaries.Last words, Donnie Yuen has always been a good martial art actor, he just never get the spotlight. And finally as Ip Man he gets to stand on where he deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Energetic & brilliant HK action drama,"This is Donnie Yen's best acting piece for awhile now, and he still delivers the action sequences brilliantly. At 44 years of age, he looks so energetic, confident and charismatic. I believe the combination of Yen, Sammo Hung and Wilson Yip is the right choice for this particular film and fighting style. Wing Chun is best depicted without the flamboyant ballet of acrobatics often seen in other wushu films.The movie doesn't dwell on historical accuracy, but rather use that settings to set the mood, deliver the message and simply tells you the life journey of a Grandmaster in an fun and entertaining way.I remember that Richard Attenborough said (regarding Gandhi) that there was no way a director/movie maker could encompass and depict a person's life journey in only a 2 or 3-hour movie. But rather one should aim to emulate the spirit of that person, and the message/lesson of his story. I think this movie does that, with a quality production that raised the bar for period drama.My rating is missing 1 point because I feel that there were plot devices that had been done-to-death before in other movies like: Fists of Fury, Fearless, Kill Bill, etc. However, Yip Man simply turns the notch to a higher sound-beating level.Don't miss this on the big screen!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: Ip Man,"I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes, with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen. While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung (in the Tsui Hark movies), Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless, after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films. And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off, and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned, with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster.In this bio-pic, Ip Man, one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity, gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan, China, where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training. With each new school, the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel. Ip Man, an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts, will take them on behind closed doors, so as not to damage his opponents' reputation nor embarrass them in public. His humility is his virtue, and his style is never violent or aggressive, which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate, since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman.The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, and it's not all fight and no story. Witth this historical setting, at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told, with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese, and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit, fail to unite during dire straits. More often than note, martial arts become a unifying force, and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory.But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan, and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator, there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community. The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains, often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao (Fan Siu Wong) as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese. Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight, where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid, and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces.So what's the verdict on the action? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action, and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit, they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie, such as private fights in his home, a factory mêlée, a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer, (which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers, mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka) being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, and a ringside duel amongst others. And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action, but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well. It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite, though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable final battle comes rolling along and gets delivered with aplomb.I'm no Wing Chun practitioner, but Donnie Yen has this marvelous calm and zen like approach with his Ip Man taking out his opponents quite effectively with the minimal of moves. Like Huo Yuan Jia, he doesn't deliver the killing blows to friendly opponents, but rather simulates the various hit points, which actually calls for some astonishing control of strength and precision. This approach will change of course as the opponents become anything but friendly. And unlike the usual martial arts stance of crouching low, here we see him standing tall and striking with such precision and efficiency, it's like poetry in motion with some astounding closed quarter combat utilizing plenty of upper limb strength.With Wong Kar-wai at one point also declaring interest in making a Ip Man movie, I thought that this effort will be hard to beat, just like how Tsui Hark has crafted some of the more definitive movies in modern times about Wong Fei Hung and Jet Li benefiting from a major career boost, I'd say Ip Man just about cements Yen's reputation as a martial arts leading man, which I guess the cinematic world these days severely lacks. This has to go down in my books as one of my favorite movies of the year, and I'm already setting some money aside to get the best available edition of the DVD when it gets released. Highly recommended, so make a beeline for the box office now!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The best martial-arts movie since ""Enter the Dragon"". Donnie Yen is on top form and may be the next Bruce Lee of our generation...","Forget ""Flashpoint"". ""Ip Man"" shows Donnie Yen at his brutal best. Telling the story of Yip Man, the man believed to have popularized the martial art of Wing Chun, before and mostly during the Sino-Japanese war.Yen caught my attention after seeing him in ""SPL"". Then in ""Flashpoint"", I was stunned by his moves, and thought he was the next Jet Li. Well, after this I think he may very well be the next Bruce Lee. I mean it! Not only injecting humanity and superb characterization, Yen also demonstrates his brutality when it comes to fighting. And boy, it does not get more brutal than this! Seriously, Yen's fists move like machine gun bullets. And he makes sure that his opponents are down for the count... at their expense, and our enjoyment. Definitely Yen at his bruising best.Other actors worth mentioning, Simon Yam and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Ip Man's business partner/friend and the Japanese General respectively. The former portrays Ip Man's comrade with heart, while the latter performs with steely resolve and honor. This is a film that is not just made with action, but a good story as well.The fight scenes here are arguably Yen's best so far, and the best in over a decade. People are getting beaten, martial arts duels are taking place, and blood is spilled. This is not an action movie, it's a kung fu movie. And it shows. Legendary kung fu star Sammo Hung brilliantly choreographs the fight scenes to perfection, and it looks like he's not going to slow down any time soon. The direction by Wilson Yip is slick and gripping as always, and he also gives the film a nice sepia tone to give feeling to the film.In short, great. This is a must-see for kung fu film fans to get their adrenal glands pumping. It's one of the best kung fu films of the decade. See it if you have the chance.Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a touching movie,"Ip Man is very touching and full of mildness,considering it's an action movie. Wisedom, courage, elegance, humour...all the mixed elements you surely will feel from Ip man and they will definitely move you. All actors have done a great job. I believe this is the best movie that Zhen Zidan has ever contributed. This time he is not only a warrior, but also a wise, gentle, and conscientious man, a good husband. People clapped hands and weeped from time to time. I have watched it for two times,and longing for the third time when the DVD is coming. You know, Ip Man did not ballyhoo before it is shown, but it undoubtedly becomes a huge dark horse. It is really worthy of watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Wow, this is a instant classic!!","Oh man what a great movie, Just seen it and im stunned. This moves up to my number 5 top list of greatest Martial Arts movies ever. Ip Man was a great man in Chinese history and i can see why. This movie is so well directed and Donnie Yen suits great as a young Ip Man. Its so dramatic at times, you start sniffing your nose and gets sad and angry at the same time. Awesome movie which will be a true classic instantly. I Bought the two disc HK Special Edition and i will see the extras later today cause i will go to sleep now, if i can sleep. Cant wait for part 2. See this film in theaters or on DVD as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. Kung Fu cinema is back and what a comeback. WOW!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kung Fu Master,"Ip Man is a heavily fictionalised biopic of the founder of Wing Chun style of Kung Fu and someone who went on to become a mentor to Bruce Lee.Ip man is a wealthy family man in 1930s China and a reluctant teacher who we see initially combat with his fellow martial art masters from rival schools who want to see for themselves how they are in comparison.When a rival bully from the north turns up and beats up all the kung fu masters in the town, it is left to Ip man to defend the town's honour as he humiliates the upstart who wants to start his own rival martial arts school.Once the Japanese invade China, Ip man descends into poverty especially when his wife becomes ill. He gets a labouring job and finds out that other kung fu masters are getting involved in duels with the Japanese platoon for an extra bag of rice. Ip man angrily takes on 10 Japanese soldiers and beats them up when he finds out that one of the kung fu masters was shot dead by one of the soldiers.This display puts him in a collision course with General Miura, the Japanese's top exponent of karate and the man who organises the combat bouts with the Chinese kung fu masters and wants to prove himself against Ip man.The film is certainly well made with good production values and art direction. The martial arts does not have the over the top choreography and wire work of many other recent Chinese or Hong Kong films.There are some references to the Bruce Lee action films such as teaching the factory workers to fight in order to defend themselves against the same bully who beat up all the other kung fu masters.The film is certainly restrained and lacks the histrionics of other martial art films, even General Miura is portrayed as more honourable than the other Japanese officers.However it is not a true story. The real Ip man was an opium addict and plagued with money problems.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Awesome choreography, intense scenes and a great story","Directed by Wilson Yip (Killzone, Flashpoint) This movie is a ""portrayal"" of the famous Wing Chun master Yip Man, credited as being the guy that taught Bruce Lee kung fu.The movie starts of a bit slow, and seems a bit awkward imo. The dialogue didn't really work on me, and I didn't quite feel the comedy or drama the dialogue was supposed to invoke. However, troublemakers enter the city and the fighting shall begin. When that part began, the movie immediately started to grow on me. The fighting is very well choreographed, and the stunts are really amazing. I am very interested in martial arts and fighting, and thus many movies loses me when I have to see a 300 pound muscular guy supposedly gets knocked out for 10 minutes by 1 jab from e.g. Jackie Chan or choked out by Angelina Jolie. However, in this movie the fight scenes are so amazing that I easily accept that a knee to the body can send a guy a flying across the room. The fighting is of course unrealistic (though not extremely so), but they somehow make it seem legit in this movie, and you actually start believing for the duration of the movie that Ip Man is capable of this stuff.As for the cast, Donnie Yen is the one that stands out. He is a really great choice for Ip Man, with a very calm and intelligent charisma, and he shows in this movie that he is capable of being a diverse actor. The other actors did a fine job as well, most notably his wife (Lynn Hung) and General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), considering their acting experience. The cinematography, soundtrack, costumes and art direction are all well done. They got some fairly experienced people for that, but not anyone ""really"" famous (except for the movie buffs perhaps), most notably Kenji Kawai and Kenneth Mak.My main critique lies in the fact that this movie markets itself as a historical portrait, while this is clearly not so. Apart from the fight scenes that has probably never gone down in reality, we also have the portrayal of the Japanese. While they definitely did invade China and committed some atrocities there, I somehow doubt they had karate tournaments with Japanese vs Chinese. The movie also claims that the city population was reduced from 300k to 72k, which I somehow doubt, but I am unable to find any source that either disprove or confirms that statement. But since the movie is from China I guess a non-biased portrayal of the Japanese invasion is too much to ask. But the thing that bugged me the most was the final part of the movie, which show a fight scene with following events that I am 100% positive has never happened, but the movie actually try to claim that it did (obviously I can't explain the scene to you without spoiling).So all in all a great movie. The plot meets the required amount of relevancy that is needed to keep you interested, but what really stands out is the fight scenes which is what lift this movie to great heights, and what I assume has secured it a place on the IMDb top 250 list. I greatly enjoyed the movie, but the fact that the movie tries to sell itself as being a historic portrayal really bugs me the wrong way and drags it down a point.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Martial of Virtuosity - A Review of Ip Man,"Ip Man (1893-1972) is the expert in the Wushu fighting style of Wing Chun, and is the master of the famous Bruce Lee. As there has never been any previous film record of Ip Man, this film produced by Raymond Wong and directed by Wilson Yip will be the very first.The movie opens and dates back to 1935 Foshan, with the city bustling with activities and various schools of martial arts are seen busy with the practice of their craft. In the people's mind however there would be only one martial artist who is the best. He however would have no interest in opening a school to teach his art. He is Ip Man, played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen.Our introduction to Ip Man began on the day when Master Liu (Chen Zhi-Hui) visits Ip Man at his residence when the latter is having dinner with his wife and son. Being the typical martial arts enthusiast that Master Liu is, he declined to leave when advised by Ip Man to come back at another time, choosing instead to stay and wait until Ip Man have finished his dinner. He is eager to test his skills against Master Ip Man. The mood here is not of hostility but of a light hearted and humorous fashion. Ip Man even invited Master Liu to sit and have dinner with his family when he spots him restlessly waiting by the living room. We see here the humble and modest character of the protagonist.When the sparring finally got underway, it ended as swiftly as Ip Man's strokes suggest. Because in three strokes and a set of quick fists, he had Master Liu at his peril, well defeated yet without injury, as this was all but a friendly exchange in the spirit of martial arts. The essence of Ip Man's fighting style, Wing Chun, is characterized by its tall narrow stance with effectiveness demonstrated through speed and power. It reminds of the time when Bruce Lee had to slow his punches down during filming, as they were just too fast for the cameras back then to capture.In the world of martial arts, with all its attractiveness, it also brings with it the competitive nature of those who practice them. With competitiveness taken the wrong way, things can go awfully wrong when all one wants to achieve is to have the other beaten so as to prove who the superior fighter is. A thug in Kam Shan-chau (Fan Sui-Wong) later arrives and challenges the various schools, defeating their masters ruthlessly, until he came face to face with Ip Man. Kam lost to Ip Man with a lesson he ought to have learn, only that he did not and left Foshan with only disgrace in his mind. The people celebrate as they hail Ip Man the savior who brought glory to Foshan by sending the thug away.The fight ends but the story have only just began, and with it a change of mood from lightness to heavy because war has broken. The Japanese have seized Foshan.What follows will be Ip Man's struggles and challenges as he has to make ends meet for his family in the dreadful time of adversity. It is here we see the true character of Ip Man, who has captured the hearts of the people of Foshan and their respect. This is most notable among his friends in Chow Ching-chuen (Simon Yam), his son Chow Kong-yiu (Calvin Cheng), and Crazy Lam (Xing Yu).To mistake this film, as one of just good versus evil is easy because in a movie that has a hero, there must be a villain. There are a few characters here befitting of the role. We have the Japanese general, Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi). We have the aforementioned thug, Kam Shan-chau. We also have police officer turned interpreter, Li Chiu (Lam Ka-tung) who appears to be a traitor. The film here however should not to be seen as a fight against evil but rather of the depiction of humanistic values that Ip Man himself would possess.There are many meaningful messages encrypted in the various plots and subplots in this wonderful film that really is about virtues more than anything else. As producer Raymond Wong would suggest on why the production team had chosen to make this film, it is that of really making a kung fu movie that is authentic and real, moving away from past attempts at glorifying and stylizing violence on screen. The intention is to make a film that would reflect the spirit of Chinese kung fu, and what better than to portray it through the virtuous character of Master Ip Man.I would have like to compare this film to Fearless aka Huo Yuan Jia (2006), starring Jet Li, which strings from a similar root, but at the very core, the approach is different. While Fearless is written in a more dramatic nature, with a more compelling story and edited with a creative dimension, Ip Man is honest and direct because that is who our protagonist is.What stood out for me in Ip Man is when he ponders in introspection about what use his training and expertise in Wing Chun all his years would come to. It would appear that there is destiny waiting to be fulfilled. And he would also influence those around him with what he has and even lead those who have been wrong to do right despite the pressure of circumstances, because to the very basis, it is the right thing to do in humanity.History means nothing if its lessons are not learned.The film also stars the stunning Xiong Dai Lin as Cheung Wing-sing, Ip Man's wife, and I must also not forget to mention that the acclaimed Sammo Hung directs the action.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Must See Martial Arts movie,"When I saw IP Man in the IMDb top 500, I thought I will have a look at it & am I glad I did! It is one of the most memorable martial arts movies I have seen. If reading subtitles annoys you, then you may not get motivated to watch IP Man, but if you can get passed that, this is a fantastic movie.It tells the story of IP Man (Yip Man), a Chinese Martial Art Grandmaster who teaches Wing Chum. It is based on the life of Yip Man (1893-1972) whom taught many students throughout his life, several of which became martial arts teachers in their own right. His most famous student was Bruce Lee. This movie has lots of action, from martial arts training to big fight scenes, interwoven with drama that makes you really feel for IP Man. It has a great storyline supplemented with top notch acting. Donnie Yen does an excellent job in his role as IP Man, and in my opinion this is one of his best performances.IP Man 2 is also very good but lacking in story compared to the original. I would rate the original, IP Man as being the better out of them. This is truly a must see for any action/martial art fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably Overrated,"I was inspired to watch this movie by all the positive reviews it has received, and the high rating here on IMDb. I was expecting something epic beautiful and captivating. I was however disappointed.The problem with this movie is that it is a martial arts movie that tries to be 'Gone with the wind'. However martial arts has no place in a serious drama about the cruelty of the Japanese occupation of China, and human tragedy is probably too angsty a backdrop for a movie that seeks to entertain you by kicking people in the groin. The genres are fairly incompatible, so they can only be held together by a story that is so contrived and stupid that you might as well just fast-forward through it to the next fight scene.In this film the universe seems to revolve around martial arts. Everyone cares way too much about it. Even though it has zero practical applications, and they all have more pressing concerns like war and famine.As a martial arts movie it holds up quite well. The first 20 mins has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The cinematography is also excellent. It is really just the awkward, nonsensical wartime narrative that makes it blow.As a historical wartime drama, it is obviously just shallow and silly, not to mention overly long and boring. Movies like Full Metal Jacket, Schindler's list, Empire of the sun etc... explore this subject properly. Ip Man really only scratches the surface, and I kind of wish it didn't bother.I would give this film a 6 because that is a realistic representation of how much I enjoyed it. It was okay, but I doubt I would watch it again or recommend it to anyone (apart from the first 20 mins which are unquestionably awesome). I'm tempted to give more because it is quite epic, and has that rich epic quality too it. But 7 is probably too high, for all it's qualities, it is just not that interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
This ain't what your daddy watched back in the 1960s and 70s!,"I have seen and enjoyed many, many martial arts film. However, I am not blind to the problems that have often plagued the genre. For every exceptional film (such as most of the Shaw Brothers films or the better films of Sonny Chiba) there are the god-awful ones--movies that are embarrassingly bad. In these bad films, you see horrible martial arts where blows barely come near their opponents or kicks that look like my grandmother was fighting! Heck, I even remember one film with gorillas doing kung fu--and they obviously were two guys wearing VERY cheap Halloween costumes! Because of the many bad films, it's a pleasure to see ""Ip Man""--a film where the fighting is the most realistic you'll ever see. There is no 'wire fu' here--just fast and amazingly talented people making it look authentic.The film covers only a portion of Master Ip Man's life--mostly the 1930s--both before and during the Japanese occupation of his homeland. I read that MUCH liberty was taken with his life in the film--and I doubt if the guy really did half the things they show the actor (Donny Yen) playing him did! But, it is constantly entertaining and even uplifting. I am very sure that in China this film must have been a great source of pride--seeing Ip Man standing up to the murderous Japanese occupiers. A simply terrific film--and I challenge you to find one better! Because it is so good, I couldn't help but give this one a well-earned 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Donnie Yen great dignity,"In FoShan, southern China, Master Liu challenges Ip Man (Donnie Yen) and gets beaten. Ip Man promises to keep it private but loudmouthed Yuan tells everyone. Jin from the north challenges every master in FoShan. He wins in every match except for Ip Man. In 1937, war starts between Japan and China. Ip Man loses everything. Japanese General Miura has organized fight tournaments. Yuan's older brother Lin is killed. Ip Man fights to avenge his death. Meanwhile, Jin leads his bandits including Yuan. They steal from Ip Man's friend Zhou Qingquan.The start is well-done kung fu movie and a good solid story. Donnie Yen has great dignity. The movie is essentially extended into two parts. The war scrambles everybody and everything. The second part is also good. It introduces whole new villains. I would have preferred having two separate movies. The fight action is fun, and energetic. This is a solid kung fu action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can't believe this one on the top 250 list!!!!!!!,"As a Chinese, I really can't believe this movie is on the top 250 list! This is one of the most superficial movies I have ever seen. The nationalism dialog and the detract of Japanese and the unrealistic display of Kung Fu is almost a joke. I voted for 1 not only because it's a bad movie, but also for a protest. I cant this one can have a higher score of the real masterpieces of Chinese movie. This is UNBELIEVABLE! For those who interested in Chinese movie, I recommend Zhang Yimou's 'Lifetimes Living', Kaige Chen's 'Farewell My Concubine' and Jiang Wen's 'Devils on the Doorstep'. These are all masterpieces, revealing the real mental attitude of Chinese people and the historical appearance of Chinese society. For those who interested in Kung Fu movie, Jackie Chan is better, Bruce Lee is always good. All in all, FORGET THIS ONE!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ip Man!,"I had a choice of watching The Spirit or Ip Man. It is a tough decision and after a long while, I finally makes the choice of watching Ip Man. The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star, Donnie Yen. As expected, the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing, he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create, I can say, some of best martial arts movies.The story: It tells about Ip Man's life, the soon-to-be master of the famous Bruce Lee. I can't say much about the plot but the fighting and the music are great. The Japanese soon attacks China which affects Ip Man and his family. Soon, he goes for a fight, organised by the Japanese, which can earn him rice. The Japanese General is impressed by his ability which leads to the final battle of all. It is fast paced with amazing fights in between and humour.Overall: If you are a martial arts movie fan, this is definitely stunning and not to be missed. If you get entertained by any form of action and want to know the facts of Bruce Lee's master, this should also not be missed. Another good martial arts movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great martial arts film show casing Wing Chun in high detail,"I cannot claim to be any sort of serious historian when it comes to Yip Man's life, but all evidence leads me to believe the story of his life in the new biopic from China, ""Ip Man"", is largely fabricated or romanticized. Never the less, the end result is an entertaining film with some serious Wing Chun fight scenes, a martial art that gets far too little screen time considering the copious amount of martial arts films that are produced. This is significant to me, since I study Wing Chun in a lineage that comes directly from Yip Man.This film is sort of in the style of biopic similar to Jet Li's ""Fearless"", a movie about a Chinese folk hero, Huo Yuanjia. I think it is more important for a film like this to be entertaining than it is for it to be historically accurate, and ""Ip Man"" does succeed in this regard. My main point of criticism, particularly in regards to ""Ip Man"", is how events are twisted in a way to rally national pride in China. It always reminds me of a sort of Mel Gibson type of thing to do, and puts me off a little. ""Ip Man"" is not as obnoxious in this regard as Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" or ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", however. Those movies seem to have a message of obedience. You know, ""Trust your ruler even though they do terrible things to you sometimes. In the end, they know what's best for you"". In the case of ""Ip Man"", the title character is plunged into the middle of the Japanese-Chinese conflicts of World war II, probably playing a much larger roll than he did in real life, and they show him as a sort of folk hero along the lines of Huo Yuanjie or Wong Fei Hong.Never the less, the film flows well. All of these elements make enough dramatic tension between the excellent combat sequences to keep the movie engaging. Some of the plot twists are extremely predictable, which doesn't interfere too much. This is a martial arts movie, after all. There is probably a bit too much dramatic tension, particularly towards the end of the film, with epic music pushing the mood of the movie, along with various camera effects. Besides, turning Yip Man into a legendary folk hero does make for an interesting dramatic character.I couldn't complain about Donnie Yen's overall performance. His acting job was good enough to be convincing. His martial arts performance was visually striking. The choreographer, who I understand to be Sammo Hung, did a great job making Yip Man seem like an untouchable bad ass. In a lot of recent movies, particularly Jet Li films, a lot of the martial arts sequences show big, long, epic combat scenes where the hero narrowly overcomes and triumphs. In this movie, Donnie Yen gets to simply brutalize his opponents. I mean, he seriously comes out with the chain punches. This is not done without being poignant, but they definitely make a point of showing Yip Man as being somewhat untouchable and peerless. It seemed more Clint Eastwood than Jet Li, which I totally dig.My other concern was whether this would be a sort of ""Brucesploitation"" film, since among Yip Man's other notable accomplishments, he was the teacher of Bruce Lee. It would seem natural to want to capitalize on this given Lee's popularity. Fortunately, there wasn't too much ""Brucesploitation"" going on, but it did seem there was a bit. There is one combat scene where Yip Man is facing off ten Japanese karate guys. The sequences are filmed in a very strikingly similar way to a famous scene in ""Fist Of Fury"", where Lee dispatches a whole dojo of Japanese karate students after they dishonored Lee's kung fu school. There is also a combat sequence in a factory that is strikingly similar to a scene in ""The Big Boss"" where Lee fights in an ice factory, protecting the workers. However, my guess is that these are nods of respect or tribute rather than exploitation, so seem harmless. There was some mention in the end titles of Lee, but the copy I watched did not have that translated, so I am not sure what was even mentioned.All that said, if you enjoy martial arts movies, this is definitely a good film. I have my share of complaints, particularly in the department of historical accuracy. However, the overall production is top notch, and the martial arts performances are a nice change of pace. I'd recommend giving it a look if you are any sort of fan of martial arts movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly great story and movie,"I've never been a huge fan of martial art movies, mostly because they rarely combine the good story with good fighting. I did however like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" back when it came despite it's aerial theme and fairytale ways, because it told a great story in a good way true to it's universe.""Ip Man"" is a great story with the more realistic and human fights, and serves as a counter to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". The one common thing is both tell their story with heart and delivers a cinematic experience you'll remember.Highly recommended and a must watch movie in my book.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Wing Chun, Ip Man...","The 2008 ""Ip Man"" was a rather good movie, and one that turned out to be somewhat better than I had anticipated. Many of these Chinese historic epic dramas tend to be over the top and exaggerating on many levels, but ""Ip Man"" turned out to be rather down to earth and a rather enjoyable movie.Donnie Yen was really well cast for the role of the legendary Ip Man, and he performed quite well, both in his acting performance, but most certainly also so in his martial arts performance. So fans of Donnie Yen will be more than pleased with ""Ip Man"", but also fans of the martial arts genre should find enjoyment in this movie.The story, briefly summarized, takes place in 1937 when China is being invaded by Japanese troops, and Ip Man is forced out of his wealthy manor and forced into a poverty, where he has to turn to teaching Wing Chun in order to survive the harsh times.The martial arts sequences in the entire movie were all very well choreographed and equally well executed by the performers. But more importantly, it was filmed in a very dynamic way, making the audience feel like they were in the fights themselves. It was a true pleasure to watch the fight scenes in the movie, and they alone actually make it worth sitting down to watch ""Ip Man"".""Ip Man"" is one of the more important movies in Donnie Yen's career, I think, because he really managed to portray the legendary Wing Chun master in a very graceful manner.The story of the movie is entertaining, and it most definitely is spiced up by the impressive martial arts. However, the atmosphere of the movie is also quite impressive and one to take into consideration. They put a lot of effort into the details to create a believable atmosphere, and it really works quite in favor of the movie.Aside from Donnie Yen, then ""Ip Man"" also has big Hong Kong names such as Simon Yam on the cast list. And actor Xing Yu also did put on a very good performance in the movie.If you enjoy martial arts movies then ""Ip Man"" is a definite must watch. And if you are a fan of the Asian cinema, then ""Ip Man"" is a well-worthy addition to your collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Time for Donnie Yen to Be on Center Stage!,"Donnie Yen has been one of the most underrated martial arts actors. Now that Jet Li has announced his retirement from film-making, I believe that the time is ripe for Donnie to take Hollywood by storm as the next martial arts icon.His powerful performance in Ip Man has established himself as a credible actor in addition to being a superb martial artist. From the early wobbly performance in Drunken Tai Chi (Siuu Taai Gik) to his confident acting in Hero, Donnie's acting prowess has slowly but steadily been honed to international caliber.Time to step up Donnie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Martial arts are top notch, but...","I knew about Ip Man but only now had a chance to watch it. The movie gives the viewer a feeling of Chinese history in the 1930s-1940s, and I really like the way the setting, the costumes, the Chinese neighborhoods are beautiful and give a very old vibe. But not only that, this is a true story of a martial artist, a talented and humble person, the film has brought out a very cool character. I really admire Donnie Yen's talent. The fighting scenes are too attractive and beautiful. I love the final battle between Ip Man and Miura, can only say Wow with the amazingly choreographed martial arts combat.However, the story of the master facing the threshold of war is actually quite simple, the story has no twists or anything special. Because it is so simple, the character Ip Man also does not have much opportunity to show the inner happenings and bring empathy to the viewers. Ip Man's family is also a problem. The wife and son received little attention, especially the relationship between the three of them. I feel that the link between Ip Man and his son in the movie is problematic. I mean, every time the Ip Man family shows up, it's kind of weird. It is difficult to ask martial artists to express a lot of emotions in quiet scenes. However, Ip Man's feelings in the face of his enemies, his love for his country are shown more clearly. Perhaps the detail I like is about the brother who was given an iron box containing a kite by Ip Man, which the late brother always treasured. Although it has not been properly described.This is a great entertaining movie, you can watch it over and over with your friends in your spare time, but if you need a movie with depth and emotional quality, this movie just isn't that type of movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best martial arts movie of all time?!?!?!?!?,"The cover boasts ""Best martial arts movie of all time. Hands down!"" With an 8.1 IMDb rating and an engaging, plausible-sounding, story line of martial arts'-based resistance to 1930s Japanese imperialism, I figure this film is certainly worth a try. Especially since I have long practiced, respected and enjoyed martial arts, and the film claims to be based on the true story.But how does any being of normal intelligence even sit through this movie, let alone sign on to IMDb and rate it a 8, 9 or 10??? Dimwitted, implausible story; and dimwitted, implausible characters. If in fact this film were representative of any martial arts code or practtioner behavior, that would be the end of martial arts. Every protagonist in the film is dead set on maiming or murdering each other -- and themselves! If in fact this film is even close to among the best martial arts movies now or ever, ""martial arts"" must be the most scum-ridden, unctuous backwater of film making that has ever existed -- a ""genre"" (if we can call it that) which makes XXX features high literature by comparison.It's certainly the last such movie I'll ever watch.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

It was one of the first martial arts movie i've seen along with a couple of Jackie Chan movies.Donnie Yen was one of the reason I wasn't sure to like this movie, his face seems like he had no emotions at all so I was thinking : how can a guy like this could do good acting. Let me say that he earned my respect with this movie, I was completely wrong. He fits perfectly for this role.This movie is not only for martial arts fans but also contains historical events between Chinese and Japanese.

You can't keep a good Ip Man down.,"Directed by Wilson Yip (Kill Zone, Flash Point), this is a rather fanciful biopic of Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), the celebrated progenitor of Wing Chun who would eventually become sifu to the world's greatest martial arts star, Bruce Lee. Charting the events in his life that occurred before and during the Sino-Japanese war, the film sees the once prosperous martial artist and his family reduced to penniless, homeless beggars following the invasion of their home town of Foshan. However, when Japanese general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) challenges Ip Man to a fight, he gets a chance to fight for his honour, avenge his dead countrymen, and open a catering size can of whoop-ass on his oppressors!Ip Man is an extremely rose-tinted movie, as one might expect from a Chinese production about a national hero standing up against the tyranny of Japan, but despite its glaring nationalism and an economy with the facts, the film proves to be both a gripping drama and, of course, a bad-ass kung fu flick, with scene after scene of incredible bone-crunching mayhem. The hard-hitting close-quarter combat is brilliantly choreographed by Sammo Hung and flawlessly performed by Yen and his co-stars, and although I've never been a fan of wire-work in a non-fantasy martial arts film (even less so in films based on historical fact), the occasional use of it here detracts very little from the overall effectiveness of the action scenes.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A modern day martial arts masterpiece,"Ip Man (2008) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows the infamous Ip Man who was a renowned martial artist until Japan invaded China and immediately looked down on the Chinese people. Ip Man becomes a humble man doing whatever he can to help his family survive. When he sees how his people are being treated he will use his martial arts to overcome their struggle and revive the honor of his country.This movie is directed by Wilson Yip (Kill Zone) and stars Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey 2), Simon Yam (Lara Craft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life), Siu-Wong Fan (Story of Ricky), Lynn Xiong (See You Tomorrow) and To Yu-hang (1911).The storyline for this picture is very compelling and you're drawn into the era, circumstances and characters from beginning to end. The family dynamic is well established and Yen is outstanding. The choreography combined with his hand spend was absolutely mesmerizing. There's a feather duster scene that's both hilarious and impressive that I could watch a hundred times. This movie does do a good job of infusing some subtle comedy here and there. The ultimate villain in this is solid and the showdown at the end is epic.Overall, this is a modern day martial arts masterpiece that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully shot but not much to do with the real Yip Man,"I had very mixed feelings here. The visuals of Yip Man are very beautiful. The use of faded colours to make the film look aged has become really popular. The choreography of the various fight scenes are complex, fast, very fun to watch. I also love the epic music which is a kind of fusion of a classical orchestral score with elements of traditional Chinese music.This would all make Yip Man a good picture if it wasn't for the plot. Even without reading up on the real Yip Man's biography it's fairly easy to spot that some elements of the film are just bogus. This goes especially the second half's climatic centre piece: fierce competitions between Japanese and Chinese martial artists fighting for a bag of rice. On one side the Chinese are shown as dignified and brave despite their suffering with Yip Man's character standing out almost like a Messiah. The Japanese, on the other hand, are shown as worse than stereotypical. They are positively demonic. Their characters are almost ridiculously evil so that the film can end in the equivalent of a patriotic fanfare blast.After the very atmospheric first half I found this a bit disappointing. Several years and sequels later I wonder if the real Yip Man has finished turning over in his grave yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brings To Light A Little-Known Historical Figure,"A semi-biographical account of Yip Man (Donnie Yen), the first martial arts master to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun.Outside of martial arts fans, the name ""Ip Man"" may not mean much to Americans. In fact, the title sounds silly, as though this was a superhero alongside Batman and Superman. But perhaps this is a sign that the film's time has come: more people, including Americans, ought to know about this martial arts legend, the man who trained Bruce Lee.Derek Elley of Variety Magazine wrote in his review, ""Yen, who's taking on real star charisma in middle age, is aces as Ip, with a simple dignity that exactly mirrors the movie's own and a gracefulness in combat that's very different from his trademark whiplash style.""

This is not the Kung Fu I am looking for,"I'm not huge into martial arts movies, I just tend to enjoy them when I watch them. In other words, I don't regularly go seeking these movies out, but if I hear of a good one I will definitely watch it.I love Bruce Lee and Enter the Dragon, I also enjoy his rougher Hong Kong work with the terrible dubbing. I really like Sonny Chiba. I grew up on Van Damme and a ton of low budget western martial arts flicks from the 80s and 90s (many distributed by Cannon Films). Road House is a guilty pleasure of mine. I find Jackie Chan movies amusing and I thought Jet Li rescued Lethal Weapon 4 from being a terrible movie. I really like Scott Adkins and his work in the Undisputed films. I became a huge fan of Tony Jaa after seeing him in Ong Bak (one of my favorite kung fu flicks) and The Protector, and The Raid: Redemption is easily one of the best action films I have seen in a decade.I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the whole wire-fu genre unless it has some sort of mystical or science fiction element, and even then I am wary of it. Ip Man has wire work (though it is toned down), slow motion, and is over choreographed. Each fight is like an elegant dance, I understand the appeal of this to some people, but it's not for me. I like my martial arts films to have more grounded and brutal combat, not a ballet of fists and kicks. So right off the bat this was not my type of martial arts movie. I know there are others like me, so this review is for them.The story certainly won't save this movie if you don't favor this type of action. It's a familiar tale of helpless Chinese civilians learning how to defend themselves against an oppressor, in this movie that oppressor is the Imperial Japanese Army circa WW2. Ip Man is supposed to be based on a real life person who defied the Japanese occupation and trained people to fight, he is presented in this movie as an Asian Beowulf - a hero with heavily exaggerated physical abilities. There's a distinct nationalistic tone to the movie and an odd insinuation at the end that the Japanese may have surrendered because of IP Man's Chinese resistance instead of two massive American bombs leveling two of their cities (most historical films would have said the ""The Japanese surrendered to General MacArthur and the allied forces in 1945, but this film being from the propaganda machine that is China simply says Japan surrendered in 1945 and never specified to whom).Some quick facts about the real Ip Man:He worked as a cop before and after the Japanese invasion. Not shown in this movie.IP Man was an enemy of the Chinese Communist party and fled to Hong Kong. For obvious reasons, this is not mentioned in the film.This movie is a propaganda piece, no question about it, but I did not rate it down for that reason, I just feel it should be mentioned.This is the only Donnie Yen movie I have watched, but I don't see the appeal of him as an action star. His facial expressions and mannerisms are bland and his fights in this movie are so ridiculously one sided that it makes Steven Seagal look humble. Add in the wire work, and I just don't see the appeal of him compared to what I saw in Ong Bak or The Raid.One word thundered in my head after I finished watching this movie: overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I wonder what the Japanese think of this!,"¨There are no men who fear their wives. Only men who respect them.¨I'm no martial art expert, but Yip Man has to be one of the coolest martial art films I've seen in a long time. I loved this movie completely. I began watching it very late and decided I would only watch the beginning to see what all the buzz was about, but there was no way I could stop watching and I was hooked from the beginning. Donnie Yen is a true star and he was outstanding in every fight scene. He felt like the Yoda of martial arts, keeping his cool, always giving smart advice and using as little violence as possible, but at the same time he seemed untouchable. He's not like most characters in martial arts, but rather more of a young Mister Miyagi who's wise beyond his years and never looks for trouble despite knowing he can defeat anyone in a heartbeat. He is completely against violence and uses martial arts for his personal well being. This film was directed by Wilson Yip and is supposed to be based on the biography of Yip Man, the first master to teach the art of Wing Chun (a Chinese martial art). Yip Man is known as the man responsible for teaching Bruce Lee, the greatest martial art superstar. There is no doubt that Bruce Lee made this art popular all over the world through his movies. I don't know how authentic the biography is, but I don't care because I was entertained by this film which was written by Edmond Wong. The script was interesting and he made me care for the characters in this film. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed, but the story also worked to perfection. It wasn't all about the fighting, there was some depth to Yip Man and Donnie Yen played him extremely well.The story takes place during 1935 in a small Chinese town named Foshan. This town is known for having a martial art class in every corner. There are all sorts of martial art styles and masters, but everyone knows that the best martial artist in town is Yip Man (Donnie Yen). Despite being the best, Yip Man isn't interested in becoming a master; he lives a simple life in his rich estate along with his wife, Zhang Yong (Lynn Hung), and his young son. Every master in town wants to prove their talent by facing Ip Man in a friendly duel, but no one stands a chance against him. Everything seems to be going well for the town of Foshan until their country is attacked by Japan and soon the Imperial Japanese army invades their town. Yip Man's estate is confiscated by Japan and him and his family are left with nothing. They barely have enough food to survive so Yip Man decides to accept any job in order to get more food. The Japanese General, Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), begins staging martial art fights between Chinese and Japanese fighters promising rice if they defeat them. Miura himself is an excellent fighter and in one fight he kills Yip Man's friend. Yip Man who was against participating in this sort of event goes to a fight to try to find out what has happened to his friend. There he discovers that he can defy the Japanese army with his martial art skills.Yip Man is a great biographical story although it probably isn't 100% accurate. Donnie Yen plays the character so smooth and wise that he looks virtually invincible and untouchable. The fighting scenes are also excellently choreographed and there are some great action scenes. Donnie Yen is really talented and he just might be the next martial art movie star. He's not only a great fighter, but he can also act as well. This film is so much more than an action packed movie; it has some interesting drama and a great storyline as well. This film has gotten great reviews, but I wonder what the Japanese think of it because they were poorly depicted and it is part of their history that they would probably want to forget. I loved the mood of this film and consider it to be one of my favorite martial art films. That is how much I liked it, and in my humble opinion it is a masterpiece. I look forward to seeing Donnie Yen in more films and catching up with my martial art films.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Instant Kung Fu Classic,"Ip Man is a martial arts action film at its best. There's rarely another film like this.Ip Man is a genre-defining kung fu epic. The film covers a bit of pre-war China into the Second Sino-Japanese War. Studio sets are accurate and beautiful, giving us a peek into life during this era. The representation of pre-war China especially makes one nostalgic for a bygone era.Donnie Yen delivers on action to give us a thrilling, exciting experience. One can skip around the movie and be entertained by the Wing Chun fighting alone. Fighting is brutal, bloody, and tense. One feels a real sense of force behind every punch, toss, and kick. Every hit is shown and none are missed. Such is the result of being choreographed by the legendary Sammo Hung.Not to mention that epic final fight between Yip Man and General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) sent chills down my spine.The portrayal of Yip Man, Bruce Lee's teacher, as a humble martial arts master is one that we can get behind. He's courageous, fair, and backs his words. Though meant to be semi-biographical, I felt that some liberties were taken to the story. Some sequences felt a bit rushed that detracted from the film.Yet, that doesn't mean that this film is a solid watch.4.5/5. Wilson Yip's masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive storyline and stunning fight scenes,"This movie is a biopic about Ip Man, the most influential master of the Wing Chun martial art. This is one of the few martial arts movies where I was actually impressed by the storyline. It's not the first time a World War II setting was used for a martial arts movie, since the Jet Li movies ""Fist of Legend"" and ""Born to Defend"" were also set during World War II. However, the plots in those movies were essentially the same old revenge story lines, which Ip Man most certainly is not. This movie is rather about a martial artist just trying to scrape a living in a time of war and poverty, like how ""The Cinderella Man"" was about a boxer trying to make a living during the Great Depression.On top of the very good storyline, the fight scenes are also very impressive, so much so that it inspired me to start taking Wing Chun classes again (I went once before but didn't return until last week). The weird thing is that I found out that our local Wing Chun sifu (master) had trained under Ip Man's son and was one of the choreographers for the movie. It turns out that was the main reason why a lot of his other students joined his classes, although I had no idea about this myself.As for the performances, Donnie Yen is clearly the star of the show. It's nice to see him finally getting such a major role, which he has performed brilliantly, not only in the incredible fight scenes but also in his subtle portrayal of Ip Man's struggles. The supporting cast also gave memorable performances, particularly Lynn Hung as his wife Yong Cheng, Lam Ka-Tung as Inspector Li Zhao, Xing Yu as Lin, Siu-Wong as Jin Shan Zhao, and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as General Miura.My only criticisms against this movie is that the last one-third of the movie was largely fictionalized, the final showdown itself felt a bit anti-climatic in comparison to the more exciting earlier fight scenes, and the finale came off as somewhat melodramatic. Other than that, this film is a must-see for all martial arts movie fans.8/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Action Scenes,"While I am sure this movie is less than accurate in fighting style and historical events, Ip Man (2008) has fantastic action, effects, and lots of heart (not just bloody knuckles).Some argue the historical events never happened. The same comments can be made about several ""biographical"" movies made about Bruce Less, or other celebrities and historical figures. At the least this film sparks the imagination, and leaves you wanting more. More action, more story.Others have argued that the fighting style is not incredibly accurate. In that case, this might not be the best film to take lessons from, however, the average viewer will be far less critical.Before this movie I did not know who Ip Man was. I did follow up watching this film with researching the true Man through various means.If you appreciate realistic martial art films with a slight flair of incredible, then this is a film for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Honor and Humildity.,"A great film, it tells in an engaging way the story of the master Yip Man who had as a disciple none other than Bruce Lee.The film has great costumes, makeup, scenery, photography that together portray China in 1938 well.For me martial arts practitioner, the movie gets even better, the fight scenes are very well done (obviously not so realistic), but linked to the typical Chinese soundtrack, they are excellent and the highlight of the movie.I really liked how the film addresses the issue of honor and how important it is to the eastern people.A great movie, I haven't seen the other movies yet, but for sure I will.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
kick ass,"My Score 3.5/5 The good old Chinese martial movies seems to have fade away from the movie scene of Hollywood lately. But the sparks still remain here and there and once in a while action movie which comes out. Mostly originated from China they seldom rocks the world unless an American studio does the production work.""Ip Man"" (Pronounced as Yip Maan) is one of those seldom martial art movie which gained international popularity back in 2008.Based on a true story and actual character of master Yip the story takes place in the second world war era. In a city where martial arts is a way of life and reputed for talented masters Yip resides with his wife and kids noble and rich from family heritage. While proving his Kung Fu talents in humble way Yip is respect throughout the land. Soon the life of Yip and many drastically change once the Japanese empire strikes on Chinese soil and Yip's city also falls victim and turn hell. Yip and his family goes though many hardships yet Yip ambitiously lives a respected life until trouble comes and know on his shoulder.Martial art movies are always centered upon fights. Duels , challenges and rival gangs which are all natural elements. In Ip Man the story goes a little further and discuss about family, respect, courage and honor as well. The limits which one can go in order to take care of his loved ones in the mid of tougher situations is what Ip Man is mostly about. And the movie cleverly shows what true martial artist is all about than throwing punches all over the town for no reason.Embedded craft fully with stunning and thumping martial art sequences Ip Man delivers a full load of action for the action movie lover. Even there is a bit of humor here and there. Sometimes following the subtitles can be a pain (The movie is in Chinese. No translation is available) but that's really not a barrier to enjoy it.Read more reviews www.flickshout.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Way Way Way Overrated,"Talk about an overrated film, this is it. It's not even as good as it's sequel. It has a higher rating than even Drunken Master 2, and that's one of the best ever filmed. I believe the reason is the people rating it have not seen many films of this type. If they had they would realize this is a very average martial arts film. Yen has done way better films. When people tell me how great this film was I ask what other films with Yen they have seen. None they answer. In fact the only Jackie Chan film one guy saw was The Tuxedo, and not one Jet Li film. People say Yen is the new Bruce Lee, but they are about 20 years off. Maybe in the 90's I would have believed that. Jacky Wu seems to be king now. So it's no wonder this film has such a high rating. Most of the people rating it haven't seen the better films by any one. So they have no foundation to judge upon.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Must see martial arts action,"This film is loosely based on the life of Chinese martial arts master Ip Man during the Japanese occupation. It opens in 1935 in the city of Foshan. The city is famed for its many martial arts schools but Ip Man doesn't operate a school despite being a more proficient fighter than all the other kung fu masters. He lives a comfortable life with his wife and young son but all that changes in 1937 when the Japanese take the city. The martial arts schools close and the various masters find themselves working at a local coal mine. Word of their presence gets back to the Japanese general and he has them fight his men for bags of rice. After the death of a friend Ip Man gets involved and defeats ten Japanese fighters at once; the general wants him to train his men in the Wing Chun form of Kung fu, but he refuses. The only people he trains are Chinese workers who are being attacked by bandits. Ultimately though he will have to face the Japanese general who is an expert fighter himself.Certain liberties may have been taken with the facts but that doesn't matter too much as this is a good story with lots of great action. It opens well with pre-war scenes that introduce Ip Man, his family and various other major characters, notably a policeman who later works for the Japanese as a translator. There is some action in these scenes but most of the action takes place after the Japanese arrival. These later fight scenes are fairly bone crunching and while it is clear that that is some wire assistance nobody flies across the room and the fights feel more real than the beautifully choreographed fights in Wuxia films. That doesn't mean these fights aren't choreographed though; Sammo Hung did a really great job setting up the fights so they feel natural. Donnie Yen is great as Ip Man; a restrained character who avoids violence when he can but is just about unstoppable when forced to fight. The supporting cast are impressive too. The villains are suitable menacing but not too obviously evil; the sadistic Japanese colonel may be bordering on a pantomime villain but the general is more honourable even if he is one of the bad guys. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; it is definitely a must see for martial arts fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great balance.,"With an excellent balance between the personal story of a respected man with great devotion to his people and the greater conflict that surrounds him as everything he knows is taken away, it leads to a masterfully crafted epic of Ip Man's journey to inspire those around him and fight for his land. With revolutionary martial arts choreography by Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu-hung, a devoted performance by Donnie Yen, cinematography from Sing-Pui O, and powerful storytelling down to each landed strike, my first and each subsequent time experiencing this tale is one that continues to impact me as a filmmaker and storyteller.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The little brother of Jet Li's masterpiece ""Fearless""","This is a beautiful martial arts movie with stunning fight scenes that also features some historic drama elements and a slightly philosophical touch which creates a rather addicting potpourri. It's portrait of Chinese culture, pride and rebellion during the Japanese occupation and is starring an authentic and brave main hero and a couple of interesting characters like his proud wife, a brutal bandit who wants to become a martial arts legend or a traitor and translator who works with the Japanese and has some important inner struggles.Nevertheless, this movie is slightly overrated if you have seen the very similar but more emotional and profound ""Fearless"" by and with Jet Li a couple of years ago. Ip Man lacks of a profound story, aesthetic details and human passion that the other movie included. It's still an entertaining flick but has not many surprises, intense scenes or parts that may truly trouble you emotionally. You will basically watch this flick for its historic elements and its fight scenes while the acting and the story are rather mediocre after all.That's why this movie is not as brilliant as its reputation. If you're a fan of Asian martial arts movies, you shouldn't expect anything groundbreaking as there are many better classic and modern flicks of the genre. On the other side, for an occidental viewer, this is still an exotic movie that may grab your attention and that is at least worth a loan at your local shop.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great martial arts film!,"This film is about the legendary Chinese martial arts master, Ip Man, whose followers include the world famous Bruce Lee.""Ip Man"" is of such high quality that I find it hard to believe. Everything from sets, cinematography, scene composition and lighting are all professional Hollywood standard. It feels like watching a Hollywood production, but even better because ""Ip Man"" successfully brings the vibrant Chinese culture alive.The Kung Fu moves are fiercely real, I feel so sorry for the stunt guys when I see their face twist, their limbs bent at impossible angles and their noses get squashed.As for the plot, the initial half basically contains all sorts of excuses to fight. The second half is intensely emotional, especially for a person of Chinese descent, as it exposes historical wounds. The plot is one intense fight after another, but still contains enough emotional elements to keep non action fans interested.I am pleasantly surprised by ""Ip Man"". It is certainly the best Hong Kong film for years.",,Anonymous,Biography
Yikes Man!,"Ip Man can easily say that it is the greatest true Kung Fu movie ever. It feels as if you are watching some sort of machine take down every opponent in a brutal fashion.

It's also history based, even though I am rusty on my Japanese-Chinese invasion knowledge, it felt as if it bought some authenticity and realism into the film.Ip Man may be a film you put off, but if you get the chance to watch it, you will defiantly savor the good taste it leaves in your mouth.

Good martial arts movie,"If you're a fan of martial arts this is a good one to watch. Donnie Yen portrays the Ip Man, a family man of good standing who faces many challenges in the movie. Much like a Bruce Lee movie, the plot is really just a method of introducing a number of action/fight sequences, culminating in the Ip Man's confrontation with invading Japanese forces in China's WW II experience. The fight choreography is fast and entertaining, and the movie's villains and heroes cast in stark black and white terms. For all its limitations, Ip Man manages to hold one's attention, providing there is no viewer antipathy for martial arts violence. At times the violence is quite intense, which will probably get it an R rating when it becomes available in the U.S.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Baloney! What a wasted opportunity.,"This movie is not historically accurate at all, it's more like a fairytale based on a historical character.Moreover, we are treated to the boring, same-old-same-old wushu acrobatics with some rapid punching and other ""short"" techniques thrown in to make it feel more like Wing Chun. But there's still ridiculous kicks and flying bad guys everywhere... yawn. The freaky wounds suffered by the baddies are interesting, but so over the top.Since the Chinese like to portray the Japanese as the ultimate evil (granted, history provides some reason for that), we get a boring depiction of Japanese as evil bastards, predictably combined with a even more boring and overly simplistic representation of Japanese karate.If you can't get enough of the typical Chinese MA movies, AND you've seen the classics from way back, then by all means have a look at this. The fighting choreography in itself is entertaining, and the cinematography is not bad at all.But this movie adds very little to the genre, while in potential it could have been so much more.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

This time they both not disappointed us. The Wing Chun style looks real and beautiful, the best fight was Ip man challenged 10 Japaneses in Dojo, this is the best from Donnie yen.May be Ip Man is the best movie for him, but compare with Jet Li he still need to do more.we all know that Jet Li is the most popular martial artist in the world for now since Bruce Lee,and Jet Li just won the best actor for his role In 'The warlord' from HK movie award., he proved he can act. Donnie Yen is not bad at fight but for his acting is not too good. He knew it.So he just keep doing hard, Wilson Yip is a talented director.Donnie +Wilson is a good couple.

Masterful martial arts performances,"A movie based on the life of Master Ip Man, who's most well-known as the popularizer of Wing Chun style of kung fu and as the teacher of Bruce Lee. The movie follows his life in the years leading up to World War Two and his exploits during that conflict. The movie is notably anti-factual, but in an honest way. Director Wilson Yip has outright stated that he put the needs of a good story before historical accuracy. When it's done this blatantly, I cannot find any fault in it.The movie mixes martial arts with historical drama, and I do have to admit that the former of these two aspects works much better than the latter. As a period piece the film works okay. The costumes and locations are interesting, the cinematography is at times beautiful and although the script is clearly from the point of view of the Chinese, the Japanese are not depicted as outright monsters, like they sometimes are.But if we're all being honest here, it's martial arts side of things, which really elevates this movie above its peers. Donnie Yen has a deserved reputation as one of the best in the business, and this right here is one of his finest films. Add in the fact that the film had a lot of great background help, including Ip Man's own son, Ip Chun, working as a consultant, and you have one fine martial arts fest in your hands. The fight scenes in this film are gorgeous. Highly choreographed, beautifully shot, just all around beautiful to witness. And they're all so different from one another. You never feel like you're watching the same match twice.Ip Man is a great watch for all fans of the martial arts genre. Donnie Yen gives one of his finest efforts, both as a martial artist and as an actor. Sit back and enjoy a world where everyone is kung fu fighting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Legendary Film about A Martial Arts Legend.,"This film deserves a 10/10 rating for it's realistic portrayal of the Japanese occupation of China. The mood and setting is exactly as it was during the 1930's in Foshan. Yip Man is seen in his home with his wife and son when patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect comes to visit him seeking a challenge. He says to Yip man that whatever the outcome of the contest between them, it would be a secret as to who won. Yip Man replies that he was just having lunch and asks his guest if he had dined. His guest replies no and so Yip Man invites him to lunch, after which they begin.Yip Man takes his opponent apart and exposes his errors in defence. In the end the grateful master acknowledges his defeat to the highly skilled Yip Man. However unknown to them both someone has seen the match and blabs the result to the townsfolk.Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.The Japanese invasion in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house. Desperate to support his family, Ip accepts work as a coolie at a coal mine.The Japanese General Miura, who is a Karate master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Li Zhao, a former police officer and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working as coolies. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin goes missing, he agrees to take part in order to investigate. He is enraged when he sees a fellow Foshan master (Master Liu) mercilessly executed for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after giving up in a second match against three karatekas. He also comes to understand that Lin was killed in an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten Karatekas at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the invasion began (in order to conserve what little food his family had to survive), he proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal yet efficient barrage of his martial art mastery, showing barely any of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who seeks to learn more about Ip and see him fight again.Ip visits his friend Chow Ching-chuen, who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan. Chow tells Ip that a highway robbery gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and extorting money from them. Ip trains the workers in Wing Chun for self defence. Meanwhile, Miura grows impatient when Ip does not return to the arena and sends men to find Ip. These men harass Ip's family, and Ip incapacitates them. Ip and his family then go into hiding at Li Zhao's house. Meanwhile, the robbers return to the cotton mill to demand money. The workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them. Just then, Ip appears and defeats Jin Shanzhao, warning him never to harass the workers again.The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura becomes overwhelmed and is unable to fend off Ip's attacks as he effortlessly uses him as a Wooden Dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him and clearly winning.As the beaten general lies down after his defeat, Ip looks over to the crowd and hears the Chinese cheering him; within the crowd, he spots his wife and child with Chow. Just then, Miura's deputy Sato shoots Ip. This sparks a scuffle between the Chinese audience and the Japanese soldiers. During the scuffle, Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato's own gun. Ip is taken away amidst the chaos. It is revealed that he survives and escapes to Hong Kong with his family. There, Ip establishes a Wing Chun school, where his students come to include Bruce Lee.Donnie Yen is superb in his portrayal as Ip Man. The rest of the cast puts in superb performances. Sammo Hung directs the excellent fight choreography. All in all director Wilson Yip does a great job.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nationalistic Propaganda Flick,"Interesting to see this to be the highest rated martial arts movie on IMDb, which I assume is on the strength of Donnie Yen's performance and the film's overall high production values. Sadly both are wasted on a simplistic good-vs-evil script, which has more in common with Rocky IV than my mental image of Yip Man's life.The film strikes a similar sour note with me as did Zhang Yimou's Hero, instrumentalizing great film making to rouse nationalistic emotions. If this were a B movie i'd thoroughly enjoy it, but as a high budget blockbuster I'll hold it to higher standards. Ultimately this is a disservice to Yip Man's legacy as well.Watch this for the martial arts, which are great, but for a more subtle depiction of Japan's occupation of China, look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Second.For mature martial artists, movie is disappoint. Choreography is nice, but as usual with kung fu movie, very stylized.

Shortcut: if you like kung fu movies in general, u will like this one. that is were the high rate (8+ now) comes from.

Only great for the martial arts,"It seems like these days true classical style martial arts films are far and few between. Ip Man is one of these modern day rarities that chronicles the life of Ip Man, the founder of the Chinese martial arts style Wing-Chun. It's a dramatization of the Japanese takeover of Man's city of fo Shen and it tells the story of how Man used martial arts to hold his own against the Japanese and give the Chinese people the strength and courage to stand up to the Japanese oppression that had befallen the city. Quite the epic tale for someone with such a strange name.If you like martial arts films you should really enjoy Ip Man. I'm not a huge fan of them, but I can appreciate the art because it is films like this that really do display it as that, an art. The fight scenes in this movie, as anyone could guess, are the highlight of the film and that's not just because the rest of the film is slightly lacking. The martial arts action in this film is awesome. There are some great fight scenes with mind blowing choreography. They are uniquely directed and showcased beautifully. We see and hear every move and every hit and it's quite the experience to watch. Watching this film doesn't make me doubt for a second that Ip Man was one of the greatest Chinese martial artists who ever lived. Of course, the film isn't exactly designed to make you think otherwise.If you want anything juicier than great fight scenes then you won't really find it in Ip Man. I give the story plenty of credit as it does the world of martial arts justice as well as tell a historically relevant story. However, if you're looking for any emotional backing you will find none. There's room for some and the story has the potential to well up great emotion in its audience, but it falls flat on that front. This is due to a mediocre script and one dimensional characters that don't invest you in what is going on. The story itself is thankfully interesting enough, but it doesn't deliver in dialogue or characters.Of course, what we want most out of Ip Man is what we get, and that is beautifully choreographed martial arts action. The film is packed with that from beginning to end, so to say that this is a bad film because of a few problems it has connecting to the audience would be a lie. It's not a great film, but it's a very fun watch and well worth your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Movie!,"I was expecting the usual Hollywood Chinese martial arts movie, and boy was i mistaken! This movie had a great storyline and even better action scenes. It was a roller coaster of emotions, at times i had to hold back the tears. The action wasn't the usual cheesy fight scenes, the moves were unique and much more believable. The only reason why i didn't give it 10/10 was that some of the movie sets were pretty cheesy as you could tell that it was just the front wall of buildings and nothing behind them. However, because of storyline and acting i had to give it 9 to give it justice.This is a great movie if you have a spare 2 hours, besides it never felt like it was dragging on, was always so into the movie i never realised time flew by so fast.

Donnie Yen as a cool & composed Wing Chun demigod,"Donnie Yen's performance will hold your attention for the entire duration. He (as Ip Man) is an splendid example of the phrase ""Insecurities are loud, confidence is silent"".The story was set during the era of the Japanese occupation in China and portrays Ip Man as the pride and savior of Fo Shan & China. Ip Man was just too good. He overpowered every opponent in the film.Because I can't connect with martial arts and Chinese culture deeply, I automatically focus more on the story rather than the emotions. The story line was a little predictable and I started wondering if the subsequent Ip Man films would also have a similar ""Ip Man fights an undefeatable villain"" template. Let's see if I get to the subsequent Ip Man movies :)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well Worth Watching,"""Ip Man"" is a biopic of sorts about the Chinese master who created Wing Chun. He went on to have many disciples with Bruce Lee being the most famous one. But before that he had to deal with Japanese invaders and arrogant Chinese bullies from other regions.The movie begins in 1935 and Ip Man (Donnie Yen) was doing well for himself. He was married with a son and a large home. There were the occasional fights, but nothing he couldn't handle. Then, in 1937, Japan invaded, and everything changed. Life wasn't easy anymore. Food was scarce and Ip Man lost his home to the Japanese. He would have to battle the Japanese in one way or another before it was all over.""Ip Man"" is a kung-fu movie first and a biopic... maybe sixth. It's primarily about the character of Ip Man which can be indicative of all kung-fu masters: humble, generous, wise. It's also about Ip Man's incredible fighting skills and using that fighting skill against the wicked. ""Ip Man"" was angering, it was sentimental, and it was courageous.

This movie its a insult to Ip Man,"First of all i want to say that who ever wrote that review on the Ip man movie must not know anything about Ip man and Wing Chun, or he is smoking the good stuff.this movie sucks!! this is just another stupid Hong Kong Kung Fu movie and another Chinese movie making another stupid Chinese hero like Wong Fei Hung. this is not a drama, or has anything of that sort. its not a story of I man, its just Donnie Yen fighting in a Wing Chun style and showing off. Once again. Ip man had real flaws and went through real problems from rich to wealthy, to poor to dying of drug addiction. what made this man fall that far? is what a movie in his honor should be like. the fact that they let the Ip family be involve was a huge mistake. because i am sure they were against showing Ip man as a real human being. the family was more concern of saving face rather then truly immortalizing this great man.as a practitioner of Wing Chun i am truly disappointed at this world release film but i do have hope, because i know there is another movie of Ip man on the works this one will be directed by the awesome director of ""in the mood for love"" and starring the only good actor in Hong Kong T.

I'm a convert,"I've never been a ""Kung Fu movie fan"". I can appreciate and respect martial artists, especially of the various Kung Fu schools, but as far as their on-screen portrayal... not so much.It wasn't until I started to develop an interest in Wing Chun, that all references pointed me to this film. Other than Ip Man, the real ""character"" in this movie is his fighting style, which is what the movie is all about.To digress briefly: Wing Chun is an extreme close-range Kung Fu style that is used as a defensive means to counter an opponent's attack. It was developed by a female Shaolin Monk, as a more streamlined version of their traditional Kung Fu. It's a style intended to give the advantage to a smaller, weaker opponent in a fight, by being as efficient and direct as possible and as it's history shows, works exceedingly well. It's also a more meditative fighting form that takes pride in its spiritual roots and relies on senses, and tactics, over strength and height. People often liken it to playing a game of Chess, first, and fighting secondary.I bring this all up because, Donnie Yen captures the essence of this style to near-perfection! Like the fighting style, Ip Man, the first open teacher of it, was the living embodiment. You can see in Yen's acting, the calm, peaceful, mindfulness that separates this fighting style from others. This also makes the scenes where he unleashes hell on his opponents, even more brutal and visceral than most other action movies are when they try to portray the same types of combat.The other bonus that I'm a sucker for, is the genre. I would reluctantly call this a ""Kung Fu"" movie, since I feel it is more of a period drama, than an action movie. The scenery, the story, the history and the drama are all things that get layered into this movie better than any others I've seen in this same genre, and even better than many mainstream, Hollywood movies.Watching this movie, I felt the same kind of underlying, tension and anxiety building that I saw while sitting through more well known movies like ""Unforgiven"", ""The Patriot"", ""The Professional"" and even to some degree ""Master and Commander""; any movie where you follow a hero you know can beat the snot out of someone and are just waiting for them to open up a can of whoop-ass at the right moment after they get pushed to their limit.This is far from the traditional (cheesy), over-the-top, Kung Fu action flicks from the 70's and 80's. This one actually has charisma for the characters (especially the lead role by Yen) and a strong underlying story.

This film is significantly more refined than those, where the actors could leap 30' to a roof top, but it's still just about the fighting.>> The acting is actually quite good, especially for its genre.>> The story is OK, but essentially is largely shallow.>> The character development is paltry, so I felt nothing except some loathing towards the Japanese invaders (yeah, I know, we're supposed to feel that).>> The movement and tempo are OK, but again, it's a kung-fu flick.This cannot be compared to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in any real sense. The latter is an anomaly in the kung-fu genre, and an overall very well-done film.The first time I saw this, it was fun. Now it's just silly, shallow, boring. Another similar film is ""Iron Monkey"" which has equally effective acting, but a richer story.Again, you can dress it up anyway you want, but a kung-fu flick is all it is.If that's what you want, then enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is sooooo hIP,"The Movie ""Ip Man"" is full of great content. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the movie being action packed. Not only was the movie full of action it also had an excellent story line that made every fight scene meaningful. Finally the movies actors were well trained and were exactly how in action movies should be well known with the part, trained in the martial art, and have the correct personality.Additionally the action scenes were well throughout the whole movie from the first fight scene to the last. Donnie yen spent a large amount of time preparing to fight in the martial art called Wing Chun. Virtuous Sammo Hung was the one who came up with the choreography used in not just this movie but also is world renown for his choreography and acting skills. Director Wilson Yip is also a veteran director with experience.Furthermore the storyline had an awe inspiring effect to it make the viewer really feel for those during the Japanese Chinese war. This movie consists of a grandmaster bringing his country together to revolt against a Japanese general. Ip mans storyline is actually based off of the life of Master Ip in Foshan.Although this movie was amazing it should be more based off of Master Ip's life instead of the movie being loosely based off of his life maybe a little more based of of his life instead. even though it was loosely based it was still wonderful. I am extremely thankful for this amazing film.Finally the actors made the movie even more easier to watch. Donnie Yen is a great example he spent a large amount of his time preparing for the film. He made himself familiar with the type of environment that Master Ip was in. Donnie Yen also made sure he knew the martial art Wing Chun from inside out.In conclusion you should watch this movie it is great and full of great action pictures. The acting was well thought out. The action film was well choreographed and was full of action.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
i changed my opinions,"practically i didn't expect so much from this movie but after the watch i changed my opinions. the screenplay and the direction was good.making a biography with a good message in a simple way takes a lot of editing which has been done accurately and carefully up to the point and presenting the content of importance is appreciated. the war scenes and the visual effects have done it convincingly.the concept of a humble hero is very catchy . lack of replays or slow motions in the actions scenes, where the speed of martial arts is convincingly visible makes the movie more interesting after all its the biography of Bruce lee's master.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful Historical Epic Delivers Grand Fight Scenes, But Lacks a Second Gear","A beautiful, if redundant, Chinese martial arts epic set at the onset of the second Sino-Japanese war. The eponymous focal figure Ip Man, drawn straight out of the history books, is the peaceful model of restraint and self-control. His easy smile, passive existence and unmatched skills make him very easy to pull for, especially when a trying second act pushes him past the breaking point, but the flick's deep reverence for his legacy strips away any chances at suspense or tension. Though gorgeously choreographed and filmed, the major fight scenes are universally one-sided, with Ip himself rarely absorbing more than a few glancing blows on his way to flashily disarming and dispensing each opponent. Even his last foe, a towering Japanese army general who effortlessly conquers three of Ip's peers at once, leaves behind little more than a cloud of dust and a disappointed, unspoken ""is that it?"" when he quietly takes a knee. Undoubtedly a feast for the eyes, the road it walks is too straight and narrow to be considered anything more substantial.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wing Chun Wizardry at Its Finest!,"Okay, let me just start by saying that ""Ip Man"" is, hands down, one of the most incredible martial arts films I've ever seen. As a die-hard movie lover, I didn't think I'd find a film that could make me fall in love with the genre all over again, but here we are!Donnie Yen is an absolute beast as Ip Man, the legendary grandmaster of Wing Chun martial arts. The dude's got charisma, grace, and the kind of martial arts prowess that leaves you both stunned and begging for more. Seriously, the fight scenes in this movie are nothing short of spectacular. You've got your one-on-ones, your one-vs-many, and just when you think it can't get any better, BOOM! Ip Man takes on ten black belts simultaneously. I mean, come on!But it's not all fists and fury, folks. The film also explores the personal struggles and hardships that Ip Man endured, which adds depth and heart to the story. Set during the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, this historical backdrop adds an extra layer of intensity and emotion to the narrative. It's like a rollercoaster, and I was strapped in for the whole ride.The supporting cast is fantastic, too. Each character has their own unique quirks, and they all mesh together perfectly to create a memorable ensemble. Special shout-out to Simon Yam, who plays Ip Man's buddy Chow Ching-chuen - their bromance is pure gold!The only downside? Well, I could have done with a little less melodrama in some parts, but hey, nobody's perfect, right?In conclusion, ""Ip Man"" is a thrilling, emotional, and action-packed journey that's an absolute must-watch for martial arts fans and movie lovers alike. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out ASAP. Trust me, your inner martial arts fan will thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Smacking fights!,"The fights are what make this movie good. I'm not a kung fu-movie expert but I have seen my fair share and in my opinion, Ip Man has the most intense, convincing and bone-breaking fighting sequences you can expect. Huge variety and crazy speed, and on top of that, something that I think really takes the experience up a notch or two, the sounds. The hard smacking sound of the hits really stands out from the usual Hollywood thumps. It brings an edge of reality to the otherwise ""unreal"" fights. You will feel the pain!The story is heavily fictionalized, it draws inspiration from the real life character of Ip Man and the fact that he lived during a time of Japanese occupation. It makes for a great underdog story as Ip Man comes to embody the Chinese peoples defiance against the Japanese, but it has little grounding in reality. This is completely fine, as long as you do not expect a documentary.I have two beefs with this movie. One is the, at times, jarring story development. It might be a pet peeve of mine but I very much dislike it when the story is all of the sudden disrupted by words across the screen explaining why everything is suddenly different (Japanese occupation). I don't want to read it, I want to see it happen! Naturally! I understand that the movie, within its limited time frame, cannot show years of development but there are better ways to make time line jumps. This is lazy writing, it disengages you from the story and I suspect it might be a general problem with Chinese biopics (thinking of 1911, a horrible movie and a great example of this problem).My other problem is the way too big amount of one-dimensional characters. Ip Man and the cop-guy were the only ones who showed any kind of character development. The rest were shallow stereotypes who served their one particular function and nothing else. It made the movie super predictable and as a result it really diminishes the replay value for me.Ip Man and the fighting scenes made this, otherwise boring movie, great!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What Makes Someone a True Grandmaster!,"Set during the early and late 1930s, 'Ip Man' is based on the eponymous Wing Chun master. It revolves around the life of Ip Man and his significance during the Sino-Japanese War. But more importantly, it deals with a man of honour who never forgets the importance of humility. For me, it is also about control, for that is what is most important when you want to channelize your strengths in the right direction.The movie has given the proper amount of attention where it's due. All the main elements have been duly emphasized and highlighted; the characterization, the superb fight scenes and the impactful dialogues married with eclectic musical score.I'm not an expert on Chinese movies and actors, but I don't know if anyone could do more justice to the role than Donnie Yen. And even if there is, I'm still more than satisfied with his portrayal of the protagonist.What I really loved is the contrasting characteristics of Ip Man and its impressive portrayal. For a person who is as proficient in martial arts as Ip Man, the master is as modest as anyone can be. Especially for a person who is hailed as the best of all masters in the region of Foshan, a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts clubs. We get to see this at the start of the movie when he defeats one Master Liu after the latter asks him for a practice session. After the duel, Master Ip Man promises to keep the result of the fight a secret but unfortunately a kid named Yuan who witnesses the fight, ruins it for Master Liu.As the story moves forward, we see how the leader of an out-of-towners group manages to challenge and beat all the masters of Foshan. All but one. When this person challenges Ip Man, we get to see the other side of him more clearly. From a calm, modest presence he transforms into a focused, determined and aggressive individual when in a duel, very much evident from his expression and approach. Let me take my sweet time to praise the absolutely amazing action! The fight scenes throughout the movie are very well crafted. An amazing amount of detailing has been done and we can see the huge amount of effort put in to perfect them, from the point of view of filming and getting them right by the actors. All I could think of is: Light Fast Blows!After the victory, he is all the more famous and respect for him among the people of Foshan has increased manyfold. But the pleasant atmosphere of Foshan soon changes as the inevitable happens. As Japan invades China, all hell breaks loose. The Japanese oppression has reached all corners of Foshan. No stone is left unturned. Ip Man loses his home and has to struggle for existence. A man who never worked a job in his life is compelled to do so for his family. While searching for a job he meets Chow Ching-chuen, an old friend whom he had lent some money to set up a cotton mill. Chow takes him to the mill and since he can't repay him, he considers Ip Man as a shareholder in his business, an idea he is reluctant to. When he asks him to join him for lunch, Ip Man makes an excuse that he is 'not free' and has to go back. When Chow's son asks him,"" Why didn't you ask uncle Ip to stay?"", he replies (because),"" He doesn't like to owe people favours.""We see how Ip Man fights the odds and defends honour. Not just for him, but for his fellow Chinese brothers and sisters. He trains the mill workers to defend them from robbers, the same group of out-of-towners we saw previously. How the art of Wing Chun is important to him and for the Chinese spirit. We see how he emerges as the champion of hearts and the flag bearer of the Chinese freedom struggle from Foshan.This is a movie about honour and valour. It is about a one-man-armywho raises one!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great martial arts movie,"I'm not necessary a fan of kung fu movies . There is something about them that turns me off. So , I had my reservations about watching this movie.

You might be pleasantly surprised.""Ip man"" is based on real life story , yet I don't know how much of what I've seen is a product of imagination and how much of truth is here.

Thankfully the movie is told in a universal way , so every viewer from around the world will be able to relate to the story.The fights look fantastic. The music is very epic at times . The acting is good. ""Ip man"" is an interesting mix of kung fu movie and war drama. There are good portions of humor and they are well placed ( the fight in the house) . The drama is also affecting . The main hero is mild mannered man , who uses violence only when necessary . He's a very sympathetic character.""Ip man"" is not necessarily my cup of tea , but it's a good movie. Watch it – you won't regret it.

The story is just as powerful as Ip Man's fighting.,"Highs: Incredibly thrilling. I went to see Ip Man with high expectations, with it being Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung and all, and I was blown away by the fantastic choreography, the thrilling speed and skill shown by the fighters, and the superbly portrayed antagonist and protagonist.Lows: It is a bit of a propaganda film, but it's Chinese and takes place in WW2. We have all sorts of acclaimed propaganda films in America too, like Saving Private Ryan, Zero Dark Thirty, etc. There's zero issues with the portrayal of Japan in this case, since it's a war film.Verdict: Go see it. It's an R-rated movie, but a tame one at that.Some scenes might be a bit hard to stomach though, because the violence does get a bit gruesome (bones breaking, pools of blood, etc.) but nowhere near many other R-films I have watched.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Best action film I have seen,"Ip Man, a martial arts film directed by Wilson Yip, is a masterpiece that blends great storytelling with breathtaking fight scenes. Released in 2008, the movie stars Donnie Yen as the titular character and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as the villain, General Miura. The film tells the story of Ip Man, a Wing Chun master, who lived in the 1930s and 1940s in Foshan, China.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is its story. Despite being a martial arts movie, Ip Man's plot is not just about fighting but about the struggles and values of the protagonist. The story begins with Ip Man's life in Foshan, where he is respected and admired for his martial arts skills. However, after the Japanese invasion of China, his life changes dramatically, and he has to fight to protect his family and his honor. The film explores themes of sacrifice, perseverance, and loyalty, which are essential for the protagonist to overcome the challenges that come his way.The film's fight scenes are undoubtedly the highlight of the movie. Every fight is choreographed to perfection and is a treat for martial arts fans. Donnie Yen's performance as Ip Man is flawless, and his martial arts skills are awe-inspiring. His portrayal of a humble, yet fierce fighter is one of the reasons why the movie resonates with viewers. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi's performance as General Miura is also noteworthy. He plays a ruthless and cruel villain who is a formidable opponent for Ip Man. The fight scenes between the two characters are intense and gripping, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Ip Man's action scenes are not only visually stunning but also serve a purpose in the storytelling. Each fight is a progression of the story, with every move and counter-move contributing to the plot. The film's director, Wilson Yip, does an excellent job of balancing the action with the emotional moments, creating a movie that is not only exciting but also touching.One of the film's most significant achievements is how it portrays the Chinese culture and values. The movie's setting in 1930s and 1940s China is a tumultuous time, with foreign powers invading and the country in turmoil. Despite this, the film shows the Chinese people's resilience and their unwavering commitment to their traditions and beliefs. The Wing Chun philosophy, which emphasizes using one's opponent's strength against them, is a recurring theme in the movie, highlighting the importance of strategy and intelligence over brute force.Ip Man's success is not only due to its impressive action scenes and storytelling but also its historical significance. The film is based on the life of Ip Man, a real martial artist who was the teacher of Bruce Lee. The movie sheds light on Ip Man's legacy and his contribution to the development of Wing Chun, making it a must-see for martial arts enthusiasts.In conclusion, Ip Man is an outstanding martial arts film that delivers on every level. Its story is captivating, its fight scenes are breathtaking, and its portrayal of Chinese culture and values is enlightening. Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi's performances are outstanding, making the characters memorable and relatable. Wilson Yip's direction is exceptional, balancing the action and emotional moments, creating a movie that is both thrilling and touching. Ip Man is not just a great martial arts movie; it is a great movie, period.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ip Man Review (2008): The Meaning of Martial Arts and WW2,"This is one of the first R rated films I remember seeing. Seeing it on my television set had me convinced to watch more of these martial art movies. This, being an emotionally driven drama of war and the struggles of a martial artist and what martial arts should be used as.The film is set in the late 1930s Foshan, China. Foshan was a peaceful area where many people practice martial arts or take classes from teachers. Ip Man, being the richest and the strongest martial artist there at the time, was living in harmony but he has a few family problems of not spending time with his family but instead practice martial arts with the people of Foshan which gets his wife and only son upset. Eventually, our story fast forwards to the early 1940s of WW2. Foshan was captured by the Japanese and they took Ip Man's mansion and use it as a headquarter. Ip Man now lives poorly with all the other martial artists who have to fight Japanese martial artists for a small bag of rice. The music that accompanies with these scenes can get powerfully strong and the feeling of death is only around the corner for any character.The fight scenes are well choreographed, brutal and realistic. The movie itself is not beautiful at all, it is depressing and downright emotional. Every single problem or ties that go in this film are either untied or unsolved. The story can get depressing at times and it is like an Asian tv drama. If you seen any Asian tv drama, you'd expect a few things that are same as this. Man fighting for his life and his family, some die and some are beaten to death. Many friends or nearby people can die. The fight scenes can get brutal but also give you the feeling that Ip Man only uses martial arts for self protection. It's only for the fact that when he fights against the Japanese, he breaks the rule and he's no longer innocent. There can only be blood, no escape from death and the use of martial arts have been misused. Although, the meaning of martial arts can be varied from many people. Some say it's used for violence which most of the time it will be, but some people like me say that it's only for self defense and should only be used when someone tries to attack you. The themes of this film stay true: Teamwork, Family, and Controlling Yourself. Some of the emotional aspects of this film is superb and can be hard to watch often. This film is probably the hardest one to watch out of the trilogy.Many messages can be seen throughout this film throughout the minor stories or problems that cover the main problem.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some of the Most Brutal Kung Fu Fights Ever,"""Ip Man"" is the ""semi-biographical"", semi ""true story"" movie about acclaimed Kung Fu Master Yip Man, the man who would train Bruce Lee in Wing Chun. That is what the movie was sold on, was his tangential relation to Bruce Lee. If you are going into this series based on that, you may be disappointed by the lack of Bruce Lee throughout the 4 movies and spinoff. But, if you are coming into the movie looking for compelling characters and awesome fight scenes, then you are in the right place.The action in this movie is a step up from what every other fighting movie is doing right now. The camera work, the sound design and the sheer talent on display is in a league of its own. There is a fight between Ip Man and 10 Black Belts that is worth the price of admission. You can feel the pain of each hit as you watch it.But beyond the action, the character of Ip man is a fascinating one. He is noble without being arrogant. He is strong without being proud. And he is peaceful without being a pushover. He is a good guy humbly going about his business, but trouble always seems to find him. Donnie Yen puts in an excellent performance, both from the physical aspect and the emotional beats.The only critiques I would have would be the villains of the story aren't all that interesting. They are just kind of there as an obstacle for our hero to overcome. And there may be a little too much going on, when the political unrest of the time is brought up it takes on more than it can chew in a 1hr 46 min runtime. When the movie is focusing on Ip Man, his fights and his family, that is when it is at its best.All that being said, the movie definitely gets a recommendation from me. It is good to watch anytime; I am always up for Ip.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wing Chun master and Bruce Lee sifu gets his own biopic,"A stylized biographical film based on the life of Wing Chun teacher Yip Man. Yip Man would go on to influence millions through the spread of Wing Chun and his early teaching of influential martial arts star and icon Bruce Lee. The story is set in Foshan and is seen as a hub for Chinese martial arts.Yip Man is a respected martial arts master but doesn't have a school or teach. He runs off a group of rowdy Northern Chinese stylists though. Yip Man is a wealthy man but reduced to poverty by the occupation of the Japanese Army. He ends up working in a coal mine and only fights against Japanese opponents when he realizes that some of his neighbors have been taking fights against Imperial Japanese Army trainees for an extra rice ration.It's extremely patriotic, almost to the detriment of the film itself. The Japanese are virtually faceless, depicted mainly as bullies, war mongers, and instigators while 1994's Fist of Legend, a very similar film, does the Japanese some credit by showing them with more honor.Still some incredible fight scenes by the venerable Donnie Yen, who at was then 44-45 makes guys like a prime Van Damme or Seagal look pedestrian by comparison, witnessed in a brutal match with Yip Man against 10 karate practitioners. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great action, simple story","I'd heard a lot about Ip Man before finally watching it, and I think I was a bit biased by expectations though I tried to watch it objectively.I can understand why the movie was as popular as it was. It's a tale of a real-life hero and features incredible martial arts choreography. Wing Chun, a seemingly defense-oriented style of kungfu, is amazing to behold, and surprisingly, I don't recall ever seeing it on screen before this movie. The movie's two action choreographers - one of whom is Sammo Hung - took home the awards in that category in Hong Kong and Taiwan.The story, unfortunately, I found a bit too simple and bordering on hokey. Ip Man kicks butt, rallies the Chinese people, the end. I would've like to see some kind of background on him. He just simply exists and is a rich kungfu master with a wife and kid, or rather with a family that can be used against him to force him to fight. There's really not much else to his family. Or to him, for that matter.Donnie Yen seems perfect for the role. He looks like a perfectly charming, non-threatening fellow, until you get him to fight and then you're on the floor with your nose bleeding the next second. He's also capable of looking as though in profound thought, even when there's nothing much to think about.Watching brilliant kungfu thrills me as much as the next guy but I'd prefer to watch it either in an all-out action movie with a throwaway plot or as a masterpiece of direction with an engaging story to boot. Ip Man is the latter with a story that doesn't work for me, sadly. As such, I'm not too enthused about catching its sequel or unofficial prequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Blows Fearless out of the water,"Donnie Yen headlines this excellent biopic of Ip Man, a real-life historical figure who taught Bruce Lee wing chun and overcame Japanese oppression on the eve of WW2. Straight away I was reminded of the Jet Li film FEARLESS, another biopic about a real-life martial artist, but from the first fight scene I knew that IP MAN was going to be better: the wirework isn't as obvious and there are none of the cheesy CGI effects that spoiled some of the fights in the Li film.In actual fact, this turns out to be a brilliant piece of filmmaking that ranks as one of the best kung fu flicks I've seen in many years. It kicks off in typical fashion, with a fight master forced to battle a couple of up-themselves rivals, but then the story gets serious as the Japanese army arrives. As the enemy devise a tournament competition in which Chinese fighters take on Japanese soldiers, I realised I was watching a great, edge-of-your-seat film in which the story is just as good as the action sequences. And what action! It comes thick and fast, is never repetitive, and utilises Sammo Hung as action choreographer; is it just me, or is Hung getting better and better as time goes on? Here he delivers all kinds of brutal battles, from the bloody tournament bouts to a full-scale warehouse brawl and plenty of other decent stand-offs.Donnie Yen underplays his leading role while at the same time getting across a measure of the man's gravitas and dignity – no hissy fits or show-off moments here, just a quiet dedication to his cause. Simon Yam appears in a minor role, but he doesn't make much of an impact and nor does he need to: this is a film all about the leading figure and the historical backdrop in which his story unfolds. Brilliant action and a brilliant storyline equals a classic movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fearless meets Fist of Legend,"Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen are a golden duo for Hong Kong cinema. The turn of the millennium wasn't easy for Hong Kong action flicks and for a long time there wasn't much out there to strengthen the believe in a hopeful feature. But when SPL hit the screens things took a turn for the better and Yip and Yen turned into the hottest HK action duo almost overnight.Ip Man marks a change of scenery for Yip and Yen. Rather than set up their film in modern day society they flip back in time a good hundred years or so. Yip Man is China's main representative of the Wing Chun style and a true hero of the people, standing up against the Japanese when they invade China. If you're somewhat familiar with HK cinema two titles will probably pop up into your mind immediately. And if you're wondering why the film isn't called Yip Man then, it is because Wong Kar-Wai is holding that title for his own bio-epic about the man.The film plays like a mix between Fearless (Li's latest big martial arts epos) and Fist Of Legend (one of Li's most notorious films), which should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect. The storyline and fighting style is close to that of Fist Of Legend, the setting and focus on the hero is very similar to Fearless. Together they make for a compelling film while just a little lacking in the action department.Donnie Yen is made to play a role like this, especially in the beginning of the film when he remains untouchable. His Wing Chun style is strong, fast, controlled and to the point. He likes to toy with his opponents but never gives the impression of not being in control of the fight. There are some cool moves to showcase too but it is simply not as impressive as other styles. Yen might hit harder and faster but the choreography feels less like ballet. In the end, it all comes down to personal taste of course.The film looks very detailed and a lot of attention was paid to the props and setting. It looks pretty expensive and probably was, on the other hand, it feels less energetic than Yip's previous films. Not that the film calls for an in-your-face approach, but it would've been nice to get some more landmark shots in there and even though the action is well translated to the big screen, it could've used a little more oomph.There's also some humor to be found in the film and for a change it is pretty subtle for HK standards. There's a little scene with Ip Man's kid coming in on a tricycle to pass a message from his wife that caught me quite off guard. It's little extra touches like these that liven up the film a bit. The proceedings of the film are pretty typical beyond that and those who are expecting some exciting twists and turns should probably lower their expectations. Ip Man is a typical martial arts hero type film.The acting is all around strong for a film like this. Yen knows how to make a role like this work and a special mention goes out to Simon Yam who seems to be getting better and better at picking out his films. Add to that a solid final battle and as an action fanatic you can't really go wrong with a film like Ip Man.It is not as exciting and grand as similar films, but Ip Man turned out to be an extremely solid entry in the ever growing list of Yip and Yen collaborations. If you liked Fearless, you will probably like this one too. Which one you like best is probably dependent on what martial arts styles you prefer. 4.0*/5.0*",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The fights are so perfectly executed which is rarely seen.

Fight sequences was entertaining to watch from beginning to end,"I didn't even know who Ip Man was, but after finding out he was Bruce Lee's master I decided to check this movie out. It's was a pretty good martial arts flick with some pretty good fighting sequences. The scene that really stood out the most though is when Ip Man fights 10 black belts at once, although the other fight scenes didn't really stand out much to me. Maybe cause I seen to many kung fu flicks but it was still pretty entertaining to watch. The story isn't amazing or anything but it's passable, just basically about Ip Man fighting his challengers who are also pretty good martial artists and soon ends up fighting japs that wants and does occupy china. I liked how the story moved evenly paced and watching Donnie Yen(Ip Man) fight using wing chun was really cool for the most part. Although a lot of the stuff that happens is fictional in this movie, it's a movie that is still worth checking out especially for kung fu and wing chun fans.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why You Should Watch This Movie,"One single scene, about halfway through the movie, is so violent, full of revenge, and just... awesome, that I was literally about to jump out of my chair. I've seen lots of fighting movies, but very few fight scenes even come close to creating such an emotional response as this one did. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie. But be prepared for some really brutal violence, if you like that kind of thing.It's a bit of a slow-paced movie, but that's just the price you pay for a good story, which this movie definitely has. It's a very serious movie. Gives you a bit of Chinese vs Japanese history. Apparently it is based on a true story. But if nothing else, watch it for the fighting.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chinese Heroism,"As a friend of the movies like this, I have to say I enjoyed the movie very much. The tension and the fighting scenes in the movie are joy to watch. The war gives the movie it's own special look and nice difference to other martial art movies. Also the historical storytelling makes the movie feel more realistic and makes it easier to feel stronger reactions towards the Chinese. The downside of the film is the way Yip Man is made to be like a superhuman. At no part of the movie it is not hard to guess how the fights end up. Of course the praised hero of the movie cannot lose, can he? It can be seen that Wilson Yip have watched more than few Hollywood movies because some of the scenes have exactly this Hollywood hype feeling. Especially towards to an end. On the other hand this is how the best way to make sure the movie will become a hit and an audience magnet. Yip Man is a wonderful film to watch for the amusement. It might not give out deep thoughts but it works as a feature film to watch together with your friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good.,"Watched it without subtitles (or dubbing) which was pretty stupid. But hey, visually it was very cool and obviously the fight scenes didn't have a whole lot of dialogue. Donnie Yen seems pretty tough. One of those cool, wise Asian guys. Lots of patience and deep understanding 'n' stuff. The music was also quite nice but I did feel like the way a lot of it was put together (the editing I guess) was a little artificial. Not bad and probably way above Hollywood's average but still, not the style of a passionate director or group of filmmakers. Just the usual kinds of shots put together the usual kind of way. I was probably just more conscious of this because I wasn't concentrating so much on the dialogue (which most movies rely far too heavily on if you ask me).The fighting parts did seem pretty awesome overall but that doesn't make a whole movie. A few memorable shots. Drama parts also good but didn't know what was happening. Why an 8 then? I guess I'm not that impressed because I have these ideas of a totally new kind of film-making in the future. Much more intense and well-thought through than today's movies. Way better music. Much edgier and braver scripts. Ip Man just doesn't seem like a powerful, unique movie. It's just good in most areas. With some exciting fight scenes. The sets did stand out though.I don't know what to say really. This is a good movie. Nothing bad about it for the most part. It just doesn't quite have a unique feel of it's own. But it does have Donnie Yen playing a pretty cool character. But that's kind of juvenile isn't it? For a ""serious"" movie?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie talks about a legendary grandmaster who there are many people don't know him , they may know his pupil; legend Bruce Lee . Donnie Yen was marvelous on all levels in fights and in his portrait of personal life of Ip Man . Donnie Yen at one of his finest performances and may be its his best yet . I love to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li but Donnie has something special among them . He has that special serious charisma . I saw Donnie Yen first time in the cop thriller 'SPL' and he got my attention since then . This movie shows us how great Chinese Wing Chun martial art is fused with individual's spirit .

Truly inspiring and breath-taking.,"There are two kinds of movies: Those that leave you doing what you were doing before you watched it, and those that change the way you see yourself and the world around you. This is an example of the latter.From start to finish you are engaged whole-heartedly in the film. The action is simply some of the best around; scenes aren't chopped together in an incoherent mess. They are fluid, relevant, and dynamic. The symbolism is also pretty amazing throughout some of the fight scenes.This movie is also somewhat of a tear-jerker. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat throughout a great deal of it, particularly the end (which I won't mention here.) I can honestly say that I felt for every character in this film (which a few exceptions, naturally) and it was produced beautifully.All in all, you must see this movie, it may literally change your life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Goofy Kung Fu Movie with Plenty of Substance,"Ip Man follows a man, called Ip Man, who becomes a prodigy of kung fu and lives life.And that's about it. Looking back on this movie anything that resembles an actual plot doesn't start until the third act, and I'd be better off not spoiling it.It's interesting actually how this movie progresses. The first act is a goofy kung fu movie. It introduced the audience to the characters in a fun way, and really manages to make you care about and like them.The second act is a goofy kung fu movie with a cheesy romance. Considering how light-hearted the movie has been up until this point, it really doesn't feel out of place. It offers up a handful of laughs and more development of the characters and their relationships.The third act is more of a dark but still goofy kung fu movie. The tone transitions almost seamlessly, and the fights become less fun to watch and more intense thanks to what is now threatening the characters. It still manages to pull off a few goofy moments in the fights, but overall it's pretty serious. Yet somehow it still doesn't feel out of place. Nothing about this movie does, really.The fights are, as expected, amazing. The choreography is fantastic, and all of them are loads of fun to watch. While some of them were a little forced at times, it was always a pleasure to see these guys duke it out.My only real complaint would probably be with the characters, but even then they weren't bad by any standard. I still cared about them and liked them, but they just didn't stand out a whole lotOverall Ip Man is great. Each act offers something new to the movie, yet nothing feels out of place, and all the fights are fantastic. While the characters aren't developed incredibly well, everything else is. In the end I would recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ip Man, who fled China in 1949 because of his KMT background, suddenly becomes a national hero during in occupied Hong Kong.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant Martial Arts Drama,"I was very surprised how good this movie was as I randomly picked it from DVD rentals. Normally one does not believe the critics testimonials or taglines, but in this case, they were accurate. Ip Man is probably the best modern martial arts movie ever and surpasses Enter the Dragon (Bruce Lee), Legend of Drunken Master (Jackie Chan), Fist of Legend (Jet Li), etc. Why? Most martial arts movies are rated on their action. Not overall filmmaking. And I do mention modern (meaning taking place in the last 150-200 years)...not classic wushu movies (e.g., House of Flying Daggers).The film is about Ip Man, the founder of Wing Chun, who is a reluctant teacher but proud family man. The action soars when he is challenged by visiting martial artists or rival schools. Some movies are rags-to-riches but this film witnesses a hero born in affluence but drawn into poverty by war and misfortune. The drama soars when he labors hard under Japanese rule in order to feed his family. Or when he trains the factory workers to resist bullying gangs. It shows the human side of a martial artist who is humbled through a difficult war but protects his family and friends.The action is nearly as vibrant as Bruce Lee's or Jackie Chan's best. But this film surpasses them in cinematography, directing, acting and drama. The newer Hong Kong films, admittedly are better visual quality than the older films which were cheaply made. Donnie Yen brilliantly achieves the zen of acting in serious drama with his passion and calm something which Jackie Chan always seriously wanted to achieve despite his amazing comedic skills. Jet Li is a solid actor and Bruce Lee, although we respect him as a legend, wasn't a great actor. Instead Donnie Yen portrays Ip Man passionately as a family man with silent pride and inner strength.For action and Wing Chun, I'm no real expert but I've seen enough to know and I would rate the choreographed fight scenes as very good although maybe not as exciting as some other films. The most interesting fight scene was in the house with a rival teacher when Yen has to make a promise to his wife. Lightly but masterfully done. Having Sammo Hung helping out in the stunts and choreography is always an asset.Wilson Yip does a terrific job of directing if not at times a bit melodramatic but passionately done. Sing-Pui O does brilliant cinematography with subtle filter (more tastefully done than the blue of Underworld); Kenneth Mak recreates a beautiful artistic feel much like a traditional wushu film (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Kenji Kawai produces a wonderful soundtrack and Ka-Fai Cheung edits smoothly.Sadly it doesn't hit a heart in the west as it gather awards for best picture, action choreography and actor from the east. Most traditional awards (e.g, Academy Awards, BAFTA) don't know how to judge this type of film and competing in technical achievement or visual effects or choreography doesn't quite fit the western type (e.g., imagine comparing choreography of a musical like Chicago).As for the overall feel, it hits that wonderful, soaring note when you cheer for the underdog or the unstated hero. It's easy to stand up and cheer for this film, which is several times better than Rocky or Rudy. Several people criticized the film for historical accuracy but really, since when are movies that accurate? It's the storyline that grabs us. Real history sometimes is a bit boring. This film isn't.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good drama, not just martial arts","I came across this film On Demand. I was intrigued because the film was supposed to be about the mentor/tutor of Bruce Lee and, even though I know next to nothing about martial arts apart from what the average American has seen in mainstream movies, everyone's familiar with Bruce Lee so I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did as the film turned out to be a very fine drama. To me, the martial arts seemed secondary to the more important story concerning the title character's efforts to survive in Japanese-occupied China.Unlike most martial arts films, this one actually had a linear plot, believable dialog, good acting, character development, and realistic fight scenes. Although one of the thugs portrayed in the film comes dangerously close to being buffoonish, for the most part the villains-- the Japanese soldiers-- are realistically drawn as ruthless occupiers, with only one coming across as sadistic. The fight scenes seemed more grounded in reality, without all the flying around on wires or gravity-defying twists and turns. Seeing the proud former Kung Fu masters reduced to sparring (sometimes to the death)in a darkly-lit room against the karate-trained Japanese soldiers for a bag of rice to feed themselves and their families was far more dramatic and emotionally engaging than watching some hero battle a cartoonish villain in a mythical dungeon or fortress.I've never seen Donnie Yen in another film, so I can't compare this performance to others. One other reviewer mentioned that Yen hasn't achieved the status of Jackie Chan and Jet Li because of his looks. I'm not exactly sure how to interpret that, except to say that in my opinion the tall, elegantly handsome Yen has a far more aristocratic bearing than the typical martial arts action superstar. One could imagine him playing the title character in The Last Emperor.But for all its strengths, the film does have weaknesses. Unfortunately, the title character is almost too perfect to believe, and we are not provided enough background information to get some sense of where he came from and what molded him. The ending of the film is also too abrupt. Although I now know that there's a Part II, this film should have gone a little further in depicting Ip Man's transition from wounded man on the run from the Japanese to legendary martial arts master and tutor to such disciples as Bruce Lee. But, overall, a real find.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Kung Fu and Sceneray make for a Pretty Good Movie.,"The Kung Fu and choreography coupled with beautiful sets and fairly decent acting make for a pretty good movie. I really have to stop and admire just how well this movie turns out, when all is said and done. Ip Man is very revered in China, so his almost super hero ability to say and do no wrong (except not spending enough time with his wife and son) is probably well deserved.I only thought that this movie suffered perhaps in it's pacing - the beginning was so much stronger than the second half. But all in all I really enjoyed this and will be watching the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just go get it - you won't be disappointed!,"Being in the U.S., I had never heard of this movie, but checking today for something worthwhile to rent from Redbox.com, I kept seeing this movie in the inventory.I couldn't figure it out - it was titled ""Ip Man"" but had a Chinese guy striking a martial arts pose on the DVD cover. Let me tell you - this movie has the most unfortunate coincidence that this historical character's real name probably most naturally conjures up in an English-speaking person's mind a techno sci-fi storyline about ""I.P. Man.""Good thing I was curious enough about this ""Ip Man"" to search it out on IMDb here, be pleasantly surprised about its (current) 8.2/10 rating, and read all of the glowing reviews.And all of the posted reviews here are correct - the fight scenes are varied and incredible, the storyline (although historically debatable in its entirety as filmed) is well-scripted for rousing drama, some humor, deference to traditional Confucian values about family, community, and country, and of course, amazing martial arts action.From the very opening title frames, you can tell that this is not another one of your grade-B or C poorly-dubbed and shot chop-socky imports. The opening credits sequence is very classy and high quality in style, typeface, and accompanied by a driving, urgent, drum-based orchestral score that goes on to play a continuing emotionally rousing major role throughout the rest of the movie.The first scenes in the movie itself are reassuring in their set design and decoration, the lighting, the cinematography, camera movement, costuming, and acting. You get the immediate impression that this is a high quality dramatic movie, and not just another quickly slapped-together excuse to string a lot of over-the-top martial arts scenes and slapstick comedy together with the barest of plot lines.Be forewarned though since this is a native Chinese language film, if you don't speak the language, you're better off watching it with the original Chinese audio on and just reading the English subtitles. Turning the English audio dubbing on is very distracting because the vernacular slang they use just doesn't fit the more serious nature of the period and place (c'mon, do you really expect to call a young child ""Kiddo"" in a higher class family in 1930s China?).One tip - on the rental DVD, in Set Up, choose the ""English - Full Feature"" option for Subtitles. Apparently, if you just choose the plain ""English"" subtitles option, it only gives English translations of things seen in Chinese in the movie but not the actors' actual dialogue, which obviously will be of very little use to the non-Chinese speaker.True, there are a few minor fake-y bits here and there with a fighter stretching the realm of believability with a slightly-long jump or other acrobatic move, but nothing that will distract you from believing in the true artfulness and complexity of the execution of the wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. (You will find yourself going back again and again after the movie to replay the major fight scenes to just take in the artistic athleticism in those shots. Talk about how Ip Man uses opponents as human speed bags in a couple of pivotal fights!)A few observations about the Extras that were on my rental DVD: (1)The director, the actors, the fight choreographer, everybody that was interviewed was just so unfailingly polite and complimentary of each other in that culturally Asian way; just kind of nice, although it bordered on the almost saccharine if they weren't so sincere about it; (2) When you watch the few deleted scenes that are included, you will agree that the director and/or editor made the right decisions because the movie and storyline played much better without them; (3)You will be somewhat surprised by how ""tame"" some of the actors who play some of the macho characters in the movie seem to be in real life; (4)And you will be quite surprised which actors had what level of martial arts experience coming into this film; you won't believe it based on what you see in the movie, especially with the amount of time they had to learn to get to that level of expertiseAt the bottom of the DVD box, there is a tagline of ""Mentor of Iconic Legend Bruce Lee."" I predict that once this movie gets a wider audience through word-of-mouth and uniformly high ratings on here and other movie review sites, people will get to know who Ip Man really is, and he will no loner have to rely on his later historical connection to Bruce Lee to cement his rightful place in the martial arts superstars firmament. (In this movie, you get to see some of the dress and fighting moves that Bruce used in his iconic breakout movie, ""Enter the Dragon."" Maybe he was honoring Ip Man his teacher in that way?)Bottom-line: If you like martial arts action movies, this is a no-brainer. If you like quality historical docu-dramas with rousing true life underdog patriotic heroes, get it. It packs an even larger emotional wallop if you're ethnic Chinese and know about the atrocities the Japanese committed against the Chinese people before WWII. And if your wife can stand a little blood and some violent martial arts (but nowhere near the blood, guts, and gore of typical R-rated movies these days), then she will probably like it too - the fighting scenes are appropriately driven by the drama, and Ip Man always sees fighting as the last resort. Plus the story is full-bodied involving the importance of family as well as doing the right and honorable thing as an individual.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
highly entertaining with great performance from lead,"Ip Man starts off as a light, rather humorous movie about martial arts expert Mast Ip, wonderfully played by Donnie Yen with quiet grace and a twinkling eye, who spends his time wowing the town with his amazing (and beautifully choreographed) fights.About a third of the way through there is a marked shift in tone as the Japanese invade China and subjugate everyone, with martial arts masters forced to work in factories and perform in tournaments with the Japanese in exchange for bags of rice to feed their starving children.The darkened mood seems a little odd but works pretty well, and Ip continues to battle for good in some very cool fights. But to me there is a certain disconnect in the earnestness of the movie's hatred of the Japanese (who are portrayed pretty much the way American movies portray Nazis) versus the flashy combat.The story itself is apparently based on a real martial arts teacher but doesn't portray anything that actually happened to him, making it the same sort of nonsensical biopic you get in the U.S. But it is a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Go beyond the Hollywood,"I am not used to give movies a 10 rating often, but this is certainly going to be in my collection. This is a story of a saint in a time.

He is humble, honest and fearless.When things not right he was ready to die for the honor of his country, now a days these saints are no more.

"Without question, one of the best, if not the best, kung fu biographies ever...","Grandmaster Ip man is simply a superb and inspirational biographical movie about the father of modern Chinese martial arts.Shot in a modern style but embodying all the virtues of The Good Chinese Hero of Confuciansim this is a really marvelous and very good watch.The film is made by the exceptional performance of Donnie Yen as grandmaster Ip. Yes, the fighting skills are exceptional - though this is in places more explicit that many earlier fantasy kung fu movies and younger viewers should be made aware of this - but more than this Yen gives the role a true and very deep and abiding sense of stillness, dignity, and gravitas.From its beginnings, which are much lighter in tone, to the Japanese occupation, which are not, (And the Japanese here are best thought of as Nazis) the story intrigues and moves along with a wonderful sense of pace - nothing is rushed but a real sense of build-up exists.This is a masterful blend of Western styles of cinema - it is exceptionally well-lit and shot with superb grading on the film - and Eastern love of the hero story. The fight scenes are all exceptional with a real sense of mastery and vision - without resorting to either too much slapstick or out and out violence. In places the moves are simplicity personified and all the more stunning as a result.If martial arts are your thing you will absolutely love this - but if drama rather than action is also your thing - then I guarantee you will walk out a foot taller.Moving, exciting, and inspirational - an exceptional movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grandmaster Yip Man,"Usually i try to avoid movies that have Donnie Yen in them mainly because of the bad stories, plots and acting.

The story and plot is good and the acting is pretty reasonable. The fighting scenes are once again excellent as he demonstrates the Wing Chun fighting style as both fierce, gentle and philosophical.A lot of people including your friends will encourage you to watch this movie saying it is probably one of the best Chinese movies out there.

Ip Man (2008): Donnie Yen in an Excellent HK Film - A masterpiece,"Ip Man is a 2008 martial arts film based on the events and life of Grandmaster Ip Man, a teacher of Wing Chun and mentor of the legendary Bruce Lee. The film focuses on the events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in Foshan during the Sino-Japanese war. The film stars Donnie Yen, Simon Yam, Lynn Hung, Hiroruki Ikeuchi, and Tenma Shibuya.The Plot: The movie begins in 1935 - Foshan. Foshan is bustling with activites and martial arts popularity is through the roof with many masters opening their own schools and training disciples. In many people's mind there was only one martial arts master who was the best. However, this master had no interest in opening a school to teach his art. This master's name was Ip Man, played by Hong Kong martial arts action star Donnie Yen.Master Liu (Chen Zhi-hui) visits Ip Man (Donnie Yen) at his house when Ip Man is having dinner with his wife, Cheung Wing-sing (Lynn Hung), and his son. Ip Man asks Master Liu to leave and come back at another time. However, Liu insists so he stays and waits for Ip Man to finish his dinner with his wife and son. Master Liu challenges Ip Man to a sparring match. It is of friendly nature and not a hostile one. Ip Man wins the match and comes out on top.The rest of the film is focused on the Japanese occupation AKA the Sino-Japanese war and how Ip Man and Cheung Wing-sing make it through and survive. I don't to go too in depth because I don't want to give any spoilers.The film was the very first film ever made on the life of Ip Man and was directed by Wilson Yip. The fantastic martial arts choreography was done by the legendary Sammo Hung.Overall, Ip Man (2008) is a masterpiece in martial arts cinema.

Ip Man one of the best martial arts movies,"Ip Man is a masterpiece of the martial arts genre and can cater to anyone with a passion for this genre. Donnie Yen shines so brightly in this movie.Not only is he a professional martial artist but he is also a great actor with lots of artistic stamina. No doubt, the movie is one of the best, if not the best in the genre. Kudos to Donnie Yen.The sequel to the movie Ip Man II is as good as the first one with an utterly different storyline. In this movies another Bruce Lee is born. Here's the story of a genius of Wushu who took on the task of training legendary Bruce Lee. This biopic has been directed by Wilson Yip.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Film review of Yip man,"IP man was directed by Wilson Yip in 2008, and the story was based on real person who was a expert of martial arts. A main character, IP man was one master of Southern Chinese traditional martial arts in 1930's. He had a great skill and always spending time to training. In addition, there were many masters of martial arts around him thus they were good friends and competitors as well. After that, it was happened the war between China and Japan and IP man and Chinese people lost their everything. One day, Japanese soldiers ask them to struggle as practicing martial arts with them and Chinese people accepted it because they can receive food as reward for their type winning. All of them were lost and one master who is IP man's friend was killed by a soldier because of disobeys of Japanese soldier. IP man finished all of Japanese soldiers by his martial arts and then he became a hero among Chinese. Top of Japanese soldier likes his style of martial arts and he asked him to join the group of Japanese but he disagrees with his request. Finally, they decided to fight to recognise which is stronger between Chinese martial arts or Karate in front of all of Chinese people and Japanese soldiers.The main point of IP man is that the main character of IP man actually existed. In addition, the genre is action movie with including historical own martial arts. The background of the film was in Southern China and IP man was a master who did not have his training students and room even he was professional about his martial arts. China has many types of traditional martial arts and the martial arts which IP man was training, was one of famous martial arts. The story is carrying on his basic story. I do not know IP man and Japanese soldier fight in front of many people as last scene but audience may be overwhelmed with emotion when they watch it because they can get feeling if they know IP man was existed in the past. Normally, action movies are complete fiction but IP man is mixing non-fiction and fiction thus it provides to audience to be more realistic and fantasy. Also, it is unique compared with ordinary action films because of mixing. Chinese martial arts have long history and we cannot distinguish but we can see the style of Chinese martial arts by action and it will make us to be more exciting and audience may concentrate their attention on the film scenes. Therefore, audience will know more about IP man and the history of Chinese martial arts because of movie with action.Secondly, IP man shows Chinese culture identity to audience such as traditional culture, background and customs. The main scenes were action with IP man and his martial arts was traditional Chinese martial arts thus I think his politeness was basically in traditional culture and his acting which he try to fight with someone, was particular behaviour compared to other martial arts so audience can notice what Chinese martial arts is by IP man. The background of IP man was historical Chinese views so there are only Chinese traditional buildings and landscapes and also they were wearing traditional Chinese clothes. It shows audience Chinese culture identity. The film was also appeared Japanese people with Chinese and two of them has own martial arts and I believe that this point is effective to audience to watch it. IP man used his Chinese martial arts and Japanese soldier used Karate which is Japanese traditional martial arts. Their martial arts clothes were different and the acting of martial arts was also unlike. Through the scene, I think the director wanted to show audience how Chinese and Japanese martial arts are different and it is good chance to show audience about Chinese traditional martial arts. According to the story, the film could show Chinese culture identity as well.In conclusion, IP man was released in 2008 and the story of the film was located in the China-Japan war and included to Chinese traditional martial arts. Through the movie, audience could find what hero is and how were different between Chinese martial arts and Karate by their actions. I think the movie was effective to audience because it is a chance to show historical Chinese culture and also we can find history between China and Japan. I could recognise and notice about the side of Chinese, Chinese customs and Chinese society when I watched it as foreign audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece in Martial arts genre,"Had heard a lot about IPman. Finally got a chance to see it. it literally blows you away! Read that is semi biographical martial arts film very loosely based on the life of Yip Man, a grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun and master of Bruce Lee. The film focuses on events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in the city of Foshan during the Sino-Japanese War. Brilliantly directed, acted. Outstanding Background Music.The action choreography is right among the best. To say that Donnie Yen is brilliant is an understatement. He is a legend, right up there with the top martial artist actors ever. The 10 men fight in the dojo , you have to see it to believe how great Donnie yen is. Its a moment where a true wing chun grandmaster unleashes himself all guns blazing.will only say – I am not in the capacity to judge someone like Donnie yen I can only stand up and applaud his talent.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Feels Like A Good Genre Entry Point For People Like Me Who Struggle With Martial Arts Movies,"The first thing to say is that I usually struggle with martial arts films - I find them lacking grounding in reality, and feel distanced by the tone and acting styles. All of this is probably my own ignorance rather than any inherent failing in the genre. Nevertheless, my heart sank a bit when my daughter chose to watch this with me, in the dubbed version (again, not my preference) when we sat down to watch a film together. But this historical drama about the founding of a martial arts school during the Sino-Japanese war feels like a good genre entry point for people like me. The fights feel more grounded in reality, the characters more human. Some of the editing feels clumsy, and the historical context only arrives like a late guest after the film's first act; but this I found far more enjoyable and accessible than I expected. Hard for me to judge on its own merits as an example of the genre due to my own failings, but certainly more of a fruitful viewing experience than I expected.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely entertaining,"Ip Man is a loose biopic of Grandmaster Ip Man, founder of the Wing Chung branch of martial arts and mentor to Bruce Lee. The film is set in the 1930s and focuses on Ip Man's early life in Foshan, China, where he is a wealthy man and part of upper class society. Upon the Japanese invasion in 1937, Ip Man, like most other inhabitants of Foshan, is driven from his home and forced to live a meagre existence under Japanese rule. The film documents Ip Man's struggle to provide for his family and his quest to protect Chinese honour in the face of atrocities committed by the occupying Japanese forces.The film is well paced and I, for one, was gripped throughout. Donnie Yen, in the role of Ip Man, gives a great performance and is a powerful presence on screen. The supporting cast are also very good, particularly the two Japanese antagonists who provide a real sense of danger to the people of Foshan. The film also features some spectacular production design which really brings to life the 1930s Chinese setting. The contrast in living conditions before and after the Japanese invasion is lovingly rendered on screen and adds to the authenticity of the film.As this is at heart an action film, the fight scenes are particularly important and it is no surprise that they are beautifully choreographed and demonstrate some outstanding skill from the lead actors. The film manages to display enough violence to give the fight scenes authenticity but manages to avoid descending into a display of gratuitous violence at the expense of plot development.At the heart of the film is an interesting theme of the modern vs the ancient. The skillful, hand to hand combat, which is at the heart of the martial arts demonstrated in the film is, in several scenes, contrasted to the more mechanical use of modern weaponry. This is an interesting juxtaposition which raises the question of whether the technological advancements which have created modern weapons, has resulted in a loss of honour in our humanity.Sure, the film is not without its flaws. The dialogue is clunky places (although I suspect that has something to do with the English translation) and there are some glaring plot holes which you could drive a Japanese tank through. In one scene, Ip Man teaches the entire workforce of a local factory how to defend themselves from local bandits and, whilst entertaining, it is a stretch of imagination too far.The story also lacks the ring of truth, and after some brief research into the real Ip Man, it becomes clear that this is a highly fictionalised account of the man, with the focus very much on the creation of a good story rather than historical accuracy. The film is also a heavily biased representation of the Sino-Japanese war, presenting the Chinese as honourable people and the Japanese as a savage race, reliant on their weaponry.These are, however, relatively minor complaints in a film which is hugely entertaining and a fine example to Hollywood of how to make a traditional blockbuster which is reliant on acting, direction and choreography instead of special effects. It may not be fine art but, as Saturday night entertainment, this is an excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ecxcellent action film,"Ip man is the biography of Bruce Lee's martial arts master Yip Man. It begins in Foshan in the 1930s. He is a rich man of leisure obsessed with the Wing Chun fighting style and trains endlessly, causing resentment from his wife and karate competitors.In 1937 the Japanes take over and confiscate Yip Man's house and all his belongings. He is forced to labor in a mine and hears of matches with rewards of rice for the hungry winners. After a friend disappears, he demands a fight against ten men and defeats all of them.Ip Man beats all comers and eventually must fight a Japanese general and this leads to a Rocky like finish at an outdoor stage. The scene is well choreographed and realistic. The acting is excellent, so I can highly recommend this action thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top quality martial arts and a powerful story to boot.,"A powerful story about loss, loyalty and top quality martial arts. The first act is funny but very jarring when it moves into the main part of the film which is more morose and serious. The acting quality varies, but the fight scenes are great, although some of the sound effects when they do some of the moves feel unnecessary. For a biography it skips over a lot of his life, but I guess that will be covered in the other films.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Story about Bruce Lee's Master.,"I've heard about The Master from Bruce Lee and this is a movie about him. We are drawn to China this time.Ip Man's story begins in China during the Japanese occupation. This was not an easy time for the Chinese and that shaped our title hero. Here he is young and until he meets Bruce Lee some time will pass and this will be shown in the next parts. There are now four parts with the actor Donnie Yen who did it very well and has a lot of knowledge about martial arts. The style that he made great is Wing Chun and the best part is it is suitable for almost everyone because you don't need physical strength as a requirement. This movie shows how effective this style can be and can defeat anyone, even multiple opponents at once if you master it.A top movie about martial arts and you root for the hero. Highest rating from me for a great entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Don't hesitate, see this now!","Ip Man is an excellent martial arts film that combines some of the best fight scenes on film with a great story that's involving, occasionally amusing, stirring, powerful, and true.The movie is split into two parts: the beginning, where we're introduced to Ip Man, his family, his city, and his style of martial arts, and the second half, which chronicles the struggles and hardship of the characters after the Japanese invasion of World War 2. The tone of both halves is very different, but they both work equally well. And there are lots of fantastic fight sequences in both, though those in the second half are for far higher stakes than those in the first.Great acting, beautiful sets, and perfectly suited music accompany the strong story and fight choreography. It's no exaggeration to say that it's really hard to find fault in this movie.

An exhilarating martial arts film that also has a great deal of emotional depth.,"Ip Man (2010) is an exhilarating martial arts film that also has a great deal of emotional depth. Many martial arts movies are typically regarded as over-the-top and cheesy. Most of the acting is hilariously bad, the plot is stupid and the action is usually the only thing driving it. This is not the case with 'Ip Man'. While it can be over-the-top when it comes to some of the more dramatic scenes, everything else is remarkable. Great acting, an interesting plot, but above all else: extraordinary action. The choreography is unbelievably good. Not to mention how enthralling the fight scenes truly are. They kept me on the edge of my seat. I was amped up to say the least. Also, the action scenes had a purpose in relation to the plot. By the time the end credits were rolling, I had to pull myself out of the world I was locked into. This movie is completely investing, truly entertaining, and is the pinnacle of what a good martial arts movie should be. Go check it out if you consider yourself a fan of martial arts movies (or good action movies for that matter).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Awesome film with high powered martial arts fighting,"The films that Donnie Yen has done are excellent and he is an absolutely brillliant martial arts film actor who i really like. I have 8 of his films on DVD and his films are awesome and enjoyable to watch. The film Ip Man is about a fully accomplished master of Martial Arts who chooses to keep a low profile of his high powered strength in Martial Arts. The town sees and realises that Ip Mans Martial Arts strength and power is unstoppable. After the Japanese Invades, the town descends into pandemonium and struggles to survive. Ip Man rises up to challenge the evil General Miura and the Japanese forces who think that he and they the Japanese will destroy the Chinese but are wrong when they are up in a fierce and violent battle against the very powerful Ip Man. This film is an absolutely brilliant film with a brilliant story line, high powered martial arts fighting, tension and brilliant acting by Donnie Yen, Simon Yam, Lynn Xiong, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Ka Tung Lam, Siu Wong Fan and Xing Yu. The film was also dramatic which also made it a very good thing because the things that made it dramatic were done brilliantly. Donnie Yens acting and performance as Ip Man was absolutely amazing and brilliant. There were so many things that I loved about Donnie Yens acting as Ip Man in this film. His acting as a family member with a wife and son was also absolutely brilliant. I was stunned by his amazing performance as a family member and thought his performance was absolutely brilliant. The martial arts fighting done by the actors in this film was awesome to watch and see and the fight scenes which were also very tense with Donnie Yen in them were also absolutely amazing and brilliant. When watching Donnie Yen use his high powered martial arts skills when in fight scenes in the film Ip Man, I was fascinated and amazed at his speed, his strength and his skills in Martial Arts. When Ip Man fought against other very strong fighters besides the Japanese he really fought extremely well and the moves he used were absolutely awesome, high powered and brilliant. I loved the fight scene when Ip Man fought against General Miura and the film was also tense when the Japanese told Ip Man to teach them Wing Chun Kung Fu which he refused. I have Ip Man 2 and Ip Man 3 which i haven't seen yet but will watch soon and which i'm sure i will like and find maybe very good but won't be absolutely brilliant like this film. I absolutely loved watching the film and found it very enjoyable and entertaining to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yet despite the good reputation and excellent skills, Ip Man does not want to open a school, but gladly accepts private challenges of other teachers. In the background the movie's Japanese cruelty towards China in World War II. We can see how difficult life led during the occupation, and how they treated them.

One of the best martial art movies in decades,"Hard to believe that this iconic martial art franchise started 12 years ago and launched Donnie Yen straight into fame for Western audience. The film is based on the life story of Yip Man, the first person to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun and Bruce Lee's trainer. This film focuses on his struggles during WWII where Japan invaded China.Let's start with what made this movie so popular in the first place, the fight scenes. The choreography is done by the legendary Sammo Hung who manages to craft a a variety of amazing fight scenes in this movie. Every fight in this movie feels different from one another yet exciting and memorable. There are one on one fights with different style of martial arts to fighting against multiple foes to fights where he uses an object to having the surrounding create a different fight. He manages to use different styles to show a characters personality through the fight scenes by having Ip Man elegant style against a much more fast pace and ferocious, villainous fighter. This movie also contains one of the most iconic fights in martial art movie history with Ip Man vs 10 dudes being INSANELY good. Every fight and action scene in this movie is nothing short of BREATHTAKING.Major praise must be given to actor Donnie Yen who plays the titular character. He trained in Wing Chun and learnt about Yip Man mannerism from Ip Man's sons. Donnie Yen gives of a wise, calm and knowledgeable mannerism for Ip Man that makes us believe that this is a master martial artist without having the need to use flashbacks to show this. When emotional moments happen, Donnie Yen is able to show a more aggressive side to the character while somehow maintaining the gracefulness of Ip Man which is astounding. All the supporting actors also do a great job as well with each character having notable traits and personalities that contrast with Ip Man.Having great action scenes is great and all but if the story is not engaging then it won't mean much. Fortunately, Ip man has a phenomenal character driven story. The story begins pre-WWII to show how happy and successful Ip man is before. It gives a sense of his strength and personality within a couple of minutes before it gets into the meat of things, World War 2. The movie doesn't show the invasion but shows the Japan occupation of China and the effect it has on Ip Man. We get to see him struggle unlike at the beginning and show that despite him being invincible in a fight and being able to beat up anyone, his fist can't protect anything anymore. There is a lot of drama within this movie during non fights that blend perfectly with the action sequences. Even during these non fight moments it is never boring and the director successfully keeps us the audience invested in the ongoing predicament. Interestingly enough, the movie manages to have Ip Man who was already somewhat perfect to change from the beginning to the end of the movie. The movie is able to convey a very clear yet important message by the end.The score by Kenji Kawai is very beautiful which is a perfect representation of Ip Man's character. When the action happens it is more sharp and loud with drums which makes the action more thrilling. The cinematography by O Sing-Pui is very vibrant in colors during the pre WWII sequence and very grey and monotone during WWII. He also uses this color template to show how the events are changing and by the end there is a lot more color even when they are still in WWII. The use of color to help tell the story is amazing. The costume and sets are very believable and feel like an accurate representation of China during the invasion.Any flaws I really have with the movie is borderline nitpicking. The story is a very pro-China story and mildly anti Japan. It can feel incredibly cheesy during parts and near the end where they portray China as the all mighty good guys. There are also some side plot that occurs during the movie that kind of feels like padding as it doesn't really relate to the main narrative. Additionally, it also feels really silly and unrealistic compared to the rest of the movie.In the end, this is one of the best martial art movies in decades. It is exhilarating, dazzling and ultimately captivating. If you're a fan of martial arts in general then this movie is a definite must watch. If you're not a fan of martial arts then this movie is still a must watch as there is still something for everyone in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best martial arts movies I've seen,"The fights choreography is extremely well done in the sense that it fits the movie perfectly: raw, energetic, without much fluff, and just the perfect subtle amount of wire-fu to top it off. While great fight scenes are welcome, they don't come as much as a surprise in a martial arts movie (especially when Sammo Hung is in charge!) as the great acting performances and the interesting story used as a background. Add to this great cinematography and a beautiful score and I highly recommend it for any fan of martial arts flicks, but anyone in the mood for a great action movie should enjoy it as well. Also, bonus points for a random Chinese Karl Urban lookalike.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Ip Man"" (2008)","Yip Wai-shun's 2008 historical martial arts action-drama ""Ip Man"" is one of the most rollicking, rocking, socking martial arts films in years. It also has the distinction of being one of the few martial arts movies to be based on a true story. In this case, it's Wing Chun Grandmaster Yip Man (1893-1972), who once instructed a teenage Bruce Lee in Wing Chun (and we all know where Lee went afterward). The film basically tells a self-contained story set before and during the Second Sino-Japanese War in Fo Shan, China, with Ip Man (Donnie Yen, in a perfectly balanced dramatic action performance) helping to restore Chinese pride and nationalism in the wake of oppression by the invading Imperial Japanese Army. It all culminates in a vicious public - and symbolic - bout against General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), the commanding officer in charge of the Japanese military forces in Fo Shan. While ""Ip Man"" pulls no punches (no pun intended) in detailing the brutal oppression the Japanese inflicted upon the Chinese, ""Ip Man"" goes a step further in not showing a one-sided portrait of the Japanese (like so many other films have done in the past). The Japanese are indeed shown to be the brutal aggressors that they were doing that time, it also plainly shows that General Miura is at least a man of honor. The film's action sequences (choreographed by Sammo Hung) are fast and vicious, with star Donnie Yen's (a veteran of countless martial arts vehicles) excellent fighting skills at front and center.

"Superb Action, Lack-luster story","First, this is a MUST-SEE for any martial arts film lovers. The fight choreography is innovative and superbly executed. Sammo Hung choreographed and Donnie Yen performed. It really doesn't get much better than that. The fighting style was elegant yet realistic. Even if you know some of the moves must have been done with wire-work, it still doesn't take away from the sense of realism they try to give there.Acting was on par. Anyone familiar with Yen's previous world would find his turn as the soft-spoken master Ip a pleasant surprise. This role seems to fit him perfectly. I enjoyed the bits about Ip's family life in the beginning of the film.However, labeling this as ""biopic"" is a big misnomer for this film. All the events were too obviously dramatized. And my main issue with this movie is the story itself. It isn't much of anything new. It's quite a contrive plot line and became way too nationalistic (in a very trite, Hollywood way) at the end. Just overlook the weak and facile story line and you'll find a SUPERBLY entertaining movie.Besides, the action alone energized the genre and more than compensated for any defect.

Inspiring stuff...,"This martial arts film tells the story of the life of Ip Man, the Chinese martial arts master who was an inspiration to, amongst others, Bruce Lee. A beautifully made film with some really excellent martial arts on show. The film concentrates on the years up to and including the Japanese occupation of China in the late 1930's.Ip Man is a master of the art of Wing Chun, a form of Kung Fu that was not generally accepted at the time. He practiced constantly and occasionally had duels with other masters. His wife disapproved of this and thinks he should spend more time with his son. He was quite well off and did not find it necessary to work for a living, but he is well respected for his talent amongst the townsfolk. When the Japanese invade they are thrown out of their comfortable home and forced to live in poverty. Having sold most of their possessions, Ip Man decides he must find a job. He works at a yard tipping coal and many of his friends find themselves there too. A Japanese General, Miura, is a fan of martial arts and wants to see if any of the Chinese masters can beat his Japanese trained fighters. Some volunteer to fight, including a friend of Ip Man. When his friend doesn't come back, Ip Man volunteers the next time. He defeats ten opponents and the General is impressed and he challenges Ip Man to a duel. Will he accept? Well, I'll leave you hanging there so as not to give away too much.I love the way this film is shot, beautifully colourful at the beginning and then very muted and grey once the Japanese arrive in the scene. Great performances all round, particularly from Donnie Yen as Ip Man and Simon Yam as Zhou Qing Quan. Although it's quite hard to judge a performance in a foreign language.The fighting scenes are all spectacular. Beautifully choreographed and expertly performed. I did find the plot a little contrived, but quite easy to follow and I even found a few glimmers of humour here and there. Over all, a pretty good watch that's great to look at with some excellent fight scenes, oh, and the music isn't too bad either Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Life of Wing Chun Grandmaster Yip Man - Teacher of Bruce Lee,"From provincial China in the 1930s to the city of Foshan, occupied by the Japanese empire during World War II, we follow the life, teachings and struggles of a humble man who fought for education, justice and wisdom, and became an icon of Chinese resistance and modern Chinese history.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"fantastic martial arts movie, good-to-OK drama","I must have had a different experience than a large number of people who have seen Ip Man, since I came to the film about eight years after its release in China, and three years after I saw a very different film about the Ip (or Yip) Man, Wong Kar Wai's The Grandmaster. That film has some of the same characters, and its unavoidable to not have some of the same beats in the story (that Yip Man is already a master martial artist, and also a father and husband, but his life is turned upside down with the invasion of Japanese forces in the late 30's), but the style is far away from this film.Where Wong is someone totally interested in visual effects - how rain will fall on characters, how movement goes from slow motion to quicker motion and how to change things like shutter speeds with the camera - Wilson Yip (any relation to the real guy I wonder) is out to just make an entertaining, mainstream movie that is very much for Chinese audiences. Where one film is more of a mood pieces, albeit with some intense action, this is all about telling one part of the Ip Man's story, and it's all the better for it.I also knew actually that this film wouldn't really be able to cover all of the events since its now over three movies (sequels in 2010 and 2015). These events are all about Ip Man's time as a teacher of his own form of martial arts - which he tries to say, in his usual humble way, is not too different from other martial artists, though of course it's the teacher and students who learn from him who are of a higher order - and those Japanese invasion events.The strongest part story-wise is that it took a direction I wasn't so much expecting; in the first half hour, when things are relatively OK for Yip Man (played with confidence and a great way into this naturally heroic person by Donnie Yen), he seems almost *too* perfect in a way. It's like, can a guy be any more of a full-blown leader and good-hearted and kind but firm and un-shakable human being? Here's a guy who's only fault is, maybe once or twice, he doesn't look at his kids drawings, or he might, maybe, break a chair or something when a challenger comes calling for a fight.But when Ip Man and his family are put out on the street and, like everyone else in their Fu Shan village, are starving and just trying to get by the day to day, he's no longer a teacher but another survivor, and, as a greater conflict, is up against the repressive Japanese military who want to see him fight. How this happens are parts of the story I'll leave for you to find out, but suffice it to say it's one of those tales where a hero is established early on, then taken down a peg due to exterior circumstances (the fall of a village, of a people, oppression and so on), and he has to rise back up to meet the challenge set to him.Now some of this drama is acted with just enough conviction to get by, no more no less, and yet that's not exactly the reason to see the movie. I appreciated that the filmmakers kept things period-correct and used the real-life, tumultuous history in keeping with the protagonist and his adversaries (maybe my favorite character is the Chinese interpreter who Yip Man thinks for a while as a traitor, but the guy is just trying to get by like everyone else and pays dearly for just being near the Japanese for too long). The reason to see the movie is for the martial arts, and it's damn impressive; Sammo Hung does the choreography here, and he stages fights so that there is an ecstatic flow to things - it's not a rush into one thing or another, pieces build and we see a continuity with how Yip Man defends himself and/or fights his opponents. And when Yip Man gets angry in a fight (or just a little more aggressive) watch out because Yen definitely brings it.It may not be some masterpiece or anything, and it may rely a little too much (especially near the end) as a piece for its Chinese audiences to lap up more than for a worldwide one (and of course the Bruce Lee trivia is put in there because how can it not be), it's a highly entertaining spectacle that has light moments that work and dramatic parts that are never unsatisfying. It's loaded with well-shot action and if you like kung-fu/martial arts its basically a must-see, maybe only a notch below the likes of 36th Chamber of Shaolin or Five Fingers of Death in terms of the 'Holy S***' aspect of the choreography.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Modern Classic,"I consider this film to be a modern classic of HK martial arts cinema.
Sammo Hung, the king of Wing Chun choreography, directs the action, Donnie Yen gives the best performance of his career and underrated screen-fighter Fan Siu Wong is back!
The story is engaging, the acting is good and the action is top-notch in this one! The film even has an epic theme song that is the Wong Fei Hung theme of the modern era. Sure it does fall into some ""Evil Japanese"" tropes but the villain at least has some character development and isn't just a stereotype.10 out of 10, a must for Wing Chun film fans",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb martial arts,"Ip Man is a 2008 Hong Kong biographical martial arts film based on the life of Ip Man, a grandmaster of the martial art Wing Chun and teacher of Bruce Lee.In the 1930s, Foshan is a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts, where various schools actively recruit disciples and compete against each other. Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man is the most skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and maintains an almost invisible profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often resentful of the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.

"Good start to series, ending rushed","The first hour of Ip Man was excellent, one of the best martial arts films I've seen. Donnie Yen was excellent as the calm and fair Wing Chun master Ip Man who would rather help individuals than start a fight.
There was a strong supporting cast with clear characters and the action scenes it goes without saying were first rate.
However the last 30-45 minutes felt a little rushed as though the producers wanted to get it over with and move on to the sequel. I absolutely will watch the sequel just hope it's better paced towards the end than this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic Revenge Story Done Right,"This is the best kung fu movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them, including, of course, all of Bruce Lee's movies.What Bruce Lee's movies always lacked, this movie has - proper motivation for the lead actor. Bruce Lee fought for...let's just call them trivial...reasons. In his handful of great martial arts movies, he fought for:The honor of his fighting style over other fighting stylesA restaurant troubled by hooligansSomeone breaking his mother's amuletVictory in an illegal martial arts tournamentNothing too heavy there. But Ip Man is next-level stuff. The backdrop is the Japanese invasion of China in WWII. The occupiers are heartless and cruel, the occupied starving, treated as slaves. The peace-loving Ip Man, who lives by Confucian principles, is drawn into conflict with the invaders against his will, and every fight is important for its own reason. You will find yourself cheering for Ip Man not because he's a great character, though he is; but because his motivation is your motivation.The action sequences are just terrific. You want your hero to be invincible, and he is, in the most satisfying way possible.This is a great movie and I highly recommend it, even for people who aren't into the martial arts genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Martial arts master,"Ip Man (2008) being about one of the experts in the martial arts named Ip Man who was famously known for training martial artist Bruce Lee. This movie is an action biography about him that was interesting and cool to watch.Donnie Yen as Ip Man was great in this role. He was cool seeing in the fight scenes and his character was a nice guy you would like to follow, along with him doing everything to save his family and/or the town he lives in from the Japanese.The fight scenes in the movie are cool to watch, especially since they can move fluidly or move fast when they go up against other people. Ip man fighting people was cool and the way he fights back is fast and impressive to look at when he is given the chance to show his skills off.Ip Man (2008) is a cool, interesting, and sometimes fun martial arts movie that people who like martial arts movies would like to see.

The Story of Bruce Lee's Teacher,"""Ip Man"" at one time in 2008 became a breakthrough project. This is a new milestone in the history of Oriental cinema. The film is a worthy continuation of the classic Chinese action films, in which viewers are used to seeing such mastodons of the direction as Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Sammo Hung. The picture, where the main role was played by the now well-known Donnie Yen outside China, tells the story of the life of the teacher Wing-Chun Ip Man. The master was the mentor of Bruce Lee and became famous for starting the open teaching of this martial art, which no one had practiced before.The film was immediately hooked by the presentation of the material. Of course, there are a lot of combat scenes in it, which are put on an order of magnitude more realistic than in the previously familiar Chinese paintings, where you can meet constant unrealistic flights of fighters, and all the fights look more like a well-choreographed dance. ""Ip Man"" shows a completely different level of fights. The fights here look quite real, and their staging does not cause any doubt that the actors and stuntmen worked, giving all their strength. Their work was crowned with success.But I liked the movie not only for the fight scenes. The picture focuses on the history of a particular person. The plot tells about the difficult life of Ip Man and his surroundings, and the level of acting is impressive. The script and director's work allow you to fully reveal Donnie Yen's acting talent, see an unforgettable story and feel it.Ip Man appears as a wise protagonist, a decent person who is always ready to help those who need it. Despite the high position he occupies, the man has retained the features of an honest man. This is well shown in many scenes when he could have taken advantage of his position, but did not do it.The painting shows one of the difficult segments of the master's life. The action takes place in the town of Foshan, which is under the occupation of the Japanese army. Residents are hard-pressed by the burden of prisoners. Ip Man is true to himself and is not ready to go against his principles, remaining in his soul a free man who will fight for freedom to the end. This is a manifestation of the character of a real citizen of his country. Ip Man is a patriot, but not a fool. He acts based on his capabilities and the environment. And he acts competently. Many scenes allow you to tickle your nerves and watch how the main character will act at one time or another.Ip Man is disciplined. I am sure that this quality was brought up in him thanks to martial arts, which he studied all his life and passed on to others. The steadfastness of character, the ability to experience all hardships with dignity is the merit of discipline. The acting team presented a full-fledged world of the city in which the events took place. It was incredibly interesting to watch this. And again, the drama is the key aspect of the picture that made it so interesting for me personally. Great fights can be seen in many other films. Here, fights act more like an accompaniment, bright, but accompanying the main storyline. This film is about a man with a capital letter who teaches to live with dignity and not to give up under any circumstances.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's a martial arts film with an emphasis on kick ass action scenes....but boy is it enjoyable,"My colleague of mine recommended this film to me and no offence to him, but I was thinking 'hmmmm well I don't know if I really trust his judgement since he probably just likes all action no story'. But he kept telling me about it so I was like 'ok I'll check it out'.And boy am I glad I did. This has a story that also dwelves around history with the Chinese occupation of Japan. But at the heart of the story, the real message is to always remain true to yourself regardless of your circumstances. Donnie Yen playes a martial arts respected master in his community, known as Master Ip. He has a wife and a son and often has tons of challengers who come to fight with him.Sounds boring? Well it definitely isn't. Ip Man may at first look like a cheesy martial arts flick and while it has some of these elements, the character of Ipman is so likable and charismatic played wonderfully by Donnie Yen that you can't help but just respect him like he is some sort of noble wiseman. And the martial arts scenes are choreographed with such precision and excitement that you really just root for Ip man the whole way through.There is also a political message in regards to the occupation of China from the Japanese - the film I wouldn't say doesn't necessarily take sides, though obviously Ip man is the character you feel for and is Chinese so it didn't really bother me - it is based on events after all.All I can say is that I was blown away and the film kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through especially at the end. Ip Man is just a guy who values peace and dignity - he never once boasts or shows off - you just want him as your own master so you can learn some valuable lessons from him.While Crouching Tiger is still my favourite martial arts film, Ip Man is a masterpiece in its genre as well. And why am I even comparing them? They are two different movies in different styles. Just go out and see it - you won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A martial arts movie you can take serious.,"When rating a ""10"" for a movie there needs to be some careful consideration before haphazardly telling everyone ""Oh man! That movie was TEN!"" Quickly rating every movie you see as a 10 diminishes its value. A 10 means it is a movie that should be original or has an original take on a story, good cinematography, directing, casting, storyline, editing, music, etc. It should be a movie that makes you think/reflect or perhaps learn more about the depicted topic or story. Overall an excellent combinations of parts that come together to produce an amazing whole. It is actually a rare thing in Hollywood.In the category of martial arts movies there is no shortage of bad cheesy forgettable (or memorable for the wrong reasons) over-the-top flicks that quickly fade into history. IP Man actually breaks away from the norm. This is a martial arts movie that can be taken serious. There are no Chinese people running on top of trees or obviously hooked up to wires. It is loosely a biographical story on the life of Yip Man (who later trained renowned Bruce Lee). It takes place in a real world setting of China in 1930's during the Japanese occupation prior to the break out of WWII. IMDb sums up the plot nicely with, ""In 1935 in Foshan, south China, there are martial arts schools on every street corner. Ip Man is the undisputed martial arts champion, yet he has not devoted himself to teaching. Despite this, it seems that all the kung fu masters of the city are eager to fight him to improve their reputation. Written by Riccardo Amadori"" Added to that the Japanese invade causing a depression upon the town. Yip's grand estate is taken from him and he, his wife and child must move to more humble means. During this time, he along with many other towns' people are driven to slave labor in order to survive. The head Japanese commandant, Colonel Sato, has competitions amongst the Chinese and the Japanese. If the Chinese win they get a bag of rice. Yip initially refuses to fight; however a bad incident in one of the challenges causes Yip to get angry and request to fight. He then takes on 10 Japanese and of course beats them all. Since the commandant considers himself to be the best he is intrigued by Yip's win and from then on wishes to challenge him. Yip continues to refuse, but is eventually captured, which leads up to the climax of Yip vs. Sato. This was a really well executed ending. The choreography was amazing and I found my heart racing fast during this epic scene where Yip totally schools this Japanese colonel. This is definitely a scene that is worth repeating and for watching the whole movie to see.The actor, Donnie Yen, does a superb job of playing the title character. The character is not running around with his shirt off to show muscles or acting cocky in hopes to start a fight. He is an unassuming kind modest man that at first you would not think to be a grand master of Wing Chun. Donnie Yen's own skill shines through the character.Though the movie is entirely in Chinese and must be read with subtitles, you quickly forget that you are reading it since the story, choreography, action, and cinematography is that good. Within the genre of martial arts movies, this has to be one of my personal favorite. I have watched it several times and have recommended it to many people who like martial arts movies or even if they don't, they may like it for the history and biographical sense and get to see some great actions scenes in between. I give this movie a 9.5.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best in Kung Fu Physics,"IP Man, a martial arts extravaganza, delivers a hilarious twist to the legendary tale of Wing Chun. Prepare yourself for a laughter-filled ride as IP Man, played by the charismatic Donnie Yen, defies all expectations and turns martial arts on its head.In this uproarious masterpiece, IP Man breaks all the rules of traditional kung fu movies. Who needs gravity when you can effortlessly float and flip through the air? With each fight scene, IP Man takes the concept of ""wire-fu"" to a whole new level, defying the laws of physics with his absurdly acrobatic moves. It's like watching a superhero movie, only without the cape and with an overload of belly-aching laughter.But the hilarity doesn't stop there. IP Man's unorthodox teaching methods bring a whole new meaning to ""martial arts training."" Forget the solemn and disciplined atmosphere of traditional dojos; IP Man turns his training sessions into a sidesplitting comedy routine. Picture students stumbling over their own feet, accidentally hitting each other with nunchucks, and engaging in absurd slapstick antics. It's pure comedy gold.Let's not forget about the villains. They provide an endless supply of amusement as they try to outwit IP Man with their villainous plots. But what they don't know is that IP Man is a master of witty comebacks and hilarious one-liners. Get ready for a string of hilarious verbal exchanges that will leave you gasping for breath between laughter.IP Man: The Unconventional Grandmaster is a delightful departure from the serious and stoic martial arts genre. It's a wild and wacky adventure that reminds us that sometimes the best way to fight is with a good dose of humor. Donnie Yen's impeccable comedic timing and the film's outlandish action sequences make it an absolute riot.So grab your popcorn, buckle up, and get ready to laugh until your sides ache. IP Man: The Unconventional Grandmaster is a must-watch for anyone seeking a martial arts film that will tickle their funny bone and leave them in stitches. Get ready to witness a martial arts comedy like no other, where gravity is defied, jokes are abundant, and IP Man becomes the unexpected hero of laughter!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Donnie Yen Finally Cements Himself as a Great Overall Performer,"I totally love the whole movie. From the first moment to the last you get to see the best of Wilson Yip's style of filmmaking utilized at its' best backed by excellently lavish production values -- thanks to the movie company -- and of course combined with some of the best MA action --courtesy of Sammo Hung, who has now officially made his comeback as action director -- you'll ever find today in Hong Kong action cinema. But most importantly, one particular thing I find so interesting in the movie is the overall portrayal of Yip Man. It makes me realize what other martial arts semi-biopics -- such as the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA franchise, the FONG SAI YUK movies, and even FEARLESS -- totally lacks, fakes out, exaggerates on, standardizes, and carries out unjustifiably. They lack the overall faithfulness in relating the roles to the real historical persons they are based on.Aside the huge irrelevance in the movie to the real events Yip man went through (it always been that way in these semi-biopics anyway) the characterization is outstanding and sets out to create a historical character that's actually very close to the real person the role is based on, and that many know too much about through mere mythical stories in correlation to Yip Man's connection to Bruce Lee. Yip Man is rather someone who is the total opposite of usually depicted historical kung fu masters. Kung Fu masters who have all the typicalities that defines the whole sub-genre; Unstoppable, unbeatable, stern, almost cold in character, helpful and so on. Yip Man's different; He's calm, modest, gently, secretive, unwilling to do anything but things he's interested in. Plus he's only driven to act certain ways when forced. All these details are what makes the titular role so iconic and fresh in a time when the sub-genre is so dried out by countless of knock-off MA semi-biopics. I think it's time to give this kind of portraying historical kung fu masters some recognition because no one has done anything like this before.On top of what was stated, Donnie Yen's acting performance is just perfect for fleshing out Yip Man and something of a fresh take on what he can do in front of the camera in general. I can finally say that he has proven to be a great actor opposed to what he has done in the past. Things such as Donnie posing cool, and acting like himself whenever he's not action performing are no longer present. So now's the time for it: The movie is single-handedly carried by Donnie Yen and him only. That being said, the supporting cast shouldn't be ignored and is a welcoming addition in the movie. Gordon Lam, Simon Yam, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Fan Siu-Wong, Xing Yu, and newcomer Lynn Hung all provide great support. Gordon Lam particularly stands out as a cop-turned-interpreter who struggles to between choosing sides when carrying out his new job for the Japanese army to provide for himself and his family.Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen delivers 100% with this collaboration, and has by far topped all their previous works altogether -- though I still give FLASH POINT the higher credit when it comes to the action choreography as no other Donnie Yen movie -- past and present -- has topped it yet, not even this movie.

Wing Chun master Ip Man lives in Foshan province and he takes on the Japanese in this first film about the man who taught Bruce Lee,"It is not often that a film benefits from having not just one legend, but two associated with it. Ip Man has two. Starring the legendary Donnie Yen in what is quite possibly his best role ever and featuring choreography by the legendary Sammo Hung. (Who when asked how he was going to work with Yen to direct the action scenes, Hung replied matter-of-factly, ""With my mouth."") *Wikipedia*Both men are well-known for their fight choreography with Sammo nudging Donnie out by sheer number of years that he's been practising his craft.Directed with past Yen collaborator Wilson Yip, Ip Man is the ""true story"" of Yip Man grandmaster of Wing Chun and master of film legend Bruce Lee. Touted as being semi-biographical, the film is pretty liberal with the ""truth"" as things of this nature tend to be. While the rudimentary facts may be correct a lot of things were added to make the film more entertaining.Despite this frugality with the real facts, the film is a powerful one. The recreation of Foshan in Shanghai looks so authentic you feel as if the film company had really gone back in time to shoot the scenes.Some complaints were raised about Ip Man's house being incorrect and that he never shovelled coal during the occupation and the facts of his move to Hong Kong are misleading. But as the film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance says, ""print the legend."" Or in this case, make it up.Yen is stunning as the placid, peace-loving martial artist who won't give lessons and spars with the local masters privately in order to save them the public embarrassment of being beaten.At one point, he has to take on a usurper from outside the town. This ruffian fights his way through all the Foshan martial art instructors until only Ip Man is left. Going to his home, the outsider brings what looks like the members of every school in the town to watch him beat Ip Man.Everyone in Foshan knows that Ip Man will be victorious and he is.Everything changes in 1937 when the Japanese invade China and this is where majority of the drama and tension come into the film.The fight scenes are exciting, original, and furious. The Wing Chun style is breathtaking to watch and the other martial arts battles are impressive as well.The entire cadre of actors in the film sold their characters and I spotted quite a few familiar faces in it.My only complaint was that in some instances parts of the story were a bit ""over the top"" so that it almost felt like a ""kitchen sink"" drama instead of a biopic. But theatricality aside the film looks, overall, fantastic and I got caught up with the characters and the ""true"" story completely.A real 5 out of 5 stars for a film that had me munching my popcorn furiously throughout. I'm now going to ""watch' my way through the rest of the films in this four film series.Even if you don't love martial arts films the story of Yip Man could turn you into a fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wing Chun is really fast,"This film is based on a true story about Yip Man. He was the first to teach the art of Wing Chun that was first introduced by a woman. This is way all the other martial art masters at this time made fun of him. But he proved that it was just as strong and takes a lot of focus making the people around him respect it more. Some still wanted to challenge him though because they believe this art was fake. During this time Yip Man was rich, but the Japanese invaded China and took over his house and money. Being poor, he shows that the love of a family and the love of his art could get him by and one day, make him famous. In fact Yip Man actually helped train Bruce Lee. There are many great actors in this film, but I will mention a few that stick out. The star who plays Yip Man is Donnie Yen, who really shows how fast Wing Chun can be. He has a small rival in the film who is Fan Siu-Wong. He believed his style was stronger than Wing Chun. The last person I will touch base on is Hiroyuki Ikeuchi who played the Japanese general who thinks that Japanese Kung Fu is better than Chinese Kung Fu. Throughout the film you will see many different fighting styles played by great martial artist actors who appear in various US and international films. The film has an OK and touching story. The only problem is at times the story seemed in pieces. This was because they did not want to make the film super long and concentrated more on the fight scenes. But the fight scenes were a pleasure to watch and you can tell they were well planned out. Even though the story is in pieces, you see by the end what the whole picture is about and realize that Yip Man was a great man in Chinese history.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Donnie Yen is Yip Man,"This movie will appeal to all, not just martial art movie fans. It follows the life of Yip Man, the grandmaster of the Wing-Chun martial art style of combat. Wing-Chun was originally invented in southeastern mainland China by techniques devised primarily by women for self defense. Part of this is mentioned in the movie. Yip Man is played by Donnie Yen in, without a doubt, his best performance on screen. Donnie Yen's acting skills shine throught this film. I should mention that, Donnie Yen is an established martial artist, trained in Wing Chun by the son of Yip Man himself! Yip Chun. Yip Chun (84 years old at the time) was a supervisor to the movie and was very pleased with the outcome. He praised Donnie and the studio. By the way, this is not a Hollywood movie, it's a Hong Kong / Chinese production and it is AMAZING. The sound design is top notch. The musical score is excellent, composed by Kenji Kawai (a master composer of other great Eastern cinema movie scores, such as Ghost in the Shell). It is so memorable it will stick to you for years to come. The main soundtrack theme also returns -expanded- in the sequels. Cinematography, setting, costumes, atmosphere will immerse you into the time period. Acting is very good overall. Donnie Yen's acting though is impeccable. You will see Yip Man in the face of Donnie Yen from then onwards. The choreography is of the highest tier. The kicks and punches are pummeling with an audio impact that sounds so real they will make you touch your limbs to see if they are still in place. There is of course some subtle cgi in the movie, which is there only to augment the story and the fights. The movie isn't gory, or bloody but it does a perfect job at conveying the proper feelings at the right time. The villains are powerful and relentless, both the chinese northeners and the japanese general.The movie is not that historically accurate. Indeed Yip Man didn't officially start a school in Foshan, but he did occassionally teach people. Yip Man wasn't staying home all the time, as depicted in the film. He had a job, soon after returning to Foshan he was appointed as the chief of police, due to his unprecedented honor and honesty. When the Japanese arrived (in 1941 and not 1938, they didn't sieze Foshan until 1943) he joined the rebellions against them. It is true that word of his incredible skills has reached the japanese chief of police in Foshan and he was requested to teach his art to Japanese students. But Yip refused. A fight was later arranged between Yip and one of Japanese masters, in which Yip threatened promised that if he loses he will teach the Japanese his style. Yip won with ease (as in the film) but he wasn't shot, nor left Foshan until after WWII in 1949, when the communists won the civil war and confiscated Yip's estate. Yip initially left alone for Hong Kong, leaving his wife and 3 young songs behind. When he established his place in HK, opened a dojo he brought his family along as well.Now the film's genre isn't documentary, but action and martial arts. These historical inaccuracies were inevitable, as a certain drama level has to be reached in order for profit to be made. HOWEVER the changes are not significant and in actual fact, this movie captures the spirit and character of Yip Man perfectly, which is the film's most important achievement. Yip Man was a family man, incredibly gentle and ever-smiling. He cared for his compatriots and loved them all deeply. He trained mostly alone with his Mu ren zhuang (wooden man post) perfecting his skills, which ultimately helped him to find balance and lead a happy and healthy life. This is clearly portrayed throughout the film by the masterful acting of Donnie Yen. There are multiple moments throughout that your eyes will tear. It is likely that Donnie Yen must have drooled when he was presented with the role. He loved Bruce Lee and Yip Man, his primary influence as a martial artist was Bruce Lee. Donnie Yen's performance is so authentic, it may seem otherwordly to (very-)Westerners. The other actors are all very good. The acting of Yip's wife Cheung (played by Lynn Hung) isn't the best, but it's decent and mostly fitting the real personality of his wife.You will never notice the few flaws of the film in the first viewing. You will be completely blown away. It has to be seen more than 2 times to start noticing negatives. I saw it once on cinema when it was released and two times in BluRay ever since to review it. I always loved martial arts movies, like my dad who grew up with Bruce Lee movies. This is probably my favorite martial arts movie ever. Others include Bruce Lee's movies (Bruce Lee's moves will always of course be unparalleled - no cgi involved), Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as far as i can recall right now. One real disadvantage of the movie can be the excessively and totally unnecessary dramatic fight scenes at the near start of the film involving swords and lances. That was unrealistic and never needed. Note that the director placed heavy emphasis on the fight sequences, as expected, which may bother some of the audience who will find the movie simplistic. The action of the movie is immensely entertaining. The movie is riveting. I bet that even non martial arts fans will be pleasantly surprised and engaged with it.I definitely recommend Yip Man.Rating: 9/10 - Amazing",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bruce Lee opened the flood gates. Donnie Yen carries the banner well.,"This is one of the, if not the greatest martial arts films ever made. The casting, writing, choreography, and story line are all in sync. I was in awe with this movie when I first watched it and have watched it several times since. That said, I feel it dragged on a bit too long but it is still an astounding film. I think I went through every emotion at my disposal watching this film, which says a lot about the writers, actors, and directors. What a ride!!!""Karate flicks"" have been around for decades. Bruce Lee transformed ""Karate flicks"" into a global phenomenon. His influence on-screen opened the floodgates of respect for the Asian culture and made Martial Arts mainstream around the entire globe. This amazing film is the product of Bruce Lee's achievements. In it, Donnie Yen does not disappoint!!!Donnie Yen's skills are beyond belief yet so believable. His demeanor brings a level of civility, humility, love, and courage that is unmatched. Almost everything in this movie is just right at every moment in the film with one or two exceptions. The hero is heroic without being over-bearing. He is powerful yet gentle.The wife is simply drop dead gorgeous. She was cast well and played her part. I enjoyed her various scenes and enjoyed her expressions such as her look of ""Boys will be boys even when they are grown men"". When she was ticked-off her husband knew it and had that ""uh-oh"" look on his face. She basically kept her hero husband in check. When things got rough, she was the glue that held the family together. This film captured many nuances without going off track which is simply amazing.I love true martial arts, always have. Ip Man's character is the embodiment of what martial arts is to its core. There never will be a perfect film. When it comes to a film about martial arts and more, Ip Man is as good as it gets. They are not running up walls and jumping 100 feet into the air on top of trees. The speed and agility displayed in this film without all of that stuff is incredible.I deduct one star for a somewhat clumsy sub-plot that was added but did not add to the movie and only served to make the film longer than needed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An absolute masterpiece of a martial arts movie,"This is a martial arts movie. So it's just lots of mindless action scenes, right? No! This is way more than the mundane martial arts flick.There are just so many things about this movie that allows is to transcend as a martial arts movie.The first and foremost are the martial arts scenes. I've seen other martial arts movies, and those fighting scenes were ""cool,"" but only in the sense that they are fun to watch; however, they are mainly placed only for the sake of having those scenes. But what about these action scenes? They are meaningfully placed into the film. In addition, they are more than ""cool""-looking; they are outstanding with the incredible realism and the true ""wow"" factor that are absent in other martial arts films.The second thing that transcends is the plot. It is not deficient in plot at all unlike other martial arts movies. Its plot is reasonably good even when pitted against other movies outside of this genre that are expected to have good plots.The final thing is that the characters are just exceptional for this genre. Rather than a boring hero, we have someone of significant depth that is absent in other martial arts movies.This movie trumps other martial arts movies in so many ways that it is just amazing. It is a masterpiece of a martial arts movie that delivers due to action, characters, and plot that way exceed expectations.This is worthy of Academy Awards. It's not those mindless martial arts movies; it's very meaningful, resonant, and fine-crafted.+ GREAT, GREAT martial arts scenes+ Thoughtful story+ Great characters+ Emotional resonanceScore: 10. This movie is really amazing. I would give it an 11 if I could, as this may be the best movie I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Biography
An Unusually Gentle Martial Arts Movie,"This is a rare genre movie with seemingly realistic fighting scenes with elegant, efficient short moves, and no inhuman acrobatics. From the very first moment you realize that this movie doesn't center on it's genre, it has many fighting scenes, but it's not focused on the sensation. And that is a fresh approach that makes it memorable.Additionally you have believable, sympathetic actors, not completely one-dimensional enemies (ok, one and a half dimensional), a bit of humor, simple but effective dialogs, heartwarming atmosphere and a perfect cinematography. Donnie Yen plays this man very calm and serious, with a good little sense for Chinese humor.The movie is made with a caring sympathy for people and the Chinese way of life, it takes its time to show us a society on a village level with no big conflicts before the Japanese invasion. That is the reason why I can't give it a higher rating, even if I would - Yip Man's life and the life of his family and his neighbors is a bit too happy, not complete believable, it seems to be washed or beautified, so that western watchers can enjoy it. I could even suspect that it's fantasy, If I want - which I don't, because it's a fictional movie on a Hollywood level, not a biopic, although Yip Man is a historical person. At least I don't forget that before the Japanese occupation China was at civil war (from 1930 on), so life there shouldn't have been that easy.Yip Man himself seems to be rich, he owns a big house and doesn't need to work. For such a man, he is surprisingly unpretentious, which may come from the influence of the philosophy-driven martial arts he loves.There are some clichés which can't be avoided looking back in history of the Japanese/Chinese war, but at least to show the Japanese General as a man of honor (in opposite to his lower staff) seems to be halfway realistic (If a real general would be mounted as governor of such a small town is another question).Anyone who sees a propagandistic approach should read some statistics and proved stories about the time of Japanese occupation, before judging. I think, the way the Japanese are depicted here is rather softened. Japanese saw Chinese as lower people, not as humans on the same level. They were in some ways not far from German ideas of that time.A little setback is the ending, which comes too fast and unexpected, after the movie took so much time (in a good way) to invite us into its world. I would have been also interested to learn about the General's fate. At least 10 or 15 minutes watching Yip Man recovering, maybe watching the General committing Sepukku, would not have harmed the chance for a sequel, and everyone would have seen the credits more satisfied, and would be more sure that this is the best Martial Art's movies ever.Still, one of the best - when not the best - movies in this genre I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,Biography
Chain punches from Donnie Yen,"This martial arts film is famous for its well-choreographed fight sequences. In a fight with ten Japanese samurai, the martial artist Donnie Yen displays his truly brilliant fighting ability. In particular, he punches the same person many times very fast in a extremely short period of time. It is called ""chain punches"", which is invented by Donnie Yen.",,Anonymous,Biography

Donny Yen in his defining role,"This movie won the prestigious Hong Kong academy award of 2009. Donny Yen was nominated for the award as the leading actor, and so has Wilson Yip as its director.The year is 1935, in the Chinese town of Fo Shan, there are many martial arts schools. Owner of one of the school master Liu (Chen Zhihui) challenges Ip Man (Donny Yen) to a match. Liu was no match for Ip, but asks him to keep things quiet. Ip assures Liu that no one will hear about it. But Yuan (Wong You-nam) who was climbing a tree to recover his kite was watching the match and spreads the word. Ashamed and furious Liu directs his anger towards Ip, but it soon becomes apparent that it was Yuan who spread the word.One day a martial artist named Jin (Fan Siu-wong) shows up and starts defeating all the school masters. He hears about Ip Man and challenges him. Ip is not interested but Jin tries to humiliate him. Ip's wife tells Ip to accept the challenge but don't break anything. Jin turns out to be no match for Ip either. After defeating Jin, Ip becomes somewhat of a home town celebrity, but dark clouds of war was forming. In 1938 the Japanese invaded Fo Shan, Ip's home was taken away from him, and he now had to make a meager living as a worker.Japanese soldiers shows up at Ip's work. They were recruiting sparring partners for Japanese soldiers. If they win, a bag of rice will be awarded. Ip's friend Lin (Xing Yu) volunteers. At the karate dojo, master Liu has defeated the Japanese soldier, and was returning with a bag of rice. General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) steps in and offers three vs one combat to show his skills. Lin and two other challenges, but they are no match for Miura. Lin persists on fighting, and gets killed by Miura. Following day, noticing that Lin is missing, Ip goes to the karate dojo. There he witnesses master Liu challenging three Japanese soldiers, and getting defeated. After he's lost, Liu is shot in the head and killed. Miura is furious that Sato (Shibuya Tenma) shot Liu and orders him not to use guns in the dojo ever again. Ip witnessing the murder, and sensing that Lin has been killed there also, challenges 10 Japanese and defeats them. Miura impressed asks Ip to come back again, and asks his name. Ip replies that he's not coming back, and he's just a Chinese man. But Li (Lam Ka-tung) who was interpreting, tells Miura that he will be back and his name is Yo Mon (Ip Man in Japanese).In the mean time, Jin who was defeated by Ip has turned into a bandit. Yuan has joined him also. Now they are terrorizing Ip's close friend Chow's (Simon Yam) factory. Chow asks Ip to teach kung fu to the workers for protection. Ip obliges, and the factory workers are now being trained in Wing Chun. Jin shows up to the factory again with his bandits, but this time he's met with workers trained in kung fu. Amongst them he sees Ip Man. He challenges Ip again, but loses. Japanese are now looking for Ip and Li is ordered to find him. They show up at the factory and offers him a position as an instructor. Ip refuses, but Li interprets to Miura that Ip is considering the offer, and wishes to challenge him. Miura accepts the challenge, and date is set for their match.The movie is almost tailor made for Donny Yen to star in. He even looks a bit like Ip Man himself. His martial art skills really shines in this movie. Portraying a calm and powerful master is spot on for his personality. This movie is made by seasoned staff, and the quality shows. Sammo Hung is the fight sequence choreographer. One honorable mention goes to the movie's producer Ramond Wong. He's been producing entertaining movies in Hong Kong for over a quarter century. This is his crowning achievement as well.While this movie was made in Chinese Hong Kong, and negative propaganda about communist China was omitted in the story, it was the Cultural Revolution and the Red Army that confiscated all of Ip Man's property in China, and forced him to relocate to Hong Kong in 1949.This is one of the best martial art movie to come out of Asia, and is recommended for viewing by action movie, and Asian movie fans alike.",,Anonymous,Biography
One Of The Greatest Martial Arts Film Of All Time,"Martial arts in cinema generally have this tendency to go way over-the-top in its depiction. Some find that overly exaggerated action ridiculously fun while for others, it's plainly stupid. However, there are also a few examples out there that have captured this combat style in a very grounded manner while managing to stay within the laws of physics. And Ip Man is definitely one of those flicks.Ip Man is a semi-biographical account of the legendary Chinese martial artist Yip Man who popularised the Wing Chun fighting style but is best known around the world as the teacher of yet another Kung-fu legend, Bruce Lee. Set before & during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the plot covers the change brought in the peaceful life of the grandmaster & everyone around him in the city of Foshan after the Japanese invasion.Brilliantly directed by Wilson Yip, Ip Man is a highly character-driven story that's filled with some of the most amazing martial arts sequences ever put on the film canvas. It takes its action seriously, keeps it realistic to a considerable extent but also manages to mix a bit of humour in it, especially in the first half. One action scene definitely stands out & you'll know which one I'm talking about once you've seen it yourself.The script may not be an entirely authentic account of the grandmaster's life but the artistic license taken for dramatic effect never really deviates from what it's all about. Camera-work is expertly carried out, Editing provides a frenzy pace to the whole narrative, background score is beautifully composed & Donnie Yen is absolutely impeccable in the iconic role of Yip Man. In fact, of all the actors who've played that role before or after, he's the best at it.On an overall scale, Ip Man is one highly explosive, incredibly thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying cinema that's great enough to be ranked amongst the finest examples of its genre. It is wonderfully balanced in all departments of filmmaking, benefits hugely from Donnie Yen's committed performance & features regular moments of action that don't end up making a complete joke of its sacred combat style. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography
Deep Honor to Yip Man,"""Yim Wing Chun"" needs to have her story told, of her Family, Her courage, Her life circumstance, and her role in the creation and ultimate design of this technique. Inner Peace, the power to dissolve conflict quickly, the strength to defend the powerless, and the practice to anticipate the weakness of the opponent's next move, are all integral parts of the format. Master Yip Man will not rest easily if the talent and skill of the founding priests and Master are not told to those ears that search for the truth. The movie is GREAT in exciting the Master's cause of Triumph over Operession. We must all pay respect to those who follow the Master's ways.",,Anonymous,Biography
Common,"Although touted as a biopic, this story is common enough to be cliche: Chinese are noble and good and at their best when humble; Japanese are treacherous, without honor and bad to the core. That's it in a nutshell. The best of the Chinamen (Ip Man) can only be pushed back so far until he finally unleashes himself to kick some well-deserving Japanese butt. Even Ip Man's circumstances humble his wife to admit she's been whiny and unsupportive (unworthy of her husband's love and patience). The story is so common as to be as predictable as any rom/com, diminishing any punch from the fight sequences.",,Anonymous,Biography
