Gripping story with well-crafted characters,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Where are the accolades?,"This movie is rated 63 on the imdb top 250 movie list, showing that people obviously like this movie, and with good reason. But why the hell didn;t this movie garner at least one single oscar or golden globe nomination??natalie portman's performance was terrific as the emotionally ravaged matildha - best actress nomination for sure.jean reno should have been nominated for a best actor nomination. the fact that the audience is led to feel sympathy and sorrow for a hitman speaks words enough about his performance.gary oldman is fantastic as the corrupt and psychotic cop. his character is so repulsive and chilling, but at the same time so quirky and interesting to watch. best supporting actor nomination.luc besson. when this man will get some kudos for his work i never know. the professional, in my opinion, is his greatest achievement as a director and, considering the fact he has helmed classic cult films such as nikita and the fifth element, the professional must rate highly as one of the best films of the 90's atleast! best film and best director nominations should have been given.but no, it was all too easy to heap praise on the feel good movie forrest gump, and shun the movie that, through its intensity and tragedy, better highlights the value of life and love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest thrillers of all time.,"A hitman is forced to look after twelve year old Matilda, who's family has been killed.Leon was and will forever be a masterpiece, it is a thought provoking, dramatic and pretty violent thriller, one that will actually challenge you, making you question what's actually happening in front of your eyes.Violent and bleak in parts, but not lacking some humour, the game of charades for example is a real hoot, and breaks the serious narrative up a little.Best scene for me, the showdown in The Gent's toilet, where Matilda finally confronts Stan, the acting is off the scale.The relationship between Leon and Matilda is complex, but one thing that I noticed, is that every aspect of it is driven by Matilda, not Leon, he just goes with the flow.The acting is phenomenal, there are a trio of first class performances, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman as you'd expect are captivating, but credit to a young Natalie Portman who is on par, defying her young age and inexperience, no wonder.This amazing film still packs a punch.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Excellent, smart action film.","Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
a symphony in film,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece of violent Characterisations and fast action-shooting,"An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the ""Version Integral"" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an ""offending"" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. ""The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar."" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""La Cité des Enfants perdu"". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Very good in some ways, problematic in others","When her family are slaughtered by a corrupt DEA officer and his men, a 12 year old girl takes refuge in a neighbour's apartment. A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his protégée.This was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.While I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while Léon does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Would be a great film, if it wasn't so disgusting","The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because the performances were incredible. Gary Oldman was phenomenal, and this was Natalie Portman's first acting credit, and she did so well considering how young she was. But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda's relationship.Mathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn't do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It's clear that this film is a reflection of Besson's own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Brilliant Conflict,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"""I like these calm little moments before the storm...""","Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or ""hit men"". They're the standard ""badass"" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). Léon, however, flips this cliché on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.Léon begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Léon, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. Léon is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, Léon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of Léon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, Léon is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Being a good hitman takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one's life.,"I first saw this in the late 90s.

Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.Things I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells.

"""I take no pleasure in taking life...""","""...if it's from a person who doesn't care about it.""What really stands out for me (aside from the really excellent direction of the action sequences) is the too-brilliant for its own good script. Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way that's both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version (""The Professional"") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw ""Leon"" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler.

Unforgettable,"When I first watched this film at the cinema, I wasn't aware of IMDb. I've since watched it probably 4 or 5 times, and have recently bought the Directors Cut. Having used IMDb a lot recently, I checked out Leon. It was kind of heart warming, having a great deal of my memories of this movie from the previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading the comments.It is a glorious film. One that I've not been able to forget for all the best reasons. I think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms a movie i.e., editing or cinematography, and you'd be hard pushed to find fault.What makes this film Extra Special however, is the emotional 'ballet' taking place throughout the film.My emotions were pretty much assaulted by a gang of joy/sadness/hate/fearful anticipation/love/empathy/shock/horror/hope.It's one of those films.I adored/respected/loved Leon (I still watch nearly every film with Jean Reno in).I fell in love with Matilda. I've watched everyone of Natalie Portman's films since too.I was already a fan of Gary Oldman. This film just added extra glue to that bond. He made a brilliant sociopath, in direct contrast to Leon's (anti-)sociopath.I occasionally feel for a character (or two if it's a great romance), but it's very rare for me to be drawn into three so very different people's intimate lives so easily.It's a shame there are too few films of this calibre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Intense, gripping, stylish and poignant with one of the best feature debuts ever","Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield.

Luc Besson directs this one with plenty of bloody and uber stylish action scenes and some really touching moments. The music is pretty damn fantastic and the editing is crisp. Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime.

"A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Good acting, bad acting, big plot holes...","It is a mystery to me why ""The Professional"" is rated so high here on the IMDb...#62 as I write this. To be sure, there is much to admire here. But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.Let's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.Oh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He ""chews up the scenery"" to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.In order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.Of course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?And speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.The biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to ""adopt"" a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.While watching this movie I was often reminded of the film ""Taxi Driver"" which deals with many of the same themes. ""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. ""The Professional"" does not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Favorite Movie of all-time (here is why),"I saw this movie in the theatre in 1994 and I really like it then, but at the time I wouldnt be able to tell you why. The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO, in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.Firstly, the theme of the movie - Isolation and Redemption - The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone (mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she had)The characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.Secondly, the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied, beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice, she says to him ""Is life always this hard or just when your a kid?"" Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.Thirdly, The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The close-ups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.Fourth, the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes, I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.Fifth, the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield - The bad cop - what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.Sixth, Luc Besson, director, writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50% of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience - his film depended on her and he was a little worried, no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.All I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10, of course.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The hit-man and her.,"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

One of the Greats of the 1990s,"Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by Léon Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade.This is what you get if you take ""Lolita"" (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, ""Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it."" Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman's rising star.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"A film that is truly memorable, unforgettable, legendary, and filled with emotions that you honestly can't help but feel alongside the characters & the emotional story.","Its a film where you just feel pure raw emotion as if you're the character or if you're seeing it first hand in person. A film with such a perfect selection of a cast with such underrated actors such as Jean Reno, Natalie Portman debuting in her first ever film which launched her acting career, Gary Oldman, and so many others. A film with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Its a film that's meant to be experienced through emotion, not through explanation just like Leon whenever you would see his character's facial expressions of what he would feel, like the amount of strong emotion behind it, is incredible, especially towards the end of the movie where you'd expect it to end off in a happy ending but it ends sadly. It can't be described fully in words, just through your own heart & emotion, especially with how perfect the film was, like there's no flaws with it. It's a film filled with strong emotional, action-packed storyline and soundtracks that honestly make you feel sad for Leon and Mathilda as if you're a part of them. Jean Reno truly nailed the performance like hes so underrated, and it really shows the amount of talent Natalie had which started her career in one of the greatest films of all time like all the roles were nailed perfectly. Its just a masterpiece. Not only that but this movie didn't have much of a budget either, and it turned out to be so successful and one of the greatest films of all time, which you can't deny, its something that everyone agrees on, like it or not, it is. Luc Besson the director literally nailed it & also proved how even at the time you didn't need that need such a huge budget to accomplish these things, and what an era it was, and what a big name for European Films if not the greatest European film, in comparison with American films that need such a big budget to accomplish the effects, it really shows the difference between the two as all thats needed is raw emotion. Such a masterpiece, a film like I said filled with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Truly unforgettable, memorable and much more. I honestly wish it got more credit that it was unfortuantely given, it honestly deserved so much credit, especially an award for Jean Leno and his performance. Such a perfect selection, such a perfect story, film, and of course music selection. One of the few films where you experience raw emotion, and feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Good movie that is a little overrated...,"'Leon: the Professional' is a movie that follows a young girl (Nat Portman) who's family (father and brother) is killed in the wake of a drug deal gone wrong, and subsequently, taken in by a neighbouring assassin who teaches her his trade. While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies"", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Creepy for the wrong reasons,"(This review is based on the extended version)Let me start off by saying that there are aspects of this film which are very good. The action sequences are thrilling, the cinematography is appealing, and the atmosphere is intriguing. Jean Reno as Léon is great. Danny Aiello as Tony is great. Natalie Portman is also fantastic, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Natalie Portman was 12 years old (give or take a year) when this was filmed. She portrays a 12 year old girl named Mathilda. Throughout the film, she wears skimpy, tight fitting clothes, and repeatedly expresses her ""love"" for Léon. Although Léon acts as somewhat of a father figure to her, she makes it clear that she doesn't just see him as a father figure. To put it simply, Mathilda, a very troubled 12 year old girl, wants to bang this middle aged man who is her caretaker. Badly. And this movie isn't subtle about it.It wouldn't be the first time that a young girl had inappropriate feelings towards an older man. The problem is how this film never really addresses the inappropriateness of it. Léon rejects her advances rather lamely, and never explicitly does so for the right reason (SHE'S TWELVE).Let's not forget that the director of this movie dated a girl when she was 15 years old, and got her pregnant at 16.There's more that can be said about how gross all of that is, but there's more to complain about so I'll move on.Gary Oldman's character is a cartoon villain. He's silly. His performance is good, but his character is so over-the-top that it's laughable.The plot is quite simplistic. That's not horrible in and of itself, but this film is a sandwich of a basic revenge story (that's the bread) and a very inappropriate love story (that's the filler). There's a lot more filler than bread, too.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Last time I've seen this movie I was 9 years old,"And WOW! When I was a kid I've probably seen this movie at least 10 times, if not more. For the longest time I didn't feel like watching this movie because I felt like I've already seen it too many times. But God Damn! I loved it when I was 9, and since then I've read plenty of books, and experienced too much of what life can offer. All that made this movie beyond incredible for me to describe in the true richness of emotions I felt.First of all, I do think it's better than Nabokov's Lolita. And I am Russian, so trust me, it means a lot for me to say that. Lolita was incredible for the first half, but this movie kept at it the whole time. Have I mentioned it made me ball my eyes out too? Definitely a better love story than Lolita.Then, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her.Now, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though.To that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Character-Driven, Action-Packed Besson - Incredible","N.B. Spoilers within. Part action/thriller, part character study, ""Leon (The Professional)"" is a sure-fire bet for lovers of both categories. The story is about the meticulous hit-man and determined loner Leon (an amazing Jean Reno) and the precocious 12-year-old Mathilda (the equally amazing Natalie Portman) who crashes his party. They are vastly different from each other, separated not just by wide gaps in age, culture, and experience, but by their basic psychologies.Leon runs a strictly one-man show by sheer will and by necessity: it allows him to survive and flourish. But as bottled up as he is, he is marked by tragedy and sorrow. These feelings he keeps tightly compartmentalized, which makes him so successful as a killing machine. Enter Mathilda, the product of a wholly dysfunctional home, where she was regularly beaten and abused by her drug-dealing father and loveless family. Despite this, she is by nature a strong, hopeful, and highly intuitive girl. The movie throws these two together and lovingly documents their emotional journey toward each other.All of this is skillfully woven with Leon's violent line of work, providing the film with some spectacular action sequences. It gets even better when the savvy Mathilda joins Leon on the job, giving her a sense of purpose while forcing Leon to join the human race, or at least one headstrong member of it. The movie really succeeds when it goes deeply into the emotions driving each character. Mathilda, after all, is just discovering love and sexuality, which she presses on Leon, the object of her newfound desires. As for him, Leon can barely stand this nuisance at first, but gradually becomes the caring father figure she never had. The more she gets under his skin, the harder he looks into himself to do the right thing for her. This whole process becomes incredibly touching. You root for these two oddballs; they flesh out a unique love story.Meanwhile, Leon and Mathilda are up against one of the stranger villains of the 90s, the malicious D.E.A. agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman: he scores again). Stansfield is also an oddball: he is outrageously high-strung (always being pampered and brought back to reality by his fellow nasties), he pops weird pills, and rambles on about Beethoven to his soon-to-be-dispatched victims. In any case, he is a creepy, ruthless dude.Besson keeps the tension high for much of the film, letting go only long enough for the occasional scene where Leon and Mathilda have some time alone. (The two actors really shine here.) Otherwise, the film has a running undercurrent of menace and unpredictability. Compassion and cruelty weave continually in and out.The film's climax is gripping, and the do-or-die moment when Leon and Mathilda say goodbye is positively heart-wrenching. The two have come a very long way. A good word should be put in, too, for the always dependable Danny Aiello as Tony, Leon's boss and a father figure himself.This is a smart, highly enjoyable film  tight, focused, and personal. It's a rush for the senses and a gratifying story of memorable characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Manolo, one glass of milk for my friend, Léon.   .. OK, Make that Two.","This movie is a piece of Art. Truly unique in its genre. It successfully blends action, drama, thriller (...you name it) together. It’s masterfully directed by Luc Besson which proves that you don’t need a big budget to make a really good movie. The shooting is awesome- Camera angles, close to face camera focus, scenes such as Mathilda’s face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome! The Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Björk is again... Very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie contains some unforgettable dialogues & scenes too. The scene where there is a burst of laughter in the Restaurant or the toilet scene with Gary Oldman is just a treat to watch that guy act! From its explosive start to its brilliant ending, no any segments gets boring at any time, everything is relevant and you just want more!The acting by the magical Trio Jean Reno-Nathalie Portman-Gary Oldman just smokes! ‘Nuff said. Probably one of the best I’ve ever seen in a movie. You could read everything just on their facial expressions and looks real. It’s really amazing…About the controversial pedophile issue I think you guys are pushing this a little too far. The Bed scenes etc, it is not sex but platonic love as Besson said! It’s that “love in the air” that makes the movie even more gripping.Timeless classic and among just the handful of movies you could watch indefinitely… No questions. I’m always happy.

"Has merits, but made me feel uneasy","With it's soundtrack of Bjork and Sting, Luc Besson's film 'Leon' certainly reminds one of the early 1990s. The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

How else could a virile man happen to start crying watching an action movie? How else could a sophisticated man fall in love with a child? Or a tantalized pacifist's soul feel itself falling into murderous frenzy? With the means of his cinematic language Luc Besson sneaks under our skin, ignoring any mental or emotional barriers. During the movie our eyes our not the window to peek at our soul but the gateway to enter it.

Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre.

Most People Call It Overrated. I Definitely Call It The Underrated Masterpiece. The best Daring And Caring Movie Ever Made.,"Leon is an adjustment of what a true modern drama genre is. Luc Besson made a real combustion here. He made a genuinely semi drama-action film which for me definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made. Despite lack of rating from movie professionals, I stated that this movie is one of the most impacts to me. The storytelling installment that this movie had was incredibly powerful, precise, and so freaking deep. It consist of a very strong bond of a little girl to a professional assassin which maybe it's too simple as shape but will plunging the audiences into his childish cry at the time, especially at the ending.In the shape of it's plot, I think Leon is one kind of movie that have a similar plot structure as Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"", but had a different style in movie making technique and how the way the story of the plot untold. Most people said the strong point of the genre was It's action. Not for me, It was the drama which intensify the whole movie. Firstly, the director wanted to slowly generated a strong bond of It's two leads. Then in the end, BAMM.. Everythings disappeared, everything destroyed, just in short period of time. It possessing a deep desperation feeling into the audience. Audience want the happy ending because of the caring and daring reason (which accumulated expeditiously because of the two lead's strong performance, especially Portman), but the real fact that Besson was brave enough to change the way of the old happy ending style implementation. Suspense skill from Besson was perfect, giving the audience to wish the ending they want, but unfortunately It's different, It's freaking sad and painful. I tear to pieces. That's what I feel when watched Leon, I had very similar feeling from City Lights (which ending's strong point was It's uncertainty of approval), two of them (the ending) had very strong impact to audience (all age range from my experience asking other older and younger people).Despite of harsh critic of It's Pedofil issue, I definitely still appreciate Leon so much. This was one of movies that truly inspire me. Leon is the true and the most bitter-sweet movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Stunning first performance by Natalie Portman,"Despite Ms. Portman later feeling uncomfortable about her role in this film, her portrayal of a violently orphaned 13-year-old is nothing short of astonishing.After her dysfunctional family is killed by a rogue DEA agent and his cadre, young Mathilda seeks refuge with the affable hit-man living just down the hall. As she rings the doorbell, she breaks down and starts crying as it finally hits her that her little brother has just been brutally murdered.And so begins a relationship of revenge, healing and mutual affection between two very lonely people. Besson pulls no punches in revealing Mathilda's emerging sexuality as Mathilda begins to fall in love with her reluctant guardian. But unlike the misadventures of an older man and young temptress from Nabokov, the relationship here isn't seedy, cynical or perverse. It is actually quite poignant as the simple-minded hit-man quietly contains Mathilda's amorous advances without withdrawing from her. He is genuinely fond of her and this is beautifully played out by Jean Ruso as he protects and guides, as best as a hit-man can, his protégé.Ultimately, this is a love story between two people who can't have each other yet still protect each other in ways both dramatic and sublime. The love is awkward, clumsy and naïve in a gritty and tender way all at the same time. But it is genuine and heart-felt. Very few directors would be able to pull off this kind of story, so this is a bit of a gem -- I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like this again.I just love this story and Mathilda is one of my all-time favorite characters. Natalie brings a sublimely powerful performance to the screen that you will remember for a long time.I'm just sorry that she isn't proud of it. She should be. It's a powerful story. Yes, Mathilda is sexualized, but her character, as portrayed by Portman, is so much more than that. We get that. Honest, we really do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Portman shines, but that's about it","Natalie Portman is absolutely wonderful in this film, and her acting ability is truly impressive for a 13 year old. She's definitely the reason to watch it. The rest of the action film was slick and somewhat entertaining, but it felt like standard Hollywood fare, and didn't interest me nearly as much. Not a lot of it felt authentic and the dialogue was poorly written. I also think director Luc Besson sexualized Portman's character in places he didn't need to, giving the film a creepy feeling that's hard to get past.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Excellent film with a gripping story!,"This film is absolutely brilliant and amazing! It is truly a unique film with fantastic acting and action that will hold you in its grasp. Where are the awards for this film? How come this film is unnoticed? With all of the amazing acting and great storyline, I am surprised this movie did not win an Oscar! Everybody was fantastic in this film! Jean Reno gives a heartwarming performance as a sad and lonely hit-man or ""cleaner"" named Leon who lives in a secluded world in a apartment complex and Natalie Portman's character Mathilda is the one that shatters Leon's secluded world.For this being her first feature film, Natalie Portman gives an amazing and astonishing performance as a troubled little girl with a desire for revenge. Gary Oldman is also fantastic as a twisted, sadistic, and corrupted DEA agent. He is on my list for Top 10 greatest villains ever! The unique love story and father-daughter type relationship between Leon and Mathilda is handled beautifully by director Luc Besson. You will feel so much sympathy for these characters.

Stunning,"It's an absolutely stunning film. Period.Even after watching it for the 3rd time, it amazes me how you can really feel the characters coming alive. They breath, you breath. They are happy, you are happy. The most special ingredient of this movie is the mixture of emotions the story creates: For a few minutes, one could think it might be an action adventure, but then, there is the mysterious touch which elevates the viewer into another world without being totally surrealistic.Little time elapses when suddenly the mood changes again from homely, to funny, and in a blink of an eye, it becomes really dramatic. If you would hear this story in the news, it would sound absurd - ridiculously even.

Must See Movie...,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is one of the best films i've had the pleasure of watching. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year- old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
the finest work by director Luc Besson,"Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy while Besson's heavily stylized direction builds tension around sexy violence. Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces. You'll enjoy the action, but you'll remember the movie because of Reno and Portman. Leon (The Professional) is quite possibly the finest work by director Luc Besson.There's conviction in this movie, and intelligence. Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus. Even after twenty years, ""Leon: The Professional"" stands as the superlative masterpiece of action filmmaking and has yet to be matched or toppled by any director in the business.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"A Vicious, Violent & Vengeful Delight","A vicious, violent & vengeful delight that grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments and doesn't let go until the very end, Léon remains one of the finest examples of 90s action cinema that's yet to lose any of its potency and can still rival the best of what its genre has to offer today.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Great, Except for One Extremely Disturbing Element","An amoral hitman forms an unlikely bond with a precocious young girl whose family has been rubbed out in a drug hit. The acting by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is stellar, and Gary Oldman gives a gloriously over-the-top performance as unhinged antagonist. The direction and editing are flawless.Reno's hitman and Portman's survivor develop a relationship which he initially views as paternalistic and which she eventually views as romantic. This is where the movie treads very close to the vile and indefensible; and while it thankfully never entirely crosses that line it never entirely walks back its implications either. One has to wonder exactly what the hell the filmmakers were thinking, since an entirely platonic surrogate father/daughter relationship would have served the story just as well. The fun revenge/action story is totally undercut by the inclusion of this one bizarre, unnecessary and nauseating subplot.And for those who think the foregoing is just some pearl-clutching, ""reading too much into it"" hyperbole, bear in mind: when this movie was made writer/director Luc Besson was 34 and he was married to a 16-year-old-girl, who he met when she was 12. But they allegedly didn't start dating until she was 15 (and he was 33.) Because apparently 15 is the age of consent in France, and disgusting everywhere else. Odd how these facts rarely get mentioned by sickos in sicko Hollywood's captive media when discussing this movie particularly or Besson in general. But the info is right there on Wikipedia for anyone who wants to spend more than 0 seconds looking into it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Never watched better movie similar to that one,i really don't like watching movies more than one time but i learned about directors cut version and i just watched it today. it is just perfect.it is one of my all time favorite movies. i hope Luc Besson will change his mind and will make sequel.

Solid but slightly creepy.,"Ok, so this is a pretty compelling action-y thriller in the same vein as Drive (2011) for something contemporary and comparable. Good performances by all the leads and especially Gary Oldman for selling how bonkers Stanfield is.

Danny Aleio is convincing in his caring for Leon. The action sequences are very realistic and not gratuitous.

10/10 - A Masterpiece of Emotional Depth and Action,"Léon: The Professional is a rare film that strikes a perfect balance between intense action and heartfelt emotion. From start to finish, it captivated me with its unique blend of thriller elements and a deeply personal story about unlikely relationships.Jean Reno's portrayal of Léon, a hitman with a quiet yet powerful presence, is nothing short of iconic. His silent strength contrasts beautifully with the vulnerability of Mathilda, played masterfully by a young Natalie Portman. The chemistry between the two characters is what drives the film, making their bond both heart-wrenching and uplifting.Gary Oldman as the psychotic antagonist is unforgettable, delivering one of the most chilling performances in film history. His unpredictable, manic energy creates tension in every scene he's in, elevating the stakes to an entirely new level.What I love most about Léon is its ability to mix genres effortlessly-there are moments of high-octane action, but also scenes of quiet tenderness and moral complexity. The cinematography, direction by Luc Besson, and hauntingly beautiful score by Éric Serra all come together to create a film that is both visually and emotionally striking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Modern Crime Classic,"This is really two films in one. Let me explain.A movie was released in 1994 called ""The Professional"". Two years later a longer version with an additional 25 minutes appeared. This was called the International version. The shorter original version is what director Luc Besson refers to as his directors cut. Both are English language, but have a very strong French influence. Lovers of European crime films and thrillers will love this film.Both version are modern crime classics, inspired by a medieval French ballad about a knight that was in danger of losing his land through battle, until he mounts one last heroic effort and with a blood curdling battle cry (as seen in the end of the film) he hurls himself once more at the enemy and wins the day. This is one of the many spiritually profound things in this film that lift it from a generic crime film, augmented by a timeless soundtrack by Eric Serra.The plot: A lethal foreign hit-man befriends a young girl after sparing her from the same bloody fate that befalls her family, gunned down by a vicious corrupt cop and his merry band of killers. One of whom in real life would later die on September 11 (he played ""Benny"").The young girl is Mathilda (Natalie Portman in a very early role). Mathilda demands to stay with her savior, the recalcitrant hermit hit-man, Leon. This sets up a nice role reversal. The older Man should be the one that calls the shots, but he's a helpless foreigner that cannot read English and so it falls to the younger vivacious Matilda to save him right back.The socially awkward man child Leon wears ill fitting clothes made for a teenager not an adult. He really is just half a man. He spends his time between hits drinking enough milk to raise a brood of orphans, just in case the child motif wasn't established enough already. He also trains and trains his body and mind to be the sort of lethal weapon that negates the need to fully integrate into this new foreign world. Half man half child.Leon is bewildered by Matilda and doesn't know how to handle her. Mathilda eventually becomes infatuated with Leon, mistaking his paternal protective mechanism as mutual love. Some Narrow minded film critics see more to that than what it is.As soon as Matilda realizes what Leon does for a living, she demands that he teach her how to kill, hoping to learn the skills required to get revenge on those that made her an orphan. Leon flatly refuses. He also rejects her naive romantic overtures. Ashamed and rejected She runs off alone toward a bloody showdown with the corrupt cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman in his psychotically brilliant career defining role), who murdered her entire family at the start.Talk of a sequel has been bubbling along for years. Director Luc Besson has written a screenplay, but having left Gaumont (the company that produced this film) it appears they are withholding the screenplay from him as well as the rights to make said sequel, so it may never happen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Why is this movie considered good? it's just ridiculous!,"Seriously what's wrong with people? ""Best action-movie ever made"", ""one of the best of all times"", ""a touching and entertaining film""... Are u guys kidding me? This movie is just outrageous! The plot is completely stupid, the pacing is slow, the characters seem to come out directly from a comic book (particularly Gary Oldman's one who is simply laughable) and the action scenes are not good at all! Have any of you guys watched any real action movie lately? because this one clearly is not! To make things even worse the director decided to make the entire movie revolve around the sentimental and sexual tension between a killer and a 12 years old girl! And what is incredible is that everybody seems to be ok about it!

As Good As It Gets,"This film, released in 1994, still rates right up there with the top films of the action genre, and it seems like it hasn't aged a bit. I happened to catch this one the other night on a pay channel, and it was right after Matilda's family gets killed. I was immediately glued to it, even though I have seen it a few times before. It is a riveting and suspenseful film, and it scores in all departments. The style and pacing are second to none. Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve.

State-of-the Art movie,"Absolutely loved every bit of it. A true classic surprisingly underrated and overlooked in history. It is in full swing every way you look at it, it’s flawless. I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I’ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.The movie carefully drew the picture of the characters in the opening 25 min. In the art of killing, Léon is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, Léon.Then the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it’s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like. There was this fascination and perfect chemistry between the two characters. It looked so freaking real and deep that you are taken away in the skin of the characters.The cast & acting was perfect:Luc Besson wrote the script with Jean Reno as Léon in mind and no one else. The role was crafted for him and he delivers the goods. He played on his facial expressions more than words actually throughout the movie. He portrayed the character as exactly Luc wished it to be. This is his breakthrough and famous movie.Nathalie Portman was so versatile in her role as Mathilda. She pulled up into a complex and difficult role. She was wonderful and prolific considering her age (12). She shifted between different moods seamlessly (An uncontrollable burst of laughter in the Restaurant scene and a burst of tears in the ending moments of the movie). She is lovable, cute, touching and has a lovely innocent voice. Still her best acting to date.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played. You will love to hate him. I won’t hesitate to say that he was on par with the great Heath Ledger’s Joker. His lines were a killer. He’s acting was scary and funny at the same time. He's a freak. He is definitely amazing. Danny Aiello role as Tony was excellent in a minor role.Verdict: 10/10.Perfect. Memorable. Repeated viewings recommended & watch the uncut edition to enjoy the true potential of the movie. It still holds as my favorite movie after 14 years of existence. Never gets old. Glad to see it is gaining its due respect with time and still climbing the ladder in IMDb Top 250 ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Awesome movie,"I remember watching this movie when i was young. It was one of those movies that I could watch everyday after school. The action was thrilling and I always wanted to be like Leon, a stone cold bad ass with a heart.About 20 years after I first saw The Professional I watched it again and it was awesome. It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term ""silent killer"". Gary Oldman gives a masterclass performance as the main antagonist and Natalie Portman gives a performance that makes one question is she was truly a teenager or if she was older. The plot is intriguing and the pacing keeps you engaged, the stunts are believable and the action sequences will put modern movies to shame. The music is incredible and the characters have depth and humanized.Without giving out any spoilers this is a film that works in every perceivable way. An A+ for me",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Mastery of Crime and Drama,"Luc Besson's Leon is blessed with so many qualities that it not only excels in its crime-thriller genre but also in the general art of cinematography.The french director stays simple in his brilliance, to deliver an intense but deeply human thriller. Filming is subtle and intelligent, with discreet special effects that give the movie a feel a realism. The composition is tight : the 110 minutes leave time to deliver a good plot, generous action and excellent character development.This is achieved by the excellent actors portraying the three main characters. Gary Oldman expertly becomes the butchery obsessed, corrupt DEA agent. Natalie Portman is a revelation playing 12 year-old Mathilda. She shows the complexity of a strong charactered abandoned girl in a seemingly effortless performance. Jean Reno is extraordinary as Leon, the killer who lives a life of paradox, between the violence of his employment and his apparent naivety. The unlikely formation of a link between the two latter characters is the heart of the movie, where the young girl gives Leon a taste of life.Leon is an exceptional film : combining suspense and drama, subtleness and brilliance, Luc Besson signs a masterful jewel of cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

UNIQUE!,"I was in Wal-Mart yesterday looking through DVDs when I came across a movie I had seen several times on television, ""The Professional."" It was on the night before and I had to get it. I love this movie. Every character in it is an individual. When I told my mother and sister what the movie was about they looked at me with a look on their face that said ""He's a hit-man. He's--a--hit-man."" Who said hit men can't have a soul? This one does. The detail of character in this movie is stunning. It has no shame either, and proudly displays images and moments with the raw truth. This little girl does bleed, she does see violence and filth, she does smoke cigarettes and gets slapped by her father. She has no sorrow for her dead and useless family, only her innocent little brother. A hit-man is her idol because he showed her kindness, he did more for her than her family ever did.Leon himself is a great guy. I found myself wanting to be like him at some points. Even though he is a killer, the man has morals. He has more morals than anyone in any other action movie with explosions and such that I've ever seen. He's very swift on his feet and even though he seems like a very serious person, he can laugh and grin a large smile. The character is just so natural, so graceful in acting. Like I said, detail is shown very well in this movie. Ooh, my favorite though...OH, MY FAVORITE...!...Is Gary Oldman's character, Stansfield. I LOVE him! The moment he comes onto the screen my face lights up like cigarette :). I was actually attracted to him because of his character....Ooh, so deliciously evil! He delivers comedy and cruelty all in one, and he holds that gun so well! I loved how close he got to people. To tell you the truth, it made me a little uncomfortable, haha. But he got so close to Mathilda. Just him and her, and he's poking a gun right in her face. It just goes to show how merciless and serious he can be. I was happy to see the extra scene they cut out from TV right afterward when Willie comes in and interrupts and he's deciding what to do with her.Stansfield is so strange and shifty, he motions to her awkwardly with the gun to come with them, but then suddenly points it at her and takes aim, but then just thinks to himself ""forget it"" and puts his arm down. Great character. The storyline itself is good too. No one is afraid to talk about/do things that a lot of other movies won't do. They don't censor out what makes people seem real. They give a 12 year old knowledge she shouldn't know and ways of acting that most parents would shudder at. The hit-man is human and considers what he does a job and when he's not doing his job he's a very decent human being. The villain is a little wacky, but he pulls it off very nicely. He fits the part of a psycho perfectly. The lines in the movie can be catchy and touching, little moments make it all worthwhile. The scene where she walks past her dead family and up to Leon's door is so amazing. She's crying helplessly for him to open the door. I mean, you really can see it in her eyes that she's begging. Wonderful acting, especially for such a young actress. It amazes me how well she does with adults, right in her face too, and all the adult related topics too that she deals with. Anyway, I wish I could write more passionately and interestingly as do a lot of people who write comments, but I just don't think I have a large enough vocabulary. This movie is not easy to explain in words for me. I can only sum it up as ""Unique, inspiring (the whole hit-man thing...), amazing, conscious, dramatic, wonderfully acted, and talented."" Well, those words poppped into my head. I could say more, but I don't know how.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Amazing,"Luc Besson, director of La Femme Nikita, introduces us to the kind- hearted assassin Leon, in this tense thriller. After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, ""I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,"" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"A timid masterpiece, one to take your breath away better than most academy award winners today","This movie simply put is a cinematic masterpiece. Rarely does a movie get me to... practically sob unstoppably almost from beginning to end, but this one did. Every detail is licked, the music not only flows along with every moment, but adds a good deal of content all on its own.Luc Besson, unlike most directors nowadays it seems, has an excellent take on child phychology, right up there with Stephen King himself. A child is shown here not as a fragile creature in need of constant looking over by adults, but more like a member of a society like any other red-blooded American. The fact that kids are susceptible to practically all the dangers that adults are today is portrayed in the movie very well.The movie does not have scenes that attract attention by asking the actors show weakness, to cry, to express feelings with words, but everything is done in situations, music, and cinematic tricks of different kinds.This is not a movie to make one feel gooey and tender on the inside, but rather to provoke a spurt of emotion that hides inside every one of us. Not the kind that's felt by watching a romance flick. This is something different. Modern movie makers have quite a few things to learn from Besson.

And Reno gave us his best role ever. The King of Badguys has played many great characters, but Oldman is on fire here. The guy could be the best villain to ever hit the screen. I think back to some of his bad guys he's played, and those movies wouldn't be the same if he wasn't a part of them. The soundtrack is also tremendous, and the closing song by Sting really defined the whole film. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and would have done nothing different.

One of the Best Action Films Ever Made!,"Luc Besson's ""Leon"" AKA ""The Professional"" ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his ""La Femme Nikita"". The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this)Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as ""Mathilda"" the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot.The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin).Directing A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound/Music A+Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
soundtrack?,"I saw Leon 9 years ago and have never been so utterly gripped or moved by any other film since. Nathalie Portman as 'Mathilda' was mesmerising and Jean Leno has yet to excel in subsequent films, I always see him as 'Leon' (sad, yeah?) Is the uncut version only on DVD or is there a US version that someone is keeping secret from me? If so, where can I get a copy? Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film. With regards to other comments on the the 'sexual' nature of Leon and Mathilda's relationship, I'd like to think it was innocent, pure love and a lack of a decent father figure in her life, but I may change my mind when I see the uncut version!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Still one of the more quotable, entertaining, touching and flat out enjoyable films I've ever seen.","Léon is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why Léon is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering  IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope  at its core, Léon could be seen as exactly this.The film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clichés and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.The ingredients work in Léon. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage Léon (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Björk song  it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.But this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on Léon's door  the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.The film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with Léon himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a café run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of Léon are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money.But the following scenes of Léon happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to Léon's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is ""always like this"", this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for Léon  she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that Léon was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.The villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that ""we were doing our job"" hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds  they are not to be messed with. Léon is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same  Besson has made few English language films but there will always be Léon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"Unconventional love story. A professional hitman and his protege', a 12-year-old orphan.","Updated February 2020: A very intriguing, action-packed 2 hours and 11 minutes. I was bothered a bit by the same thing that bothered Ebert's accurate review, namely the idea of a young girl aspiring to be a ""cleaner"" like the man she adopts after her parents and siblings are killed by a rogue cop when a drug deal goes bad. Also the implied relationship the young girl sought, telling the hotel clerk ""he's not really my father, he's my lover."" Or the circuitous discussion of whether first-time sex is enjoyable, or the scene where she tells him to sleep next to her in the bed. This character is not a little teddy-bear hugging child, but a mature 12-year-old who wants to have a relationship with the older man, no matter how absurd it seems. Probably the French influence.However, all that aside, ""Leon"" is an entertaining and action-packed film. This was Natalie Portman's (Mathilda) first film role, two years before her smart performance in ""Beautiful Girls"", and she is quite remarkable. Gary Oldman is his usual crazy self. Jean Reno is cool as the hit man, a role that fits his image perfectly.The opening scenes, where Leon is hired to ""advise"" a man to stay out of NYC, is one of the best I have seen in any movie and establishes Leon's profession and skill set. And of course the closing OTT action. But the vast middle of the story is a non-sexual love story between Mathilda and Leon, something that neither had experienced before.I initially saw it on DVD, then more recently purchased the BluRay version which has an enhanced soundtrack, especially with inclusion of some really deep bass at appropriate places to heighten the tension. This is one of my favorite re-watches, I've probably watched it more than a dozen times. The BluRay disc also has a set of interesting extras, including actors reflecting on the experience of making Leon.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
One of the true greats of the 90's you have to watch,"Léon is a great and emotional drama that has earned its place in the top 250 movies list.Story:
The story is just amazing and unique. Great pacing, you do not feel the 2 hours 20 minutes long runtime at all. Writing is perfect, the teo main characters are traumendous and you feel with them from the first second on.The antagonist is dangerous and you want to see him die. The end is very emotional and very satisfying. (8/10)Acting:
This is were the movie has its biggest strengh. Natalie Portmans breakthrough, the performance that causes George Lucas to cast her for the biggest stage you can get. And that with 12 (!) years. You cannot believe it but it is true. She's without a doubt the star of this movie! The other cast members are doing their best and I mean it, they are very good, but they cannot reach the masterclass acting of Natalie Portman as Mathilda. (10/10)Verdict:

It's on Prime Video right now so go and watch it!(8/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A classic that totally holds up...,"This film totally withstands the test of time. You can watch it today and it still feels just as fresh and relevant as when it came out. The international cut is better than the U.S. cut, but any version is worth the watch. Even as a kid, you can tell that Natalie Portman is destined for great things. I feel like even though Gary Oldman's character is a bit over the top, he still makes him as believable as possible. But, the stand out is obviously Jean Reno. Amazing as ever. Just a perfect roll for him. I must have seen this film at least 20 times, and every time I catch some little nuance that I missed in the past or just see something differently than I had before. It is just a great, if not underrated movie, and not only worth a viewing, but many. You surely will not be disappointed, and if you somehow are, give it another chance to grow on you.

"A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film","""Leon: The Professional"" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. ""The Professional"" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is old like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all.The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as ""Leon"" are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, ""The Godfather."" Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. ""The Last Don"" didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it.This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I thought my hearing's going! I says to myself Leon's a pro!,"Never have I seen a film so well put together. Amazingly enough The Professional was the best work done by these four thespians: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello AND Gary Oldman. They probably didn't know it at the time it was released and neither did anybody else. Why this movie was denied at the Academy Awards we may never know but it was terrific. The on screen chemistry between Reno and Portman is unforgettable. Their relationship is what makes it work but the real star is Gary Oldman. He is phenomenal repeat phenomenal. His over the top performance is the best of his entire career and earned his character Agent Norman Stansfield the number 6 spot on the Entertainment Weekly's all time greatest villains list.I have read the reviews of the two people in the world who didn't like this film and it doesn't take long to figure out why they didn't like it. The first didn't have a clue about what the movie was really about (readers can draw their own conclusions about that person's mental capacity) and the other somehow arrived at the erroneous conclusion that director Luc Besson is a sellout. I'm not going to bother to respond to that. The acting was top drawer for such a small budgeted film, the dialogue was remarkable and there is enough action to keep you entertained.

"Moody and exciting, coolly defiant...but ultimately dispiriting","French filmmaker Luc Besson's darkly intriguing, absorbing modern noir about a precocious, orphaned preteen girl in New York City (Natalie Portman) who attaches herself to a thorough, yet curiously mild-mannered hit man (Jean Reno). Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action, with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately, in the third act, Besson allows the violence to take over, leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market. Still, a sleek and handsome piece of work, entertaining, mature and straightforward, with terrific performances by Reno and the shockingly unself-conscious Portman. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"""Your not going to lose me. You've given me a taste for life. I wanna be happy. Sleep in a bed, have roots""","Leon: The Professional is an absolute magnum opus of cinema, and gave me chills watching It. Its story is complex and riveting, and its theme echo's the realism of living a lonely, unhappy life.This story of a man's journey to be able to find an emotional connection, and new meaning in his life thanks to Mathilda is heartwarming and satisfying.I have seen nowadays that controversy seems to surround every classic released in the past in one way or another, it festers on destroying what was real, and had a soul, and in this film that involves the connection between Leon and Mathilda.In all honestly, people need to open their minds to reality. And see how deep and meaningful people can be. This is what happens in life, and these are the feelings of young people who are affected by traumatic incidents in their past towards mature adults which leaves them a little confused and vulnerable.It's a shame that topics like this get sensationalised, but luckily it takes absolutely nothing away from the performances within the film.Going off Luc Besson's personal life, the relationships could easily be considered a truer story in a lot of ways that could potentially delve deep into a person's past.The language, the scenery, and the dialogue all just seem so natural. It's so relaxing to be visually satisfied to see the personal growth, and development of Mathilda, the good intentions, and the human side of Léon.The devotion you form with the characters is emotionally moving, and the performances show such naturalism in their roles, that it feels like these are ordinary people, having to deal with extraordinary circumstances. It grabs your attention and gives you a sentimental attachment to the story.The acting was phenomenal. Gary Oldman (Norman Stansfield) has played a villain that will be remembered for the ages. He was so charismatic, calm, cool, collected, and vile that you detested, and feared him. When he is on screen he captures your attention and draws you in so intently that every scene feels like something sinister is just about to happen.This was Natalie Portman's platform to the big time. I have seen her in countless films and always regarded her highly as an actress. But this was something different. To play such a controversial, emotional, and demanding part would be tough for even the best performers and she handled herself extraordinarily.When I rate a film a 10. It means that it emotionally touching, and leaves my mind swimming with many thoughts, theories, ideas and new sensations. And finally, it leaves me feeling the utmost satisfaction or pure joy of being able to see something truly remarkable, and astonishing. I sometimes even dwell on the plot for days or even weeks after the film has ended.No spoilers in this review.

The Professional is a mess,"I just watched Leon The Professional and I'm a little perplexed as to why this film has such high ratings. While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.It's one thing to ask the audience to suspend disbelief but this film takes that to a whole other level. It goes so far out of the realm of possibility in places that it becomes more of a fantasy/sci fi film than a crime action film. Also what was up with the music? It was always totally inappropriate for the scenes. It was just completely off and awkward. I really wanted to like this film. I have generally been a fan of Luc Besson's other films and I'm a fan of the cast. Unfortunately this movie was a real challenge to sit through. Now there were some redeeming moments. I liked the little moments that established Leon's character. How he drinks milk, cares for his plant, and sits in the dark. I liked some of the little moments between Leon and Mathilda. There were a few good action beats. However none of these positives are enough to give the film the kind of rating that it has here on IMDb. The film is average at the very best. It offers no intelligence or soul to it's story. The concept could have worked if it was done correctly but sadly it wasn't.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"""A Dark Dance of Innocence and Brutality""","In the shadowy corners of cinema, few films resonate with the raw intensity and emotional depth of ""Leon: The Professional."" Directed by Luc Besson, this cult classic is not just a film; it's a beautifully crafted dichotomy of tenderness and violence that leaves an indelible mark on its viewers.At the heart of the movie is Leon, played to perfection by Jean Reno. He's a hitman with a heart, navigating a life mired in the grim underbelly of New York City. His world is a symphony of sleek, efficient brutality-one where each job is meticulously executed with precision. But when he inadvertently becomes the guardian of Matilda, a young girl played by the fierce and captivating Natalie Portman in her break-out role, his life takes a haunting turn. The bond they develop amidst chaos is both unconventional and heartbreaking, transforming Léon from a solitary assassin into a reluctant father figure, highlighting the fragility of innocence in a world filled with darkness.Portman's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. As Matilda, she embodies a mix of vulnerability and fierce determination, showcasing a complexity rarely seen in child actors. Their relationship is both beautiful and problematic, layered with emotional turmoil that challenges societal norms and perceptions of morality. It walks the tightrope between love and an unsettling darkness, making viewers grapple with their feelings toward the characters.Besson's direction is an artful spectacle-the cinematography creates a palpable tension, each frame dripping with atmosphere. The film is punctuated by moments of explosive action balanced with quieter, poignant scenes that linger long after each sequence. The soundscape complements the visuals, with a haunting score that captures the essence of the characters' tumultuous journey.""Leon: The Professional"" also serves as a commentary on the nature of violence and redemption. It poses difficult questions about love and loyalty in an unforgiving world, challenging viewers to consider the lines between villain and hero. The morally ambiguous world of Léon is a tapestry of stark contrasts, where love can flourish in the most unexpected places, and life can be fleeting and brutal.""Leon: The Professional"" is a tour de force that transcends genres. It's a film that juxtaposes the innocence of childhood against the cold realities of adulthood, inviting viewers to explore the depths of human emotion in the process. With unforgettable performances, masterful direction, and a haunting narrative, this film remains a badass testament to the power of cinema, proving that sometimes, the most beautiful stories are born from chaos.

Professionals and not,"It has been a while - and I don't think I had seen the Direcotrs Cut of the movie up til earlier. There is something interesting - well more than something, but let's start from the top/beginning, no pun intended.The movie starts off quite out there. It is almost comical - not just how Leon looks (the long coat and generally the way he dresses and walks - influences from the silent era? Quite possibly), but how he but even more so, the bad guys act. There is an air of amateurish and not proffesional vibe in the air.Leon of course seems to be in control of everything. So much so, that it seems his hand is detached of his body - especially when he has a knife at someones throat. A great dissapearing act commences.Leon has some very fine action scenes and has some very fine actors too. Take the three main ones - Jean Reno obviously in the main role, but also Natalie Portman as a kid and even more so Gary Oldman as the main villain. More about Natalie and her role in a second, but Gary Oldman is the ingredient that really elevates the movie above others. His performance made this movie work on many different levels.And maybe make you forget about certain things that seem weird in hindsight. There is the strange humor and the incapable almost cartoonish goons (though apparently they seem to be able to work the other side of the law - without consequences). No pun intended.The movie also has a weird relationship that builds between Natalies and Jeans character. You may have issues how she connects with him and how she is portrayed. But if you remeber being a kid, a teen, you may remember saying inappropriate things as well. She doesn't know any better - that is the best way to look at it. Otherwise you are making a case agains the movie and what it portrays.A few years later a still not adult Natalie Portman was still making men go crazy. Beautiful girls - you can see Natalie Portman and you can recognize her. Her performance is magnificent. We came to expect that from her. And I don't think making this movie scarred her in any way shape or form.There is the music the movie has and the New York vibes (mostly second unit shots I reckon). Then there is also the late great Danny Aiello. A terrific actor, who is shady, but also loveable.And back to Reno: his grumpy performance really works best. He seems to channel some heroes from the past. Strange he is not able to recognize Charlie Chaplin in a game of guess who. Even stranger still that the young Mathilde (Natalie Portman) does know Marylin Monroe and Chaplin ... especially because she only seems to be watching cartoons.As good as Leon is, there are certain things that do not make much sense. Like entering a bulding he has no business being in .. and without much resistence either ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Because this looks and sounds good ... and is the movie that made Reno and Portman the stars they are ... or at least send the on the trajectory they are (still) on.Edit: Matthilde is cursing a lot - okay? Hopefully you answer with okay, even if that would make Leon angry (if you know, you know)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

a must-see for everyone,"Leon is by far and away one of the best films I have seen. When I first read a synopsis of the plot I was wary of how good it would be but I am so glad that I got round to watching this masterpiece. There are many reviews that recommend viewing the extended version (US) which has 25 mins more scenes included, but after seeing both versions I honestly would say that the shorter version is better. There is nothing from the scenes cut that is relevant to the plot, and the character development in no way suffers from this deletion; rather I found more association with the characters in the shorter viewing than I did with the extended version, but in the end the film is just as good regardless of which version you watched.

"Short, sharp & stylish","This is a cracking good film with a few uncomfortable moments. An oddball story well told in short, sharp style.Leon is a hired hitman (aka 'cleaner'). He is uber cool and clinical in his work. He also does his own ironing, drinks milk, and has an obsessive love for a pot plant.His path crosses with a 12 year old girl, Mathilda, and when she becomes orphaned Matilda decides to adopt Leon as her guardian, hero and assassin trainer.It's a mad plot which shouldn't work, but somehow it does. Largely this is thanks to the terrific performance of Jean Reno, who is utterly convincing as hitman Leon; he's tough, soft hearted, dangerous, vulnerable, ruthless and likeable all in one. Perfect casting.A young Natalie Portman gives a fine performance too as the clingy but head strong Mathilda.Throw into the mix a deliciously OTT performance from Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the deranged and corrupt drug enforcement agent who ultimately comes into violent conflict with Leon & Mathilda, and you have the perfect villain too.This is a violent film, and at times overly macho, that doesn't quite land its tender moments as easily as it does its excellent action scenes. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is entirely fine when based on sentiment or pseudo parental love, but does occasionally flirt with something more troublingly sexual. The 'dress up' scenes where Mathilda takes on adult characters - although hopefully intended to be playful - are cringingly wrong, and the film would be much finer for ridding itself of any hint of sexualising a 12 year old girl.Put those uneasy troubles aside (if you can), and its thoroughly enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Violent and touching at the same time--a beautiful stylized gem,"Leon the Professional (1994)A tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's ""the best"" without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.The bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension.So whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.Director and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen ""La Femme Nikita"" or ""Fifth Element"" knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called ""cinema du look"" style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the ""Taken"" movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.If some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"That rarest of film creatures, something unique.","Determinedly, odd, over the top and a lot of fun., This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his ""Dr. Strangelove"" mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure.Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon.Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
EVERYONE!!!,"Leon the Professional wastes no time in proving itself as one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. An expertly crafted story that shows the connection between a young and frightened girl and her hitman neighbour. The beauty of the plot is how as Mathilda teaches Leon to be more caring and kind, she learns from him how to be ruthless and cold. Both actors play the characters brilliantly well, but the highlight is definitely Gary Oldman as the arrogant and psychotic main villain, which is one of the greatest actor performances of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A killer and a girl who get to know the world in a new way,"Luc Besson's film ""Leon"" is really strong. This is an amazing creative work of a genius director whose style cannot be confused with anything. Besson loudly declares himself to the world with this work, makes the audience be chained to the screens. And it catches everything: the plot, the acting, the music, the atmosphere.Actor Jean Renaud is very famous. His tired look is always recognizable. And here his hero, despite the sadness on his face, goes to his goal, he is dangerous and, it seems, invulnerable. But confidence, composure, lack of pity suddenly crumble into dust when he meets a little girl and gets into her feelings. And the actor perfectly shows how his character is changing.This film opened for me one of my favorite actresses - Natalie Portman. Today she is known all over the world. And not without reason. The actress is very talented. And this picture is a great start, which helped her already at such a young age to show an excellent game. Natalie plays little Matilda, a little naive, not knowing the world around her yet, but insightful and, as we see, able to melt the ice even of a ruthless killer. And now these two lonely people find a kind of shelter in each other's company.The atmosphere is wonderful, the unique style is sustained. Although all the pernicious boils of society in the form of drugs, murders, crimes are present around the characters, Besson competently weaves all this into the picture, not making a bright emphasis on this, but telling a completely different dramatic story.""Leon"" is a great film by a competent director who helped at least two actors show their skills in an extraordinary story, probably even a love story. Everyone will see their own. One thing cannot be taken away - the picture does not lose its relevance today and looks timeless.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"A killer as a guardian angel, a cop as the devil and a little girl's soul in jeopardy...","Luc Besson became the 'it' director ever since he dust French cinema with his 1985 ""Subway"", embracing the 80's as if it was a new millennium, a time where French movies could look American without it being an overused gimmick. And on that level, ""La Femme Nikita"" was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit ""Nikita"", would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.Jean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!Somehow I like the English title even more than plain ""Leon"" (though ""Le Professional"" was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..And on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.And before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a ""mission-giver"" played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And ""The Professional"" becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and ""Leon the Professional"" shines with its contrasts.Mathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!There's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview of the Vampire"", both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a ""guess"" game with him. When Mathilda plays ""Like a Virgin"", it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.It's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. ""Do you love life?"" he asks. She nods, ""Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care"". Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.It is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Léon is someone you really don't want to mess with.,"Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, Léon has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named Léon in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean ""EVERYONEEEE!"". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between Léon and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a Léon in their life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

An Unintentionally Hilarious Comedy,"Hilarious, I have more laughs watching this movie with my friends than anything, think about it: The overly done stupid Milk thing, the whole first scene with things like: Leon randomly being in a vent to kill some guy when he was just on the stairs less than a minute before, when the balcony window closes hes somehow shooting towards it when he clearly isnt on the balcony which means he must be floating in the air in front of the building, him magically appearing and disappearing in a dark hallway in the beginning as well as his arm stretching when he backs up from the fat guy, the guys they try to pass off as D.E.A. (like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious ""AHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real ""cleaner"" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

top 250?,"It's surprising that ""Leon"" is so highly ranked (as of Feb. 2006), as it is so weak in so many respects. There are basically two things that it is trying to give us: (1) great one-elite-versus-many-soldiers-shoot-em-up sequences; and, what would make this movie special, if it worked, (2) a view into a very unusual and interesting relationship, with tinges of father/daughter, of master/apprentice, criminal/partner, and of lover/lover.It delivers decent shoot-em-up, but fairly little that stands out much from the vast quantities of decent material of that kind in 90s (and 00s) Hollywood film. If you *love* that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.On the other hand, the relationship idea suffers from weak execution. Some of the specific plot and script ideas are to blame, but N. Portman is basically unbelievable, for the most part, and in a boring way. J. Reno is excellent, and there is some ""chemistry"" there, but there were just too many times when the cinematic illusion was broken and I just wanted to roll my eyes---the fascinating premise disappeared and I found myself thinking things like ""man, what a dumb line"". (Nothing as bad as the intimate scenes of Portman/Christensen in the Star Wars movies, which feel like a caricatured rendering of the interior imaginations of an inexperienced fifteen-year-old reading a mediocre discount store romance novel. But that's not saying much.)So, I suggest that ""Leon"" does not deserve to be in the company of nearby-ranked action-oriented films (""Das Boot"", ""Se7en"", ""Alien"", ""Fight Club"") or noir (""Maltese Falcon"", ""Chinatown"", ""LA Confidential"").I should add that I believe I saw the ""U.

"Weak dialogue sometimes, an awesome film otherwise","I was about the same age as the 12-year-old Mathilda, played by Nathalie Portman, when I first watched this film, and boy, did I drool over this girl, with her choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. What is Director Luc Besson's excuse though? The creators knew what they were doing when creating the sexual tension between Mathilda and our main man Leon, played by Jean Reno, especially given the events in the extended cut of the movie, where the relationship between Mathilda and Leon is further expanded upon. That's ok, Mr. Besson, I won't tell.Interestingly, even in the extended cut, the relationship between Mathilda and Leon works surprisingly well, without crossing into the offensive territory, because Leon is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life and their relationship is touching and innocent. Nonetheless, this movie would never be made today, given the cultural censorship.Those familiar with Luc Besson's other works know that this guy is obsessed with showing distressed but strong female characters with guns that get thrown into a harsh male-dominated world. This creates an interesting contrast between tender elegance and masculine brutality. Leon is, perhaps, the best version of this concept. In Besson's ""La Femme Nikita"" it was an adult woman and in his other film, ""Lucy"", the female character is too overpowered, so the vulnerability is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters.Speaking of which, Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain might be his best performance. He puts all of himself behind it, ranging from quietly menacing to almost blowing up his vocal chords. Between the 3 main characters, this film delivers captivating performances that keep you anchored in your seat from beginning to end.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the shallow childish mood produced by the writing. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic and cheesy dialogue, which points out the obvious and does not give the viewer anything deep to think about. The dialogue sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy. Matilda talks like no kid of her age would. Take even the title of the film: in the US, the movie is called ""Leon: the Professional"". A title like that evokes an immature comic book about assassins and ninja's.The movie looks phenomenal though. It has a peculiar grungy look, which I love. The movie Is supposed to be set in New York, but has a European vibe. Shot in a warm sepia tone, people's sweating faces and cramped apartments with run-down dirty walls combine with Jean Reno's French accent to give this film a foreign look. This makes complete sense when you find out that the interior filming was done in France. It's like New York and Paris were smushed together in this alternate universe.The soundtrack mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric drones. Those violins give weight to the dirty reality in which the characters find themselves and you can feel the heat of the city through the music.The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny.

Really Captivating,"Usually, I don't go for super violent films. I've mentioned before that I love Scorsese, but I'm uncomfortable with his produce, well done as it is. Here, a hitman, illiterate but extremely good at his ""job"" finds himself saddled with a twelve year old girl (Natalie Portman of all people) who makes her way into his dangerous life. Her whole dysfunctional family has been killed by a psycho played by Gary Oldman. One of his victims is her four year old brother. She is daring (too much so), putting herself and her friend, Leon, in danger. There are several violent scenes and a nice relationship which could lead to redemption. Of course, that is not going to happen. This is a gem of a movie, despite its harsh subject.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Black knight, child princess, and monstrous evil","This is a modern fantasy complete with twisted lives, nobility, endangered innocence, self-sacrifice, death, true love, and monstrous evil.  If you look very closely, it all dissolves into an unholy mess as did the knight's tales it resembles.  But, if you can forget reality and focus on the emotional appeal of the story, Luc Besson's drama rivals the best mythology can offer.  It works because the values that help Mathilda and Léon to find redemption are as timeless as the fears that terrify them. Before the film ends, she has helped him care about life again, and he has given her a decent adult she can believe in.Jean Reno plays a masterful, but childlike hitman who avoids all contact with anyone but his employer.  His rules are simple, he will not kill women or kids, he does not get emotionally involved with others, he takes care of himself so that he can do his job, and he takes his responsibilities seriously.  His knightly persona is complete with a disregard for money, profound humility, clean living, and a gentle spirit.  Reno makes it all work well.  Despite his off-handed disregard for human life, Léon is an extremely sympathetic hero.Natalie Portman, however, steals the show with her portrayal of a willful preteen devastated by the loss of her brother and adrift in a sea of powerful emotions.  Incapable or unwilling to face the consequences of her actions, she wants a final end to the turmoil inside her.  Portman does an amazing job showing the vulnerable child wanting an adult end to her isolation.  Good or bad, her innocence and reckless intensity make the movie work.  That Léon sees what is at stake and in his incoherent way tries to keep her safe is the hallmark of his nobility and should speak to everyone who cares about the sanctity of trust.The only downside to this picture was the stylized and unrealistic enemy. Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor, and the fact that his exaggerated rendition of a corrupt DEA agent comes across as believable is a testament to his skill.  In general, his crew comes across as cartoonish at best. Some of the more outrageous scenes include a bad guy preparing himself to stab a mattress, and the horde of skimask-wearing ninja/swat team/jack-booted-thugs who show up near the end.  The last time I saw such a ridiculous collection of enforcement personnel was in the ""Blues Brothers.""The monstrous evil in this piece is the emotional purgatory that both Mathilda and Léon experience alone. Their journey to unexpected peace is unlike any story I have ever seen.  Besson makes you care about the internal lives of his wounded couple by presenting the horror and nobility of their relationship with full intensity.   Mathilda's wish to die or find love, Léon's near willingness to kill her or let her kill herself, and their mutual disregard for the killing of others is mind numbing but powerful. Given the context of an uncommunicative killer afraid of involvement, a reckless child, and a lifestyle based on violent confrontation, they have few chances to survive and prosper.  The only things they have going for them are Léon's decency and Mathilda's complete faith in him.  The fact that faith and decency are enough makes for a first-rate medieval story in modern dress.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
No brains preferred,"Leon is a well acted but poorly written movie. Portman and specially Reno give an very good performance. But Besson fails at every level. The story is nothing less then stupid. OK you get sucked in for about an hour but then the last bit of credibility is lost. Only if you are prepared to believe anything, there is a flick left. I won't go into spoilers but if you believe that when you go give two policemen a headache the whole police-force collapses then this is a great movie. It's just as believable as The Fifth Element but pretends to be much more. If Besson had kept to making a farce it could have been a great movie!

"Before you see ""Anna', see this film.","25 years ago, Luc Besson was a director on the rise with his cult hit Le Femme Nikita which spawned a popular USA tv show of the same name. His big break was this film, which became a global hit and featured the debut of Natalie Portman as the daughter of the professional, played by Jean Reno, who would go on to star in movies such as the ill fated Godzilla 1998 remake.

Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years. Therefore, I'd say that this flick is still worth the time to watch it if it's on, but it's no longer a must-see, now that we have True Grit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Ludicrous & ridiculous effort from Besson,"How is this movie in the top 100, let alone the top 250?I will answer my own question and say that apprently most filmgoers do not find the idea of a ""perfect assassin"" turning out to be a good guardian ludicrous.On one hand we have ""Leon"" the ""perfect assassin."" An assassin is someone who kills people for aliving. This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes. This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss. That's original.Or how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r.And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives?This film is completely ridiculous.

A Personal Best for Both Besson and Reno,"Perhaps Luc Besson will one day make another truly great film. Perhaps Reno will once again garner better roles than a French DOI officer battling a giant lizard in New York. But it doesn't matter if they don't.By pairing for this masterful movie the two have produced a film which will definitely live on throughout history long after all of the riff-raff-flicks are lost and forgotten. This film is definitely deserving of a place in the top 50 films of all time.Outstanding performances burn up this stellar flick. If you don't know the show's storyline, here's the short-short version. An immigrant hit-man (Reno) becomes responsible for, and eventually falls in love with a young girl, Mathilda (played marvelously by Natalie Portman) whose family was murdered by a dirty DEA agent (the always superb Gary Oldman) and his team. Our heroic hit-man must protect the girl and avenge her family's death.More than just a compelling action drama, the film focuses its attention on the truth of humanity that people are social creatures and need companionship. While at first Leon is cold and commanding towards his young charge, he eventually warms to her more than he wants to admit to himself. When Mathilda's desire for vengeance places her in harms way, Leon's true feelings burst forth in a hail of bullets and bloodshed that would make the Terminator think twice about messing with this man.The story is solid. The dialogue is honest and pointed. The action is spectacular. And overall, the direction is undoubtedly Besson's best. This film ranks exceptionally high on my All-Time Must-See list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Simplicit,"Most people misinterpret this movie, Leon was not a pedophile. He was a hit-man who obviously has no family and love for no one and he finally finds someone he can care for. It is not really sure how he loves her, but he wouldn't have sex with Matilda. He loves her like a Father would love his Daughter. This is one of the few well made emotional aspect movies that I can actually enjoy. It had everything a movie should have, slight humor, emotion, drama and action and most importantly, love. If you can't respect a well made film like this, then perhaps you shouldn't be on IMDb, trying to offer your two-cents on a movie you know nothing of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Look for the international version,"The US version of the film is heavily edited, which correspondingly causes the plot to break and makes some scenes seem senseless. I was not a big fan of the US version (it was basically an action film), but really enjoyed the international version. The international version explores the relation between Leon and Natalie Portman.I believe the reason for the censorship is that many Americans consider any sort of a relation between an older man and a younger girl as pedophilia. This is not the case, and, it is a sad reflection on American culture that this is what viewers would see.

A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda.

Killed by bad writing,"Most of the IMDb commentators seem to find no fault in this movie, which I can almost understand.  The acting, directing and dramatics of the picture are almost there, but not quite.

Leon's character is very one dimensional, leaving Reno no room to stretch as an actor, unless you count his bad John Wayne bit or his plant stroking.  Oldman plays a comic book character, so he can't help being over the top.  As for the kid, she leaves an impression but her part is simply not believable.Directing:  Besson was writer and director, so any positive points one might give him for directing are canceled out by the completely implausible story and unmemorable dialog.Dramatics:  There were some very good action scenes, but the ""tender"" Lolita scenes I could do without.I give the movie a 7 overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Professional-ly done!,"Wow! This was one of the first non-classic movies hat just blew me away!!!!!! Back in '94 when it was released, it was a welcome change from the 'senseless violence' flicks that Hollywood started to churn out in droves. The movie featured a compelling plot, well-cast actors and some very riveting performances.The basic root of this story - a killer with a soft heart - was probably the best executed example of its kind. Jean Reno nailed his portrayal as Leon; a professional hit-man whose relationship (not sexual, mind you) with a young girl forces him to re-examine his inner youth/lost child that his harsh life had robbed him of all those years ago..Gary Oldman was a little over-the-top drama king as the dirty cop villain, but I don't think anyone could have done it better, especially when his character took actions under the influence of drugs.I believe this was Natalie Portman's theatrical debut, and boy was she convincing! I don't think there are that many young actresses who can vividly portray the emotions and suffering that here character had to go through given the story that played out.The cinematography was superb, the effects well done (not overdone), and I'd recommend this movie for almost anyone to see, regardless of preferences!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
This movie will grab you by the throat and will not let go.,"Léon is one of my favorite movies of all time although I'm not a fan of action movies at all. I've seen it already so many times and still I can't get enough of it. I don't know what it is that makes this movie so attractive. I guess it is because of the great acting by all actors and the fact that Besson has made a really surprising movie with characters who aren't what you would expect.Léon is a professional hit man, but he isn't cold hearted as you might think. He's a nice man who doesn't know how to read, who only drinks milk and who's best friend is a plant... Admit it, that's not what you would expect from a hit man. The same for Matilda, the 12-year old girl that he protects since her family was blown to pieces by a crazy Beethoven-loving drug lord. She's only 12, but she already acts like an adult and she wants to become a ""cleaner"" like Léon so she can take revenge on her little brother's murderers.This movie isn't just an action movie or a thriller. It's also a drama with a lot of comedy. You might think this wouldn't work out well, but it does. Don't ask me how, but Besson has made a solid movie out of it that will grab you by the throat from the first minute on, not to let you go until hours after it finished... This is what people call a masterpiece I guess. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

It's NOEL for Natalie (DVD),"Funny but Natalie comes from natale, thus the birth of Christ, thus Christmas or Noel in french!Seriously, for her first feature, she got a wonderful gift and was able to give in return a tremendous acting! I don't know for others stars but at her age of 13, she shows that she can cry and laugh and express all the feelings between with an evident talent! That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find ""beauty"" in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.I think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this ""Big Blue"" with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).I don't know if a ""Lolita"" vision is acute here but i think that anlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship!A unique masterpiece in conclusion all the worth that a sequel seems highly unlikely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Good Film -- Vastly Overrated on IMDB,"Leon is a good movie, but it doesn't deserve to be in the top 100 on IMDB. The film is very well shot and scored, and this, coupled with the performances by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, serves as the movie's highlights. Danny Aiello also does a nice job with Tony's character. However, the basis for the story is too unrealistic. Yes, shady cops exist; however, they don't just get to murder entire families without consequences. It tries too hard to make Gary Oldman's character seem completely insane. He has a very overstated performance. This is what breaks the film for me.

Strange film !,"The film is strange, well made but isn't free from flaws also. It's a film of a world where darkness reigns at max, like hitman killing people, police officers involving drugs, common people lives involving drugs and dysfunctional lifestyles, uneducated themes etc. It's all dark but the camera is used with illuminating light, which makes it unappealing mostly. Leon is about a hitman who comes in contact with an 12 year old girl and develops complex relationship. This relationship changes him, changes for the better actually. He gradually takes the taste of life, which is actually true between father and daughter. But leon is not her father, a kinda father figure but not father. It seem optimistic highly but will make you feel unreal also. He becomes attached with her and feels the impact of sentiments. He becomes human but this transformation has a reason behind which finally takes the ultimate toll on his life. That reason is the saga of revenge fof mathilda's family.The technical aspects are well executed like the script which progresses logically and good work has been done to bring out the characters to screen. But the BGM seems to be of issue here, it is used heavily on the first half. The sexualized part of 12 year old girl with leon made it very strange, very confused now to recommend this film. I understood it, it means mathilda's upbringing was done in a dysfunctional family. The characters may be real individually but as as an aggregate it is unbelievable. The whole plot involves killings and training to be a killer but does it all appeal in real life ? It may have in someway but the lighting should be used in a dark fashion to intensify that reality. Tony felt like the true hero of the film, who didn't exploit or made mathilda engage in any other work, rather he used leon's money to send her back to school. That's real hero in real world. But the film is not about Tony, it's about Leon. The set of the film with BGM seems like an arab world suddenly and uniquely appearing in USA.A film well made technically but will be called a film nevertheless, not a real experience. I abstain from rating it due to its dark content presented in a brilliant way to be accepted by society. But that doesn't appeal universally for all. Is this film made only for the French ? Are French like that ? A strange movie in all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
When Hype Falls Short,"When I first saw that ""Leon: The Professional"" had such a high rating on IMDb, I had high expectations for the film. However, I don't think it lived up to the hype. While it's not a bad movie, it's not as great as people make it out to be. The movie features Jean Reno playing the role of a highly skilled and efficient assassin. But the plot takes a strange turn when he forms a bond with a young girl and becomes her foster father. It's hard to believe that a ruthless killer would suddenly take on a nurturing role, and even more difficult to believe that he would train her to become a killer as well.In addition to the issues with the plot, I also found some of the character portrayals in the movie to be problematic. Natalie Portman's character, in particular, was a bit too much for me. The way she was dressed and act throughout the film made her look like something else, which was unnecessary and inappropriate for a child actor. Moreover, the relationship between her character and Leon was uncomfortable for me to watch. At times, it seemed like the filmmakers were trying to portray a romantic connection between them, which was inappropriate considering the age difference and power dynamic between the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

There where very creepy moments between the 12 year old and a grown man this movie is a 8 but i have to dock it points. I shouldn't feel that way watching a film and it's just me its a-lot of people.

Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard,"From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.Many actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate.Leon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
My perfect kind of film,"A poignant, stylish thriller showing the unusual relationship between a professional assassin and a young girl who's family was murdered. It is moving, tense and entertaining, everything a thriller like this should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
So well done!,"The actors were perfectly cast in this film. Plus, it was so well written that you cannot pull yourself away. It blurs the line between heroes and criminals. Who, in their right mind would pull for a little girl to become an assassin? But somehow it works. I enjoyed every minute of it, and was not able to predict what would happen next. It's so interesting watching Natalie Portman when she was so young. But you can tell she is incredibly talented. Her character's background story is told in a way that you can really believe that she would be so desperate to want to become a killer, and want to be mentored by a deranged yet kind ""cleaner."" Definitely watch this film unless the violence is a stumbling block for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Overrated,"It might be because of the cool sunglasses he wears. Or because he, as a killer, has a heart which lots of killers do and the people he kills were all bad guys. We like him because he's a simple person (but also because he's a very good killer). The girl is simple too just wanting to move on with life.So why, as rated by my fellow rating persons, is this movie ranked #33 BEST OF ALL TIME (out of close to 1M IMDb titles)? I will agree it's well acted, has a compelling story line and is cute but really! 33! It's good, but not THAT good.About the story, the plant lives.

Charming,"I have just finished watching it and it became one of my favorite movies so far. Gary Oldman acted so well that he shined even though he didn't have that much minutes in the movie compared to the 2 main characters.Leon and Mathilda probably has one of the most interesting and awkward relation dynamics out of all the movies out there. Even though they have absolutely different personalities and perspectives of life, it makes the viewer smile that they both could find common interests in that small house of theirs.The movie successfully completes its mission to create a different kind of mood swing through every scene as the movie as a whole could be identified by different genres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Natalie Portman, who always pretty much sucks in movies, was apparently even worse as a young actress. This movie is on par with any other cliché ""assassin"" oriented flick.

To fully enjoy this movie YOU MUST watch the Directors cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
I love it!!,"With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hit-man who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story - this picture has it all!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A brilliant film that helped define a genre,"I love this film. I loved it when I saw it in the 90s and I love it today.

He's not chosen a career path yet...No spoilers here, just to say if you like gritty and cinematic but great acting and quirky, disturbing yet somehow still believable characters mostly mixed up by chance and misfortune in a great story. Then this is for you.I also noticed some people giving it a rating of 1 because they felt it was a 7.5 not an 8.7...please don't do that, you idiots. Just vote what you think is fair and leave it alone. The voting system levels itself out, you just f*ck it up trying to play God.WATCH THIS FILM...you'll not regret it.

P. U.,"Are any of us happy we responded so enthusiastically to La Femme Nikita that we now have to sit through shiny garbage like The Fifth Element and the Professional?  Wow, this movie's stupid.  The movie begins attempting no nonsense-realism by choosing gritty, not picturesque parts of the city, as well as chucking in the pretty gratuitous murder of a child to make it that much more ""edgy"", and then the movie just becomes an orgy of gun-worship and impersonal murder, strung together by a silly, yet sickening plot, where this mass murderer's (Leon) really kind of cute and avuncular when babysitting this heavily made up 12 year old.  Hey, he drinks milk!  How bad could he be?  And he refuses to shoot women and children!  What a guy!  I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child.  In the course of the plot he teaches this alarmingly sophisticated neighbor girl how to be like him, how to kill strangers.   Ahhh.  The ""lessons"" he offers her, the tricks of his trade are chestnuts you'd  never ever think of like, ""relax.  keep your eye on him.""  I would have thought panic and look away, so shows what I know!  And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so ""advertised"" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing ""Like A Virgin"" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe.  Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy?  ""The Fifth Element"" had an equally annoying cute streak.  Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur.  He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing.  They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French.  Does the French director not know what French accents sound like?  Gary Oldman is laughabale, at best, and that really is almost a compliment, or as close to one as this thing deserves.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its genre,"Leon: The Professional, is directed by Luc Besson and released in 1994, is a gripping and emotionally charged crime thriller that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. This film, often referred to simply as ""Leon,"" is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and intense, thought-provoking cinema.At its core, ""Leon"" is a tale of unlikely companionship between Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a taciturn and highly skilled hitman, and Mathilda (a remarkable debut performance by a young Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl seeking revenge after her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, Stansfield (a chillingly memorable Gary Oldman).What makes Leon stand out is its exploration of complex themes like innocence, loneliness, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Jean Reno's portrayal of Leon, a morally ambiguous character who lives by a strict code, is nothing short of iconic. His stoic exterior hides a deep well of vulnerability, and the gradual transformation of his relationship with Mathilda is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.Natalie Portman's portrayal of Mathilda is nothing short of astonishing. Her portrayal of a traumatized and precocious young girl navigating a world of violence and darkness is a testament to her acting talent, even at such a young age. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is palpable, and their interactions are the emotional core of the film.Gary Oldman's performance as the unhinged and pill-popping Stansfield is a tour de force. He brings an intense and unpredictable energy to the screen, making Stansfield one of the most memorable cinematic villains of all time.Luc Besson's direction is both stylish and gritty, with expertly choreographed action sequences and a hauntingly beautiful score by Eric Serra that enhances the film's atmosphere. The film's pacing is taut, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.This film is not just a crime thriller; it's a deeply human story about connection and redemption. It challenges the audience to confront the moral ambiguity of its characters and the choices they make. This complexity, combined with outstanding performances, makes it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.The film is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Its unforgettable characters, powerful performances, and exploration of profound themes make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally charged cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Just for copy,"From Amazon.co.uk Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) made his American directorial debut with this stylised thriller about a French hit man (Jean Reno) who takes in an American girl (Natalie Portman) being pursued by a corrupt killer cop (Gary Oldman). Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description Léon: The Professional (French: Léon; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man; Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Amazing Film,"There is little I can add to the many things that have been said about Leon. But I will offer two observations. One is that Leon is not lascivious. Many if not most or all would-be viewers presume that it will be, and then are disappointed, or, like me, amazed that it is not. It is easy to understand the expectation. How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl ""adopted"" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing. She more than holds her own in her scenes with Jean Reno, and with Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello, whom I consider among the very best. That is extraordinary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I suppose giving the girl a place to live was OK. However, to teach her how to kill? Come on! No evidence that she went to school. I could not watch more after an hour and only lasted that long because people gave it good reviews. I assumed something almost intelligent or exciting would happen. Lots of sad music backed scenes of people doing nothing. If one cut out the dull moments, this movie would last 10 minutes, if that. I stopped after the girl professed her love for the killer.

Prepare yourself to get attached and even fell in love with the main character played by Jean Reno; the heartless hit-man who's a lone wolf will open up along the movie in a very subtle way when he takes that little girl under his protection.

This is because I think that this scene is the point that he and she got the human emotion, which is love. I couldn't know why he doesn't get to love anyone, but she was abused by her family except for her little brother, so she couldn't get to love anyone. After meeting each other, their life gets colored by changing from what they were. Besides being a daughter, she was a lover.

Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world.

Max your life...,"Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating. Oldman is the least constructed expectable actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve. Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money. Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly. With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed. The sheer oddness of the New York world for this film where cops and crooks are literally stranded in roles that pick over the leavings of earlier parts..!?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Not worth the watch......,"Ok, it seems like I'm going against the grain here, but after watching Leon: The Professional (Widescreen DVD: International ver) I was very discontented.  For starters, I was introduced to the movie with the understanding that it was an action flick, it wasn't.  I was told that I would really care about the characters, I didn't.  Here's the deal:Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors.  I like him to play villains and in this movie he does a very well job.  He's evil, clever and extremely threatening.  Unfortunately, his character is given little screen time.Natalie Portman shows that she is a great actress.  After seeing what I believe is her first film I can understand why she could have a successful film career in front of her.Jean Reno.  Um....He seems to do as much as he can with the role.  I like him in other films but there's not a lot you can do with a character who seems extremely smart at times but mentally retarded at others.The movie starts out great but comes to a screeching halt about 1/4 of the way through then climbs back up to about 3/4 speed towards the end. Matilda's relationship with Leon is strained and borders pedophilia. Matilda continually advances on Leon sexually.  Could this film not have accomplished the feeling of comradely without the thought of a sexually active 12 year old attempting to seduce a 35ish year old man?Other than that major plot dampener, we are continually bombarded with silly things that do little if nothing to the story. (Such as Matilda dressing up like Madonna, Marilyn & Charlie Chaplin.) Her continual use of the F-bomb is annoying and after the first 10 times she says it you start to ask yourself if you like this little girl of if she's just annoying.  Luc Besson does add some clever camera movements into the film as well as some interesting and funny characteristics into Leon.All in all I found myself glancing away from the screen and checking just how long the movie had been running on the LCD read out.  The painfully predictable ending was just that, painful.  If you have nothing to do on a Monday night when it's raining outside and there's nothing on, then watch Leon: The Professional.

"Even with its flaws, it's a pretty entertaining film.","The too-cool-for-words French actor Jean Reno plays the title role, a hitman earning a living in NYC. One of his neighbors is the precocious Mathilda (Natalie Portman, in her film debut), who lives with trashy parents, a foul-tempered sister, and one innocent, her baby brother. Then one day, crooked, psychotic, and pill-popping D. E. A. Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his crew wipe out the rest of Mathildas' family. She finds a safe haven living with Leon, and becomes obsessed with the thought of revenge. She URGES him to teach her the tricks of his trade; with great reluctance, he becomes her mentor and father figure.Written and directed by Luc Besson (who'd made a big splash with ""La Femme Nikita"" previously), ""Leon"" is not without its share of problems. For one thing, it can get pretty ridiculous at times; master stylist Besson is not exactly going for gritty reality here. Also, some of the scenes with Leon and Mathilda, who's obviously in TOO much of a hurry to grow up (and who thinks she loves Leon), are very uncomfortable. (This, despite the fact that we can sense that Leon is a basically good man who won't take advantage of her.) It also threatens to go off the rails because of Oldman, whose performance is often quite over the top. (His ""EVERYOOOONE!"" scene has become iconic over the years.)All of this said, the film is a compelling combination of dark elements, drama, humor, action (""Leon"" gets operatically violent at times), and tension. What really makes the difference is that Reno has such presence on screen, and his rapport with young Portman, who likewise gives such a natural performance for a beginner that it's as if she'd been acting for years. Reno chose to play Leon as a simple-minded, almost childlike man, one who dotes on a plant and loves movie musicals, and this makes him quite appealing. They're supported by a number of familiar faces: Danny Aiello as Tony, the guy who gives Leon his assignments, Ellen Greene and Michael Badalucco as Mathildas' parents, and George Martin, Kent Broadhurst, and Robert LaSardo.Most amusing is the montage of assassinations where Leon and Mathilda are working as a team.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
pretentious garbage,"Others have described the awful plot, so let me just get to the point. I don't know how this film ever got rated so highly.

One of the best crime films of the 80s or 90s...,"My rating: 9,0/10Is actually a bit cheesy at times. But overall the film is very effective, and effective in all aspects. Starting with the cinematography: an oppressive look in the interior scenes _ houses with tight halls and grimy walls_ and a cold, desolated one in the exterior scenes _with a mostly gray palette of colors, streets with big corners and dead ends. This odd, dark ambient, added to a lovely romantic soundtrack, gives this film a distinct, perfect atmosphere.*About the story:*""There is poetry in the dialogs, and there is definitely some artistry put in this film. Is very similar to TDK in that aspect. Very good character development, something extremely rare in this sort of film. A few things felt forced here and there, but overall, a good and moving story about a kid growing up all by herself in a totally hostile environment.""*And to finish, the acting:*""Great performances by Oldman, Reno and Portman. They are definitely the highlights of the film. Oldman is a scene stealer here, with his ultra over the top acting.""*Conclusion...One of the best crime films of the 80s or 90s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Beautiful love story,"Generally a love story about a 40 year old man who lives by himself and a 12 year old girl would go down about as well as a porkpie at a Jewish wedding with cries of paedophilia from far and wide.  However Leon is just that - a love story, everything else is incidental or situation, and has become a modern classic.What makes this work is that Leon is the 40 year old but appears more naive and childlike, while Mathilda is the grown up in a 12 year old's body - a modern version of Lolita.  The love between them is a pure love, like the relationship between two children, where Leon protects Mathilda and cares for her and Mathilda provides a life that fills the cold existence of Leon's hitman-focused lifestyle.Portman is excellent in this role - she has yet to do anything better, Reno is well cast and handles the opening up of his character in a very believable fashion - he is totally convincing as a killer and a nervous child making friends for the first time.  Oldman overacts like a madman!  If you look closely at his shirt sleeves you'll see his cuff links are actually pineapple rings because he's such a big ham!  His performance doesn't sit well beside the others and he seems to be in a different movie at times. However he does bring a cold killer element with it that works well and offsets his eccentricities.A classic love story, look beyond the guns at the two central performances and you'll see one of the most beautiful relationships in modern films.  The ending will fill you with happiness and break your heart in equal measure.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Looks cheap and feels awkward,"When it works, it really works. Reno is great, Portman is impressive, the two have great chemistry, and the action scenes are exhilarating. When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A classic,"It's a much sparer film than many of Luc's others (particularly his subsequent ones), and has a definite small-scale feel about it, which is a good thing. It's brilliantly scripted and directed, and superbly paced...long periods of calm, leading up to bursts of intense action. The humour works well, too.Jean Reno is absolutely top-notch as Leon, the awkward, shy guy who becomes an invisible killing machine whenever he goes to work, and exhibits a sort of childish glee when watching Gene Kelly on the big screen. He's funny, deep, mature and childlike all at the same time, and it's a pleasure to watch.Nat, too, is simply amazing. It's her first movie, and she's only around twelve or thirteen, but I don't think she's given a more accomplished performance since (at least, not in a movie I'm willing to watch). The bit where she's standing at Leon's door sobbing her little eyes out kills me every time.It's nice to see Gary Oldman playing a villain for once ;). He's in peak form here, as a linen suit-wearing, pill-popping, Beethoven-loving, ultra-violent sociopath. He's a total nut-bag, but very cool with it. Even when he's slaughtering innocent women and children, you can't help but like him.Or, is that just me...?Eric Serra's score actually WORKS this time. In some movies I find all that weird, French, electronic stuff distracting. Not here.I'm trying to think of bad points about this film, but can't come up with any. I guess that says it all really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Charming characters with decent performances,"While the sum of the film leaves you with little to chew on, I found Jean Reno's performance captivatingly charming, Gary Oldman hilariously over the top, and Nathalie Portman fairs just fine as far as child actors go. But outside of that it feels as though the back drop of murder and violence serves as simple action fodder. Nor does it excel in this regard, and since it's less commentary on violence and more violence as a tool for engaging the audience it lacks the depth or excitement you crave from the genre. It is also a film that did not completely know how to end. While I sympathize with writers everywhere on the difficulty of endings, it does not excuse what seems to be a complete lack of effort to tie the story up (or not tie it up, either way it should embrace a certain tone rather then... we'll nothing at all). This is by no means a bad movie, but I find myself enjoying the idea of the film over the film itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
What a difference it makes if u watch after 10 years...,"Two days ago I watched Leon after little more than 10 years since I last saw the movie in a theater. I had fond memories of getting goose bums last time around. But this time around the feeling was completely opposite. I couldn't even finish watching the DVD. Stopped watching just when the last fight scene was about to start... After watching movies over the years, realized Leon is just another flick made by Hollywood with all the formulas and recipes they use repeatedly to make the mass dumber and dumber. The dialogues were so awful. Both the main actors were unbearable this time around. The so-called anti hero is given a set of activities to make him look villainous... I have watched movies like Godfather, Lost in Translation a number of times. Each time I appreciate the thought process that went into making such movies.

A stunningly well made film,"This is another one of these films which surprised me with how good it was.

Quite where I had got that idea from I have no idea but i was so wrong. This is one of my favourite films of all time. I love the feel of this film, I never felt comfortable for any of the characters at any time, I never really knew what the next frame would turn out to be and in many ways it was a depressing film. I think there are a lot of people out there who could identify with the character of Leon in this film because if its not yourself it could be somebody who just doesn't seem to fit in anywhere apart from one tiny aspect of life as a whole.

After 27 years...,"So why now, after first seeing this movie on its original theatrical run 27 years ago at London's Odeon, Kensington High Street do I suddenly feel the need to write a review of a movie I've since watched countless times? I guess it was receiving the 4K blu-ray of the movies as a birthday present and sitting down to watch it again that was the catalyst but in all fairness, I should have done it a long time ago..I'm going to assume at this point that nobody reading this hasn't seen this movie. If, by some quirk of fate, you haven't...well, stop reading now and go and watch it, that would be a far more productive use of your time. Given that everybody else reading has seen it, I just want to make a couple of observations on this remarkable piece of work.Perhaps the most obvious thing about this movie is absolutely NO WAY would it get made today. Hollywood's woke mafia would pretty quickly see to that. The pitch meeting for a proposed movie in which an orphaned and therefore vulnerable twelve year old girl and a middle aged Italian immigrant hit man enter into a dubious relationship would be a wonder to behold - I'd pay to see that! The movie itself is in no way problematic in this respect, with Leon himself being more of a 'child' than Mathilda is. Still, the issue is an obvious sticking point...I can remember leaving the theater 27 years ago with my friend Tim and, for most of the drive home, he remained quite - most unlike him. After a while, he sheepishly said '...I found that girl attractive. Is that a problem?' to which I laughed and said reassuringly 'you were meant to, that's the whole idea!'All these years later, Leon remains Luc Besson's finest work by quite some way. I enjoyed 'The Fifth Element', 2014's Scarlett Johansson-fronted Sci-fi romp Lucy and even the B-movie mediocracy of Anna. Nothing the man has done before or since matches the artistry of Leon. Story, casting and execution came together perfectly on this movie, the stars were aligned. I don't give marks of 10, that's perfection. Perfection doesn't exist and so I'll go with a 9...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Movie Of Extremes & Fascinating,"This is one of the truly sick movies I own and am embarrassed to say how much I have always liked it....but I have, big-time. This film, with some very sick messages, is uniquely appealing at the same time. To use a popular word of today: it is ""extreme.""The extreme GOOD: 1 - A very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; 2 - A very intense drama at times with tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. 3 - The little girl ""Mathilda"" (Natalie Portman's first role) does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child, and I've seen a number of good ones over the years. It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star. 4 - Despite his profession, ""Leon"" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. 5 - Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. 6 - A very satisfying ending; 7 - Great camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.The extreme BAD: 1 - Not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but.... 2 - the latter (on the extended version) gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her ; 3 - Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) 4 - Another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys.In the end, though, it's only a movie, just a fictional story and it's job is to entertain....and in that it succeeds amazingly well. Great entertainment in a perverse way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Jean Reno Is My Hero For Life!!!,"This is the first Jean Reno film I saw. After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.The other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.Now we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.Now when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.Full Plot: Leone ""Léon"" Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or ""cleaner,"" as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the ""Supreme Macaroni Company"" restaurant. Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his ""best friend,""[3] and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.On a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman ""Stan"" Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Léon.Mathilda discovers that Léon is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a ""cleaner;"" she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. Léon shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying Léon's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to Léon several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.After increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Léon, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that what he calls the ""Italian hit-man"" has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering Léon's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is ""from Mathilda,"" then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open Léon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Léon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune Léon had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can ""clean"" as Léon had. Tony sternly informs her that he ""ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!"" Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and Léon's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with Léon's houseplant in hand. She digs a hole and plants it, as she had told Léon he should, ""to give it roots.""Verdict: 10/10. Buy the FULL UNCUT EDITION on DVD",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
I didn't think I'd find a better movie about a hit-man than Grosse Pointe Blank... but I did in spades.,"This film is the story of a very smart and calculating professional killer named Leon (Jean Reno) who ends up with a burden in his arms, a twelve year old girl named Matilda (Natalie Portman). Matilda's fate is almost met when a very crooked DEA Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) murders her family while she is out buying milk - Leon saves her life and teaches her the trade of ""cleaning"". I bought this film before I had even seen it. I did this because of the fantastic reviews it got, and having a real respect for Gary Oldman. When I fired it up the first time... it all suddenly made sense.The real story behind Leon isn't the gun play, (which is still fantastic) but the relationship between mature well mannered Leon and sexually inexperienced and unsure, but outgoing Matilda. The chemistry between the two on screen is just fantastic, as Leon starts to come to terms with himself that he really is in love with Matilda. Pedhophila is an issue in this film (though is never shown) and is understandable why some people find it to be a hard pill to swallow (maybe not for Oldman)... but for me, this film is like taking a trip down a road of rocky revenge, heartbreaking tragedy, breathtaking style and substance to die for. See Leon today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Many Deviates like this Movie,"The Professional is an awful movie. Natalie Portman is precocious and godawful. The premise is absurd without knowing it is, or being entertaining. It has no internal logic. The scene in which Portman tries on outfits & performs is excruciating for anyone who is not a child molester. Films that engage adolescent girls (who spend their adolescence being as grating and needy as Portman is here) are rare in Hollywood. The equal to Portmans work here is the excruciating character of Penny in the Lost in Space remake. Gary Oldhams performance is this achieves a new height; the height of idiocy.But the movie has much, much more wrong with it; namely the eroticization of a 12 year-old girl, in the movie and in the public reaction. This is deeply disturbing. An entire cult of straight weirdo's has sprung up who talk very heatedly about Portman in this movie. They consider her a nymphet like Lolita. They brag about in the uncut European edition in which Leon (reportedly) has sex with Mathilda.Hey freaks, if you think this movie is hot, you're a sociopath.Portman has turned into a striking young woman who unfortunately dependably continues to select and make more bad movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A much more tender affair than you'd expect.,"'Léon: The Professional (1994)' is a much more tender affair than you'd expect, one that's not so much driven by the eponymous assassin's life-meddling day-job but by his surprisingly human home-life and the relationships he forms during a time where both begin to catastrophically collide. The central dynamic is a little odd, though it's nothing compared to what was in the original screenplay, but ultimately turns out sweetly serene and incidentally innocent. The scenery-chewing villain is a little pantomime but menacingly hunts down the duo like dogs, which allows for some great action set-pieces punctuated by pure emotional moments. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

One of the top 10 movies ever,"This might equally well have been entitled 'Mathilda' for there is no question it is Natalie Portman who steals the show from the merely brilliant Jean Reno (who should have got an Oscar for this.) Gary Oldman is as good being bad as ever, and Danny Aiello provides a classy supporting role.The movie could be controversial in many respects but the sheer class and emotion lift it above any doubt. It reflects real life. Perhaps surprisingly, it is in Leon that emotion surfaces more easily, with Mathilda almost carrying the hardened hit-man as well as the film, through a series of punishing tests.Mathilda is irresistible, cute, practical, tortured, sensual, and yet remains entirely innocent. As is the heartless, simple, cold-blooded murderer, Leon. This is artistic, entertaining, depressing, uplifting, shocking, yet always remains beautiful and true.It is sad that Portman has never come anywhere near to repeating her performance in Leon, and probably never will. Whatever reasons she may have, it is sad for the fans that she doesn't take on more of these 'gritty' roles.

Bessons cameratechnic is fantastic. Portman, Aiëllo and Oldman are very convincing. But what makes the diffrence is Jean Reno. France's far most talented actor. His shy professional acting makes one believe he never done anything else in his life. It was one of the best films I had ever seen. I even namned my bird Leon. When I in 97 laid my hands on the long version (released in Sweden, Denmark, France and a few more places. NOT USA!) I realised that it was my favourite movie and it still is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Absolutely Brilliant,"I knew I loved this movie, but after revisiting it after about a decade, it still stands up -- No, it more than stands up. Like a good wine, it actually gets better with age. I just watched it with my 13-year old son, a budding film enthusiast, and he just flat-out loved it. Great story, top-of-the-line performances by Portman, Reno and Oldman, wonderful direction. Even the music is great! What more can I say? This stands the test of time and stands proudly among the best ever made. This time around, I was particularly impressed with the artistic mixture of drama, action and comedy. Besson knows exactly where the camera should be at all times to tell an entertaining, gripping and touching story that is both daring and caring. Hard to do!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Only One Criticism,"Judging by other user's comments, I must be the only one who thought Gary Oldman was a little too angry and crazy to be believable. The scenes of his ingesting drugs were overacted to the point of being humorous, which was not intended. The rest of the film was wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Good movie but left me feeling uncomfortable,"I want to start of by saying that I watched the directors cut, so it included a lot of scenes that I did not particularly appreciate, hence only the 7/10.Natalie Portman is fantastic in her role. To be able to achieve this level of acting at such a young age is something we must truly appreciate. It feels very natural and very easy to her. She was born te be an actress!Same can be said about Jean Reno's performance. He portrays the character in a very fragile way and he was able to make me feel 'bad' for a hitman. I was emotionally involved with him and I felt for him during the movie.Gary Oldman's best performance as the deranged head of the DEA also adds to the reasons as to why this movie could've been great, but let's talk about the 'bad' now.The plot was ridiculous in many ways to be honest. There was no backstory for Gary Oldman's character and it felt weird that he was somehow the head of the DEA as a psychopath. Also some of the scenes just don't really make any sense. The DEA does all sorts of weird things that just wouldn't happen in real life. I don't want to include spoilers so I won't go into detail.Now why did this movie make me feel weird in a way. The constant subtle hint of a sexual relationship between a child and a grown man (only in the directors cut). Portman is seen wearing very little clothing throughout the film and she even wears lingerie at one point. She also keeps telling Leon that she loves him during the film and Leon never really denies her feelings. He doesn't really give in either but he doesn't fully reject and it doesn't sit well with me. Portman was just so sexualized in this movie and I didn't like it, that's the main problem I have with it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"If you don't like this, we can't be friends.","Somehow I missed this incredible film when it came out. I was in college and studying pretty hard. Anyway....better late than never.This is a film that conveys how amazing humans are - from sadistic maniacs to tender hit men. The complexity of the behaviors, the abilities of the characters to make largely believable choices based on their moral codes, and some astonishing performances from some incredible actors make this a film you must like if we're ever going to see each other again.The principals give us some incredible performances. Jean Reno as Leon is astonishing. His ability to convey a million feelings with a blink of his eyes, a stiffening of his shoulders, or even the intake of breath make him someone I could watch in anything. I loved loved loved him in Ronin and this has only increased my love of the guy. I'm not gay but if I watch Leon enough, I might soon be! I will have to check out more of his work. His modesty, loyalty, decency, complexity, his tenderness and firmness with Mathilda (Natalie Portman), his steadfastness, and his courage make him one of my favorite movie characters in any film.I thought I wouldn't need to use any more superlatives for Natalie Portman having watched Heat about 50 times but she was younger in this film and she gives a performance with even more range than she showed in Heat. I'm happy to be able to see her work (even though I thought Black Swan was pretentious, predictable, melodramatic pablum). Her ability to convey anger, fearfulness, tenderness, confidence (I loved her peremptory dismissal of the four boys trying to protect their claim to neighborhood turf), and burgeoning sexuality (fortunately this part of the film doesn't quite take the film off course though I was worried for a second) while most definitely being a kid (she loves cartoons!!!) is amazing. Having said that, the best thing about Mathilda is her resilience. She is a survivor and this trait is Mathilda's baseline characteristic. Portman is just an incredibly gifted actress and her performance here is almost enough to leave me speechless.Danny Aiello is fantastic as Leon's loyal friend. He is a rock for Leon and asks no questions. He can always be trusted. Aiello conveys the sense of a man who cannot be shaken and is a true friend. He's probably heard it all and yet he's still there for his friend.Honestly, I thought Oldman was a bit over the top in his role. Obviously he is supposed to be out of control but I thought this was self-parodic, even for him.Luc Besson is never better at the helm and as a writer. His steady hand is much in evidence in keeping such a wild plot on pace and finding the emotional and moral centers of the film. The script is fantastic - a hit-man with a heart of gold, a precocious tweener, and a psychotic, crooked cop. Really, if you don't like this film, we can't be friends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Excellent,"My husband discovered this movie and urged me to watch it with him. We both believe it is one of the finest, most intriguing films ever made. Period! The performances by the entire cast are as amazing, as is the script. After watching it butchered by cuts and commercials on TV, we finally purchased a copy of our own. One of the wisest buys ever! Until then, we thought the title simply was ""The Professional."" Knowing Leon is the first part of the title is most satisfying. The character (and Reneau's performance) makes the name a requirement, which often is seen as the only title. Natalie Portman has gone on to make many other films, but this could still be her best effort. I'm sorry for anyone who has not seen this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Just perfect...,"This is the first time I make a review so pardon me if you don't like it.

It's also annoying to watch supposed tactical teams move like complete idiots on screen.

Reno ends up taking her in and helping her avenge her parents deaths.What follows is heart stopping action and a tender love story which never crosses the line into pedophilia.

My second favourite film,"Leon the professional is my second favourite film. I absolutely love it. This film ticks all the boxes for me, it has drama, violence, emotion, thrills, romance, humour and much more. The only film that tops it for me is The Shawshank Redemption (click my name above to see my review on that) so therefore for me it beats the likes of my other favourites like The Godfather and Schindlers list. One of the main reason this film is so great is because of Natalie Portmans amazing acting in it, she managed to capture angry, suicidal, vengeful side of Mathilda but also the loving more caring side of her, not many grown up actors/actresses can do that let alone a kid.In conclusion I'd say this is a film that all audiences can watch and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Léon - the best assassin film ever made,"The Reno/Besson team meets once again for one of the best films of the decade, and certainly the best assassin film made.

But in now way what so ever is this a top 250 ever and BY GOD IT IS NOT A TOP 50!!! There must be something I was missing. I watched a really cool action film that was better than the rest due to its intricately woven characters and its original storyline. That does not mean its better than DIE HARD and YES it falls in the exact same genre and YES I just compared the two.

"Good movie, still today. Mathilda character did not age well. Ughhhh","I was never quite sure whether I had watched this as a teen or at least parts of it. So Christmas was a good opportunity for a full-on action movie and nothing felt familiar at all, so I guess I just didn't see it. Maybe.It starts very strong, with an amazing action sequence and I was a bit frustrated that I couldn't understand how on earth he did it. Towards the end we are shown a little bit more of his special techniques. However, after that we get to learn more about Leon and we find out he has a very unusual backstory, and that despite his very precise and specific and razor-sharp skills, he is not the smartest tool in the shed in a lot of other ways. And he has been molded and taught all these things by his manager/handler. Which was a little disappointing if I'm honest , but maybe that's just me. His deadpan looks and stares do work very well though, especially in relation to Mathilda. As for young Mathilda, I was put off by the disturbing Lolita vibes and thankfully Leon does not respond, but it is a little uncomfortable to watch. Natalie Portman did great of course, but Luc Besson, you are one sick individual to have written her that way.It was a very entertaining movie, despite all that and the need to suspend your disbelief with the level of police corruption and violence, but it's not one of the great movies for me. It is good though, still today. There is a lot of originality to it, especially when compared to the absolutely mediocre churn out of action movies these days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Matilda is cute,"Leon (Jean Reno) who is a professional killer opens the heart little by little to Matilda (Natalie Portman), the girl who aims at a professional killer for the revenge which had the younger brother killed. And Leon comes to have feeling. This movie contains all the elements have scenes with tension, calm scene, and the scene laughable. An action scene is impressive. Camera work is also wonderful. Fusion of showy action and true love calls big impression for the last scene. Even when you dislike an action film, since this work has the contents, I think that it is interesting for everyone. I was very impressed with the figure that Matilda is endure the sadness. Natalie's overwhelming presence of that time 13 years old is wonderful. Leon is good at teaching about how to use a weapon.

"This is from Mathilda....a beautiful, entertaining film with heart.","Its nice to see another of my personal favorites score so highly with IMDb reviewers! The professional is about a hit-man Leon (Jean Reno) who befriends young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family is murdered. Mathilda decides she wants revenge and insists Leon teach her how to ""clean"". A very touching relationship then develops between the two which is at the center of this amazing film. I really love this movie!I need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.Then there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film ""State of Grace""). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to ""send me everyone"" and the assistant incredulously asks ""everyone?"" to which Stansfield chillingly screams ""EVERYONE!!""...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.I don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...""this is from Mathilda""...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.This is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.Real nice song by Sting ""shape of my heart"" over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
This S*** was Wild Son!!!,"May have spoilers, but nothing to serious, like describing a scene.

Not much else to say but that everyone should see this movie!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Natalie Portman was brilliant but some plot-driven decisions seemed off to me,"My biggest take from this movie is that young Natalie Portman was a badass. I imagine a lot of people might find Mathilda's character as uncomforting but seeing as she came from a troubling family, most likely with no friends, her character arc makes a lot of sense for me. To some extent, she even reminded me of Wan-Chu, the disturbed girl from Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind (1980), both by looks and violent tendencies. Of course, she's not as destructive and might be viewed as a watered-down version of Wan-Chu, but she definitely wasn't boring and was badass enough for my taste. For me, these kinds of disturbing and troubled characters always seemed more entertaining than your average ""walk-in-the-park"" characters.Even though the plot is action-driven with a great premise - a young pre-teen girl teaming up with a hitman after an unfortunate demise of her whole family - this movie didn't really go too well with me. I don't know whether it's the lack of the X-factor that would push me over the hump of excitement or the fact that Gary Oldman's character was the only one that couldn't be viewed as just a redshirt character. The movie was exciting to some extent but the over-the-top plot was a bit of a turn-off for me. The ending was emotional but the shootout was a bit ridiculous. I know Leon is viewed as a professional and a threat but sending 200 guys just for him and the way it went down just didn't click with me.Besides what I mentioned already, I'd like to say that the violent scenes are top-notch and the romance, whether disturbing or not, was cute and kind of shows how easy it is to dream for girls of that age. I don't think there's anything wrong with the cast and their talent, it was just the key plot moment weren't as enjoyable as they could have been. If rating just the portion of the movie before Mathilda went off to the DEA building, I'd rate it way higher, or even if the finale of the movie took place by Leon saving Mathilda from Gary Oldman's character, I'd think the scenery would be greater to end things off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

An absolute classic.,"Luc Besson brings an impossible relationship between a cold-blooded assassin and a 12-year old orphaned girl to reality in this one. Natalie Portman's screen debut in a leading role was absolutely special. Definitely one of the best performances of any child actor in film history, if not the best. There isn't a young actress out there that could've played that role as effectively as Portman. The emotion she's able to summon from when she's looking for Leon to open the door after her family's been shot, to the entertaining charades game, to the intense scene with Stansfield in the bathroom, truly amazing. You can't help but feel empathy for her character. Vintage Gary Oldman playing the bad guy as the corrupt DEA officer, one of his best performances as an actor.

Carefully composed action drama that has a big heart,"The innocence of the two protagonists here, despite one being a killer, is what makes this movie. Leon is a very simple man from a poor background in Sicily, and although highly disciplined, comes across as very honest and caring. The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above. Their relationship leaps off the screen from perfect performances, tugging our heartstrings. Gary Oldman also gives a no holds barred performance to create a supremely twisted character. It all has the quaintness of good child/adult drama whilst sending out regular sparks from orchestrated violence, a tough act to follow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Professional,"Luc Besson doesn't hold any record in my book for credible filmmaking. Nikita was an interesting take on an unconventional subject (or an unconventional take on a redundant subject, you decide), The Fifth Element was not as good as people will profess, and The Messenger got too weighted down.  Nonetheless, Leon gets marks in my book due to the following characteristics.1) Jean Reno: since this movie, he has been typecast by Hollywood time and time again whether in Godzilla, Ronin, or Mission: Impossible.  It's as if the script calls for ""french or other foreign looking guy who looks like he can kick ass"", they call him.  Either way, Besson uses the role and the character of Leon around him as opposed to making Reno fit a mold.  Smart idea.2) Gary Oldman: yet another guy commonly typecast into villain roles, Oldman goes about hammering the anvil with his character and drawing the most attention to himself.  Best line: ""Bring me everyone."" ""Whadaya mean 'everyone'?""  ""EVERYONE!""  Sometimes I wonder if he will ever get a decent role.  The Fifth Element was too much in the vein of Saturday Morning Cartoons and less out of seriousness.3) Natalie Portman:  as far as I am concerned, Natalie is currently a slave to the promotional department at Lucasfilm.  Until she gets out of that money pit, I will consider this her best performance.  Considering the subject at hand and the level of involvement on her character's part, this is light-years beyond any OO7 flick.4) Shifty editing: the editing is superb and complements with Besson's very European style of film.  Not once did I get the idea that a scene was unnecessary or drawn out longer than it should have.  Kudos to Sylvie Landra.Overall, an action movie less in the vein of comic books and more with pulp writing.  Better than the other blockbuster garbage of 1994.  4 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
An all time classic. A simple story about a very non-simple situation.,"Jean Reno plays the titular character – regardless of the name on the spine of the DVD – he is both Leon and the Professional. A quiet intense man who lives a solitary existence of discipline and ritual, honing his skills as an assassin that leaves no trace and carries out his work cleanly and perfectly, a man with only two parameters to his work: 'No women. No kids.' When the family that lives next door in his modest apartment building is butchered by corrupt police after a drug deal gone wrong, leaving only 11 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), Leon has virtually no choice but to literally take her in, lest he break his own rules through deliberate inaction.In the days and weeks that follow, impressionable Mathilda – who feels she is wise beyond her years – comes to realise the enormity of her situation. This is only magnified when she learns of Leon's true occupation. Of course being no more than a kid, Mathilda hardly finds this news abhorrent, but decides that she wishes to learn the ropes of what Leon refers to as 'cleaning'.This leads to a strange new existence for Leon, he cannot force pre-teen Mathilda out into the real world, but allowing her to remain compromises his disciplined existence. The mismatched duo settle in to a 'Daddy / Daughter' relationship, with Mathilda remaining home while Leon heads off to 'work', the issue rapidly becomes that Mathilda rapidly starts seeing Leon as less of a Father figure, and more of a crush Seeing that Mathilda is so headstrong, determined and convincing, and that Leon is if anything slightly child-like and has been shielded from normal human relationships, Leon ultimately yields a little and tentatively commits to basic training; something his employer Tony (Danny Aiello) is rightfully doubtful of.Regardless of suitability or basic ethics, the Leon / Mathilda relationship evolves into a strange partnership, and bringing your (pseudo) daughter to work days take on strange and uncomfortable significance. As Mathilda develops new skills and confidences unbecoming of her fragile years it is more and more evident that her ultimate intent is to avenge the deaths of her family Which brings us to Mr Gary Oldman and his role as corrupt cop Stansfield.Stansfield works for the Drug Enforcement Agency in the police force, however his entire unit is entirely crooked. Oldman toes the fine line between over the top intensity and cartoonishness well for the most part, and I guess if you are looking to forgive some of his antics you could always point to the green and yellow capsules that he takes prior to his more 'memorable' sequences.What is undeniable is that the and inescapable routine that the reserved and measured Leon is bound by is an effective counterpoint to the haphazard and impetuous existence of Stansfield. Having initially innocent Mathilda embroiled between these ying and yang characters provides the film with a centre, and the inevitable feeling that all three characters will find themselves in the same place at the same time.Leon is full of long low key scenes with equally subtle background music, 90% of the dialogue is between Mathilda and Leon – with a good two thirds of each conversation dominated by the precocious child. These scenes are punctuated by sudden dramatic scenes of violence, especially as the film nears its conclusion and Mathilda finally learns that there are some things that kids shouldn't be subjected to regardless of how 'ready' they think they are.Leon: The Professional was directed and written by Luc Besson, who has managed to leave his fingerprints on several essential action flicks from the last couple decades, Taken, Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter and Unleashed included. Leon seems to be quite a personal work, and while some of the other works listed are very good and worth checking out, in my mind Leon: The Professional stands head and shoulders above them all.This film granted both Gary Oldman and Jean Reno eternal credibility to a generation of young film-goers, and helped launch the career of Natalie Portman. For a moment it almost made me want to buy a skull cap Now nearly two decades on I am at odds with the more 'risky' scenes that further the on the job training and 'romantic' aspects of the storyline. I am by no means decrying their inclusion as being abhorrent or immoral, but I similarly don't really see them adding much to what was already an amazing and essential film.Final Rating – 9 / 10. A simple story about a very non-simple situation, Leon remains an all time classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Guns and a few glasses of milk.,"Leon lovingly cares for plants. He watches vintage romantic musicals, and he has a sense of humour. Hardly the traits of an assassin, wouldn't you agree?Leon is a professional hitman who lives in an ordinary apartment building. His next-door neigbour is an abusive father, who has been stealing cocaine. When DEA boss Stansfield (Gary Oldman) discovers he has been stealing, he cold-bloodedly murders his family. 12-year old Mathilda - who was out shopping - escapes the massacre. On her return, she notices the killings and finds shelter at Leon's apartment.With nowhere to go, and wanting to avenge Stansfield, she asks Leon to teach her to become a 'cleaner' - or assassin. Reluctant at first, Leon agrees. And so an unlikely friendship develops between Leon and Mathilda. It is a well written script, and the film has a great score.I remember seeing 'Leon: The Professional' in theatres back in 1994 when it was released, and thinking it was a bit boring. I was very young at the time and watched it now again as an adult. Having learnt life's lessons, the film definitely had a much greater appeal to me now than it did when I was a youngster. Still, there were moments when it felt the film dragged too much. I understand it was necessary to establish a relationship between the lead characters (no, not as in an intimate relationship, thank goodness!) so we could understand them and their situation better.Dialogue throughout the movie hinted at what the outcome might have been, and it was indeed so. 'Leon: The Professional' is a stylish drama which doesn't offer much in the form of action. This is mostly a character-driven movie. The performances are absolutely fantastic. Gary Oldman, especially, is brilliant as always. This was a career-defining part for Natalie Portman, and the film that propelled Jean Reno to international stardom.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Saw the Extended Director's Cut,"Sorry, I didn't get the appeal!Going in, I expected a nail-biting action thriller, but it turned out to be a trivial drama in which a contentious relationship between a 12-year-old child and a middle-aged man is portrayed as the norm, which is strange and quite distasteful to some extent.Even if I ignore the problematic aspects of the script, it still doesn't seem to make an impact. The action is well shot, and the direction isn't half bad, but it is the pacing that ultimately marred the efficacy and momentum of the narration and robbed me of my enjoyment.That being said, I still appreciate the actors for what they have done here. Portman did great; for an 11 year old (she was at that time) child artist, she did a fine job. So did Jean Reno with his laid-back, expressionless role of Leon, but for me, it was Oldman who took the limelight. He was freaking amazing; I wish he had more screen time. I think the film needed more Gary Oldman!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Characterised by 1 performance,"It's a good movie, without doubt, yet I cant help but feel that the cult following that IMDb has garnered is the cause for it having such a high rating. I mean it shouldn't be in the top 40 (or so) films of all time list.After watching Leon I felt rather hard done by, yes the review I've given is good and it's deserved but it can hardly be considered a masterpiece. To satisfy curiosity I suggest it's worth the watch, if only for another spellbinding turn by undoubtedly the greatest English actor of his generation. Not only has Gary Oldman set the benchmark for sociopathic villains, but his touch is so feather light that the eccentricities of each individual movement are as delightfully entrancing as they are wickedly sickening. Yes, admittedly my admiration for the man led me to write this review but only because I feel it important to tell others that this is one of his best performances to date and that it prevents this movie from being forgotten.I watched the film after seeing a 'Top Ten Gary Oldman Performances' video on the old youtube thingymajigg ('watchmojo' is a very interesting channel, go on... check it out.) and this has led me to scouring the internet for different films involving this guy, and honestly, and fairly upsettingly, I can't think of a better way I could've spent my time. In my, not too sought after opinion, he is the greatest actor I've ever seen and I repeatedly tell my friends ( and I know I don't sound like a guy who has any, but I'm fairly certain that they can be counted as friends ( don't ask them in case I'm wrong )) to study the man in great detail. I mean, they hadn't even heard of him. Anyway, in all honesty, this review was supposed to be serious but I fear I'm losing my way. So on we go...The performance of Reno is sturdy as is the support of the majority of the cast; obviously the use of a child acting doesn't fail to annoy, even though the girl in question went on to reach stardom (didn't see that coming). I'm not an expert in direction so I'm not in a place to comment on Besson's job, but he's created an enjoyable film that certainly breaches the norm, so top marks there. I don't know what to make of the French, this film points in their favour though.I think this conclusion gives me an excuse to compliment G.O. so I will. All I'll say is that if you have the intention/hope/dream of going into acting, or simply just admire this strand of entertainment: this guy's the man to watch.Sorry for going on, anyway I liked it...

brilliant. absolutely brilliant.,"I don't think I've rated a film 10/10 on here yet, but this is most definitely a deserving recipient.Unlike the films that are recommended or assumed to be alike to it, Leon has so much more of a heart than most other hit-man/assassination based films. I'm not normally a fan of movies within this genre, so i cast my 10/10 with an unbiased eye. I loved this film, I really did. Leon and Mathilda are both such memorable, endearing characters, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman and Jean Reno. Gary Oldman also plays his part with such ease, fantastically.The killing scenes throughout the film are spectacular, and the cinematography is surprisingly stunning.

"Brilliant, powerful story of revenge...and belonging","Brilliant, powerful story of revenge...and belonging.Leon (played by Jean Reno) lives in New York and is a professional hit-man. One of his neighbours, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), is a 12- year old girl with family problems, one of which is that her father is a petty criminal. One day, a drug kingpin, Stansfield (Gary Oldman), kills her entire family due to something her father did. Mathilda turns to Leon for help...and revenge.Excellent crime drama. Good plot, meticulously set out and executed. Good action scenes too. Not just an action-drama though - there is also an emotional aspect to the movie, and a theme of setting down roots and belonging somewhere.Solid work by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman (12 years old and in her first movie) in the lead roles. Both these performances are eclipsed, however, by an amazing performance by Gary Oldman as the villain. Pure over-the-top, menacing, evil, bizarre genius of a performance by him.

Ick!,"I'll try not to be too gratuitously abusive about this film, but considering the astounding amount of uncritical, even hysterical, raves it has received from viewers, I feel like I have to swat it down a peg or two.  Any fairly flashy film with a lot of guns, explosions, death and destruction is bound to excite a large number of moviegoers.  I used to think this is more of an American thing, but the comments from overseas seem to contradict that old cliche.  Bad taste is universal, it seems.  Still, the ardent praise of its plot and characterizations astonish me, as these elements of the film left me with a creepy, vaguely dirty impression of the film.  Enthusiasts for the film defend its morality, and suggest that any hint of sexual tension between Leon and young Mathilda is in the mind of the viewer.  However, the fact that Mathilda is always dressed in a sort of provocative, gothic punk/slut attire, and the fact that she openly hints to a hotel clerk that she and Leon are having sex (I know, they aren't) suggests that the filmmakers would like us to be thinking about the possibility of it, even if it is not portrayed.  in a way, a straightforward sex exploitation film is more honest that this kind of hypocrisy.  As for Leon -- are we supposed to love this guy?  Leon is a hit man.  What's a hit man but a specific variety of serial murderer?  We're supposed to like him because he is kind to children and houseplants?  Jame Gumb loves his little dog, but that doesn't make him any more cuddly (see ""Silence of the Lambs, a REALLY good film). so the emotionally damaged kid finds out that her new father figure is a paid killer, calmly says ""cool"" (yuck!), and Leon proceeds to instruct her in the noble profession of killing people for money.  but the killer has scruples after all!  ""No women or kids"" he says.  What a saint!  Are we to assume Leon knows for a fact that the world will be a better place without the men he's being paid to kill?  Sort of like the evil twin of Clarence, the angel in ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Aren't the men he kills without even knowing them somebody's children too?  Might there be women and children who will be hurt by their assassination?  Aren't women sometimes evil too?  And then we're supposed to feel Leon's basic human goodness because he asks Mathilda not to swear so much, even though he has taught her how to kill people without thinking too much about it.  Is this all some kind of subtle satire?  If so, I think it's a bit too subtle for most people, including myself.  If it's meant to be taken seriously -- well, I just can't think of it as anything but some sort of moral idiocy.  I take nothing away from this film cinematically.  It's a great-looking film, but to me it's just plain creepy and disturbing.  Besson's ""Fifth Element"" was a lot more enjoyable to me, both as eye candy and as entertainment.  Sorry to rain on the parade.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Fantastic movie...,"Leon will stick with me for a long time. It is one of the few movies that I've seen that blends action, love, humor, and tragedy into a great film. Jean Reno's, Natalie Portman's, and Gary Oldman's acting was fantastic (It's a shame to see a talent like Natalie's wasted on horrible writing, like in Episode I/II. While I enjoyed both of those movies immensely, I hated the dialogue, especially between her and Anakin).I saw the uncut version, and from what I've read, the US cut (""The Professional"") removes all of the tenderness between Leon and Matilda. Squeemish MPAA viewers who don't like the relationship between Leon and Matilda removed the film's most important parts (and for worried viewers out there- don't worry, nothing ""happens"", but their love is very well played, and quite believable).So anyway- see this movie, but the uncut version, not the US cut.

"""Death is...Whimsical Today""","Luc Besson shows how he can create a wonderful story again, and also a wonderful movie. To start with, the relationship of Leon, a hardcore hit-man that talks to plants and doesn't relate at all to the world, and Mathilda, a girl that is moved away from her family nucleus to find real love, a paternal figure on Leon. Both Jean Reno and Nathalie Portman seem born to this role, so natural. They feed a bizarre, uncommon couple that lights on their talents and their lateral chemistry. Gary Oldman is a beast, in every single way. He enjoys performing a DEA agent that has very little respect for everything. When he shouts ""Bring me EVERYOOONEEE!"", one can see that his acting is intense, visceral and passionate.Leon is an excellent story, any way you see it.

I really began to feel for jean and natalie, even though their relationship was rather odd(a 40 year old man with a 12 year old girl).

It is one of Besson's good films which he happens to make once in a blue moon. Great script with well-developed characters.

One of my favourite films of all time,"Leon The Professional is purely and simply one of the best films ever made. From Natalie Portman's stunning debut performance, to Gary Oldman's absolutely nightmarish baddie, to Jean Reno's lovable and eccentric protagonist, it's a classic, a piece of achingly beautiful cinema that I could watch on the daily and never get tired of. The three actors are the bricks which make the film so special, and Luc Besson's fluid, sensitive direction is the mortar which holds them together. Portman is simply miraculous in her first film role as Matilda, a young girl whose entire family is murdered by psychotic DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Highly introverted assassin Leon (Reno), takes pity and allows the orphaned girl into his home and his life. Matilda is a strange girl whose specific idiosyncrasies both clash and amusinly interact with Leon's. He is an exile of sorts as well, with a tragic past and not a whole lot going on in his life besides the contracts he carries out for kindly, paternal mobster Tony (a phenomenal Danny Aiello). Leon and Matilda makes an interesting team; she is brash, unfiltered and lively, he is reserved, awkward and deafeningly quiet, resulting in unique character building and bonding that Besson handles wonderfully. Now, there's two versions of this film, because apparently American people can't handle slightly taboo undertones, even when they're handled in a caring and tasteful manner. You definitely want to see the longer, European cut which has some interesting scenes that crackle with sexual tension on Portman's part. Yes, she's twelve years old, at a very confusing crossroads of her life, the stark black and white mindset of a child dissolving into the very ambiguous and complex psyche of a woman. She believes she loves Leon, and he handles her advances in a way that requires maturity and intuition that he never had to begin with, but rises to the occasion. Call these scenes what you will, but there's no denying their esential place in the film's complete story, and to censor them for the sake of prudeness is a straight up crime. Matilda wants revenge against Stansfield and his team, which means going up against his wrath, and also means Portman sharing some incredible scenes with a voracious Oldman. Oh, Gary. This is his final form, the most terrifying villain in his stable, a flamboyant, deranged lunatic that one can scarce believe ever was allowed to be a cop. There's a fairy tale esque feel to the film, where the bad guys do what they want in the urban forest, never in uniform and free to roam, kill and terrorize with the full might of the NYPD at their dastardly disposal. Oldman is the Joker on mescaline, and in fact Stansfield pops mysterious pills from a little casket, when he's not murdering people while listening to Beethoven. He's loud, scary, stylish and animalistic, so intense one feels like his very presence will melt the TV screen. Portman is so superb it's hard to believe this was so early on in her career. In my mind she did her best work right out of the gate, in this film. Matilda is wise for her years, which she uses to mask the gulf of vulnerability residing in her, a hallmark trait found in children from abusive households. The family and friendship she finds with Leon strengthens her as as human being, and we start to see the emerging person she will continue to grow up to be. Natalie displays all of this uncannily well, and is the bruised, beating heart at the centre oft the film. Reno sells the eccentricities (Leon loves golden age Hollywood musicals) and sorrowful resolve of Leon so well, taking a character that is all action and very little talk, and speaking volumes with both body language and silence which, take it from me, is tough stuff. Besson, whether directing a quiet, introspective scene or a balletic action sequence, gives everything a stylized, earthy quality that makes the film stand out amongst other action ventures. You could spend a billion dollars on production design, but it all comes down to the human element behind the wheel, and if you don't have a director, cast and team that has the current running through them to create something special, all those dollars go out the window. This one has all of that, and is a solid gold classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

One of the most under appreciated films of all time,"Luc Besson (Transporter, Taken, The Fifth Element) directs the intense visceral and compelling action/drama of Leon, released in the USA as The Professional. It could be called as a karate kid film...except with guns and assassins. I was left wondering to myself at the end why wasn't this film given even one nomination in direction or acting. Now it is considered as one of the best films ever made and is currently at the time of writing this review sitting at #25 in IMDb's top 250 list. At the very least it is one of the finest cinematic experience of the 1990's.Leon is a ""cleaner"" or a hit-man living in Little Italy. He has learned to suppress emotions and feelings and lives his life in a little apartment working for Tony, a mob boss. His life is turned around when 12 year old Mathilda who lives on the same floor and has been recently orphaned comes to him for help. Leon grudgingly helps her at first but soon discovers his own inner child.All the scenes are shot beautifully and the action sequences are well planned. The score works well with the film. The acting is superb especially from Natalie Portman who played young Mathilda in her debut film at just the age of 13. She displays her emotions well with her body behavior and immaculate expressions. She was born with the talent. Jean Reno (Pink Panther, The Da Vinci Code) does a good role as Leon, the mentally slow and emotionally dumb hit-man for whom you start to feel. Making someone feel for a hit-man is certainly not easy. Danny Aiello as Tony also gives a good performance and delivers as required.Gary Oldman does such an intense, quirky, interesting and terrifying role as the corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination. He gives an absolutely electrifying performance and the fact that he improvised one of the best scenes in the film proves his acting chops.The film is not for the fainthearted and the action never feels to be artificial or deliberate. The story, while basic, incorporates all the elements for an interesting 2 hours. It's a cinematic success about innocence destroyed and innocence reborn. The cast show that there is no substitute for good acting and you don't need special effects to make a good action film. While the accolades are missing, Leon-the professional is definitely a cult classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"A different kind of ""Lolita""?","Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read. He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets. Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a ""cleaner"" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother. Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style. After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial. (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.) After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment. He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some ""cute"" shots of his very pretty little star. One wants to ask, ""What's a nice Jewish girl (Portman was born in Israel) like you doing in a movie like this?""What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot. Some highlights:The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, ""He's not my father. He's my lover."" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills. In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, ""This is from Mathilda"" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand... (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review! Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"MY REVIEW: Intelligent, Emotional and Intense!!","Leon. A professional assassin rescues a young girl whose family were killed in a police raid conducted by a corrupt police officer. Girl teams up with the assassin to take the revenge. Now, the assassin here is 50+ played by famous Spanish actor Jean Reno, the girl is in her teens played by Oscar winner Natalie Portman and police officer is Gary Oldman who always enjoys himself so much when it comes to negative roles.Leon's strength lies in the unusual cracking chemistry between Jean and Natalie. Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer.Only false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional. Watch it for its apt cast, great acting, super dialogs and highly emotional, intense, beautiful and subtle moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"""Can we try with real bullets now?""","Professional assassin Léon (Jean Reno) ends up with an impromptu foster daughter when he recues Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from corrupt cops who massacre her family while searching for stolen drugs. Mathilda vows revenge and pressures Leon to teach her his deadly trade. Reno is great as the efficient but almost child-like killer, who drinks milk, cherishes his houseplant, learns to read, and ultimately ends up showing his young charge how to kill people, and Portman, who was only 12 when the film was made, is outstanding as a pubescent 'avenging angel wannabe'. On the other end of the gun barrel is Oldman's 'doped-up-psycho-cop' character, but the film has a bit of a fantasy feel to it so his sometimes screechingly over-the-top delivery works (IMO). Léon and Mathilda's off-beat, asymmetrically innocent relationship is developed beautifully and the story plays out to a great, if somewhat predictable, end. Apparently Besson's original screenplay was sort of a 'Lolita with guns', but Reno and Portman (or maybe her parents) nixed the idea of Léon becoming romantically entangled with 12 year old Mathilda and Reno was careful to play the part to minimise the chance that the audience would misinterpret the relationship. All in all, a memorable action film (with a great poster) from the '80s. Some of the stories about young Portman's introduction to the world of film make for interesting reading.

USA preview audiences from 1994 don't know a sheet.,"This movie is something unique. It's wonderfully awkward, it has a story that I've never seen before and has two great protagonist. The only problem, is that it got at least two cuts that doesn't makes sense and ruin the whole meaning of the movie.Yes, I'm talking about the scene when we know the past from Leon and then they go to sleep so she makes him hug her with an arm while he is clearly uncomfortable. This escene is pretty necessary, otherwise we don't know the real boundary on the relationship, what happened with the gift and why they were sleeping together from nowhere.The other one is when Mathilda goes with Leon to Tony, so they tries to make her a Cleaner and the scumbag refuses. There is a reference that Leon says to him something like ""remember the girl from the other day"" and tries to persuade him to give his money to her when he dies.I'd just like that we don't get watered down versions and everyone can enjoy it as it was intended, without the stupid censorship.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
a film that would give what to talk in today's times more than the year it was released,"Léon is a controversial film, a film that portrays a child falling in love with an adult man, is a movie that for many is a film that portrays pedophilia and I disagree at one point, Mathilda is just an innocent child who fell in love with a man , but I've never seen Léon fall in love with the girl, he only took care of her as a daughter, but it's an opinion, the film is directed by Luc Besson but I found the film with some problems in the direction, there were times when the camera stayed well confused, he for example in some scenes that have action I found them confused, but he develops the characters well, and it's a very tragic, exciting movie, with a great shot and a good soundtrack, Léon is a filming, a of the best of the year 1994 that is considered by far the best of the cinema.

Excellent but underrated film,"'Leon' should rightly go down in film history as a classic, and will probably be shown on TV in years to come. It is, however, underrated, and people don't see it for what it is. Leon has many levels to it, and each becomes apparent the more you watch it. It is fundamentally an action/thriller about a lonely hit man who seems to be getting swindled by his boss over his money, and who unwittingly gets caught up in the troubles of his next door neighbours drug problems with the DEA, through a little girl Matilda (Natalie Portman, who he helps).As well as this, he eventually ends up with crazed DEA officer Gary Oldman on his back, as well as nearly the entire NYPD. On the surface, this film is an action shoot em up, but it is really much more. It seems to be a tale of a desperate young girl who has no where to go after her entire family are gunned down by Oldman, and who sparks up a kind of father daughter relationship with Leon.Gary Oldman is excellent in this, and plays the part with the usual intensity that he has. Natalie Portman is also great, and its probably this film that has led her onto her more recent successes in films. As for the lead Jean Reno, this was the first film I saw him in, and I can't say I've ever seen him beat this performance in any other.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Leon - A Sympathetic Hitman,"Generally speaking, hitmen in Hollywood films are not especially deserving of sympathy. However, this portrait of a hitman, also known as The Professional, is far more sympathetic than most other portrayals of this profession. Jean Reno gives his unforgettable performance as a very hard man to kill along with a very young Natalie Portman, a young girl that the killer takes under his wing. One could easily assume there are sexual subplots going on here, but they would be mistaken. Leon is acting upon his instincts as a father might have in the same given situation. Gary Oldman is wonderful as the over the top cop out to get Leon from beginning to end. Portman does a great job as the young orphan, and shows why she would become a magnificent actress later in her career.

A fluke,"Very good, acting a movie for romance and action lovers combined. Not the greatest plot line but an outstanding performance by gary oldmen.

I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you enjoy this genre. If not this movie is a simple civil crowd pleasure for some people. If you want romance combined with action/gangster I would advise you to see the above movie (Miller's crossing) or some arbitrary movie involving Gun's and Romance. To my knowledge that can not be done with exceptions of notable movie's you've probobly seen or heard of. The real thing that will leave you crying is the excellent score By Eric Serra who composed movies such as Golden Eye, And The fifth element. Music scores have been notable for doing such...If you look at all the comments made you will notice that they are all in favor of this movie. However this movie has gotten several bad rating's by critics and imdb members. The base line is you either care so deeply about this movie it causes you to write a 10 paragraph commentary on it.

"""Leon:  The Professional"" is a great film.","""Leon: The Professional"" is a great movie from 1994. The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie. I gave it 10 stars. Dale Haufrect",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"My introduction to Luc Besson, Jean Reno, and Natalie Portman.","I had never heard of Jean Reno when ""Leon"" (called ""The Professional"" in the United States) came out, but I was sure impressed with it. Featuring Reno as a hit-man who has to take teenager Mathilda (Natalie Portman) under his wing after a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman) murders her family, the movie is gritty - and sometimes a little gag-inducing - but an interesting look at the underworld.As for the people involved in it, Luc Besson later directed the super-cool ""Fifth Element"" and the misconceived ""Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc""; Jean Reno will probably make an interesting Bezu Fache in ""The Da Vinci Code""; Natalie Portman may be best known as Queen/Senator Amidala, but I prefer to remember her for ""Mars Attacks!"" (although it remains to be seen how she performs in ""V for Vendetta""). All in all, a really good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
French charm and bloody deaths - perfect mix,"The movie Leon is truly one of the best things I have ever watched. A legendary Luc Besson's picture. Even thought it was released in 1994 it is still as topical and urgent as at the first screening in cinema. An incredible criminal thriller about a mastership of the murder, unexpected accidental meeting and an amazing pure love between two opposites.How can a professional killer fall in love with a little girl, whose family was killed? Well, Leon, an expert killer, whose life is nothing more but completing one 'order' after another one, played by an unsurpassed Jean Reno, didn't expect this to happen as well. His routine was monotonous when Natalie Portman in a role of a 12 years old Mathilda appeared in his doorway. And this acquaintance changed his priorities and life.The best part of the movie is its atmosphere and aesthetic of The Little Italy in New York, mafia and dirty cops, muted colors and Sting's song during the titles, which is still inimitable to these days. Moreover, the French charm and criminal cruel scenes are looking surprisingly good together. There are many details in this movie that made people who didn't even watch the scene like it. One of the main one of them is Mathilda's outfit with red beanie, khaki jacket, black round glasses, which became an inspiration for many members of teenage subcultures.What has to be also mentioned, people love to watch films based on easy basic concepts. The whole movie is a game of contrasts and incompatibilities. A grown man and a little girl, a killer and a blameless child, guns and kids, murders and a friendship, immortal love and death. This whole movie is a confrontation of black and white. That is also its secret of an unfading success.Summing up, I can't think of anything bad about this movie or things I don't like, so I am just going to say that this movie is amazing and everybody who hasn't watched it yet should do this and those who has already seen it can rewatch it again because it is worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Questions about Continuity,"Leon / The Professional is an outstanding movie!A question arose as I watched the ""charades"" scene today. Mathilda came to Leon with nothing more than the clothes on her back, and yet she had lingerie to pose as Madonna? I wondered whether the bra & panties may have been left in the ""furnished"" apartment by a previous tenant. Then I arched another eyebrow when Mathilda appeared with a ""Marilyn"" white halter dress, that just happened to be the perfect size for a 12-year-old girl?One might speculate that she retrieved clothes from her old apartment, but that seems implausible. Consider this: Shortly after Mathilda moved in with Leon, the pair moved to another apartment. The charades scene precedes the scene where Mathilda visits her old apartment. Are we to believe that Mathilda was able to access a guarded apartment twice after they moved?Just thought I'd pose the question- I'm no continuity expert, and I've been willing to suspend belief the other 200 times I've watched this excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

While biting down on the capsules he pops into his mouth prior to executing his victims, Oldman shivers, shakes, crosses his eyes, and shrieks in ways similar to a vampire preparing to sink his fangs into a jugular vein.

noxious and twee,"Much of the flak that this film has received has been directed at its alleged paedophilic inclinations; I think this criticism has some truth to it, but is often overplayed. What really bothers me about 'Leon' is another form of child abuse: the 'grooming' of a minor as a would-be professional assassin. Hollywood revenge flicks are a dime-a-dozen of course, and they usually end up endorsing vigilante violence in one way or another. But what makes this film so awful is the application of this trope to the realm of childhood, and, further, its blank refusal to consider the moral implications of this stance. Sure, the little girl's family has been wiped out, and she wants payback, but is the most humane response to the situation really to help satisfy her desires, and get her even more entangled in the world of brutal criminality? The criminals are simply regulation scum who deserve what they get, and a little girl is deemed as suitable an agent of vengeance as an experienced hit-man. Leon is just as much a criminal and a murderer as the bad guys, but he is strong, taciturn and endowed with a sentimental streak, so he's 'noble'. No deeper reflection is required. Dress it all up in the odious trappings of fey Gallic whimsy (ye Gods, it's worse than 'Amelie'!), and the movie's nasty little heart beats on unnoticed. Seldom has a soundtrack got on my nerves quite as much as this one did. Yuck, yuck, yuck.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Luc Besson at hist best !!!,"""Leon the professional"" is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing.The plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
An action film among France's greats.,"Leon: The Professional is a great film that's an action movie showing Europeans know how to make overly familiar territory (Brooklyn) something fresh, new and hyper-energetic for the mid-90s. It's an outcast's story focusing on a compassionate hitman whose life is turned upside down when Mathilda, a little whose family was shot and killed by the psychotic Norman Stransfield, is suddenly thrust into his life and forcing him to make a change in his blood-soaked life.It's a very energetically directed film and this shows Luc Besson knows how to make intimate stories of redemption into something more than the sum of its parts. This film's got cinemtic references, family bonding, regret of the past, and even a little girl trying to find her place in 90s Brooklyn. It's also got some FANTASTIC action sequences too.This would have been mundane had it been a movie from Hollywood directed by Brett Ratner or Michae Bay, and it shows that action cinema doesn't need to be beholden to action blockbuster stock characters.

A Superb Movie!,"For a movie to get an 8/10 from me it has to be brilliant. For 9/10 it has to be exceptional. What more can I say about Leon which gets a resounding 10/10? It is without doubt one of my top 5 movies of all time. High praise indeed! Setting aside all the 'arty-fartyness' of the quality of the cinematography, the lighting, acting and directing etc, the fact is it's just a brilliant story. Luc Besson and his cast couldn't possibly have put it across any better hence the 10/10 from me. Yes it is quite a violent movie in parts, and 'shoot em up movies' with lots of blood and gore aren't my preferred genre on the whole. But the balance struck in this movie is perfect. Let's face it, you couldn't make a movie about a wet boy without showing some violence. But so many directors could have gone overboard with that side of things. Instead of which Monsieur Besson and his merry band of players stops well short of unnecessary violence. It's a love story without sex, a comedy without banana skins, a drama without over-dramatisation, and above all else it's a heart warming story of a shy and in many ways insecure man taking care of a young girl living in an abusive family environment. Thankfully not once does the viewer read anything into the relationship between the man and the young girl other than what is there, i.e. mutual respect and friendship.

The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer. It is an uncompromising and unconventional uncovering of some uncomfortable realities that are challenging as well as engaging. It is a Movie that can isolate many but also endear those willing to take on a bit more than usual.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
In the top 5 of all films I've seen,"It's hard to find fault with this film. I still think it's the finest performance to date of all 3 main actors, possibly with the exception of Gary Oldman's recent performance in the Darkest Hour. The story is simple yet compelling, the outcome is never clear until the end and the action is short, sharp and spectacular.The interaction between the hitman and the girl is really well done and feels natural. It provides the core interest of the film and although the age difference makes certain interactions a little uncomfortable, this also gives an edge to the relationship which makes the film so compelling.If you have ever considered how Portman has got to where she is now - watch this and you'll understand!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Acting is good and story powerful,"Gary Oldman was amazing. The acting in the movie is superb. Young Natalie Portman really shows exactly how good an actress she could be at the age of 13. Since I haven't seen Black Swan, this, to me is her finest performance. Jean Reno as Leon was absolutely wonderful as the two shared some great scenes but the star of the movie, to me, without any doubt is Gary Oldman. There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable. He does that Heath Ledger's Joker type performance and is absolutely amazing as Stanfield, the one who murdered Mathilda's parents.The story itself is incredibly movie. By now, its a story that's being done to death with a bad guy falling in love with kids and growing a heart but no movie has ever nailed the idea like Leon. Seriously, the 2010 Despicable Me is the exact same story and is done horribly when compared to this. Leon is far more detailed. I mean, its not like Leon saw Mathilda and just loved her straight away. No! He tried to kill her during her sleep. He gets annoyed at her, he plays with her and he does everything. The way the relationship was executed was phenomenal.The characters in the movie are just absolutely wonderful and are extremely detailed. Mathilda is probably the finest child character I've ever seen, as Empire Online have said themselves. I could NOT agree more! There is just so much depth to her and not just she lost her brother and wants revenge. You understand her as a character for some strange reason and everything feels real.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I'm left speechless,"This movie had my undying attention until the end and now I feel compelled to write a review.Acting:
Absolutely beautiful acting by jean Reno and natalie Portman. I truly believe they should both win Oscars if they didnt already. The characters were so well developed and interesting. The actors did a phenomenal job at making you feel so many emotions and connections with them. Even other supporting actors and everyone in between did great in their roles. Well done.Cinematography:
Great shots and scenes that are filled with purpose and emotion. It feels like the director took inspiration from many things and spliced them into cinema. Everything was well done and stands the test of time.Story:
Who ever wrote this deserves a glass of milk. Extremely interesting story all the way through. It has many moments where the viewer gets connected with emotion and suspense with the duo. It has funny moments, sad moments and perfectly timed action moments too. Theres something in the film for everyone. The writing, dialog and plot direction was perfect. The only reasoning this is getting just shy of a 10 is because of a few things. I didnt like the awkward kind of crush/love Matilda had for leon. It was really strange and took away from the sweet father daughter relationship they had. Also I didnt really like the ending. I'm all fine with a good send off but the Tony guy seems like the biggest jerk in history. It looks like to me that Tony is just manipulating the girl and isnt going to pay her out. (Without giving things away) what happens from there? Its extremely tragic as there is no proper carer or family left. Other than those things I did throughly enjoy this movie throughout.Summary:
This film has everything you could want as a viewer. Its almost perfect besides the things I stated above. I would highly encourage anyone who is reading this review to give this a watch, its fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
The Director's Cut is a Must Get,"Some of the reviews here ummm sound more like fanatical praise than critiques. lol. thats cool i guess since i agree that this movie is really great. i cant add any more positive comments about this film other than to strongly recommend that you watch the longer director's cut version - (i think it will be released on dvd in us pretty soon). i first saw the director's cut about a year ago and enjoyed the film immensely. it evoked all these emotions in me. not alot of movies can do that. then i got to watch ""the professional"" at someone's house and i was really disappointed. it was as if someone had took out all the good parts. imagine your favorite movie and then just imagine the editors cutting out about 20 minutes of stuff. so in conclusion, i suggest you watch the director's cut to get luc besson's true vision for this film. oh and to some of you here who said that this movie is about pedophilia, abusing a young girl's age and sex, etc, imho, i dont think you got the point of the movie at all. please go back and rewatch the movie. you may like it the second time around.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"It's like Amelie, Lolita and The Usual Suspects clumped together","It's like Amelie because of the 90s aura, because of the beautiful camera shots filmed in an old New York apartment that could also perfectly be in Paris, because of the colour palette used by the director, because of the amazing, memorable quotes worth keeping, because of Natalie Portman's haircut, because of the way each character is immensely unique, irreplaceable.It's like Lolita because, well, that's kinda obvious. In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and León are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Leóns relationship: she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they say:Léon: You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda: I finished growing up, Léon. I just get older. Léon: For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up.Then it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting: Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.But in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime: all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building? Yet it does, and it's beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"""It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life"".","This is the only Luc Besson film that left me feeling satisfied, I think with his previous films (Subway, La Femme Nikita) and in his two films that followed (The Fifth Element, The Messenger) he focused too much on the look and atmosphere of the film, whereas the story just seemed either too stupid or too rushed to make any sense. With Leon however, he got it right.Leon (aka The Professional) is the story of Leon (Jean Reno), a lone hit man who lives a bohemian lifestyle, moving from one low rent apartment to the next whilst making his hits. But after his twelve year old neighbour (Natalie Portman) has her family wiped out by crooked cop Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) Leon is forced to take the girl under his wing and eventually both teach the other a little something about life.Leon is a fantastic action film; it has great characters, brilliant use of mise-en-scene and a chic Eric Serra score. It also has a heart, and at times the scenes can be quite touching, ""I wanna have roots, sleep in a bed, never be alone again Mathilda"" confesses Leon as he must make an important decision.The central message also has a lot of importance, as Stansfield says to Mathilda ""It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life"", this becomes clear for Leon, as he realises that this little girl is leading him into a situation that will be hard to get out of. I'd recommend this film to anyone, the final shoot out in the apartment is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen and the three leads (especially Reno and Oldman) are fantastic, and there's fine support from Danny Aiello as Leon's friend and advisor.Leon is a striking film too often ignored by the wannabe cinefile set who dismiss it as an exercise in style, too caught up with the likes of Goddard to expand their horizons to a new kind of film making. As action movies go, Leon is a cool, fast and unmistakably French affair... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"I'd probably give it a 4, except I'm troubled so many have it a 10.","Here to lower the average. This movie was psychologically unrealistic. The montage segments to lighten the mood after a traumatic massacre of a girls family were out of place in the real world. Felt comedic... yet the director was obviously taking it seriously. The lack of public or police/security presence amidst the loud and violent shootings was off and more than anything, the unusual father-daughter-lover relationship that was supposed to be a demonstration of the hard man's softening heart trope was very awkward.

"""I like these quiet little moments before the storm. It reminds me of Beethoven.""","Léon: The Professional is perhaps one of the finest action films you will likely ever see. The tension builds and builds, the entire film seems to be balanced on a knife's edge. Gary Oldman is superb here, in portraying one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history, in Norman Stansfield. MSM Movies would describe the Norman Stansfield character as ""the role that launched a thousand villains"". The ""Bring me EVERYONE!"" line was entirely improvised by Oldman to make Luc Besson laugh. Funny enough, Norman Stansfield - played by Oldman - who is excessively obsessed with Ludwig van Beethoven. That same year, Oldman would portray Beethoven in Immortal Beloved (1994). In all sincerity Oldman is one of the finest actors of his generation. Gary Oldman is an actor of tremendous range and versatility. He is well known for playing characters that are usually borderline psychotics. He has a great ability to change his psychical appearance and voice to make each character believable and unique. It speaks volumes about his acting, through all these years, to be still cast in high-profile films.The film also features a young Natalie Portman, who would beat two thousand other girls for the role. Léon (played by Jean Reno) is the near unstoppable professional hitman, who reluctantly takes in twelve-year-old Mathilda (Portman) under his wing. The wonderful score by Éric Serra would provide the relentless intensity the film was trying to convey. Who can forget Stings - Shape of My Heart at the ending? This is easily one of his best written songs and works well at the end of the film. This is a real masterpiece - action with real heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Stunning Movie Surprisingly Overlooked,"I'm honestly surprised that this film isn't more well-known that it is, for it is honestly an incredible and well-done movie.Jean Reno is a ""Cleaner"" - a graceful and smooth hitman employed with the Italian mafia. Natalie Portman is a young girl from an abusive household that comes home to find her family murdered and enters Reno's life seeking both sanctuary and revenge. Upon learning what Reno really does for a living, Portman encourages him to teach her the ways of being a professional assassin, and starts her studies under the hands-on teaching of Reno.Surprisingly enough, there is much, much more to this film than the simple misgivings and actions of a hitman who is forced to care for a young girl. Despite its obvious violent backdrop, the film not only chronicles her growth in his art, but also the bond and relationship that comes between them, not only as adult and child but also as father and daughter.Natalie Portman only seeks to be cared for while Jean Reno finds his love hard to give, finally culminating in the ultimate sacrifices being paid for each other - sacrifices which only love could bring about.The acting is done superbly, with Leon's childlike wonder amidst his very mature profession being played to a T by an incredibly under-rated actor Jean Reno. And Mathilda's child-like habits, yet her adult maturity being performed amazingly by an only 13 year old Natalie Portman, this film definitely is a must see, not only for the superb craftsmanship of Luc Besson, but also for the heart-felt story and its ""star-crossed"" love between the characters themselves.With support acting from Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman, this well-done film doesn't receive its due enough, in a time when films have lost what quality such films like these had.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Léon"" (1994) is essentially a movie with everything working so well that you might forgive it's lunatic plot and enjoy for what it is - a movie. The plot is like a fairytale for adults, that would never happen in real life, and there aren't people who live like Leon, nor there are 12 years old girls who can come armed with two weapons into police headquarters with main goal to kill a detective. But this is a movie for god-sake, and a great one it is.It is very sentimental, but that is just one of the parts that makes it's unique and unforgettable. Character are drawn very sharp in here and we start to care for both lead from the opening sequence of them together - that is because of performances, great and simple script and wonderful chemistry between two leads - this is still i think one of the very best performances by Natalie Portman. Directing, cinematography are great, with some clearly visible style and mood trough the film, which makes it feel like a unique - still.Overall, ""Léon"" is great action film with lots of well made sentiments. Performances are amazing by all three actors (Oldman including), but it's Natalie who steals the show. Add craftsmanship which creates this unique style, simple but sharp script and tons of sentimental moments (but not to much) and a bit coming of age story and you will get a mix of superb motion picture, a true fairytale for adults.

The problem is that this is not a sci fi movie. These are things that are necessary for a crime movie, especially of this nature. This is not the matrix or some sort of martial arts film. It is a organized crime/hitman movie. And in these movies you expect things to be realistic and believable, not overdramatized and downright silly. And thats what this movie is.

Charming and brutal,"IMDb Top 250: 33I think a big part of why this film was so good is that it could've been so bad. Consider the alternate film this may have been: an icy, one- dimensional hit-man somehow pairs with a bratty young girl to face a drugged police character in this summer's brainmelting blockbuster.But it's not that. It came out as Leon: The Professional.Leon is a special film. It channels classics like Taxi Driver, Batman, and many many New York films but has its own unique identity. Part thriller, part drama, the film is touching and exciting, and reels you in from its stellar first scene and takes you for a fantastic adventure.The story, while having the possibility of being off-putting, works. Sure you can question the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (depending on the cut of the film you saw, I saw the International cut and everything was fine), but I found it more reasonable than say the relationships in Doctor Zhivago and Lolita. Anyway, the story- it's original and takes many turns, but stays on track and never slows without reason.A story only goes so far: the biggest success of Leon is its 3 main characters. Jean Reno IS Leon, I can't see anyone doing any better. As the cold, solitary hit-man who is handed a very different responsibility, we grow to love Leon with his quirky persona of houseplant caring, movie watching and chair sleeping. He is an iconic character with his sunglasses and low voice. His developed duality is remarkable to behold.Leon is complimented by the fiery Mathilda played by the extraordinarily young Natalie Portman, the smoking, swearing kid who grew up with a tough life. As unbelievable as her choices may seem on paper, I totally got behind her reasoning and never found her to do anything horribly distasteful. The duo of killer father and eager daughter is one of the greatest in film.That leaves the sick Stansfield as the target of the duo's revenge. Played by Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of all time, the psychotic, pill-popping shady cop is truly despicable, with his scenes of drug consumption and Beethoven rant to be extremely unsettling.The bread and butter of film is great. There are many shots that I found interesting and unique, and the cinematography and editing is all top notch. The music, decidedly the most French thing about the whole film, is juxtaposed to anything happening on-screen and helps make the film's identity, especially in the bonding scenes between Leon and Mathilda.There is a double-edged sword about the film. We see Leon's killer side, and we see him as an awkward caregiver, like in the dress-up game. This mix keeps the audience guessing and keeps the film entertaining. It all culminates in a poetic ending that couldn't be any better or more satisfying.From start to finish, Leon is awesome. It has artistic credibility, awesome action scenes, great characters and acting, as well as the brick and mortar that makes film work. I had never heard of it before seeing the Top 250, and I don't know why it isn't bigger. See this film!9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A 100 points,"""Leon: The Professional"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends action, drama, and emotion to create an unforgettable experience. Directed by Luc Besson and released in 1994, the film revolves around the unlikely relationship between a seasoned hitman, Leon (played by Jean Reno), and a young, orphaned girl named Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her debut role).The strength of ""Leon: The Professional"" lies in its compelling characters and their nuanced performances. Jean Reno delivers a powerhouse portrayal of Leon, a hitman with a strict moral code and a mysterious past. His stoic demeanor and emotional vulnerability make Leon a complex and relatable character. On the other hand, Natalie Portman's performance as Mathilda is nothing short of extraordinary. Despite her young age, Portman conveys a wide range of emotions, from innocence to resilience, adding depth to the character.The film's narrative is tightly woven, combining intense action sequences with moments of poignant character development. Besson's direction keeps the audience on the edge of their seats while also inviting them to connect with the characters on a personal level. The pacing is well-balanced, allowing the story to unfold organically and keeping viewers engaged throughout.One of the standout aspects of the film is the unconventional relationship between Leon and Mathilda. The dynamic between the two characters is both heartwarming and thought-provoking, challenging traditional notions of family and loyalty. The mentor-protégé bond that develops between them adds a layer of emotional complexity to the narrative, elevating it beyond a mere action film.The cinematography of ""Leon: The Professional"" is visually striking, with Besson and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast creating a dark and atmospheric world that mirrors the characters' internal struggles. The use of wide shots during action sequences and close-ups during intimate moments enhances the overall viewing experience. The film's gritty aesthetic, coupled with Eric Serra's hauntingly beautiful score, contributes to the creation of a memorable cinematic atmosphere.Additionally, the supporting cast, including Gary Oldman as the unhinged and corrupt DEA agent Stansfield, adds another layer of intensity to the film. Oldman's portrayal of Stansfield is both menacing and captivating, making him a memorable antagonist who complements the protagonists' performances.""Leon: The Professional"" is not without its controversies, particularly regarding the portrayal of a relationship between an adult hitman and a young girl. However, the film handles these themes with a degree of sensitivity, focusing more on the emotional connection and growth of the characters rather than exploiting the potential for controversy.In conclusion, ""Leon: The Professional"" is a timeless classic that transcends the boundaries of its genre. With its compelling characters, expertly crafted narrative, and exceptional performances, the film remains a benchmark in action cinema. Luc Besson's directorial prowess, coupled with the chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, makes this film a must-watch for cinephiles and casual viewers alike. Despite the passage of time, ""Leon: The Professional"" continues to resonate with audiences, solidifying its place as a cinematic gem that stands the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Leon,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
No plant was mistreated in this movie,What a great actress the plant ... although overacting ... sometimes it took me to weigh even that it was not the same plant ... the others just great.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Classic for a reason,"Action movie filmed using art house film techniques. As much art as it is enjoyment. Each scene carefully crafted to place both the eye as well as the need for action. A tale about an orphaned girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who happens to fall under the wing of a seasoned yet somewhat simple-minded assassin, Léon (Jean Reno). From there, an unexpected friendship blooms.What I like the most is the atmosphere. The world of this film is cruel. Officials are corrupt, you cannot trust your own parents, everyone is willing to look the other way and as a whole there's not much hope to be had. Yet the film's tone doesn't reflect that. Many of its scenes are lighthearted, perhaps a bit naive, but ultimately optimistic. In a lesser film this dichotomy would bother me, but here it works. Its part of the message, that there are pockets of goodness to be found, that not all bad men are evil, just like not all so called angels are good.The camera-work is also excellent, the pacing flawless and the characters are interesting. I must admit that I didn't find the story to be as captivating as I was led to believe, but I blame the hype, not the movie. The ending was also somewhat of a letdown, but it just means it wasn't my cup of tea, not that there was anything wrong with it.Léon is classic for a reason and rightfully considered to be Luc Besson's masterpiece. Worth a watch for all that are looking for an action movie with a soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
One of The WORST Movies I Ever Watched!,"Mind-bogglingly dumb, insanely bad and over the top cringey story and acting, one of the worst and uninspiring dialogues I've ever heard, super creepy and uncomfortable at times that I honestly had to look away (a 12 year old showing too much skin), has some of the worst senses and attempts at humor I've ever seen in a movie (we're talking kindergarten lvl of humor), and I found myself asking almost all throughout the movie ""WTF is goin on ?!!

"Memorable, crazy movie","I hadn't heard much about this movie, so I really went out on a limb watching it. But sometimes it really pays off.First off, let me start by saying that in my opinion, this was one CRAZY movie. But I guess thats why I like it so much. Not a whole lot seemed to make perfect sense, but I guess thats what they were aiming for.The best performance by far was Jean Reno as Leon, the lonely professional hit-man, living in a run-down apartment down the hall from a dysfunctional family. Cast out in the family is Mathilda (Played by a young Natalie Portman), the 12 year old daughter who seems to be kicked around by everyone in the family except her little brother. While out shopping, Mathilda's family is killed by corrupt DEA agents, led by the completely insane Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).Among many good performances was a unique plot, and many memorable scenes and lines. The music score really helps set the mood of each and every scene. Like I mentioned, I think this is a crazy movie so maybe thats why it stands out. You feel a bit of every emotion here as well.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
"Besson, the writer/director","Not every day you see a film that shows, as its opening credits, the actors who star in it, the composer of its score and its writer and director. Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's ""Léon"". Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.Taking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after ""Léon"", all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director.""Léon"" is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though ""Le grand bleu"" takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man Léon (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job.The style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from ""Nikita"") putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character.You see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and/or psychological disorders: he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like ""Singing in the rain"". His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie ""Danny the Dog"", shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.The other relationship Besson writes and details in ""Léon"" is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in ""The Piano"") that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being.I want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so Léon can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then Léon does John Wayne.This is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's Léon is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living.In that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves.The movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like ""Le grand bleu"") and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A Beautiful Movie afraid to Commit,"Luc Besson is a competent director, and most of that is on display in ""Leon"" which portrays a mystical sense of intrigue from its main male lead. However when breaking down the overall plot, it doesn't really come together with a sense of believability from both its setup and payoff.Jean Reno is fairly good, although he's playing a character a bit too quiet for my liking. Natalie Portman is dressed to play the part and this is probably her best role despite it being so early. Gary Oldman is mad as always but his character doesn't have a lot of backstory so he somewhat becomes a caricature.The individual elements work fairly well, especially some of the cinematography that uses light and focused lenses to create sense of perspective from the characters. However as a whole I feel it plays everything a bit too safe, and the antagonists are largely all exposition and no meaning.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Gary Oldman rocks!,"Jean Reno plays a near-illiterate, but skilled 'cleaner', or 'fixer'. That means you will do what he says... or else. Most hitmen aren't so genial..Frankly, a lot of bad language & graphic violence in this entry, but Gary Oldman is worth the price of admission. His performance as a crooked, quirky cop is frightening. He showed his bad guy chops 2 decades ago in 'Fifth Element' & 'Air Force One'. More recently, he portrayed Churchill in 'Darkest Hour', but I marvel at his work as the quiet, honest cop, Gordon, in the Batman entries with Christian Bale. Oldman can play under-stated or over-stated, as the occasion requires. In this one, he's a raving loonie, guaranteed to make the weirdo dating your daughter look like a prize catch.If you read the IMDb trivia, you will learn that Oldman more or less improv'd a couple of scenes in Léon, for effect. He is an immensely unlikable character in this flick-ruthless & heartless-but you can't take your eyes off him anyway.Natalie Portman, in her 12-yr old rookie appearance, shines and Jean Reno, as the 'cleaner'-gunman who becomes obliged to mentor/protect Portman, is outstanding in a role similar to another 90'S flick, Wasabi, in which he played a tough French cop (I didn't say it was a nice cop). 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A tale of unlikely bonds and revenge,"""Leon: The Professional"" is a stylish action-thriller directed by Luc Besson that explores the unconventional relationship between a professional hitman and a young girl. Jean Reno stars as Leon, a solitary and efficient hitman in New York City whose life is upended when he takes in Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her debut role), a 12-year-old girl seeking vengeance for her family's murder.The film excels in its portrayal of the bond that develops between the hardened assassin and the vulnerable yet determined girl. Reno brings a stoic yet compassionate depth to Leon, while Portman delivers a remarkably mature performance, capturing Mathilda's mix of innocence and resolve. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt and unhinged DEA agent Stansfield, provides a menacing and memorable antagonist.While the film boasts intense action sequences and emotional moments, some may find the storyline and character dynamics controversial and unsettling. Despite this, ""Leon: The Professional"" remains a gripping and well-crafted film, showcasing strong performances and Besson's distinctive direction. It is a thought-provoking exploration of loneliness, redemption, and the complexities of human connections.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

When someone tries to play an innocent character in a movie, I don't believe they can do it so well unless they are really a bit innocent. And hence my belief that the guy who plays Leon is somewhat of a Leon in reality as well and Mathilda does a carry a bit of Mathilda in her beyond the silver screen.It is an emotional journey of two characters. The plot, the story has absolutely nothing special to it. Its all about the characters and how they make you believe in the things they believe in. It is a performances centric movie and here are two performances in the history of cinema that are not to be missed.Leon just marginally hovers on looking like being retarded but does a fine job of staying away from that zone safely in the end. It is his personality, his love that sets him so far apart from the rest of us. A bit more could have been done to prove his ""professional"" credentials, but I guess that is all they could in the early 1990s. The movie has immense potential for action that should be fulfilled in a remake. Oh wait, a remake has been attempted in Hindi in a movie called Bichchoo, starring Bollywood's very own Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. Once you see Leon you will laugh your a** out watching Bichchoo. In fact, I think the guys would have been better off making Bichchoo as a true parody like Scary Movie or somethingThen there is Mathilda enacted by Natalie Portman in her debut movie. She is 12 and has the emotional leanings of an 18 year old. Her falling in ""love"" with a seemingly 40ish Leon is awkward, at least to eastern sensibilities. But no concession has been given to her age in showing her love and hatred and for that you have to hand it out to the makers.All in all, a great GREAT emotional drama.

A young Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a down on her luck kid who craves revenge and a parental figure to guide her through a tough part of her life. Léon, played by Jean Reno, truly is the star of this film. Léon is a notorious Italian assassin who travels on a path of self discovery throughout this whole film. With every word that Léon speaks you can sense a deep and daring combination of optimism, pessimism, and darkness. Though he is a rather quiet character, just the tone in Léon's voice shows that he is a true striking mafia man. Finally, the villain in this film, played by Gary Oldman, is a devious character. As the film progresses, your hate for him builds up inside. My one issue with Oldman's character, however, is that you cannot relate to him. All good villains should have a reason for what they are doing and something in common with the protagonist, in this case Léon. This was not present in Oldman's character. Aside from this one minor flaw, great, realistic but still awesome characters made this film what it is.As great as the characters are, when I think of this movie I will always first think of its incredible score, composed by John Altman. Every step of the way the score perfectly accompanies the mood of the scene. It is a perfect example of how symphony music doesn't just appeal to the wide arrange of 80 year old's throughout the world, but can also appeal to many more people if executed correctly, which it was.As my title would suggest, Léon can't be fit into one genre, but many. The action aspect of this film is incredible. With near complete use of practical effects and Besson's history in directing great action films, you really marvel at how certain scene's were created (particularly the end of act three, like holy crap!). The drama and emotional conflict in this film is also substantial. You can understand and relate to many of the characters in this movie, and really feel what they are feeling for a lot of the film (aside from the large number of people in this film that get shot, that would hurt like hell and as a result Besson didn't include that aspect for viewers). There is also a strange feeling of romance in this film, but that gets into spoiler territory so I should shut up!One slight issue that I have always had in this film is not what is present, but what is not, for the majority of the film. Unlike most other films, my favorite moment in Léon: the Professional is the first act. There is a deep feeling of darkness and actual fear throughout the whole first act. You get the horrendous feeling that something awful will happen, and it does. I would've liked to see that feeling of darkness a bit more throughout the film. Not the whole time, but I think that feeling could have added a lot to a few scenes.In conclusion, Léon the Professional is a gorgeous, musical, grim, witty, and brilliantly put together film. For this reason it deserves an A- (8.3/10).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A Rare Treat,"At first when I heard about the plot to this, I thought it will not work. A young teenager girl being looked after by her neighbour hitman, since her whole family is completely massacred by a bent copper.It sounded like it was going to be a buddy movie, one of those where everyone will live very happily. But when I watch this, I was so wrong. It is one of those movies which will always remain as one of my favorites, ranked with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This movie is easily intertwined both funny scenes between the girl and the hitman, the graphic violence, and the great acting by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman and producd with one the finest movies ever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Cult status is well deserved,"Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a 12 year old girl, sees her family murdered by Stanfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang, and is taken by Léon (Jean Reno), a professional hit-man that teaches her the trade.I know that cinema, has an art form, may serve to break the boundaries of reality, but I like to see some plausibility in movies and stories; I say this 'cause the action scenes are, as usual, exaggerated and unrealistic, mainly at the beginning of the movie. But as it progresses, we get to know the characters and are plunged into their world due to first-class acting and the strange relation Léon and Mathilda develop. The camera work of Luc Besson is very interesting and well thought out, greatly enhancing the quality of the movie.Is it worth watching? Definitely!

"Inspired by ""Home Alone""","Both ""Leon"" and ""Home Alone"" contain plot elements involving a young child doing things one would find not very likely to happen, or even remotely possible. ""Home Alone"" of course was a comedy, so you can laugh at the silliness of it while realizing all along that it's preposterous. But does that idea still work in a film you are supposed to take seriously?Plot In a Nutshell: A young girl left orphaned by a drug hit on her family is taken in and mentored by her next door neighbor, who happens to be a lethal assassin.Why I rated it a '6': Because the plot is as silly as it sounds. It actually DOES sound like a comedy, doesn't it? Sadly, it's not. And it's all the worse for it. Who really thinks a loner hitman would do this? How about bringing the girl to an orphanage? Or Child Services in the city? Hello? Well, no, because then you wouldn't have a movie. But does anyone really think an actual contract killer would take in a little girl, and not only that, but begin to train her in the ways of an assassin? Count me out. This isn't compelling theater. It's fantasy all the way, and not very riveting at that. Not for a second did I find myself invested in this plotline. I kept thinking ""if I was a hitman, would I do this?"" and the answer kept coming back ""Uh, no you would not."" So the film's story lost me very early on, and it could not get me back. The fact that this unrealistic fantasy (yet set in the real world) is currently #31 on the IMDb Top 250 is pretty hilarious. For all the wrong reasons of course.Roger and me: In his 1994 review Roger Ebert gave this film 2.5/4 stars, calling it ""a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture,"" and he was right on the money. Fanboys take note.6/10. Good cinematography and acting, but an extremely unlikely and unrealistic plot makes this a one-and-done film.

"Deep down in criminal's heart, there is still mercy","In criminal perspective, mercy is something strange. They think mercy is a weak character and they don't believe in kindness as we believe it. So from the first time I read the synopsis, I feel curious. How the professional assassin can rescue a little girl? I mean, how his heart is touched by someone like an orphan? It's a kind of interesting yet unique paradigm.And the ""movie rhythm"" is just flow like a river, which in some scenes we may find fluctuation. I think it is not boring at all. I can enjoy this movie every time. Not so serious movie, but just a combination of drama and crime in the thriller cinematography. I rated this movie ""8 of 10"" because there is some not-logical-action during the movie. So it's all the movie deserved for me.I don't highly recommended this movie, even its rank is 31.

"Leon, The Professional","The measured lifestyle of the killer was turned off in one day, after in his door the 12 years old girl was knocked. He knew, how it would be ending, but nevertheless has let the girl. Small Matilda had no place to go, after all her family was killed by the corrupted policemen. The little girl has only one desire to revenge for the little brother who was killed by people of Stensfild. Living with Leon she understands that has fallen in love to him. Mathilda, a twelve-year old New York girl, is living an undesirable life among her half-family. Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield. Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from breaking apart. One day, Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little, thus killing the whole family. Only Mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by finding shelter in Leons apartment in the moment of highest need. Soon, she finds out about the strange neighborers unusual profession — killing — and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother. Leon, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and in friendships, does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble — unsuccessfully. Now, the conflict between a killer, who slowly discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police officer, who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness, arises to unmeasurable proportions — all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

A gangster's fairytale,"So much can be said about this movie. It is really a wild guess that worked out brilliantly to let a kid play a leading role in a gangster movie. Nathalie Portman's debut is to thank for the truly magnificent believability she gives to her role. Jean Reno, Danny Aiello are the other masters at work. Gary Oldman however plays the part of his life. Nothing is scarier than a lunatic who smiles at you. And he plays the part of the mentally deranged corrupt criminal so well that it is a joy to watch again and again.Seen ""Leon"" 10 times or more now and I keep loving it. Every time I think now I have seen it all, but it stays thrilling till the very end. And endearing. How does director Luc Besson do that? How does he make a serial killer so likeable?If I would just tell the story you wouldnt believe me. Objectively speaking this script makes no sense. None. Even a character in the movie who has to explain what has happened isnt believed. A hitman for the mob gets befriended with a young girl. That's the story in a nutshell. But that doesnt come close to what really happened. The story presented in a nutshell sounds sweet, doesnt it? But there are massive amounts of assasinations that take place in between scenes.How can that be sweet? But it can be, because the violence in ""Leon"" is presented as if it were a game of playing cowboys and indians. That ""funny"" tarantino kind of violence in ""Leon"" is produced by a frenchman who came to America: director Luc Besson. This man has an odd talent: he mixes humor and childlike innocence on the one hand with brutal violence on the other hand. And somehow it works. The violence is cartoonlike and funny, but still suspensefull and realistic. Just as in Quentin Tarantino's work. You can laugh about the violent crimes in ""Pulp Fiction"" but you still take Samuel L. Jackson seriously.Oh I could go on and on about this movie. Never felt a bigger urge to write about so many different aspects in a review as with ""Leon"". Because it is extraordinary unique in script and excecution by the director. I think that ""Leon"" is Luc Besson's masterpiece. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly performed. And a script that is bonkers but still so believable and endearing thanks to those magnificent young acting talents that came together in this fabulous gangster's fairytale!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Luc Besson: The Professional!,"This film, Leon the Professional, is a very strong and powerful film. It's thought-provoking, but emotional. What I liked about this film the most is how we truly feel for the characters. The scenes that we got to know these characters are great since we learn what kind of people they are. I loved how they try to play out the relationship between Leon and his protégé, Mathilda.Luc Besson's film, which is his first American film, is about a hit-man named Leon who reluctantly takes in a girl whose family just got murdered by a corrupt DEA agent and his cronies. Wishing for revenge, Mathilda is tutored on how to kill in order for her to unleash her anger.The acting is very good. Jean Reno is very convincing as Leon and after watching this film, I believe this is his signature film. Making her film debut, Natalie Portman is great and really brings substance to her 12-year-old self. Finally, Gary Oldman is always amazing and he delivers one of his best performances. I love him as a villain and his Beethoven-loving character broadens him yet again.Overall, this is a great film that packs a punch and delivers the goods. One would expect this to be an action or gangster film, but it's more of a character study with more subtle moments. Not to say that there isn't any hardcore action, but the emotional punch this movie gives is what gives this film a heart. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
A great action movie with a heart.,"Deliriously corrupt DEA agents, a murderously vengeful 12 year-old kid who's fond of smoking, and a coldly-efficient killer who has more of a heart than he would like to think. These are the ingredients of Léon: The Professional, and they combine to make quite the tasty dish.This is definitely an action movie, but it's the non-action parts that make it so memorable. Most of them are between Léon and Mathilda. When he first passes her on the stairs with her cigarette and bruises, or when he takes her up on the roof overlooking Central Park for her first real lesson. Scenes like these add a real emotional gravity to the movie, which 75% of action flicks either don't even bother with, or give a half-hearted attempt at, at best. A lot of people may focus on only the violent or seemingly exploitative aspects of the film, but that means that they're missing out on something much deeper.As for flaws, Gary Oldman takes over-acting to a whole new level in this movie. Occasionally, that kind of thing is okay (or even a plus), but not here. This isn't The Fifth Element. He was too wacky to feel sinister or dangerous. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie that is worth adding to anyone's collection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Amazing but a bit creepy (international version),"If you watch the extended cut/ international version, there is a lot more of a romance/relationship between Leon and Matilda, so it's kind of creepy.

A witty film,"A great and witty film about how a hitman really might be.  A hitman really would kill without emotion, just doing his job.  Great plot combined with great acting, with some brutal, but not too bad, violence.  The ending is not disappointing, and I thought that the film was very good.  Jean Reno's acting performance is fine, as is the girl who played Mathilda, and Gary Oldman is OK.  The beginning of the film is great, where he turns up at a house, and moves without sound, and kills without remorse.  A good film experience that I recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Disturbing yet enthralling,"This film drives you to question yourself and makes you deeply uncomfortable along the way, especially in the extended cut. However it is immensely satisfying and has three outstanding performances. Portman's career in my opinion has yet to produce a role so intriguing, Oldman comes across as chillingly both insane and rational, and Jean Reno plays his role spectacularly, capturing both the human and inhuman sides to the character. Although at times I needed to pause and digest it, it was undoubtedly a superb movie. Gritty and unafraid to make bold artistic choices.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Simply a masterpiece,"I've watched this movie three times and the least I can say is that it is a masterpiece. Luc Besson perfectly managed to make us feel things through his movie.

Gary Oldman succeeded at being a villain. It is a smart action movie with a touch of love and comedy. A real thriller, leaving us speechless during all the movie, specially at the end. When the movie ended, I started asking myself questions about me and the world around me.

Admirable film.,"Léon, to put it simply, is a masterpiece. One of the greatest early-modern films, no doubt about it. Natalie Portman at 12 is already excellent, and given a chance so few have: while there are many younger actors a mere handful can win these starring roles, and in serious films they're too young to see. Comparable to Kick-Ass, though this original suspense flies past the modern indie-wannabe in daylight. Nothing was stilted nor pushed too far and the story, yet unmentioned, is simply insightful. The only reason I give an 8, not 9 or even 10, is because 8 is my favourite number, and so only given to those which are worthy. The actors own their roles, and should play these characters more often. (This is) A favourite that will (unexpectedly?) last a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
Possibly the Best Action Film Ever Made,"This movie is art in its purest state. It refuses to follow any boundaries of what should be done and what should not be done, what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. I have never seen a freer movie. It flies like a boundless bird above the mountains and hills and cities.The closest thing I can compare it to are those moments when the protagonist takes their love interest on a flight through the clouds. You the viewer are the love interest. The film is the dark and mysterious protagonist.But even looking past all that, and even looking past the mostly fantastic characters (Gary Oldman is hit-or-miss as the villain, but he does not ruin the film), this movie is fantastic because of its blend of art and action. Outside of MM: FR, I have never seen a movie that blends those two elements so gloriously. Under poor hands, art and action neuter each other. But under expert hands, they amplify each other and create something that will last, that deserves to last.I wish Besson would make another film this great, this beautiful.The first shot of the film is a pan shot over Central Park. Now, normally, this would be nothing more than a standard shot to show our setting, but they way they shoot it makes CP resemble a forbidden jungle or something of the sort, thus giving off the impression that this film will cover the dark and wild side of NYC. It is one of the best opening shots I've ever seen.Every time you think the story is going to zig, it zags. But nothing ever comes off as forced or contrived. In every good story, you are confident the creator knows what they're doing. I always got that feeling when I was watching this film. Combine that with the unconventionality I describes earlier and you have a truly beautiful piece of art.I'm willing to bet you'll feel uncomfortable at times when you're watching the film. This is not a bad thing. Art is not meant to keep you comfortable. It is meant to evoke and make you look at the world differently. There is nothing squicky enough to make any reasonable person turn off the film, but some of the interactions between the assassin and Natalie Portman can make some people shaky. Quickly: she grows to lust for him. He does not take advantage of that, but if you're turned off by such things, you're better off either not watching the film at all or watching the far inferior theatrical cut.This film is everything blockbusters want to be and everything they would never think of being. It is my favorite French film and one of my favorite foreign films. If you want a thoughtful and artistic yet adrenaline-pumping experience, go give it a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"

"7.8/10 - Well-Directed, Full of Cartoonish Action and Fun Whimsicality","Luc Besson's 1994 film, Léon: The Professional, follows Léon, a deadly plant-loving, slow-thinking Italian hitman. This guy was just trying to go on with his steady life as a hitman when Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl whose family got murdered, forced his hand into letting her join him so she can take her revenge upon the cold-blooded killers of her little brother.A fair warning: a lot of people note that Mathilda and Léon's relationship glorifies p3d0philia, with which claim I tend to disagree.Luc Besson's original intentions were probably really problematic, considering the fact that Besson's partner at the time, Maïwenn, he met when she was 12 and he was 29, and he married after impregnating her at 16. She plays a side character in the movie's opening scene, and she sees Léon and Mathilda's relationship as something that's based on her and Besson's real-life marriage.I'd say that maybe because of the fact that Natalie Portman's parents were involved so much in the production, and maybe Luke Besson's fear of outright justifying grooming, the final product - the film itself - doesn't convey such messages. Problematic things happen but the film, in my eyes, mostly presents them in a negative light. That's it, you've been warned. Now, let's move on to talking about the film itself.This film is noticeably very well-directed, and it manages to be visually captivating without being too avant-garde for people to feel it's not accessible. The actions scenes are dynamic and fun (and quite creative), and there's not a single action scene that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. There are some cartoonish qualities to the cinematography as well, and I think it's really cool. Adds to the general whimsicality that this film shows from time to time.Also, the score has no business going this hard. Éric Serra captures the suspense and aesthetic of the scenes he scores in a really accurate way, that totally enhances the scene. The music is also very well-produced and pleasant. If I'm talking about the music, might as well give a nod to the soundtrack. Bjork made me smile for like five whole minutes after the song ended. Love it.Léon is a really likeable character (Jean Reno delivers a great performance in my opinion), and I found myself quite invested in him. He's not complicated and layered or anything, he just works really well. Mathilda was quite annoying, to be honest, but obviously there is no film without Mathilda, and I also like a lot of the ""cleaning"" interactions between her and Léon. All the characters in the film are relatively simple but work well, built with enough thought, creativity and cool dynamics between them all to make this film a very enjoyable watch.Take the killers, for instance - each of them has his own thing, his standout personality that makes them feel more human. Props for that.I still wish that the film would've given me more reasons to like Mathilda, since the film definitely wants us to but I'm not really there. Hard for me to be totally invested in her as a main character, and that's definitely a flaw in the film in my eyes.So despite its problematic background, I think that Léon: The Professional is a good movie. It's funny, well-directed and full of iconic moments. The character dynamics are mostly fun and interesting, and even side characters feel like they have some personality. I think that this film would've benefited from making Mathilda a more likeable character, but still: it's a cartoonish, viby and quite badass film. Feeling a 7.8/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Drama"
