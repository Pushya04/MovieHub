Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece.,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.,"Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it.Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here.Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons.Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further.The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.10/10. Best film of the decade.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Intense,"This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach)It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around.Excellence!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Tension, tension, tension!","After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next ""Yardbird"" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of ""Whiplash"" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: ""What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days"".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with ""Whiplash"" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Just My Tempo,"Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in ""Oz"". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle ""good job"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A Psychological Horror Story,"In New York, a young jazz drummer (Miles Teller) is enrolled in a prestigious music school. His ambitions are tested and manipulated by a sadistic, perfectionist music instructor (J.K. Simmons).There are occasional moments in the film that seem far-fetched and over-the-top. But these are forgiven due to the edgy execution by director-writer Damien Chazelle and the acting.Teller is very believable as someone whose obsession to succeed overrides his sense of safety. This is partly explained in a useful scene at the beginning of an extended family gathering where one-upmanship seemed to be the traditional form of communicating.However, the movie belongs to Simmons who is the epitome of the authority-from-hell. He has rightly won many awards for this performance and he is likely to win more. He is so frightening when he is dominating the students that, even in the audience, there is a sigh of relief felt when he is acting more at-ease and human. His presence is that strong.""Whiplash"" ably presents the question of whether attaining genius is worth the price - at least in certain circumstances. It also succeeds as a psychological horror movie. The Simmons character is likely to be mentioned in the future as one of the movies' most memorable villains. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year,"There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss.I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Intense movie, phenomenal J.K. Simmons but unrealistic","This movie should please a wide audience of non-musicians. I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one.
The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story ""to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits"" is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here.

A strive for perfection.,"Music teacher Terrence Fletcher spots something in raw, but talented young drummer Andy Niemann, desperate to get to the top, Andy makes several sacrifices, to strive for greatness.I can't always give one hundred percent attention to a film, sometimes my mind can wander, here though, I was glued for the full run time. This film is absolutely phenomenal, a relatively low budget movie, but one with an incredible story and some phenomenal acting.How can a film be equal parts subtle and brash, I can't explain why or how, but this film has an incredibly rich content, there is so much going on beneath the surface.The characters, incredibly rich, rounded and thoroughly believable, I must start by commenting on Fletcher, he's fascinating, irascible, angry, but deep, smart, demanding and passionate. JK Simmons won an Oscar for this performance, and deservedly so, he is breathtaking here, it is acting to savour.The film is as much about Fletcher, as it is about Niemann, a total contrast, where Fletcher is hard, brash and tough, Niemann is a little naive, meak, cute, but loaded with talent, it's Fletcher's outrageous demand for perfection from him that's the key.Damien Chazelle nailed it here, the script is pretty near perfect, Oscar nominated, it should have won it.I am blown away by this incredible film, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Sure to be one of the best films of the year,"Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film.

A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...,"When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama ""Whiplash."" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' ""Captain Phillips,"" coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my ""Oscar Isaac"" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in ""Rabbit Hole,"" and then helming ""The Spectacular Now"" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in ""Whiplash."" There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in ""Amadeus,"" as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a ""10,"" he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in ""Juno,"" ""Burn After Reading,"" and ""Up in the Air,"" a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's ""Men, Women & Children,"" writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.You can't credit ""Whiplash"" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year.""Whiplash"" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto.

Blistering,"Nominated for five Oscars, and winning three (editing, sound and Best Supporting Actor, with nominations for screenplay and Best picture), 'Whiplash' is positively blistering, with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that's tense and inspirational.Visually, 'Whiplash' looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful, gripping shots (like close-ups of the drum playing) and some of the tightest, cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year. The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does.The script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace.Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view.'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene.Otherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

What makes this film so excellent is the character driven storytelling. I watched this the same weekend as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (""MOM""), and I was far more captivated by the conflict between the characters of Whiplash than I was of MOM.Whiplash featured incredible twists and turns, that kept me glued to the screen.

"Its message is conflicted, but it's still pretty good.","Though my appreciation of this film has somewhat decreased throughout the several times I've watched it, I still think it has a lot to offer. In the brutal world Chazelle crafts in this film, you need to pay a price for your dreams to come true (Chazelle's La La Land has a similar theme). Not only do we see the toll Andrew's pursuits of being a great drummer have on him, but also on his relationship with those around him given his alienation of some of his family or how he cuts off his contacts with someone who may have gotten in the way of his dream. Also, even though Fletcher's teaching strategies technically work, the film simultaneously acknowledges the downsides to them given what we learn about Sean Casey and how some of Fletcher's students leave his program. In spite of the darker bits though, the movie also manages to be a lot of fun. The jazz concerts are both well-shot and edited, with the standout being the technically outstanding ending which dropped my jaw when I first watched it back in 2014. Finally, J. K. Simmons does a terrific job in this film. He's electrifying when he teaches the band and equally compelling in his quieter scenes, with the standout being his conversation with Andrew about Charlie Parker.In spite of these strengths though, something about the film's message turns me off. While I don't think the film champions Fletcher, it does imply that the only way to achieve greatness is through being abused. You can either roll with the abuse and become famous or give up your dreams. While I'm not denying some people will require that kind of pressure to improve, that isn't the only way someone can become famous. I wish the film would've presented more options to achieve greatness to Andrew, but have him choose to stay in Fletcher's program (staying in abusive relationships that you recognize as being abusive is normal, so this would've worked just fine). As it stood, I thought the film's message was conflicted. Yes, it does acknowledge the flaws to Fletcher's teaching methods, but it also acted like Andrew had no other options to pursue his dream and that didn't sit right with me. In spite of this, however, I still like the film quite a bit. Its strengths are compelling and engaging enough to carry the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Rings completely hollow and false, with no redeeming qualities.","As a musician and a drummer, I was urged by a couple of different friends to watch this ""praised"" movie. Aside from a few of the JK Simmons insults, which I laughed at, there is nothing good about this film, as it clearly shows that the filmmaker and the editor know nothing about music or drumming. He reduces all of drumming to ""that's not my tempo"", thereby dumbing down the entire art form into a click track, meanwhile, revealing no insight into what it actually means to play the drums, or be a musician. The film won an Oscar for best editing, although, throughout the film, the drumming that you hear, and what you see being played by the unlikeable lead actor, do not match, and in the finale, the overhead shots obviously reveal that it is not the actor, but rather a stand-in musician. Both lead characters are unlikeable and actually ridiculous. Everything about the movie rings hollow, and, worst of all, false. The most ridiculous thing of all is how poorly and over-the-top he represents the drumming.

Because this film is a nightmare.Miles Teller gives an under-appreciated performance as a drummer following his passion who is lucky enough (if lucky is the right word) to be chosen by a psycho jazz teacher (J.K. Simmons) to join his class. What follows is a battle of wills, as Simmons tries to grind his students to stumps of their former selves while Teller proves that he won't be so easily dominated.""Whiplash"" goes in a very dark direction and completely defies expectations, which is what I liked most about it. I was expecting a kind of ""Devil Wears Prada"" set in a music school, where the eager pupil first wants to give up, then rises to the challenge, earns the respect of a tough teacher but ultimately decides his worth doesn't depend on proving himself to anybody. But that is most decidedly NOT the direction this film goes, instead turning into a contest to see how much crazier and more obsessed one maestro can be over another.Simmons shouts and blusters his way through a one-note role. He's good in context of what he's asked to do, but it's the kind of showy performance that wins Oscars, not a subtle and complex characterization. Teller is the heart and soul of the film, and he's tremendous. The film is like watching a car accident in slow motion and being unable to do anything to prevent it, and just as unable to look away.Winner of three Academy Awards (Supporting Actor for Simmons, Film Editing and Sound Mixing) and nominated for two others, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Great music, but the plot angers me","This film tells the story of a young drummer who us accepted into the most prestigious music school in New York. The teacher there is very strict, even abusive physically and psychologically. The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve.The music in ""Whiplash"" is great. It's like going to a jazz concert, especially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself, however, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me. Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it evoked a lot of anger in me.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Beat a path to the cinema to see this,"Whiplash is simply astonishing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a gifted and highly ambitious drummer in his first year at an elite New York music academy. There his talents are spotted by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an equally ambitious coach and mentor who is always looking for the ""next big thing"" but has never found it. However, there is a very thin line between being an ""ambitious coach"" and a terrifying bully, and Fletcher constantly crosses that line sometimes inflicting a terrible impact on his young students.In an almost uniformly male environment, love interest is served from the cinema concessionary stand by Nicole (the charming Melissa Benoist) who the shy and uncertain Andrew finally plucks up the courage to ask out on a high-point in his emotional roller-coaster. Spot the female, featuring Melissa Benoist The 'school for protégés' theme has perhaps been trodden before by movies like Alan Parker's ""Fame"", and some of the emotional and creative jostling of elite musicians has appeared in films such as 2012's ""A Late Quartet"". But none of these deliver the degree of passion and intensity metered out in Damien Chazelle's movie.Miles Teller (""Divergent"") is superbly credible as the aspiring jazz drummer Andrew, and it is almost unbelievable that he was not a professional drummer-turned-actor for this film. In fact, the more accomplished jazz drummer (very different to rock drumming apparently) is Nate Lang who plays Carl, his key competitor for the ""percussion 1"" role. The two were apparently locked away in a drumming 'boot camp' for 2 months prior to the movie being filmed.But the starring role in the film goes to J.K. Simmons, probably best known in the supporting role of J. Jonah Jameson, the cranky editor of the Daily Bugle in the Spiderman films (and a number of other Marvel spin-offs). Simmons is quite simply astonishing, channelling the sort of Oscar-winning performance of Louis Gossett Jnr (""An Officer and a Gentleman"") into his vicious drill-sergeant-style performance. He has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor role for both Golden Globe and BAFTA awards, and I would fully expect him to feature in the Oscar shortlist when they are announced on January 15th. Personally speaking, he will be the one I will be cheering for in the awards themselves.Cinematography by Sharone Meir is outstanding, with every drop of blood, sweat and tears glistening on forehead and cymbal. The editing by Tom Cross is also extremely tight, winding up the tension during key encounters. The combination of the two together with Chazelle's tight script effectively spears the audience in the gut.The feature is based on Chazelle's short film of the same name, and on this basis he is a name to watch for the future.Gut-wrenching and enthralling, this film will spit you out the other end feeling emotionally drained. This is simply a film you MUST see. Let me drum it into you again. GO SEE THIS FILM! (If you liked this review please see others at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to receive future posts).

A flawless masterpiece,"This is one of my favorite movies. I've watched it at least 10 times. It's almost perfect throughout. The acting is superb. I can't even imagine any actor or actress who could replace any of those in the film. J. K. Simmons deserved that Oscar, hands down.It's art, obsession and the ruthless pursuit of mastery. If you've never been consumed by the need to be the best, you won't get it. All they see is psychological terror and verbal abuse. But anyone who's truly obsessed with becoming the best-one of the greats-knows they'll endure hell, sacrifice everything for the art, and stay laser-focused. They'll confront abuse and hardship without flinching because all that matters is their ambition and recognition. In Whiplash, this obsession is captured in its simplest form through the young drummer that above all is only human and tries to find his way in life, but ultimately is driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to become the best and be acknowledged by others. To fully appreciate it, you also need to understand the precision, discipline, and mastery that real music-jazz and orchestras-demands from skill to tone to tempo to coordination-when you want to become the best. This movie isn't about a cruel teacher. It's not about getting the viewer to sympathize. The ending is undoubtedly one of the all-time greats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Whiplash,"Whiplash is an electrifying cinematic experience that gripped me from the very first frame. As someone who has always had a passion for music, I found myself deeply immersed in the world of jazz drumming, even though my knowledge of the genre is limited. The film's intensity is palpable, and it captures the relentless pursuit of perfection in a way that resonates universally, regardless of whether you play an instrument or not.From the moment J. K. Simmons bursts onto the screen as Terence Fletcher, I felt the air shift. His commanding presence is both terrifying and magnetic, and he embodies the role of a mentor who pushes his students to their limits-often beyond what is considered acceptable. There's a scene where he throws a chair at Miles Teller's character, Andrew, that left me breathless. It's not just a shocking moment; it encapsulates the film's exploration of the fine line between motivation and abuse.Miles Teller's performance as Andrew is nothing short of remarkable. He perfectly conveys the struggle of an ambitious young man who is willing to sacrifice everything for his dream. I could feel his frustration, pain, and determination as he navigates Fletcher's brutal training methods. The drumming sequences are exhilarating, and the sound design immerses you in the rhythm and chaos of the practice room. I found myself tapping my feet and holding my breath during those intense moments, as if I were right there on stage with them.What struck me most was the psychological depth of the film. It's not just about music; it's about the human condition, ambition, and the cost of greatness. The film poses challenging questions about the nature of success: Is it worth sacrificing your mental health, relationships, and well-being? Watching Andrew's transformation was both inspiring and heartbreaking. I found myself reflecting on my own ambitions and the pressures we often place on ourselves to achieve.Damien Chazelle's direction is masterful. The editing is sharp, and the cinematography beautifully captures the frenetic energy of the music. Each frame feels meticulously crafted, and the pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film's climax is a stunning culmination of tension and artistry that left me exhilarated and emotionally drained.Whiplash is a film that lingers long after the credits roll. It's a visceral exploration of ambition and the sacrifices that come with it, and it challenges viewers to consider what it truly means to be great.

terrific performances,Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) is a first year student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. His father Jim (Paul Reiser) is a sweet high school teacher. He gets picked by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) to be the backup drummer in his winning Studio band. He gets enough confidence to ask out Nicole (Melissa Benoist). Fletcher is a cruel manipulative dictatorial teacher.J.K. Simmons gets a great juicy part to show his skills that he has shown all these years. He fully deserves his Oscar win and it's not a surprise. He's certainly done great work in many TV and movie roles before over the years. Miles Teller take a great step up. He has done good work but this is something much more. It's a compelling character who develops and changes. He's able to play through it all.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Bleeding Passion,"People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band: there's Fletcher militarily pushing his student, Andrew, to get his task right. The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character's motivation of achieving his orders perfectly; and the similarities could end there. Although this is a very different context; the harsh, shout-y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent. But without any grim twists, this movie just sticks directly to one's determination of being successful to his job, either for the instructor or for himself. This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control. And just like those sequences, Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone, and leads them to rewarding results.Movies like this, specifically relationship between a student and a mean teacher, conventionally ends with a heart changing sentiment, possibly leading the two to an unexpected life-long friendship, but Whiplash takes it stone-cold; hardly showing any sign of friendliness in their bond. The only way for the young drummer to gain his own light is to roll with the punches and learn exactly what the band want him to do, even if it costs much of what he has in life. This is supposed to be an image of inspiration, but the film mostly portrays the nightmares of this ""never give up"" ambition; which transforms the dreamer into a mad man who is few steps away of breaking down. Nonetheless, this unending pressure brings real impact to what lesson this movie is trying to show.The filmmaking is spectacular all in all, each of its musical scenes makes for a truly grandeur show, but the core here are the ones that is mainly about the drums. They are impressively played with relentless intensity, while the camera strikingly displays the flowing literal sweat and blood of the drummer; indicating his committed exhaustion. The performances are the spotlight, especially J.K. Simmons who has done perfect to his character. It might have been easy for an overacted performance, but Simmons finds the sense of humanity beneath what it's written, making Fletcher reasonable to furiously shout at any intolerable flaw of his students. Miles Teller also killed it, recognizably for the drumming parts, but aside of that, he convincingly follows through the character's obsession, until he turns closer to insanity.Whiplash often feels cruel, but there is an important reason for that. It depicts a serious way of motivation, you can feel that in every beat of his terrifyingly breathtaking drum performances; this is mostly the reality of being unstoppable to what you are desperately aiming for, plus driven by fear and hate. But eventually, the film makes a clear point why their world of music have to be this bitter. Overall, it all works by choosing clever directions, staging magnificent musical set pieces, and remarkable acting from its two leads. Even if the story is quite simple, its heart tends to overwhelm you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Intense But The Hype And Awards Possibly Work Against It,"Do you know who I am ? "" asks the film's protagonist as the audience are introduced to himYeah you're that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn't all that different from the role OZ fans know him for . It's nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema . It's even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by itSo is it any good ? Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it's not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be . One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline . Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it's the same with WHIPLASH . How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines ? That's already been done a hundred times before and so here we've a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school . It's a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there's a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the leastWhat stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing , sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling . Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action . The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time . It's nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it's probably a film that's easier to admire than to like .

Nice,"Top-notch camera work and top-notch JK Simmons. Tension stays high throughout the whole movie, and many twists keep the story from being predictable. Execution is well above average.
While it's surley entertaining, I think Whiplash lacks some depth. When the credits roll, you will find out that the story arc is very linear, and there's no enlightenment in it. At the and of day, this story is about grit and endurance, and nothing else. 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Bitches Whew,"If this is already diminishing in my estimation minutes after watching, it's because it's about subjects that are dear to me, music, concentration, meaning in life and placement of ourselves in the larger music, but it has no insights to impart, or none that I have any use for.The whole is about ego pummeling away in the effort to be someone in the eyes of others rather than the joy of the craft itself, about clinging on to achievement than flowing on the creativity of the moment, about perfecting technique than cultivating soul, what Spanish musicians know as duende; the deep urge that rises from the body and cries to express itself as music.Now I'm not a fanatic jazzist who thinks the music should be portrayed in this or that original light, the film may well be seen after all to be about confused individuals who miss the point, a bad teacher. But the bad teacher who hammers home a trivial point is the filmmaker.We see how this clinging is more or less disastrous for everyone, how it derails them from expressing soul. It's also what puts them back on the stage. But I miss the deeper and softer insight here, for which jazz is a model, that we should indeed strive to perfect our craft, but that's so we can be able to use it freely and without obstruction, so that we can pierce through the sheet, the notation, to the real hum of music that spontaneously unfolds in the room where we play with others, become the instrument for music that plays itself.The film is in the end as small as what it shows, unable to pierce from merely polished technique to wonder or let go of fixation with accomplishment to begin immersion in fulfillment.It ends just as it would have to do that. It all builds up to a last scene of dueling between master and student for room in the stage that finally perhaps sublimates all the ego and hardship in music that sweeps both. In that scene we have a frantic display of ego as determination, but is his drum solo great music or merely an elaborate flourish apart from the music that the music has to stop for?And this extends in a cinematic way, the scene is adroitly edited but is it anything more than a piece of mastered technique, mechanical?(I wrote last year about a film called A Spell to Ward off the Darkness which has a much more spacious swimming of the cinematic eye, also incidentally between instruments on a stage, but faced the same conundrum, soul wasn't there, duende. This is bar none the most striking limit in expression with a camera since the beginning of cinema, one that every great maker strives to push back. Many have.)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Fantastic,"There are multiple reasons why Whiplash comes to the Toronto International Film Festival with palpable anticipation. The film was showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival where it went on to both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize award for best dramatic film. Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch and J.K. Simmons, well, he's J.K. freakin' Simmons. So the gathering audience at the afternoon screening was primed, ready and eager for the expected greatness about to be screened.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman, a determined 19-year-old drummer who is pushed to his emotional limits by his new instructor Terence (J.K. Simmons). Terence has a reputation for being the best, but mentoring under his tutelage comes at a price. Terrence is no Mr. Miyagi. He is ruthless in his barrage of verbal sewage that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve. Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can't find Terence's tempo, , ""Were you rushing or were you dragging? If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig. Oh my dear God - are you one of those single tear people? You are a worthless pancy-ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl!"" There is no ""Wash-on, Wash-off"" PG-ness here.Being mean is in Terence's nature. And his assault on his young protégés is sometimes hard to watch. Think of Gunnery Sargent Hartman in Full Metal Jacket and imagine the persistent yelling and abuse for an entire film. Throughout, Andrew remains resilient. His goal to become a drummer of future legend has him shun friends and family. He's all alone and the uncomfortable Terence bond that he creates is all that he has.Audiences will be unsure of where Whiplash is headed. Are we headed for a triumphant climax where the drill sergeant-esque nature of the instructor pays off in a musical crescendo closing that brings audiences to their feet? Or will the pressure and barrage of verbal bullying take effect with a shocking tragedy that spotlights the harassment of our children. Be sure, this is no Mr. Holland's Opus and the hate and evil that Terence employs travels from opening to closing credits without reprieve.Writer-director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur. We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play. We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew's goal.The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew's defiance while gasping at his situation.The result is a fantastic film that is sure to be considered for Best Picture at next year's Academy Award's. It is a rousing crowd pleaser will have audiences clapping with hands they will want washed of Terence's abuse. J.K. Simmons has the role he was meant to play and his character was not only brilliant but could rank as one of the best cinematic villains of all-time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

music and obsession,"J. K. Simmons has played a number of stern, demanding characters during his career. But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"". He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band. This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse. In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods, the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed. Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance. Although it was for Best Supporting Actor, the movie belongs to him. Miles Teller's performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons. His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Mind-Blowing Jazz Music Harmonising with Some of the Most Amazing Acting,"Miles Teller being an up and coming actor along with JK Simmons who is a well-established underrated actor, whose performances have often been spell-bounding, together have made one of the best movies I've ever seen in the music genre (and I've seen Inside Llewyn Davis). Miles, who plays Andrew, a young drummer studying at one of the top schools of music, shows us his passion in every frame, every single time, whilst delivering a performance. His anger, temper, rise, fall, and everything else in between worked so well with the movie, that he caught my attention with every single frame passing by. As time passes, I am sure he will take the industry by storm along with all the other young up-and-coming actors and actresses. Simmons, who plays Fletcher, delivers a performance worthy of his name. Actually I might actually go ahead and say that this is the best I've ever seen him act. He convinces me completely that Fletcher is an insane perfectionist, so much so that he can forget that the performers were even human, until he gets the beat, tempo and rhythm he needs. Insanity suited his character and he delivered that in an extraordinary fashion. Both the actors showed their passion on screen, but I must give props to the director, who made the film go at the right pace, pushed the actors to show insane amounts of passion, and not allow the audience to divert their attention from these captivating performances. I love jazz music, but don't have much knowledge. But whatever I saw in this movie and heard as well, made me love it even more. Whiplash and Caravan were two genius compositions, and they were so amazingly beautiful. I actually don't know the right adjectives here to help me show how much I loved the score. All the other characters also played their part quite well making this movie one well-rounded show of art. All in all, this is one movie that even the non-jazz lovers will love.

A study in bullying and acceptance thereof: drummer's blood,"Simmons may have picked up a supporting actor Oscar for this performance, and he may have deserved in comparison with the rest of competitors for that award in 2014, but it has to be said that he is a repulsive and manipulative bully and that his character is no example to anybody - quite the contrary. In fact, his eagerness to label others with derogatory and even insulting adjectives quickly becomes difficult to watch.If that is what is required for the human being to exceed his limitations - be it in music, sport, art, or any other field - then this is out and out human rights violation and I would rather live with a bit more mediocrity.Tellers tries his best in a difficult part, but the very ambiguity at the heart of his character's nature - in turns accepting and rejecting Simmons' bullying - detracts from the spectator's sympathy. His search for personal greatness as a drummer, at the expense of love and family, is a welcome warning to anyone thinking of following that path.And then I have a real problem accepting that Charlie Parker was the ""greatest musician of the 20th Century,"" as the central characters claim, and I do not care for the final rendition of ""Caravan,"" a wonderful piece of music that the two of them (Simmons unwillingly at first, then encouragingly) turn into a near solo drummer show.The unremittingly bleak photography and atmosphere; the characters' apparent failure to learn and become better human beings; and the director's emphasis on highlighting meanness and the absence of redemption with his chiaroscuro backgrounds, all made for an unpleasant movie experience for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

As an amateur musician...,"As an amateur musician, I really couldn't enjoy this. It is not really about jazz, let alone music. It's a movie about an abusive teacher and an obsessively self-destructive student, that uses the world of jazz music as a contrivance. Because so few people are familiar with the world of music, let along jazz, the movie is able to use this contrivance to create drama by divorcing itself from any kind of reality, under the pretence of insight.This wasn't a music movie, it's a sports movie (ht Adam Neely). It takes the tired sports formula, and substitutes football for jazz, with such a low level of realism the average person would be able to spot its absurdity from a mile away. It's terribly cringy, if not downright absurd. I doubt many people would rave about a movie about an abusive coach and a football player (who is obsessed with a very old deceased football player) on a team where no-one really loves football, no-one talks about football, and no-one care about their team-mates, and no parent cares if the coach is abusing their kids, etc. But substitute football for jazz, and apparently, this movie is critically acclaimed? Why? There are far better films about abuse, education, obsession. But I guess there are very few films about jazz, and so this imposter seems insightful to some. Trust me. Its not.

This brings the art of music down to the level of sports,"Throwing a chair, slapping a music student repeatedly in front of his class in rehearsal simply because the teacher doesn't know how to teach rhythm.

The guy isn't a ""hard teacher"", he's just an asshole. Anyone knows that a good teacher can solve simple problems like this very quickly and knows that hitting a student isn't the answer. But this screenplay is an amateur work and sought out this method to evoke drama than showing someone who was a real teacher who was passionate about the craft and found a better way to work with students. But hey, showing a kid get slapped around gets you off, then this hazing film is for you. It's sure to play on your Picure-in-Picture along side wresting with you and your buddies pausing to say, ""Wait...watch this..."" and the kid gets slapped and they all say, ""awesome!"" and have another beer.

Just my tempo,"Whiplash was an emotionally absorbing character study. Andrew (Miles Teller) aspires to be a legendary drummer, and Fletcher ( J. K. Simmons) sees potential in Andrew and gives him a chance in his band. The sheer amount of tension between student and instructor throughout this movie is hardcore at times, but Fletcher is ultimately trying to maximize Andrew's potential as a musician by any means necessary (He makes this philosophy clear several times throughout the film.) This movie also manages to capture the intricate details of advanced music theory, as well as depicting the amount of hours and effort it takes to become an exceptional musician.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

As Over-rated As They Come,"Yes, the acting by JK Simmons was very good, and yes the storyline was compelling regarding greatness, and how greatness is found and nurtured, or in this case abused.The idea is our society is too friendly and politically correct to be able to develop great musicians. The interesting concept of the film is that the mentor is as important as the mentee, which of course we already knew, but the idea was that the mentor must be willing to push the mentee in ways or manners the mentee would not do otherwise. Very interesting concept that could yield hours of interesting debate over a bottle of wine and a cigar.However, the movie does not behave like an Indy film, but like a Hollywood picture. There is far too much drama. The primary character (Andrew Nieman) bleeds no less than three times during the movie on his trap set! Seriously, bleeding! He gets in a car accident, rolls his car over, and runs to the recital he was late for while bleeding and unable to control his limbs from the trauma.Then there's the complete lack of character development of ANY of the characters in the movie. Why is Andrew Nieman so obsessed with music that he breaks-up with his girlfriend because he thinks she will eventually get in the way? JK Simmons is good, but sorry, I don't know why he behaves the way he does, nor would his style ever be effective, or accepted at any college, private or public.The idea that Charlie Parker became great because he had a symbol thrown at him is extremely trite and irrelevant to greatness. Again, this is not an accurate representation of the truth. The reason we don't have any modern Charlie Parker's is because our society doesn't care about Jazz music any longer, in fact it's the butt of many jokes. Jazz was played everywhere in Parker's day. You could buy a saxophone at JC Penny's for Pete's sake. Today, you can barely buy a saxophone at a music store. The fact of the matter is that people become great in areas that the people care about; football, basketball, baseball, and in the arts symphony orchestra. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the greatest cello players of all time. So did he become great because he had some dude yelling profanities in his ear? NO! How about 50,000 hrs of practice, and prospect of getting rich and being adored.So much hype and very little substance behind it I'm afraid, unless of course your used to watching Marvel superhero movies, so you've become abundantly inept at recognizing a good film unless it slapped you in the face. Which of course, JK Simmons does slap Peter Parker, I mean Andrew Nieman :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
You could feel the wind of that chair being thrown,"This movie to me is about how much a person can aspire to succeed as a musician, and the story brought to the screen a protagonist that through sweat and blood found way to achieve his dream. You get tired, hyped and even upset with Andrew, while on the other hand, Terence Fletcher is there being Neiman's executioner and you can't decide if you hate or love his passion and will to drive the drummer to success, All of this thanks to the performance of both Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons.You are absolutely lying if you say this movie didn't sparkled a fire inside of you to pick a pair of drumsticks, play an instrument or even learn about something that inspires you.

"Intense movie about music, incredible editing and well paced story.","""Whiplash"" is first of all a movie about what you are willing to sacrifice in order to be the next big musical sensation. Professor Fletcher is a music director in one of the best conservatories of the USA and he always pushes his students beyond their limits, because he is seeking for the next big talent and he sees a lot of potential in Andrew. This young 19 years old guy squeezes himself to the point where becoming the most talented drummer becomes his only obsession. He will throw away everything else. The film is very intense and scenes that could be dull and boring are so interesting thanks to the incredible fast-paced editing, with quick cuts and camera movements. The music is always synchronized with the images, creating an amazing harmony. The dialogues are so intense: Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons were in perfect symbiosis and they pulled out an incredible performance. There is such a harsh and bitter development regarding the student-teacher relationship. The audience can hardly catch a breath and I think that in this case it is a positive element, because it highlights the intensity of the musical performances and all the hardship that the musicians need to endure during classes. However, at times the character of Fletcher was too much, I would prefer that in some sequences he was toned down just a bit. As a music lover I genuinely appreciated this Damien Chazelle work. He is clearly very talented when it comes to movies that have to do with music: ""La La Land"" is one of my favorite musicals of all time. The sound design is well done and this production deserves every single prize that it won. For me this is an 8 stars out of 10, and I definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Powerful performances with intense drama,"Having heard of the strong praise about Whiplash since around its release in 2014 but not having being overly intrigued by the picture or having much of an interest overall, now watching for the first time. Can see as to why this film is as praise and held to such high standards.From the great performances by both leads Miles Teller and JK Simmons, to the overall plot and script, to the music, to the directing and the way it's scenes were shot, to the build up and tone, Whiplash is a one of a kind film. This film has a relatively short run time (littler over 1 hr 40 mins) as it does not drag and every minute is quite engaging.This film exceeded expectations and am somewhat disappointed as it took this long to finally getting around to watch it. Highly recommend, even if you are not a fan of jazz music, Whiplash is much more than music- as it is about a young mans dream of becoming great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A Riveting Journey Through Music and Emotion,"Nine years after its release, I finally got around to seeing ""Whiplash."" Nearly a decade later, it remains a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of musical understanding, captivating even those who don't consider themselves connoisseurs of music. This film, featuring the intense journey of Andrew Nieman (Miles Teller) and his tumultuous relationship with the formidable Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), is a whirlwind of emotion, skillfully blending excitement, tension, and rage.The brilliance of ""Whiplash"" lies in its ability to immerse its audience completely, regardless of their musical background. As a viewer not deeply rooted in music, I found myself enthralled and engrossed, as if I were alongside Nieman, feeling every beat and enduring every challenge. The movie's pace and intensity had me watching in a stiff, tense state, mirroring the emotional rollercoaster experienced by Teller's character.What makes ""Whiplash"" truly stand out is its complex character dynamics, particularly the captivating presence of Fletcher. J. K. Simmons delivers a performance that is both enraging and enthralling, drawing viewers into a love-hate relationship with his character. His portrayal adds depth to the film, making the audience yearn for more of his compelling presence.Despite being a non-music aficionado, I found the film's portrayal of ambition, passion, and the pursuit of excellence universally relatable and deeply moving. The film's conclusion left me wishing for an extended cut, a testament to its captivating nature. I would have gladly indulged in a five-hour version of this intense, musical journey.In conclusion, ""Whiplash"" is a remarkable film that resonates with viewers of all musical backgrounds. Its exceptional storytelling, coupled with powerful performances, creates an unforgettable experience. For its ability to engage, provoke, and inspire, I give it a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
OK Social Drama - Whiplash,"So, you wanna be the best in the world at what you do? You have to go the extra mile and work like a dog until you become the master of your domain. (apologies to Seinfeld). Miles Teller is a young drummer who wants to be the next Gene Krupa or RIngo Starr. Good luck with that idea. J. K Simmons tells him, no problem; all you have to do is sacrifice yourself on the altar of unrelenting practice, practice, practice. Play until you bleed, baby. And that is all there is to it; much easier said than done, however. We see the trials and self-doubts of the young Andrew, and the fierce determination of Terrence Fletcher, as he tries to make a star out of Andrew, despite having been a never-was himself. Terrance lives out his fantasies by torturing Andrew, but in a constructive way. Entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
The most intense movie experience,"It had been far too long since I last saw this film. Whiplash was what I considered to be my favourite movie of all time for a long time. However, recently I have been watching a lot of films, and my taste has somewhat changed. As such, I wasn't sure if this movie would still be at the top of my list.Having finished this movie nearly out of breath, I think that it is safe to say that Whiplash retains its position as my favourite movie of all time. I have always liked movies with high tension and intensity, and quite frankly, I don't think that there is another movie that captures those two feelings so well. This film is easily the most intense movie experience that I have ever had. The intensity of the characters keeps you engaged and on edge the whole time. The intensity of practising and performing makes you out of breath even though you are only watching. And the intensity of trying to achieve perfection makes you wonder how far you'd be willing to go yourself.In many ways, one of the most pivotal moments in the movie is the jazz cafe scene. It allows you to breathe for a moment, but, even more importantly, it allows the movie to take a deep breath before unleashing a finale that makes the rest of the movie feel cute. That moment in the cafe is crucial, as it allows you to reflect on what you have seen and to pause for a moment. That final scene becomes as impactful as it is because you have been allowed to understand the complexity of the two main characters. The cafe scene could be the best in the film if it weren't for the fact there are so many other even more impactful scenes.Although I rarely discuss things like performances, I think that with this one it's mandatory. I am, of course, talking about the performance of J. K. Simmons. If this movie isn't intense enough on its own, leave it to Simmons to give an unbelievable performance and turn it up a notch. A performance that is scary and intense, but also emotional and sad. The moments where his character lets his guard down, are just as good as the moments where he yells some of the most creative insults that I have ever heard at the top of his lungs.Ultimately, the brilliance of this movie comes down to the fact that I have never seen another film that captures tension and intensity as well as this one. I have never seen another film that makes me feel the way that this one does. And when you find a film like that, it's not surprising that it becomes your favourite one. And for me, that film is Whiplash.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Powerful--and thin, and the ""jazz"" is handcuffed ""band"" music","Whiplash (2014)Wow, the best of this is intense and disturbing and invigorating. It's about never never never cutting corners. It's about pushing and being your best until you break, and then keeping going. Who can't get revved up about that?The scene is a mythical music school, something like Julliard and Berkeley combined— intense and serious, with an element of jazz built in. And the competition, expected as it is, pushed students beyond their comfort zone to absurd and inspiring degrees. The scenes where the music leader (teacher and bandleader played by J.K. Simmons) goes apeshit over the bumbling of his students are quite shocking. I'm an art teacher, and I tried it out one day, even warning the student I was going to do it and showing the preview to the movie first, and it went very badly.The student in the movie who anchors the plot is the unknown Miles Teller, who is just fine in the role. He pushes and struggles and suffers—and eventually comes through, though with some serious convolutions.So, on the surface, this will thrill and wow most viewers. And I liked all of this a lot. But the plot is mostly just what I've described. There are two additions to it, one dismissible (the love life of the student) an the other the one socially probing aspect, which you'll have to wait to see. Excellent and needed.But not enough. If you love jazz, or have played jazz (I've done both in my limited way), you might balk at the music here. Yes. Surprise! Because this is all written out band music with jazz inflections. Until the last scene, which is critical, there is no improvisational jazz at all—none! In fact, the music struck me so cold I almost stopped watching. I hope you won't have the same problem, but it's there.I also found the overall plot so narrow I couldn't quite get past its linearity. Even the psychology of the two leads is mostly left to rants and bleeding fingers and disgust. It's oddly superficial, even if it strikes you at first as completely about psychological depth.Still, it's remarkable in its own way, and I totally recommend seeing it. The shocks will be wonderfully shocking, and the idea of doing your best, which is something most of us shamefully avoid, is a great reminder.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
100 minutes of torture,"There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness.

Quite perfect,""" There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.""Without a doubt, Whiplash is one of the best films of the last decade. It not only manages to capture a wide range of audience, but also to keep them glued to the screen for about an hour and a half. From the first few seconds of the film, you can actually already feel part of the story. Those seconds with the full black screen and the sound of the drums in the backcround are truly unique and I found them to be mesmerizing. Chazelle couldn't have found a better opening sequence, I believe.
This is not really a story about success, but a story about a young man trying to pursue his dreams while facing tons of obstacles and I think that each and every single one of us could easily identify in this story, as we all try to reach our goals one way or another.
Miles Teller portrays the young drummer Andrew Neiman, who is 19 years old and who just started to study at one of the top universities in the country. Teller is amazing in this film, as he successfully communicated the many emotions his character had to go through in this picture. You could actually feel the pain and the exhaustion while he was playing the drums. Then, there is absolutely no one else who could have portrayed Fletcher better than the great J.K Simmons. He took everything to the next level. Every single scene he was in was truly flawless and so magnificent. Everything about him in this particular film was nothing but perfect, from his voice, style and language to his way of approaching things. He absolutely mastered this role and this is why it is one of the best supprting performances I've ever seen and I dare to say that it might be one of the best supporting performance there ever was.
Damien Chazelle has proved once more that he is not only gifted and talented, but also very skilled. Each scene in this picture was so well directed and shot. He put so much passion in this film(as he does with everything) that it made the audience fall in love with Whiplash. His perspective of seeing things and storytelling is simply exquisite.
The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful and it made everything so much better. The colors told the story on their own and they played a big part in this film. Then, the score was nothing but perfect. It was ""the right tempo"". The film would have been so different without this score and this makes me realize how big of an impact the soundtrack had on me.
I highly recommend this film, as it is one of the greatest pictures of the last century. It is filled with amazing performances, unique direction and storytelling and it will make you feel so many emotions at once. You will feel exhausted, overwhelmed, excited, depressed, pleased at the end of the picture and this is one of the reasons this film is so great. It takes you through everything you wanna feel while watching a film. It will satisfy all your needs as a cinephile and not only. You don't have to ""know"" or ""understand"" music/jazz to be a fan of it. That's why this is a film for everybody, so go and watch it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
An uncomcomfortable but brilliant exploration of ambition,"Whiplash (2014): Unforgiveably, it has taken me a good few years to get around to watching this modern classic but just in case there are any film fans who have not yet done so, do make sure you check this one out. The film is an intense exploration of drive and ambition: it juxtaposes the comfort of mediocrity with the insanity and suffering which comes with the attempt to achieve the extraordinary. Miles Teller brilliantly plays the impressionable ingenue, who is willing to do anything to succeed as a musician. JK Simmons is possibly even more brilliant in the showier role of the mentor that will test his pupil to the absolute limit. Clearly inspired by iconic films such as Powell and Pressburger's ""The Red Shoes"" and Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", the director, Damien Chazelle, has Simmons excude menace and testosterone as he attempts to crush and remold his musical recruits (and his band literally are recruited, watch the film, you'll see what I mean). The script is witty and caustic and the film's depictions of extreme devotion to craft will make you wince and squirm but if you have the stomach to keep watching, you will witness a brilliant character study in which the power struggle between mentor and mentee becomes unexpectedly much less than one-sided. The film's brilliance, aside from some dazzling close-up camera-work and brilliant acting, is that it does not moralise or take sides, it shows us something profound, something rare, something utterly compelling: two human beings' capacity for self-sacrifice and discipline in the pursuit of an ideal. And just when you think its characters can't go any further, they reveal that they're only just getting started.Rating: 10/10, a truly mesmerising cinematic treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Deserving of its oscars and more!,"I wish I watched Whiplash sooner. The acting, especially by J.K.Simmons, is incredible and really brings the movie together. The camerawork is great, this is what movies should look and feel like, the unique angles and lighting look attractive and make the movie more enjoyable without even noticing. The writing is good, not great but is suitable for this movie, everything slots perfectly into place and flows very nicely with plenty of twists. My only negative about this is the ending, it wasn't a bad ending at all I just wish I got to see more of it, I wanted to see what happened...but it does make it different from other movies that would continue and feel very cliché. 9/10 great movie, you don't even have to like jazz music to enjoy this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

I have never loathed someone the way I loathed Fletcher; never been so acutely aware of the transformation of a character like I was with Andrew. They were just outstanding.The music, the emotion, the aesthetic of Whiplash were all phenomenal. I only wish the ending had been 5 minutes longer to hear a final conversation between Fletcher and Andrew. I can appreciate the ending being up to interpretation, but after all that went on, I needed some more closure, one way or another.Can't believe I've never seen this movie until now, but so glad I finally have!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
the film's title sums it up perfectly,"Andrew Neiman is an ambitious drummer who doesn't just want to be great, but to be one of ""the greats.""

This intense, exhilarating drama from director Damien Chazelle pulls you in right from the start and never lets up with vigorous acting as well as top-grade musical numbers on its way to a smashing climax. Teller is compelling as the youthful student pushed to his very limits, meanwhile Simmons (who looks like he'd be right at home in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket) gives a brutal and uncompromising performance as his relentless ""mentor."" This is a powerful and provocative film about dedication, ambition, and obsession. ***½",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Whiplash Just Might Be One Of The Greats,"This film does not drag nor rush, it was perfectly in line with the tempo and nearly every aspect of the film was flawless. I'm going to start off praising the electrifying performances because I have never experienced that much tension and fear through the use of dialogue. J.K Simmons was fantastic, taking on a psychotic temper-mental music instructor who comes off beyond intimidating and all the more blood- curdling. Miles Teller delivers a surprising career flipping performance and handles the role perfectly, as he is driven to succeed and dedicated to excel at his admission, the intensity put into his character is overwhelming. The film takes many unexpected twists and turns, and overall comes off a very powerful and intriguing experience, all thanks to the unique style of direction and striking cinematography. The film offers moving characters and hidden life values throughout, despite its fairly basic plot you will be surprised with what this film is capable of.

It's easily one of the best 2014 movies so far, and without a doubt an Oscar nomination is well deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Are you people nuts?,"Seems almost everyone likes this movie for some reason. My review will be short and sweet: This is the dumbest premise for a movie I've ever witnessed.

It's one thing to be a nasty music teacher, but quite another to be R. Lee Ermey as Gunny Sgt. Hartman. Every kid I know today would have pounced on Fletcher and beat him to a pulp if he acted this way towards them. I keep waiting for Andrew to turn into Pvt.

"Explosive, inescapably riveting, a phenomenal achievement","If I'm being honest I've been nervous about watching this as much as I have been looking forward to it. The theatrical trailer was incredibly sharp and biting, but it would hardly be the only time a trailer has impressed me so much only for the full film to be nowhere as good itself ('Troy,' 'Age of Ultron'). Gladly, such trepidation is very quickly laid to rest, as Damien Chazelle's picture is filled from top to bottom with those same acrid flavors. As reliable a presence as J. K. Simmons is for any production, his performance as monstrous Fletcher is absolutely ferocious, the type of tour de force exhibition that will be remembered for a long time to come. Any glimpse of humanity he shows us in that capacity is a fleeting shade next to the unremitting viciousness, and Simmons becomes someone completely separate from himself for these 100 minutes. To my disbelief, Miles Teller nearly matches that explosive fierceness as blindly ambitious Andrew, and between these two stars 'Whiplash' is filled with such excruciating dark energy as to manifest tension and suspense tantamount to an outright thriller. When the picture does eventually pause for a breath, it's still hard to come down from the earlier peak, and it's only a pause. Make no mistake, this is a total beast, and it is absolutely worth all the anticipation.Chazelle's screenplay is plum ripe with two titanic, powerful characters that feed off of and into each other, extremely piercing dialogue and scene writing, and somehow between it all, an unexpectedly dynamic narrative when all is said and done. His direction is astoundingly tight, pushing the feature ever forward, and leaving not the slightest room for laxity - yet much like the central character, that drive only serves to focus the contributions of cast and crew alike, shaping the whole with brilliant laser precision. Sharone Meir's cinematographer feels altogether alive, like a real set of eyes on the set, and Tom Cross' editing is truly impeccable, splicing the movie together with inhuman acuity; the first point of comparison to come to mind for me is Jay Rabinowitz's mind-blowing work on 2000's 'Requiem for a dream.' This is to say nothing of the incredible music that flows through the runtime, treating our ears to an amazingly rich array of tunes at the same time that we're wowed again and again by everything else before us. To that point, I think it rather goes without saying but all the drumming herein is difficult to even describe. At its best a drum kit is more than just a source of functional rhythm, but can become a lead instrument all its own, and I'm unsure if there's ever been a showcase on film or TV the way 'Whiplash' is.Unless one already has insider knowledge, music can be very difficult to describe; either you get it, or you don't. A movie about music is much the same. It would be easy to wax poetic about the tremendous performances of Simmons and Teller, the vibrant dynamics between them and their characters, the exquisite writing and direction, the magnificent editing, and so on and so forth. To truly convey what all this means, and impart understanding, is another matter. 'Whiplash' is a feature that everyone needs to see for themselves, and I do mean ""need."" It doesn't matter if you're a musician, an audiophile, an especial fan of someone involved, or just an avid lover of cinema generally. This is a stark, breath-taking portrait of ambition, perfectionism, and towering personalities that is completely entrancing, from which it's impossible to divert our attention. As it turns out, that theatrical trailer which so quickly caught traction and turned heads is, after all, but a mere appetizer for what the film in full represents. There's no getting around what an awesomely riveting, satisfying viewing experience this is, ultimately leaving one with a smile on our face like relatively few pictures can really achieve. This earns more than a recommendation, it becomes a demand: 'Whiplash' deserves your viewership, and it's worth seeking out however you must do so. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

All that jazz,"For all of its widespread critical acclaim and multiple award nominations and wins, I found Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' to be a rather thin and clichéd regurgitation of the tired ""Driven artist, intense student/mentor relationship"" trope with absolutely nothing fresh to say or offer up.I believe its reputation is primarily built upon the strong performances of its two leads, Miles Teller and J.K.

Would need to like Jazz,"If you don't like Jazz, then this is not for you. As there is loads of Jazz in this and I am not a fan.J.K.

I am not sure if people could be this obsessive over Jazz.Main plus in the film (if you don't like Jazz) is the performance of the two leads.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Absolutely Fantastic,Didn't expect much from this movie so I was very pleasantly surprised! Just absolutely fantastic watching Miles Teller go on his journey of obsession with his craft. Of course JK Simmons is excellent and it's truly obvious why he received the Oscar for this performance. I have watched this movie over and over and it really is inspiring and unexpectedly funny. The determination and obsession in this film are just so good. The writer and director is also fantastic. What a great mind and how grateful I am that he shared this art with the world.

"""Good job""","If ever a movie needed to come with trigger warnings, it would be this one. Warning: for artists who have gone to schools or conservatories for artistic training, this film contains depictions of abusive behavior by a sadistic teacher who believes he's helping students by torturing them until they break, and who won't apologize for it.""Whiplash"" is unrelenting and deeply upsetting in its depiction of extreme psychological, emotional, and physical abuse inflicted on the student (Miles Teller) by the teacher (JK Simmons). There's something frighteningly true about it, even when its excessiveness reaches a point of incredulity. (There's no way this guy keeps his job with the stunts he pulls, even by 2014 standards.)Teller plays Andrew, a musician at the fictional NYC conservatory which he's not shy about telling people is the best in the country. His one aim in life is to become ""one of the greats."" Simmons plays Fletcher, a sadistic jazz-band conductor who will test Andrew's resolve to the extreme.Simmons is terrifying in his Oscar-winning performance, playing a character you either hate to love or love to hate; the nature of his emotional abuse is so convincing that even the viewer isn't always sure which is which. Teller goes toe to toe with Simmons in a breakout performance of his own. Predictably, Andrew's obsessive perfectionism comes at a great cost to himself and those around him as he begins to emulate the warped values of his abuser.The film definitely has the impact its title suggests.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Chazelle brings his own rhythm and timing to this one,"Damien Chazelle's directorial debut about a young, talented jazz drummer (Miles Teller) at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory in New York City and his clashes with the school's star conductor and talent scout Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) is a story of the axis between authoritarian rule and fear culture on the one hand and great talent and musical prowess on the other. Still, the film's greatest merit isn't as an homage to music, but rather as a visual masterpiece and an uncompromising delve into the psychological aspects of this story. Chazelle brings his own rhythm and timing to this one, freely ignoring Terence Fletcher's ""time"" at his peril.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Whiplash, 10 years later","There are just few films as inspiring as Damien Chazelle's incredible Whiplash. It is, I truly believe, a unique blend of sacrifices in one's life and pursuit towards greatness. Directed in 2014, Whiplash is a dramatic story combining hope, anger and outburst of deeply-withheld emotions that create unforgettable viewing experience.The evens unfold in New York's prestigious Shaffer Conservatory - a dream school for all those young and aspiring musicians who wish to achieve greatness in their musical careers. When Milles Teller starring as Andrew, one of such students, practices his drum skills, he is observed by Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) - a firm instructor who leads his own jazz band. Andrew knows that the instructor is on a hunt, seeking musicians with enormous potential. Considering ""good job"" as two English words that should never be uttered, Fletcher is a quite controversial character to say the least. Andrew and Fletcher really quickly develop a surprisingly toxic relationship which leads to many personal tragedies.I was most impressed by the screenplay and editing both by Chazelle. Watching and listening to Whiplash for the first time is truly amazing. No other musical film in my life has ever made such a huge impression on me, combining the dynamicity of jazz and human emotions. There are several scene which I find particularly well-crafted and recommend everyone to see.In conclusion, till now, Whiplash remains Chazelle's opum magnum. No other film he has produced so far was such a perfect combination of two natural and yet tameless forces - music and ambition. Even love, which appears in the film for a brief moment, does not play such a key roles as those two crucial elements.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

That ending!!!!!,"Ten years later I am still surprised this wasn't a bigger box office success. There's a couple of other things in this film that surprised me. I've seen Miles Teller in a few things and he's never really appealed to me, but he is excellent here despite being outshone by his co-star, J. K. Simmons. Teller's role really is sort of gigantic between his constant presence in the film and his skills as a drummer. The other thing that surprised me is that I don't recall this much suspense and tension in a film that is not an action, sci-fi or horror film and that is a credit, of course, to its director, Damien Chazelle, who so deserved an Oscar nomination for this. Simmons has been around for a very long time and never has he had a role like this. He is like a rabid pit bull much of the time and he deserved all the awards he received. This is pretty fantastic much of the time and I really cannot find any real flaws in this fascinating tale of one seeking perfection and the other demanding it in this wild sorta love/hate relationship.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"Big Expectations, Rather A Moderate Impression","I had been waiting for this movie for long time, as I am a drummer of sorts myself, I like music, I like drumming films, and this one seemed to be a great achievement. After all, there are all those raving reviews and blazing cheers made to this spectacular piece of cinematography. Well, yes, I have watched it, and what I can say? It is very over-rated. Yes, both Simmons and Teller seem to give very impressive performances, and yes, Teller is A Good drummer with neat stroke, precise beat, gentle swing and delicate accents. But then, he does not convince as an actor. The love story is the biggest disappointment and the greatest weakness of the film. It simply passes by. leaving me cold and unaffected. Was that dubious drumming achievement worth losing a beautiful girl? It was not. Simmons is surely the crowning top of the production, but then, he is too sadistic, too dry, too pedantic or a jazz aficionado, he seems more like a drill sergeant than a genial conductor. The final solo? To long and too drawn out for a satisfying coda. Kinda cool, but tiresome and yup, dragging. It is a film for a single watch and quick oblivion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Stretched the bounds of believability,"It is often taught that a screenwriter can do anything in the first five minutes of the script and the audience will go with it. Unfortunately, the same does not hold for the first 30 minutes of the film. This film really stretched the believability quotient for me. It was over-the-top absurd at times and I didn't ""buy"" much of the action. The music school was preposterous, people simply wouldn't let this behavior fly in this century. Miles Teller was quite good as the student, but I felt JK Simmons was miscast. Not because he is not a good actor, but because his TV persona is so memorable and opposite, that I just couldn't believe him in this role, unfortunately. The role was just ridiculous at times, so it's not just the actor. I'm happy to say that the film does get better in the second half, but not enough that I would recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Fails to understand what it means to be a musician,"Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music.The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished, elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice. Which it sometimes does.. but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.People become musicians out of LOVE for the art. They aren't pushed to ""achieve greatness"" by sadistic asshole teachers. Also, Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz (and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity, colour, contrast & emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught and never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt). Many can't even read music.This (American) movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports.

The Consequence of Ambition,"Chazelle delicately directs the film to have that sense of crisp and sound – one that's quite hard to find nowadays. He magically transforms violent and abusive scenes into something extremely watchable without dismissing pity. There is never a camera angle that is out of place, no wasted detail in its frames. This is one film that can teach LES MISERABLES (2012) Director, Tom Hooper, how to effectively use extreme close ups, without having to waste pure emotions and sheer talent.WHIPLASH presents a decent, yet violent argument that exalts the student and polarizes the discipline. This is a story where the teacher simply becomes the tool to the artist's journey to becoming what he really is. Or may be not. At some point, the teacher becomes a separate entity in the learning experience. At some point, the teacher has ambitions of his own, far detached from what his own learners think and dream. At some point, the teacher finds his learners as his competitors in the race to greatness.It's an absurd tragedy, though still arguably triumphant on its own.What WHIPLASH argues is that beyond learning lies a greater and more painful path to ambition, and to get there, one does not need anyone but himself. It is a story that challenges the collaborative norm in education. It is an anti-social thesis on refinement and discipline, yet it is still something worth looking into. It does not give you that moral lesson that you are waiting for. Amidst the loud, energetic sounds of Andrew's sweaty, bloody, jazz drum set, it whispers to you that the road to glory is made of brimstones from hell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

A stunning character study that acts as a white knuckle thriller,"Who knew jazz and drumming could be so ripe for heart stopping narrative drive? Culminating in one of the more tension riddled finales of recent memories and featuring some of the most brutal ego tearing scripting this side of Full Metal Jacket, up and coming filmmaker Damian Chazelle's searing drama is against all odds, a drama cume thriller of the highest order.Featuring some of last years most outstounding performances from both the ever growing Miles Teller and the always good yet never before so commanding J.K Simmons, Whiplash will have you constantly on the edge of your seat, frequently forgetting to breathe and riveted every step of it's running time due to an all round package that has rightfully become a player and often winner in this awards season. It's stunning to consider this is one of Chazelle's first features and for a man perhaps best known for scripting the Elijah Wood thriller Grand Piano, this is a sure fire heralding in of a major new filmmaking talent. Chazelle handles proceedings like a true professional, the editing, the pacing, the direction of actors and the award calibre scripting is all of he highest order and it's evident throughout that Chazelle is a naturally gifted filmmaker. Whiplash truly is an exciting mix of dramatic tension and thrilling interplay between budding musician Andrew and egotistical conductor Terrence Fletcher that sees Chazelle draw out a pair of rivals that will live long in the lore of cinema history.Since his arrival on the film scene in films such as Rabbit Hole and more recently The Spectacular Now, Miles Teller has threatened to break out at any moment and if The Spectacular Now was not proof enough, there is little remaining doubt after this effort that Teller is one of the finest examples of young talent in the industry today. Teller's character of Andrew is a multilayered one and one that doesn't necessarily win over our affections completely. His a complicated young boy, driven to the point of arrogance and not overly warm, yet his a figure we want to see succeed, if not only to spite the evil incarnate that is J.K Simmons's Fletcher.A recognisable face over many years of supporting work in Hollywood, it's a true joy to see Simmons unleash in a stunning portrayal of a man driven to drive others to the point of no return. Whether spouting out some of the most vile abuse possible or talking calmly to potential future musicians that he can use in his band, Terrence Fletcher is a force to be reckoned with, a tornado of aggression and pent up rage. It's one of 2014's stand out performances and a role that saw Simmons collect a thoroughly deserved Oscar at the Academy Awards, it's a win that is wholeheartedly earned and deserved.While Whiplash has a few narrative missteps and a handful of questionable scenarios (particularly one scene involving a car accident) it's not enough to sully a film that you suspect will be living a long life in years to come, being studied by start out filmmakers, budding actors and lovers of all things good cinema. Just don't go showing anyone considering a potential sojourn in a music school, as Terrence Fletcher may just be enough to scare them away for good.4 and a half bloodied drum kits out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Bursting with energy,"At first sight, Whiplash seemed to me as another talent movie, which features the same clichés, no matter it's about music, dancing or sports. But the great reviews made me really curious about it, and I can honestly say, that it's nothing like your usual film about music.Damien Chazelle's work, like every beginner director's is full of raw power and energy. Every moment of Whiplash has so much dynamics and tension. You wouldn't expect surprising twists from these kind of movies, but Whiplash has the quality to show you something unexpected in every minute. The director incorporates a few small, but clever twist in the narrative, and these aren't twists for the twists' sake. Chazelle is unlike any other young director: his work is unbelievably calculated, there's not a single unnecessary frame in this picture, and he can always capture the essence of the moment or the actors' performances.And that's a good thing, because Whiplash relies hugely on those actors. Simmons' presence rules every scene he's in, he has clever lines, but the actor is doing most of the work. Miles Teller is a bit shadowed by him, but the young actor also does a great job, and the chemistry between the two of them is the absolute highlight of this movie. And with that, Chazelle can achieve that the songs are not just some promotional material, but important storytelling devices in the conflict of the main characters. The director is also great at capturing emotions through these song.Which takes us to my only problem with Whiplash: the scenes of the rehearsals or the musical performances are so intense and strong, that they make every other scene disappoint you a little. That's exactly the case with the storyline of the love interest or the middle part of the runtime.Whiplash is not the film of great words, act or emotional effects. But I think, nobody's going to care about that, because Chazelle's perfectionist storytelling is going to compensate everybody for that. It's not an flaming improvisation, it's not a shitty, but catchy pop song, but it's an artistic symphony. It may not be a classic, but it's brilliant cinema.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"Be Best, If You Dare","This is review number 1,819 for this film, so what are the chances that it will even be read? At any rate, whether I have the honor of an audience or not, I need to express my thoughts about this film, so here they are.As I watched this film, I experienced a variety of intense feelings including anxiety, nervousness, and fear, just to name a few. I even felt Andrew Niemann's excruciating pain when he bled all over his drum set and dipped his wounded hand in a large container of ice. If director-writer Damien Chazelle's intention was for me to share in Andrew's physical and emotional agony, he more than succeeded.Miles Teller and J. K. Skinner were extraordinary as the leads, and Skinner certainly earned his Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Overall, the entire cast was excellent, including actual musicians in the band, which added to the film's authenticity.I was disappointed to read some of the negative reviews written by musicians, especially drummers, who believe that the film unrealistically portrayed their art, but I certainly respect their views and take them very seriously. Fletcher did seem to be more of a brutal Army sergeant or a ferocious football coach than a demanding music director.I will admit that of all of the musical genres, I understand jazz the least. I accept full responsibility for this failure. As annoying as it is to many in the music world, I know what I like, but I can't always explain why I like it. I just do.At the risk of sounding very self-centered, what the film forced me to do at this very advanced stage of my life was to acknowledge the uncomfortable reality that no one has ever invested the intense energy and commitment that Terrence Fletcher devoted to his students once he acknowledged their exceptional talent. Beyond this, I have never exerted the drive of Andrew Niemann, who strongly believed in his ability to succeed as a star jazz drummer. In order to excel at anything in this life, you have to have the talent in the first place and the motivation to develop it to its fullest potential. Without the fundamental ability, there is nothing to advance.It should not have surprised me that Chazelle was raised and educated in the fiercely academic community of Princeton, New Jersey, a town that I once called home for three decades. Andrew's father taught at ""Pennington High School"". That's as close to Chazelle's alma mater of Princeton High School as one can get. The very uncomfortable scene in the father's dining room, at least to me, was quintessential Princeton, where personal achievement defined one's fundamental existence. Note how everyone at the table was determined to prove their worth as human beings by the milestones of their achievements rather than, say, the content of their character. Don't stop to smell the roses. Just keep pushing if you want to be valued as a member of the community in good standing.But we've got to stop and smell the roses. I sure hope that Andrew Niemann understands this before it's too late.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Not My Tempo,"I will admit to not being a music expert. I am a teacher, and I have taught music classes. So, I do know that if I did a fraction of the things JK Simmons does in this film, I would be instantly fired.One of the main themes of the story is the idea that an artist should be challenged in order to excel from good to great. If an artist cannot rise to that challenge, then they never truly had the potential for greatness.A movie is not measured on whether or not you agree with the theme of the movie, it is in how they execute and communicate that theme through their characters and story.JK Simmons absolutely deserved his 2014 Best Supporting Actor win. The movie does not waste any time, it is a tight 106 minutes. Paul Reiser also does a great job; this movie is low-key, an excellent Fathers' Day movie. I also liked the scene where the accomplishments of academia, sports and music are compared. There are also some very charming date scenes in the movie. It was amusing how Andrew knows how these types of movies go, and just fast forwards through the ""drama"" of it all.The reason why I don't love this movie as much as most is due to the unlikability of the characters. I don't have to like the characters, but it would be nice to root for their success.I apologize to the musicians out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Jonah Jamison from spider man but after watching this movie I don't think that this man can be known as anything but Fletcher.

The drive to finding perfection I'd expressing your feelings in your own music and expressing it with others, (slight spoiler ahead) and I think it's the ending shows that magnificently.

One of the Best of 2014,"Whiplash (2014)**** (out of 4)Hard-hitting drama plays out much like a thriller as Andrew (Miles Teller) dreams of becoming a great drummer no matter what the cost is. He ends up attending the best music school in the country and it doesn't take long before he's hand picked by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the best teacher there who will stop at nothing to get the best out of his students.WHIPLASH is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and is leaving a major mark on those who see it. I will admit that I hadn't really heard too much about the film but it seems with each passing day there was someone new singing it's praises. Well, having now seen the movie I'm going to join the crowd and tell everyone how wonderful it actually is. I think one of the hardest things to do is take a familiar genre (teacher- student relationship) and trying to bring new life to it. Director-writer Damlen Chazelle manages to do just that because we've seen this type of film several times before but it's done in such a way here that you can't help but feel you're watching something fresh and original.I think one of the biggest reasons it feels fresh is due to the actual subject of a drummer. You'd expect to see something about singers or guitar players but to set this in the world of a drummer and Jazz music was something that works so well because of the wild, frantic style of the jazz score works perfectly well with the work and abuse that the main character forces on himself. The scenes of Andrew working his hands to blood are just so flawlessly edited with the score that you can't help but feel every drop of blood that drips from his hands. Another major plus is the actual editing, which is incredibly fast-pace but falls well short of that MTV-style that has become so worn out the past two decades.Of course, the film's highlight is without question the performance of Simmons who is simply wonderful. Again, we've seen angry people countless times before and we've seen caring teachers countless times before. What's so memorable about the performance here is how quickly Simmons is able to change emotions from caring to pure rage in the matter of seconds. Getting the eyes to tell you what you need to know from a scene is extremely hard but just watch Simmons' eyes throughout the picture.The rage he shows isn't just mindless screaming and cussing because you can still see a certain emotion and caring in his eyes. Teller is also excellent in the role and manages to stand his own against Simmons. Both Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also very good in their supporting parts.What also makes WHIPLASH so memorable is the fact that it really plays out like a thriller. I'm not going to ruin anything that happens but we can see the main character falling apart due to the abuse from the teacher and we know something is eventually going to happen to cause havoc. The film plays this suspense out as if you're watching a thriller and it really pays off in the final twenty-minutes as there are a couple excellent twists. The film certainly has everything you want from a movie and it's clearly one of the best of 2014.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Sadistic movie leaves confused feelings afterwards,"I knew from the trailer that the movie wouldn't be a nice movie leaving you with some happiness afterwards. However, I've seen most other movies that has come out lately so I had nothing else to watch and gave it a chance. I very rarely write reviews and usually just rate the movie, however this movie is so sadistic that it needs to be reviewed for other peoples safety.First of all, I used to be a drummer myself. The quality of the drumming and choice of music is fantastic. The actors are doing great except that the attention was towards the two main characters the whole movie. This gave the feeling that all the other characters were just put there to help show the personality of the two main characters. The drummer is an insecure, self centered teenager seeking for glory and the mentor is an sadistic, bullying psychopathic conductor justifying his methods with that they give result. The student struggles getting recognized by the conductor but somehow finds his glory and happy ending. I worry about the students future in this fictional world. He will probably kill himself in a couple of years as an another student of this conductor did.This movie didn't leave me either happy, relieved, inspired or anything similar. If you wish to not feel good afterwards, its an excellent movie for you. I worry people think bullying people into success is justified if it gives results since people made such positive reviews. It saddens me people like and supports movies which glorify bullying. I hope this review gives another perspective to the movie since most reviews were very positive.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Electrifying,"Those who like jazz will love this movie for its excellent musical moments. But that is not all since it has an image rythm and an intense story that keeps you.rrooted to it till the end.. A 19 year young man wants to to be not only a good drummer but also the best drummer in the world. In the music school that it entered he meets a teacher whose ways of teaching and trying to make great musicians of his pupils include bullying, insulting and even hitting them. Therefore the relationship between them both is tough and conflicting. The role of Fletcher the dictator teacher is excellently performed by J. K. Simmons. A very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
I love seeing J.K Simmons look so angry,"A young man who aspires to become a famous drummer must get heavy pressure from his university mentors. Mental problems adorn him to stick to his ideals.Whiplash presents a strong and violent emotional film. The premise is strong, dense and has a high tension in it. Quite content in displaying such a strong emotional from anger, sadness, satisfaction, hubris and selfishness. It's interesting to see how hard and perfect a music guide is to get the band he wants. Such a strong, dense conflict and putting tremendous pressure to watch this film. A dense story, not in a hurry in building conflicts. Good character development and well built. The atmosphere of the film is well constructed, it looks real and the emotional side is so extraordinary. The film feels real to me with the emotions it brings. A great message and meaning in this film. With jazz music that adds to how good the film is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
My favorite movie of all time,"Whiplash! I mean wow this movie really is incredible! I must've seen this film 4 or 5 times at this point and it always has me as tense watching it as i did the first time. J. K Simmons has an unforgettable role here, I mean he truly did just amazing. Terence Fletcher is one of the best villains in a movie that i've ever seen. He's manipulative and snide, and he tries to convince you he's your friend. Terence Fletcher is nobodies friend. Something I don't see talked about often is Miles Tellers performance in this movie. I thought he also did fantastic. Fantastic movie, watch it now if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Electrifying,"At first it was not the synopsis of the movie that captured my attention but the IMDb score. I thought ""it's just a movie about drumming, how compelling can it be?"". I was an ignorant fool. This movie rocks (or jazzes). From start to end. Your eyes are glued to the screen, you keep guessing what will happen next. I anticipated how the characters would react to one another, not how the story unfolds. The sheer brutality is both refreshing and terrifying. Coming from all characters. They did a splendid job on building original characters. I salute you. It was also an eye-opener for me and my friend. It was enthralling to learn more about the world of orchestras and jazz. Still, it was awesome. A thousand out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
You will be glued to the screen from start to finish,"I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the greatest film of all time, but boy it might just be the most engaging one.From frame one we are introduced to our protagonist, Andrew, and know pretty much everything we need to know about him. When Fletcher enters the scene, we know everything we need to know about him, as well as the duo's relationship for the duration of the film. Every following scene plays off of the seeds placed within this opening scene, culminating in a 20 minute long, dialogue free standoff between these characters.The film is elevated to the top tier by its performances from Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. Simmons might might have won the gold statue for portraying the abusive teacher that pushes his students to the brink of sanity to become the best, but Teller commits to his role with passion and creates a protagonist that everyone relates to on some level. Without these performances, the film would be nowhere near the level of 10/10.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle definitely did his part in making sure the film was entertaining without being hollow, and artful without being pretentious. The actual plot is rather straightforward, but the ideas at play resonate universally. The film is really a metaphor for obsession with perfection, and how it destroys a person's soul. The music and cinematography also deserve great recognition for serving the story in a huge way, especially that 20 minute standoff.The film is definitely uncomfortable to watch at times thanks to Simmons' almost terrifying presence, but you will no doubt be glued to the screen from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"A musical thriller. Intense,vicious and cruel. But with damn lot of rhythm in it.","""The truth is, Andrew I never really had a Charlie Parker. But I tried. I actually f*cking tried.""""Whiplash"". You could think that this film tells the story of a drummer (the movie poster is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to this) who has suffered this injury by violently playing his instrument. Or he lost control of his car while drumming rhythmically on the steering wheel and crashed into the car driving in front of him. You could link the movie title to these assumptions, because the arrangements that Andrew (Miles Teller) has to play in this masterful and highly rhythmic film may result in a neck injury. And when it comes to losing that control ... well ... then you should go and watch the movie to find out yourself. Anyway, the film title refers to a song written by the American jazz composer Hank Levy. The central theme of the film is about the influence you can have on someone and drive that person to exceed certain inhuman limits of his own ability. Now, for me you're already a top musician when you know the complete arrangement of ""Whiplash"" and ""Caravan"" (written by Duke Ellington) by heart. Even if there's a little mistake here and there or you are little bit offbeat, eventually I will have a boundless admiration for the musician after completing such a superhuman performance.I've never had such a desire to pull someone through the screen and then smack a huge cymbal against his face as now with the presumably extremely talented music teacher Fletcher, brilliantly played by JK Simmons. A man who lives for his music and has a huge passion for it. It's a bit exaggerated that passion though. Exaggerated to such extent that it exceeds the limit of human dignity and by his passion for creating a perfect musician, his way of teaching tends to be sadomasochistic. A kind of militaristic attitude towards his traumatized and frightened students who are wary of any unexpected outburst. A disrespectful howler, suitable as ""drill sergeant"" in the US Army, and first-class bully, who suddenly swings around music stands, slaps his students in the face and throws out a member of his orchestra, just because he plays a bit out of tune . Afterwards, the accused doesn't appear to be the culprit, but he's just thrown out of the classroom because he didn't know he wasn't the one playing out of tune. A worse stain on the reputation of a professional musician, according to Fletcher.That's also what Andrew, an ordinary American teenager who studies at the Shaffer conservatory and whose only envisioned aim is to be the best jazz drummer ever, undergoes. The moment he's being asked to join Fletcher's school orchestra, which only consists of a select group of musicians, it becomes the best day of his life. His confidence gets such a boost that he even overcomes his shyness and dares to ask a girl, who works at the cinema, on a date. That it's subsequently leading to a veritable psychological warfare, goes beyond his wildest dream. Gradually the terror policy of Fletcher drives him to the utmost to meet Fletcher's expectations. Even his relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist) is terminated abruptly by him. The love for music is displaced by a bloody battle for a wanted spot in the orchestra. The obsessional takes the upper hand, tending towards self-destruction.I'm not exactly an expert myself when it's about jazz. And I've read reviews where it's suggested that the essence of jazz is completely misrepresented here : ""The idea about jazz in this movie is brought in a grotesque way and looks like a ridiculous caricature"". The whole history about Charlie Parker and the anecdote Fletcher tells every time, apparently isn't exactly true at all. Could be, but for me the jazz section wasn't of essence in the story. It's the emotional and physical brutality that Fletcher uses to bring students to a higher level. In this way Fletcher tries to create ""HIS Charlie Parker"". The whole movie does follow the rhythm of the used music: uplifting, rhythmic and intense. Only the end was predictable and presented us of course the well known rule that the oppressed kicks the oppressor's ass again. Actually I hoped Andrew would put his drumsticks there where the sun doesn't shine at Fletcher.The performances of Teller and Simmons are obviously extremely stunning. It took me a while before I realized that I've seen Teller in ""That awkward moment"". A movie I wanted to forget about as soon as possible. Here, however, I thought he was brilliant. And apparently he's an avid drummer and he did all the drumming himself. Hats off and respect ! But the most brilliant achievement was undoubtedly that of Simmons. What a great character sketch with lots of charisma. A character that scares you. Someone you start to hate thoroughly after a while. But in the end I understood a bit what drove him to this behavior. He won an Oscar for this role and in my opinion well deserved. An energetic musical thriller, with a fairly predictable outcome and which is so extremely rhythmic you can't sit still. Highly recommended!More reviews at opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

This movie will keep the Jazz alive,"Oh god, it was a fabulous experience! This is my second or third time watching this movie, and each time I'm as captivated as I was the first. Everything about it is near perfection.This is the story of a young adult who is passionate about music, drums, and jazz. It's his story, or his journey if you prefer. You become part of his life for a little less than two hours, feeling the passion alongside him. Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons are the two actors who steal the entire show. I can't say who is better, but they carry the intensity of this movie and deliver the message that Damien Chazelle wants to convey perfectly. It's full of emotion, drama, and conviction about people who want to keep jazz alive in a world dominated by pop music. It's a shame for musicians who want to express themselves through their instruments.This movie has a lot of psychology behind it, especially with the teacher who pushes students beyond their limits to make them great. Good is not enough. Good is bad in his eyes. It's a philosophy taken to the extreme and will be judged by many as such, but I believe that if you want to be in a different class from everyone else, in any field, this is 100% the path and vision you must carry throughout your life. If you want to accomplish something excellent, something that will be remembered when you're gone, you absolutely have to go to that zone frequently and shift your mindset, always pushing yourself harder. It's profound, but I think this movie explains that concept perfectly through the lens of music.Can I talk about the music in this movie? It's one of the best soundtracks ever. Every song shares the passion of jazz and varies in intensity. You can listen to the album with your eyes closed or even during your workouts to relive the vibe of the movie.It can be dark, for sure, but I really think that anyone who loves music and films MUST watch and listen to this movie. It's even greater when you rewatch it, like many of Damien Chazelle's films. This is in my top 25 for sure. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

The Embodiment of Storytelling,"I don't give out 10s often (15 in my lifetime), and especially to 21st century films, but this film tells its story perfectly. There is nothing can add about how great the writing, direction, and acting are in this film that has been done a million times before.What I love about this film the most is that it could have been made in 1934, and nothing would change. Honestly. What happened to movies like this? This movie proved that if you have good writing, you can create a modern day classic. Do you hear that Hollywood? You don't need a $500 million. You need one man with a pencil and a camera. In this case, his name is Damien Chazelle. Also I didn't forget about the incredible performances by Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons.Just an incredible movie that I couldn't recommend any higher.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
I don't want to be great. I want to be one of the Great.,"I like when Hollywood dares to cast a young actor that doesn't fit their standards of beauty. The lead worked extremely well with his character and quite frankly, I think that's what kept me riveted. Adversity fuels him, exhaustion is merely an obstacle in his path. The actor's nervousness and receptivity is mesmerizing and will entrap you in his world. The camera could have pulled a Lars Von Trier, standing just behind his shoulder and it would have felt the same.While the audience isn't courted so much into caring for the characters, the story does bring its emotional content with themes that appeal to everyone. The desire to make something out of your life, the sacrifices, the labour. But who knows how it will end? It's different for each of us.JK Simmons was remarkable and his chemistry with the lead could have been better but it was sufficient. It was just enough to hold the movie together.Now the bleeding hands were great at first but that quickly wore down. Everyone one of us who's ever played an instrument (which is everyone), knows the hardship isn't in the playing but in the accuracy. I get that his main struggle was to keep up the fast beat but as I said, the bleeding hands metaphor quickly wore down. If it had been a trombone, would they have made his lips bleed? The fingers of a piano player? It was just too much. Sweat would have sufficed.Ups and downs - not the greatest movie I've seen this year, but good. Pretty good. It's an 8/10 for me; would recommend it to a specific crowd only.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Good job,"Whiplash is an astounding piece of modern day cinema. Its a film that leaves you physically shaking even after the second watch and with a complete sensory overload as you try to reconcile every element of that film that seems to have been seamlessly and passionately crafted.All that I hope is that Whiplash is not too overpraised in the sense that future audiences may meet it with harsh expectations and come away underwhelmed. Part of what made the first experience so special was that I had no expectations, I saw a short trailer and it was at a convenient showing time.Its excitement may dwindle, like sussing out a roller coaster, following its turns and loops from the ground before you even hit the queue. Whiplash is adrenaline cinema and is best met head on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
So. Much. Tension. and without guns.,"An absolutely riveting movie.Terence Fletcher (the crazy good J.K. Simmons) and Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) were both amazing in this, although really, Fletcher took the cake. His character embodies that fierce (and sometimes violent) drive in each of us, or perhaps some person in our lives that tries to push ourselves to the limit, which is what makes this movie so personal as this connects with the audience. While on the other hand, Andrew represents the dreamer in all of us, but is sometimes faced with the limbo between attempting to push harder or to give up. This is what makes this movie so engaging.The music in the movie, coupled with the drumming also adds to the tension in this roller coaster of a movie.The finale was also spectacular and epic. There's basically nothing to criticize this movie for. It elevates the simple idea of diligence and success to a whole new level and engages the audience throughout.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A movie that rocked me to my core!,"Whiplash was for sure one of the greatest movies in 2014.The things that are most outstanding is firstly the acting, including Miles Teller's performance of an promising drummer who also visits, as he says, the greatest music-institute in America and on the other hand J.K. Simmons who maybe offered the moviegoer of 2014 one of the best performances seen in a long period of time ( it's still a riddle why he was nominated as an supporting-actor).Secondly I would like to mention the sensationally effective way of how the editing was used to appeal to the viewer in a certain way, namely that camera and sound-editing work perfectly together and brought the movie on a exhilarating level. The story is thrilling, just the thought of having a (music-)teacher like Fletcher (J.K.Simmons) is simply a comparison of yourself going through hell. Andrew (Miles Teller) has to do it. Does he enjoy it? Probably, well, pretty sure not...but he follows his plan of becoming one of the greatest drummers of all time although the pain for him is inconceivable. The ""relationship"" of these two definitely stands out and saying, that Fletchers' methods are near to rape (physically and psychologically) is not very understated. By giving Andrew a few ""opponents"" drumming his way through the studio-band makes the movie even more interesting and shows how deep and on point Miles Teller's acting can be. The movie is from the very beginning with the nice overture (after a few minutes) and other musically supports till the end with again some great acting amazing. It could be said more about this masterpiece but I would like to leave it right here as it is my first review. Go and watch it...NOW!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Jazz is not pretty,"'Whiplash' is the story of two men. One is a young music conservatory student determined to be as good as his idol, Buddy Rich, on drums. So single-minded is he in this pursuit that he largely ignores other aspects of a normal, well-adjusted life, including personal relationships. The other primary character (J.K. Simmons in a career-defining role) is the most hard-ass music instructor ever. He curses, cajoles, intimidates and physically assaults his students, buffered by the philosophy that if he does not, they will never achieve greatness. Neither lead character will yield, and from that premise and tension flows the drama and some incredible jazz music.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Way overcooked but hugely entertaining,"I've never quite understood why it's become a pejorative to refer to a movie as ""manipulative."" Truth is, most of us go to the movies to be manipulated. That's kind of the whole point. Writer-director Damien Chazelle — at least on the evidence of this sophomore feature, Whiplash — is a master manipulator. The movie is a sleek machine that works you over and bats you around until the climax incites the audience into the kind of frenzy I haven't seen in an auditorium since Rocky beat Drago. It's viscerally thrilling, and distressingly hollow.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew, as aspiring young jazz drummer studying at a New York conservatory. Hopelessly devoted to his craft, the kid catches the ear of this school's legendary instructor, Terence Fletcher. Played by the great J.K. Simmons as if auditioning for the lead in an R. Lee Ermey biopic, Fletcher is a bullet-headed, ball-busting martinet – an emotionally abusive sadist of almost super-villain proportions. He recruits Andrew for his competitive Studio Band and then proceeds to humiliate, badger and berate his new pupil to the brink of a nervous breakdown.It's Fletcher's belief that if Jo Jones hadn't thrown a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head during a gig for which he was ill-prepared, the wet-behind-the-ears saxophonist never would have buckled down and become Bird. Fletcher throws a lot of cymbals, and plenty of other stuff too. He's had it up to here with a generation raised on participation trophies and he excoriates the words ""good job."" Fletcher demands excellence, no matter how many obscenities, homophobic epithets and pieces of furniture he has to hurl at his students to get the desired result.The sheer pleasure of watching J.K. Simmons in this role should not be understated. A key utility player in this past decade's films finally stepping into the spotlight, he conducts temper tantrums with mathematical precision, at times diabolically lulling the kids into a chummy sense of security before unleashing his splenetic rage. Clad in black muscle tees, Fletcher is often half-glimpsed lurking in the shadows like a B-Movie monster. (If I've learned anything from Whiplash and the 1980 Fame, it's that Performing Arts Schools in New York City are lit like the Corleone family living room.) Andrew flourishes under his mentor's drill sergeant methodology, and the film begins to feel like a sick parody of inspirational teacher movies. Desperate never to end up like his schmucky father (Paul Reiser, perfectly cast) the kid callously tosses aside his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) and practices all day and night until his hands bleed — recurring shots of which Chazelle is a bit overly fond. Whiplash subscribes to the notion that artistic greatness requires monastic self-abnegation — a canard that's ruined many young men's lives and gets taken out behind the woodshed in next week's Listen Up Philip.Expanded from a short film that similarly dominated Sundance in 2013 (this story has won so many festival awards in one form or another I half-expect juries to start inventing new categories in which to give it prizes) Whiplash raises a lot of pertinent questions about bullying and self-discipline, only to sheepishly back away without exploring them in any depth. Chazelle's script leans on a couple of eye-rolling contrivances, and I think it's long past time to retire the de rigueur, out-of-nowhere car accident tossed in at the end of the Second Act to raise the stakes whenever screenwriters can't figure out a way to do so organically.Of course, nothing else matters if you can wow 'em with the ending, and Whiplash has a doozy. Andrew and Fletcher finally square off onstage in a kinetic, feverishly prolonged musical crescendo. It's a breathtaking sequence, with editor Tom Cross' syncopated Fosse cuts ramping up the intensity to an almost surreal, nearly unbearable pitch. Whiplash has the kind of finale that makes you momentarily forget all your reservations about everything that came before. No surprise to discover that Damien Chazelle was a musician before he became a filmmaker. His real gift is for playing a crowd.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
This is no way to get the best drummer out of.,"Being a musician all my life and seeing this film makes me hate the main character. And more the teacher. He practices all wrong and he always has accuses. The best drummer doesn't made from playing fast, that is so stupid. The best drummer doesn't made from playing stiff, this is even more stupid. And the best music teacher surely doesn't made from a tough guy who do not the first thing how to teach, you can not push students like that to make great musicians. The whole point is to relax and feel the music. And swing is about feel the beat. You need to master the slow tempo so you can then be more accurate at higher tempo. What his film try to communicate about practicing and being the best musician is absurd. I stopped half way through the film, I just couldn't watch this non-sense anymore.The main character does also looks very dumb as a person and worst as a musician and I believe not many musicians can relate to that.

A massive step in the right direction for American Films,"Constantly we hear about the lack of substance modern entertainment contains. This movie defies this generalization. Whiplash is excellently constructed, beautifully filmed, and the actors achieve a rarely reached level of skill, which collectively make it worthy of nine stars alone. However, it is Whiplash's display of the cost of greatness, it's insight into the nature of sacrifice and ambition, which make it a ten star film. J.K. Simmons role personifies the aspect of human ambition centered around seeking greatness at all costs, while Miles Teller shows the struggle of attempting to balance the losses. To anyone who wants to see a quality, well developed movie with an excellent, deep plot, watch Whiplash.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Astounding, intense & damn near perfect!","Wow! Just wow!A young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller) enrolls at a prestigious music conservatory. Plucked from a rehearsal room, he is given the opportunity to play with the studio band under the tutelage of aggressively driven band leader Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a man with a vicious mouth, extreme methods and an obsession with driving his students way beyond breaking point in order to achieve their potential and find absolute perfection.Perhaps my greatest joy with Whiplash is that just a few weeks ago I was barely aware of its existence and deliberately knew little about it as I took my seat in the screening room. There is something very special about being blindsided without expectation, and blindsided I was. My screening companion and I felt exhausted by the end and were still discussing animatedly it an hour later.I knew I was in the presence of greatness within minutes of Whiplash. From the opening scenes of Andrew rehearsing and Fletcher observing, passing judgment and scything him down with sharpened tongue and looks that slayed, it was abundantly clear that writer/director Damien Chazelle was on a mission to hammer us repeatedly with verbal blades, withering looks and an intensity that other directors would kill to produce.There are insufficient superlatives to express the power and effect of Whiplash and Chazelle's achievement. At least four times in the course of the screening my heart sank as Chazelle took us towards an alleyway that was predictable and certain to kick a five-star experience into another four-star, notable also-ran. Each time, he turned it around beautifully, steadfastly refusing to take the convenient route, instead aiming another kick at the tender parts, slamming us with the unexpected and leaving us to reel or look on in wide-eye admiration.His brilliance is in the subtlety, the sharp cracks of dialogue that slice through the opposing character's confidence; it is in the reactions of the onlookers that we see once and only once, never over-egging a moment; it is in the blood, sweat and tears, literally, that coat the symbols; it is in the music, the performance and the slam of hand and stick on metal and skin and it is in the accompanying venomous glares that scream more eloquently than a thousand words could ever achieve.Until last night, I didn't really 'get' jazz. After 107 minutes of Whiplash that passed in a heart-pounding, hair prickling moment, I can't get enough. If there had been a second screening I'd have put myself through the exhaustion again in an instant.When the Oscar nominations are revealed tomorrow, I doubt if the Academy will honour Whiplash with a Best Film nod but I sincerely hope it is in the mix at least for director and editing. As for J.K. Simmons, his nomination and win as Best Supporting Actor are probably as much a certainty as Daniel Day Lewis was for Best Actor in 2013 for Lincoln. If Simmons doesn't clean up 90% of the principal awards and see his already superb career take a whole new trajectory after this, I'll eat my hat, and yours and every one I can find in the village! Good? Whiplash is damn near perfect and J.K. Simmons is a major reason for it!For those who know J.K. Simmons as 'that guy from', no longer is he going to be the go-to guy for irascible bosses and supporting characters. There is an effortlessness to his commanding performance as the teacher his students fear but whose validation they crave. Powerful, venomous, controlling, manipulative, vindictive Fletcher is at turns both horrible and, perhaps, a genius. J.K. Simmons' utter ownership of the character pokes an electrified finger into every nerve prompting us to hate, fear and, just maybe, respect and admire a man who walks a razor sharp line between obsessive insanity and genius, all the time staring his victims in the eye, screaming into their face and daring them to take him on.On the receiving end of much of his venom is Andrew, played with equal measure and control by Teller. It is a solid performance that meets Simmons' all the way. More than that is Teller's performance at the drums that astound. He plays with his hands and his fists and his mind and his emotions and every ounce of fluid he can ring out of every available pore in his body. At the risk of sounding repetitive, wow. Just wow!I recently reviewed Big Eyes, a true story that really didn't warrant a feature-length big screen outing. Conversely, Whiplash is an event I wish I could make a reality so that I could experience it in the flesh repeatedly.Chazelle has crafted a film that is pretty much perfect. I fear it will receive a limited audience because, on paper, the premise doesn't blow anyone away: Teacher gives student a hard time; student struggles to find himself... But back in 1994, a little prison movie was released that was badly marketed, garnered seven Oscar nominations, didn't win a single one and bombed at the box office. It was only word of mouth and the DVD release that made the world sit up en masse and notice that The Shawshank Redemption for what it is. Perhaps Whiplash will go through a similar experience, though I suspect Oscar won't make the same mistake this time around.The year is young but Whiplash is the best cinematic outing from it so far.

Carrot and stick,"What a performance or better performances. It was about the time JK Simmons got recognized (read won an award)! And it couldn't have been a more rewarding role than this. If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to.We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had.

"It is an intense, powerful, and electrifying work of art","Damien Chazelle's Whiplash represents arguably one of the most exhilarating cinematic endeavors in the music genre in recent memory, let alone one by a man making his directorial debut. It is a music-themed that takes on the daunting task of delivering a feverishly thrilling atmosphere not from the emotional resonance of its music, but its bold psychological tone that proceeds its heart- rending story. By Chazelle's thoughtful direction and the uncompromising performances by actors Miles Teller and J.K Simmons, this film doesn't just achieves this task, it embraces. The story here is not one of your battle-of-the-bands tales involving a band or a solo musician shooting for the stars, it is a story concerning the complex and thought-provoking relationship between a young musician and his mentor. And it is one that hits hard in ways that a very few would expect. This film follows Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), an inspired drummer who enrolls in a local music conservatory where he joins a jazz band conducted by the talented, but maniacal Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is most certainly not a kind-hearted mentor, he is abusive towards his band and holds no bars when splashing his band with an severely ill temper each time one of them makes a mistake. Upon joining the band, Andrew suffers under Fletcher's mental abuse to pushing him to the limits, but at the same time, inspires the immersive talent he never knew he had.If you think you are in for another cheery and whimsical musical tale, think again. This film takes the music genre and grips with a dark twist, and Damien Chazelle accomplishes this in a way that puts the film on the border of a thriller than a drama. The narrative crux of the story is the complex relationship between an ambitious drummer who wants to exercise his talent to the fullest when he arrives to the opportunity, and a cold, anger-fueled conductor who threatens to tear him apart with his mental abuse, yet sees an inspiring talent in the young man. This all comes down to an exhilarating tale of a young man discovering his hidden talent, while enduring a harrowing maltreatment from his mentor that will leave viewers questioning his actions from start to finish. At one point, Andrew drums with such endurance to where his hands starts bleeding, while Fletcher is busy losing his temper and hurling chairs and instruments at his students. Throughout the picture, the story vigorously questions the actions of this conductor, but never answers. That alone makes for an astounding and thought-provoking aspect of the story. The biggest spark in the picture, however is the performance by J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Channeling R. Lee Ermey's Drill Sergeant from 'Full Metal Jacket', Simmons doesn't just play the role, he swallows it with immense precision that allows his inspiring, yet grueling character burst out of the screen with great versatility. It is the kind of performance that simply grabs you by the heart and never lets go. Miles Teller on the other hand, shines like gold through his incredible drumming skills. It is a performance that not only allows him to expand his acting chops, but to exercise his musical talent as well.Whiplash is an intense, powerful, and electrifying cinematic endeavor with performances that are simply too difficult to ignore and an inspiring direction by Damien Chazelle that makes for an absorbing directorial debut. It is an astounding cinematic achievement that makes for a powerful contender on my list for the top ten films of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
I Feel So Small,"Never thought I'd like this movie. Really love the drum playing and actually i was hoping that Andrew would play it one more time at the ending, instead he played Caravan. This movie also has a great plot twist. Wow, I should learn human character to anticipate what a person like Fletcher would do when he is felt betrayed. He's never be really good to you. He would revenge. Fletcher is like a male version of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada, only severer. Can't imagine if someone suddenly throws hard object at me.Having watched this movie got me thinking that I haven't done enough for my dreams. I feel so small. Somehow I feel Andrew is too obsessed. You should see how hard he practices everyday to impress Fletcher, yet it's never enough for his meticulous ears. Luckily it ends happily, so there is good price to his every hard work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Must Watch,Whiplash is a beautiful movie that shows perception and expectations of a young drummer and an experienced band teacher who is short tempered and very strict.Movie is boring in starting but last half hour was amazing.JK Simmons was amazing as a Band teacher and he really deserves that Oscar for best supporting actor in a Supporting Role.Other cast was also nice.Watch this movie if you want to fulfill your dreams no matter how much hurdles are there in your life.My recommendation is that don't watch this movie with higher expectations.Overall I give this movie 8/10.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"A good film, but...","How shall I put this? Sometimes for the sake of making something sensational, filmmakers descend into the realm of ridicule and make a fool of themselves.Let's go in order: the film is good overall, a very good film with a very interesting message and lots of excellent thinking points.There's this young drummer who has talent, grit and ambition, and of course the right amount of youthful stupidity. There's the ruthless machiavellic teacher, for whom it is unconceivable to compromise on standards.As a musician who trained old-style, I find all this quite relatable.But then there's the scene where our main character practises so hard his hands bleed. Seriously? I don't think this ever happened to any drummer (or other instrumentalist) in history. This is so hyperbolic it's laughable. I found myself rolling my eyes and saying 'why, for goodness' sake, why?????'.For this scene alone I lowered my rating by one star.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Compelling at times, but over the top","While I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by the two lead actors, as a drummer myself I feel the musical situations/scenarios of the film are often exaggerated and overblown. I've been in many of the same situations as both teacher and student, and any teacher who acted the way this one does wouldn't last out the week (I actually know of a teacher who struck a student and he was dismissed the same day). Additionally, although I understand the student's intense desire for success, the lengths he is depicted going to are often counterproductive and even absurd (playing until his finger bleed for instance). I would welcome a little more balanced, intimate look at the often very complex relationship between an experienced but demanding mentor and his/her ambitious, aspiring student.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Thankyou so much for the movie -Damien Chazelle,"Really an inspiration movie, which felt me like a music student who sitting under pressure with J.K.

Edge of your seat intensity,"Read my full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2015/02/whiplash.htmlOh man. I just saw Whiplash and I am still reeling. I can't remember ever having such an electrifying experience watching a movie (I swear I wrote that before finding the poster on the left with the word ""ELECTRIFYING"" in all caps). I was riveted, on the edge of my seat strung up with excitement by this thing. It'll have you on your toes, sometimes shaking with anxiety and other times bursting with anger and then joyously applauding at the end. Whiplash indeed.Maybe it's because I had a taste for how nasty it was going to get, but I was just wiggling with anxiety, half anticipating/half dreading when the shoe would drop. And once it does for the first time you just never know when it's going to hit again. JK Simmon's performance is just gnarly and intense. He plays a man with a single-minded, unbending vision: create truly great jazz musicians, no matter the cost. For him, this means pushing them to the brink of their own destruction. The ends justify the means. He makes the tiger mom look like a cuddly kitten. At one point he pits three drummers against each other for hours on end. He dismisses the rest of the band while the three battle it out one after another and you can see Fletcher is in his element, relishing the opportunity to just dig in, give in to his rage, and make them suffer it out. Andrew plays until his hands are bleeding. This movie has more sweat and blood-stained drum sets then a Tool concert.Writer/Director Damian Chazelle (who just turned 30) reportedly based the movie on his own experience dealing with an overbearing band teacher in high school. I did band all through school and even had a teacher that had some mildly-similar elements. (Also, did I mention the director completed this movie by the time he was 29?!? So impressive.) Fletcher's character is certainly extreme, with some complaining that it is unrealistically so, but it is brilliantly carried out. Yeah, we know that life as a jazz student isn't' exactly like this - so what? Keep watch for when he takes off his jacket, usually a sign he's doing what he thinks is his most important work. Miles Teller's performance of Andrew show's great range as well as his character transitions from a young hopeful pup to a cocky upstart, then a broken down hound dog and finally an experienced wolf that, although not a master, has a couple of lessons under his belt. Now that he's been through the first few bumps he's more dedicated then ever.The movie really asks two questions: What does it really take to achieve greatness? And then the follow up, is it worth it? The final act is exhilarating, jump-out-of-your-seat kind of stuff. I do like jazz, especially the type in this movie. But I think even if you know nothing and care nothing for jazz, the performances, the visuals, the editing, and the resulting energy and dynamics of the final scenes will get anyone going. Even as you see the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher change and then change again during an extended musical sequence, you never know right till the last moment how it's going to end and what it means. And even then the movie still leaves it up to the viewer's interpretation. Maybe the answers that you think the movie is giving to those questions says more about you then about the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Full metal jazz,"After all this time I've finally watched this. And yes, it reminded me of Full metal jacket, part one. I guess that Mr. Chazelle drew his inspiration from Kubrick and boy, did he make it right! Direction is perfect (including editing), fantastic performances by two main characters and fine choice of music. Beautiful photography also. This movie has everything to make it perfect, however Mr. Chazelle is not Mr. Kubrick but may probably be one day. If he tries hard enough to develop his own style.

"Excellent story, excellent music","I loved this movie. A tight script with two nasty, dueling main characters. The teacher/student relationship has been explored many times before, but in this movie the twist is that both are unpleasant in their own way.Both Teller (as Andrew the student) and Simmons (as Fletcher the teacher) were very good and Simmons did deserve the Oscar.For once, I loved that I did not need to pick a side but I could just enjoy the ride and see how these two ambitious, arrogant and toxic personalities were going to hurt (or help?) each other. Also, I do not usually like open endings, but in this case I found it very appropriateThe music is great, as it was expected.

I felt like I was the drummer. The emotional turmoil this film creates, makes we want to see the sequel, please!

Like my old gym school teacher,"The bullying nature of the bandmaster had me reliving those horrible days at school where a gym teacher had much the same approach to bringing out the best in his charges. Fifty five years on and I have grudging respect for the tactics of achievement by fear, but I still recall him as a rectal aperture who could have used more tender methods. J.K. Simmons plays the ""rear exit"" role to perfection, totally uncompromising in his almost unattainable standards (and a person who would be doing jail time under today's parameters).It's a real debate as to whether a genius needs to be pushed or whether their natural talents will emerge from some internal drive. My old gym teacher certainly brought out some qualities in me that would still be latent if it hadn't been for the fear and humiliation factor. Miles Teller plays a wonderful part as a driven/obsessed youth, it seems that all of the great musicians excluded everything else from their lives until they became masters. After that most of them make up for lost time by piling headlong into booze drugs and women.. but that wasn't part of this story. I enjoyed the pace and tension of the movie , all of the parts were well cast and the dinner table scene was a wonderful display of the contrast between hero worship of Football Jocks and the dismissal of musical talent. But that's America , at least until the musician gets famous. I would have given the movie a 10 if it wasn't for the actual music itself ; Jazz to me is like a cinder caught under a door, I'm sure they're all magic musicians but I'd sooner hear three cats howling on the back fence at night than spend any time listening to this tuneless crap. Go ahead and hang me if you can find me, it should be easy, I'll be at any country/rock concert. Enjoy the movie in Cmajor7b5 cheers Billc",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Electrifying and provocative,"If anybody out there has a passion for something, don't let anybody else take it away from you or push you to the edge, no matter what. If you're good at something, do it. There a lot of people out there who will provoke you endlessly and make your blood boil, so do not give them that benefit. This film made me believe in that fact once more, and took my breath away. Anybody with a dream, an intention, a vision of their future, has to see this motion picture event!!!! This is not a musical, this is not just a movie about drumming, DO NOT walk in with that misconception. WHIPLASH is a both electrifying and provocative well-paced drama that asks ""what is the true definition of motivation"" or as the AFI see it ""What is the line between mentor and monster?"". I urge you to check it out!!!!! If you're not at the edge of your seat while watching this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece, something is wrong with you!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Tests the Viewer,"The performance that Miles Teller gives in Damien Chazelle's new film ""Whiplash"" reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro's in ""Raging Bull"". They both play tenacious, unrelenting characters and do so in a way that can't be forgotten and stays with the viewer long after the movie's over. They may be pursuing different things, De Niro with boxing and Teller with drumming, but they're each after the same goal: greatness. And that's what this film is all about, reaching a goal that is relative to the person trying to achieve it.In this case, it centers around a guy who never feels understood. He's attending the most prestigious music school in the country and is constantly working to be 'one of the greats'. Who, in his eyes, is someone like Buddy Rich. Then unexpectedly, he's given a chance to prove his chops on the renowned studio band instructed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). He's soon met with Fletcher's abusive teaching tactics and is continuously tested under pressure. The question is, can he withstand.It tests the psyche of a young man and shows how far a person will go for something they love and want to do for the rest of their life. That being said, it's a harsh movie. The audience is thrown right into the pressure cooker along with Teller, and if you're not ready for it, it can be unsettling and scary. But that's one of the main reasons why I liked it. Not only does it test the main character, it tests the viewer. You also can't deny the masterful performances on display and finesse that the director brings along with them. Needless to say, this is a must-see. If I had seen it in 2014, it would've undoubtedly made my top ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Exactly my tempo!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I remember the first time I watched it I was so captivated that I wished the movie would go on and on and never end.

The character is everyone of us who are ambitious and driven, and have a thirst to prove ourselves. Miles Teller was able to play that part so perfectly, you forget you're watching a movie. It is almost like watching someone in real life. He is such an amazing actor, it is sad that he is so underrated. I hope he gets more good roles like this in the future.And Damien Chazzelle, please make more movies about Jazz.Totally recommend it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Tense but powerful, brought to life by fantastic performances","Whiplash calls into question how much humanity is worth sacrificing in the pursuit of excellence. Jazz drumming is a metaphor for any time you've ever tried to better yourself and life kept looking you square in the eye and saying ""not my tempo"". JK Simmons is outstanding, his bi-polar performance makes him perfectly detestable while still maintaining the humanity to rationalize his extreme behaviour. It may all be an exaggeration of reality, but the feelings it portrays are universally relatable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Cinema Personified: Brilliant Movie,"REDUX (09/19/2024)
Rating: 9.7
Overall, the best interpretation of the obsession of the artist as there is so much nuance to the message and morals of this movie, like whether or not it's worth pushing yourself past your mental breaking point to achieve your goal; the direction, screenplay, score/soundrack, technicals, and performances from Simmons and Teller really make this one of my favorite movies of all time and an excellent example of what you can accomplish with such a low budget.Direction: Incredible
The direction on a macroscale is incredible as he uses fast editing cuts and pacing to really show the rat-race of striving to be the best, and he does an amazing job using lighting and cinematography to build anxiety and tension; the direction on a microscale is brilliant as the scenes between Simmons and Teller show the complex relationship between the two characters, and how the former gaslights the latter to be the best and pushes beyond a moral boundary to get what he wants; the storytelling is incredible as he uses the ego and mental state of Neiman to really show the confidence he has as a drummer and how he pushes himself in silos to get better and appease both Fletcher and himself; he builds tension brilliantly as he uses lighting and anxiety to really show the intensity and villainy of Fletcher, especially in the music scenes as he pushes and gaslights him into being a good player (which is really up for debate if he actually did it for Neiman's best interests)Story: Brilliant
The concept is brilliant as it is an excellent interpretation of the artist's obsession, showing the moral dilemma on the subject and whether or not it is worth pursuing greatness at the expense of one's sanity; the plot structure is laid out very well; character writing is brilliant, Neiman is a symbol for the naive artist striving to achieve it all, with the rise and fall of his ego accurately portraying his confidence, and Fletcher is one of the best-written characters in cinema with how nuanced he is, being both a villain and someone who pushes Neiman to be betterScreenplay: Brilliant
The dialogue is incredible as it is sharp and iconic; the humor is really good as it helps paint the tension and makes Fletcher both evil and hilarious; the symbolism is profound as the movie is about the morality of the obsession of the artist and whether or not it is worth pursuing greatness at the expense of your mental health and Neiman himself is a symbol for the ego of a young adult and how their confidence is easily malleable by their surrounding factors; the foreshadowing is incredible and makes the climax so well executed and an incredible sendoff for the movie and these charactersActing: Great
Miles Teller: Very Good (What is really needed from the character as he subtly shows the change in ego and personality for the character the more he gains and loses confidence; he has great chemistry with Simmons and shows how he is willing to push himself to be the best)
J. K. Simmons: Brilliant (A ferocious and villainous performance that really pushes the movie forward as it crosses many moral boundaries to get what he wants; the way he gaslights and berates his players while simultaneously showing 'compassion and care' is so good that you really don't know if Fletcher is really a villain or not (though he leans more into being one); he has great chemistry with Teller)
Paul Reiser: Good (Plays the fatherly figure well and has good chemistry with Teller)
Rest of the cast: Decent (Feels like typical low-budget movie supporting cast acting)Score: Incredible
The jazz and drums really give this movie a fast-paced feel that helps increase the intensity of the movieSoundtrack: Incredible
Used in conjunction with the score, instrumental in making the movie iconic, as many of these songs are the ones played by the bandCinematography: Incredible
Uses lighting and angles to really build tension; the fast cuts really help make this movie feel like an anxiety rushEditing: Incredible
The fast cuts really help portray the rat-race in trying to achieve perfection; this helps increase the anxiety and tension of the movieSound: Incredible
Helps make the movie feel so polished and interjects music well; it is used to help build tension and intensityProduction Design: Good
Mostly just for the studio band room, as I really enjoyed the warm lighting they usedPacing
Pacing is very fast-paced, as this helps mimic the rat-race of trying to achieve perfection; the movie slows down in the right moments to really amplify the intensity and anxiety of scenes (especially the playing scenes)Climax
Climax is executed perfectly as it shows the journey Andrew goes on and takes control of his career; the final shots really are ambiguous and help leave the movie open to multiple interpretationsTone
Tone feels like a psychological thriller mixed with musical elementsFinal Notes
The movie does so much with such a small budget of 3 million dollars; there are some noticeable continuity errors with the movie (like how he rents a car when he's only 19 and how the players in the climax are visibly reading music when they are supposed to be playing from memory)ORIGINAL: (09/19/2024)

He steals every frame he's in, but don't let that overshadow the outstanding work done by the rest of the cast, particularly Miles Teller who absolutely sells the theme of how far somebody will push themselves for greatness, and the eventual cost of that.

Drums Along The New York,"Two things I don't like, drum solos and bullies. I'm not a jazzer, but I've attended enough pop and rock concerts to know that when the spotlight falls on the drummer, it's usually time to head to the gents, or the bar. And there's a lot of drum solo-ing in this movie, trust me...Then there's the bullying by J. K. Simmons' brutal, foul-mouthed, domineering music teacher, Terence Fletcher at the fictitious New York music conservatory where he's putting together this year's prestigious college jazz band. I don't like seeing people bullied and have experienced a little of it in my own life and working career.The questions this movie posits are whether such bullying is ever justified and how much a musician, or by extension any artist, has to sacrifice to be the best. Here Fletcher rules his class of students by fear, frequently resorting to foul-mouthed expressions of most of the major bigotries to supposedly goad his charges to going beyond their limits and in so doing become the next Charlie Parker or Louis Armstrong. He tells an anecdote about a fellow-musician nearly decapitating the young Parker with a flying drum-cymbal for not playing in time, which he tells us inspired young ""Bird"" to come back better and stronger. So is artistic bullying justifiable then?Nah, I still think that any kind of bullying is just an abuse of power by one person over another and can never be condoned. Especially if it breaks a victim or two along the way, as we learn happened to an earlier Fletcher student years before.Miles Teller is the ambitious young drummer, slavishly devoted to his drum kit, playing Buddy Rich CD's every waking minute until it takes over his life. When he starts to date a pretty young non-music student, played by a pre-Supergirl Melissa Benoist, the old argument arises as to whether he will put his art before his love-life.The film ended by pleasantly surprising me on the girl-friend front but not on the musical angle. There's not much wrong with the acting, the leads in particular. Simmons is convincing as the tyrannical music teacher while Teller's apparent prowess on the drums is impressive to witness bolstering a credible performance in his role as the driven young man. On the technical front, there was some sharp editing on the musical numbers and the music itself was fine even if not really recognisable to me. It crossed my mind though that for such a freeform style of music, this teacher's almost maniacal obsession with tempo and hitting the right notes seemed to contradict the improvisational ethos of jazz.I'm currently taking piano lessons from a young music teacher. I know that even if I magically woke up tomorrow to find it was Groundhog Day, I'll never be the next Glenn Gould or Oscar Peterson, but I do know that I welcome my tutor's patience and encouragement and would rail against the obsessive rages of a teacher like Mr Fletcher.So I found it difficult to credit the truth of both the abhorrent method of teaching and the pupils acceptance of it, to the extent that it spoilt my enjoyment of the movie.I'm pretty certain that Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong weren't taught like that either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

A Disturbing Film--And a Masterpiece?,"On the front end of this review, let me note that as a rule I try to never write spoilers, and this review certainly will not be that--but as the review goes on I will be commenting on where the film goes, in a general sense, at its conclusion. You've been warned.That said, ""Whiplash"" is one of the more challenging films that I've written about since I started the practice of writing a review here each time I watch a movie. It's hard to put into words how I feel about this film. It's disturbing, hard to watch, and puts its audience through a type of mental stress that eclipses most horror movies or suspense films. It's a story that is almost impossible to like, and as such it's very hard to say that I ""liked"" this film. And yet by the same token, it was an amazing piece of art. The movie is thoroughly well made, well produced, well acted, and well scripted. It's essentially a brilliant train wreck of movie--it hurts to look, but it's nevertheless captivating. In that regard the movie is well worth the watch.Now, let's talk about the plot itself. It's no spoiler at all to say that the movie revolves around an abusive student-teacher relationship, and more to the point it features an abusive college professor who has let authority go to his head--that much you can get just from watching the film's trailer.The film features a young drummer (Miles Teller) who has enrolled as a freshman at a well to do music school who then sets out to join the school's ""studio band"". We quickly learn that the band leader, ""Terrence Fletcher"", played by J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson from the ""Spider-Man"" movies), is an egomaniac who likes to scream at students, curse profusely, and even throw things in the middle of rehearsal. Fletcher takes on the young drummer, and sets out to ""motivate"" him through the most inhumane of mentally abusive instruction conceivable.I might note that Simmons earned the 2015 Academy Ward for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and that award was well deserved. Simmons truly makes the movie, which is a strange thing to applaud someone for given that you can't watch this film without coming to hate his character. Nevertheless, the performance deserves strong praise, and its easy to see how and why the Oscar came his way for this movie.Still, the film is a bizarre amalgam of emotional abuse--both of its characters and of its audience (at one point my girlfriend wanted to turn the movie off altogether, but we made it through)--and brilliant film making. Dr. Fletcher becomes every much as devilish as any villain in any horror or suspense film, all while the movie makes the viewer empathetic and invested in its characters.Now for the slight spoiler which is unavoidable if I'm to offer my biggest criticism of the film. The big problem with this movie is that its conclusion leaves the audience wondering if Dr. Fletcher's instructional tactics were perhaps well founded, inasmuch as the film ends with its main character (Teller) accomplishing a tremendous musical feat that appears to be the product of his being pushed so hard by his tormentor.This being the case, one cannot watch the film without wondering what the message is supposed to be. Is this a movie that is promoting emotional abuse? Is it promoting bullying? Does the film essentially endorse the bizarre abuse of power that its main antagonist personifies throughout the film? While any of these criticisms may be slightly overdone, it's nevertheless true that the awkward ending to the film is troubling.And yet in spite of all of the above, the film nevertheless is powerful, if for no other reason than that it leaves such a powerful impression on its audience. What exactly is being communicated in this film is sure to be a topic of much discussion, but what's for sure is that the movie will captivate you, even if that captivation may prove to be uncomfortable.That said, I wrestled with whether to rate this movie an 8 or a 9. It's extremely well made and powerful....yet its also a film that's just hard to ""enjoy"" in spite of itself. Thus my 8. Still, I can see how many will watch this film and immediately label it a classic, if not a masterpiece. It's great cinema--just be prepared to be uneasy during and after the movie. Thus my 8 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz.,"An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz. Yep, that's right. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a promising jazz drummer who has ambitions to be the very best. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is the cantankerous, exacting, conductor whom Andrew needs to impress if he is to fulfil his dream.The two leads perform brilliantly. Simmons launches into Fletcher's virulent tirades with savage gusto, his frightening demeanour and victimisation of the promising pupil creating the initial drama and tension. We feel for Andrew as he suffers the verbal and physical abuse meted out by his potential mentor. A battle of wills develops with Andrew determined not to simply accept every degradation heaped upon him.In the interests of tension and drama, it's overdone. Whilst immersed in the events taking place before you, you may not notice. The film is that powerful. But afterwards, you are likely to think how improbable it all was. Scenes between Andrew and both his father and girlfriend feel superfluous, interrupting the savage narrative of the battle between Fletcher and Andrew.It's this battle that results in events taking a different turn. We are made to see both sides. There is no goodie or baddie, it's the tale of two obsessions in conflict and the ensuing sparks that fly. Then we reach the dramatic finale (no spoilers here) and watch it unfold before us like the drawing back of a taught bowstring, wondering where the arrow will fly.Excellent, gut wrenching, roller-coaster movie.

At a loss to believe review score,"I'm a music lover, not overly keen on Jazz, but had great expectations of this film given the review score. Oh what a disappointment! The only half decent thing I can say is that the last 10 minutes were good. Great drum playing but blimey, I could not recommend this film.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Great movie,"I loved this but the movie is underrated.J.K. Simmons did a good job portraying his role, no doubt he won an Oscar for this one. Miles Teller also did a good job as a drummer boy. Too bad, he wasn't acknowledge by the Academy. Even the movie did not get so much attention. Maybe because it was released by the end of the year, I honestly think that this is an Oscar worthy.The intensity of the movie is just over the top, literally the emotions that you felt while watching the movie were real. After watching it, I can't stop thinking about it on how wonderful the movie was. We need more like this kind of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Too bad it was not about Metal instead of Jazz,Seeing the kind of ratings Whiplash got I had high expectations for this movie but at the end I'm disappointed. I expected much more from this movie. Maybe it's because of my natural distaste for Jazz music. It's really a genre of music I almost never enjoy. In Whiplash you get repetitive parts of songs that I particularly don't like at all. And then to have to listen to them over and over again is a bit too much for me. On the other hand the acting was good. The battle between student Miles Teller and teacher J.K. Simmons is interesting to watch. I can understand that sometimes you have to push somebody to let him reach his best level but in this case it's just bullying. So maybe if it was an other genre of music (like Metal or so) that I would have liked Whiplash. But it isn't so to me it's just a movie you watch once and then forget about it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Absolutely incredible,"I was expecting a lot from this movie. With all the Oscar nominations and positive reviews from audiences and critics alike I had some pretty high standards. Who knew that this film was going to blow those standards out of the water? This film was absolutely brilliant. It's about jazz drumming and its probably one of the most intense films I've ever seen. Go figure. Both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons delivered incredible performances. I don't know how much of Miles Teller's drumming was real, but from what I saw, it was mostly real and ridiculously impressive at that. I really felt like he was the next Buddy Rich at some points. J.K. Simmons outdoes himself here. He even beats his performance as J. Jonah Jameson from the original Spiderman movies. He plays a seriously hardcore jazz teacher who really reminded me of that drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. Every second he's on screen, you can't look away. Probably a career best for him. The music is amazing as well. The level of effort that appeared to have gone into the soundtrack is highly respectable. The highlight comes at the very end, which I won't spoil, so watch this film for yourself to find out. I cannot recommend this film more. Seek it out immediately.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Great movie,"This movie was a joy to watch (and is definitely worth rewatching).In the end of it there are a lot of twists which is very good.I was wondering whether to give it a 9 or 8 but ultimately feel that 8 is the right mark for it.Both the main actor and the supporting actor make fantastic appearances. The supporting actor absolutely deserves his Oscar (I still haven't watched The theory of things, so I can not say the same with conviction about the leading actor).The message of the movie is very powerful and I am very glad that titles like this get the recognition they deserve. I am also glad that other titles that don't deserve this recognition (albeit getting it by being nominated for an Oscar) (I am directly talking about American Sniper) are getting low grades in IMDb.If you like movies about fighting, student/teacher relationships you are in for great time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
No room for imperfection,"I watched this movie last week and Im still thinking about it. Unrelenting, overbearing, narcissistic- for both characters, the student drummer and his insecure , driven instructor. It reminds me of the days I spent at boarding school, where some of the masters there were just as unforgiving for any mistake and took you down as far as you could go. As far as the story carries, it is also a supremely done allegory. The protégé, in this case a young man, gaining experience in the face of continual criticism by the teacher.The teacher, though, is way beyond normal- he seeks to destroy any confidence that he may have- even if the student knows he's good enough. But its not enough to be just good enough. The young student, knowing that he can outperform if given the chance while his unbalanced instructor is determined to somehow bring out the excellence demanded by the medium of music- in this case-Jazz. There are no words of encouragement- only extreme criticism, and denigration. What purpose it serves to do that kind of instruction can only make you or break you to the point of self despising.The movie is very well played, well acted and will keep you thinking about it for a long time.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Unrealistic but worth watching,"I have been both a musician and a music teacher, and this movie is unrealistic in so many ways. No ""prestigious"" music school would allow the bullying, profane monster portrayed by J.K. Simmons to have access to its students. No drummer's hands bleed in the manner portrayed by Miles Teller's character (maybe a blister or two might pop before he develops callouses--drummers should speak to this). The movie is almost unbearably slow at times besides.However, it is worth seeing if you like jazz--although most of the music is not modern jazz at all but more from the big-band era--and if you like good acting.Both J.K. Simmons--who won the Oscar for his portrayal--and Miles Teller do a phenomenal job of acting out their parts in this wildly unrealistic drama of a driven young musician's descent into near madness caused by a sadistic ""instructor."" The movie Shine with Geoffrey Rush was in a similar vein but was done much more realistically and with a painful type of beauty.J.K. Simmons absolutely deserved the win for his portrayal, but anyone who would rush to see this movie should go in with eyes wide open and a shot of caffeine to stay awake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Fifty shades of gray with drums,"Or...The Stanford prison experiment - with drums.There is something disturbing about the overall message of this movie. The idea that greatness is justification for abuse and that abuse can somehow inspire students to greatness is just one of messed up ideas that is entertained in this movie.Masochist student teacher relationships apparently bring out the best in students and oh yes, you are not a serious drummer unless your drums end up splattered in blood and sweat.Apart from exploring a messed up form of battered person syndrome and battering our credulity with predictable shock tactics, this movie really does not say anything about greatness, music or the kind of inspiration which brings the best in human beings.As a musical person who has had the privilege of being conducted and taught by great teachers who achieved and inspired great things.

Whiplash is an entertaining look at obsession in the arts,"Whiplash Changes TempoWhiplash is a film above all about struggle, the struggle within ourselves and the struggle we have with the influences in our life: our family, our mentors and our artistic challengers. Andrew, played by the talented Miles Teller, is a young drumming prodigy, or is he? Is he the next Buddy Rich or Max Roach?Andrew admires his mentor, Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Simmons won an Oscar for the playing the megalomaniacal band leader who thinks he has the power to beat greatness into his students through abuse, name-calling, manipulation, lies, whatever it takes to be great. One big question left standing at the end of the movie is whether abusive teaching works for the most talented of artists, if it can make them that much greater.Whiplash is a more dramatic and less smarmy look at the entertainment industry than Birdman. Whiplash doesn't beg for us to notice how clever it is at every turn, it's not predictable, and while we are not clear where the protagonists will go at the end of the film, it doesn't need to invoke magical realism and mysticism to be a mystery. Other than both being compound nouns and about the entertainment industry, the two films are world's apart.Whiplash is not your typical film about an artist climbing to the top. Few films give so much time to the importance of mentorship in the artists' lives. Few films explore the obsession of the the art itself that leads one to desire to be ""one of the greats."" And the film isn't talking about the obsession of drugs and alcohol or some abusive family that leads artists to greatness. Like many artist we consider great, his obsession stems from his inner demons of not knowing what else he would do with his life without it and his insecurities in a world where the next guy on drums might be better. If he can't play like Elvin Jones, than what's the point? Unlike most of us who either aren't willing to do what it takes to be great or are content with what talent we do have, artists (athletes, scientists, writers ) who become the best have a different mindset. Whiplash lays that out for us to see in an entertaining form.And when you think you caught the beat of Whiplash, it turns on us like modern jazz and ups the tempo. But it never plays down to us. Whiplash surprises with the plot twists and just when you think it goes to far, that it has played out, the key changes and leaves us wondering.

Whiplash Review,"Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"" is an electrifying film about the lengths someone is willing to be pushed in order to achieve greatness. Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman and J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher drum up their best performances to date, as well as a pair of the best performances of 2014. Teller as Neyman is phenomenal, and the butting of heads between the leads is what drives many scenes of this film. All of the Oscar buzz behind Simmons' performance is valid; Terrence Fletcher is the ruthless music teacher at Schafer college whom Andrew Neyman strives so hard to impress. J.K. Simmons gives such a vulgar, astounding, and unrelenting acting job as Fletcher that even I felt infuriated by what he was saying while watching this film. The emotional and physical pain Neyman goes through to try and impress Fletcher is absolutely unbelievable, but the acting by Miles Teller, who has come a long way from 21 & Over, allows the pain to be understood. Damien Chazelle's directing is also very smooth, and the score is perfect for a movie about Jazz music. ""Whiplash"" is a fantastic film with magnificent acting, wonderful music, and a final fifteen minutes that will entice and amaze any viewer able to appreciate how far Andrew Neyman has come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Fake, fake, fake","My contrary reaction to the phony film WHIPLASH:1. Fake jazz: Jazz is the vehicle to tell this story, but what we get is not jazz but rather the academic teaching of big band/orchestral music, emphasizing arrangements and perfecting the technique of one's instrument. Same film could have been better scripted about a classical symphony orchestra at a university. Jazz is about improvisation and the interplay between musicians, as seen in a small group context. Big bands as seen here are more evident nowadays at sporting events. The only solo was the hero's mediocre drum solo at film's end.2. Fake theme/ending: Theme of the movie is the importance of motivation & rigor to promote excellence, in the context of a student, and the pitfalls of the martinet. In movies, for audience manipulation and dramatic purposes a theme is often betrayed at the end, most famous case being Alec Guinness's sudden reversal at the climax of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, because an audience expects the damn bridge to be blown up, even though his character spent the previous 2 hours with every fiber of his being symbolically building it. In WHIPLASH the finale contradicts everything previously in the script, not to be even-handed but to falsely convey a message that ""maybe"" true artistry and achievement stems from the horrible inspiration we've witnessed. Totally bogus and phony.3. Fake characters: Given jazz's history, the two major characters - protagonist and antagonist, should have been Black. The filmmakers have every right to make them whatever they want, perhaps a female teacher and a girl drummer would have been interesting, but that also would not have fit the use of jazz as movie's central core. My reaction to the whitened-up story was the same reaction as I would have to a '50s movie biography of Fats Domino played by Pat Boone, whose early career was essentially spurred by the industry (and specifically his record label) customarily ripping of a Black artist (Fats) with a white artist (Pat) singing his songs for a general audience. Same crappy approach here.4. Fake gimmicks: Many gimmick scenes in WHIPLASH would have been blue-penciled and not made it into the final script had this been a TV episode rather than an independent (""anything goes"") feature film -the writers' room would not have permitted them to slip through. Most notable is the hero's car accident and arriving late and bloody to unsuccessfully try and perform at the big concert contest, when the band's other drummer was perfectly capable of going on in his stead. Not merely unbelievable but farcical as directed here. Final reel of him conned into appearing with no charts for songs he had never seen or heard before was an asinine gimmick, almost as stupid as him returning to suddenly lead the orchestra himself, all for fake-dramatic purposes. And maybe even worse the scene that made me want to leave the screening: his blow-off of his girl friend telling her his need to practice and succeed would not leave enough time for their relationship to continue. That must have looked bad on the page and it didn't play at all on the screen.5. Fake performance: I have praised J.K. Simmons many times, and you can read my rave review for him on IMDb for his role in the obscure comedy NEW IN TOWN. But his facile, surface performance here is just the kind that wins awards (it surely did), but pales into comparison to many others playing essentially the same role. I will merely cite Robert Duvall in THE GREAT SANTINI or Lou Gossett Jr. in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as the most vivid in recent memory. I found his playing closer to the psychotic of Humphrey Bogart in THE CAINE MUTINY than to what the role called for.6. Fake icon: Buddy Rich is elevated to god-like status in WHIPLASH, a reactionary and outdated concept that I reject entirely. In show biz history I would nominate Rich for iconic status as a jerk, not a musical artist. In jazz history, the logical icon and role model here would be Art Blakey, since not only is his importance in modern (post-WWII) jazz secure but more to the point he became the archetypal leader and inspiration to hundreds of musicians who graduated from his band, ranging from formative stints for Wayne Shorter and the Marsalis Bros. to little-known connections with artists as varied as Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione, both of whom I saw appear with Blakey's Jazz Messengers in Boston in 1966.. Unlike the teacher posited in WHIPLASH as a Dick Cheney-like nut, Blakey motivated rather than tortured his young acolytes. Buddy Rich and his mediocre '60s big bands yielded nothing, and as a drummer he was all technique and zero jazz.7. Fake porn: Categorically WHIPLASH (the title is perhaps the key hint) is a type of soft-core pornography, among other things. It's another movie example of the trends in recent years to substitute sadomasochism for traditional sexual porn - namely the thousands of horror films about torture and sadism appealing to the audience to alternately identify with and then hiss the sadist as protagonist, or more recently the oncoming trend that will be inspired by the success of 50 SHADES OF GREY. The movie's domination theme is obvious, but the submission aspect is way more subtle -masked by the hero's natural rebelliousness. Looking beyond him we have a score of submissives -his fellow band mates who are humiliated (a key element of BDSM cinema) throughout the film. This as entertainment is the definition of pseudo-porn, acceptable to the masses because it does not involve ""money shots"" and explicit penetration making it soft-core rather than hardcore. The absence of sex in WHIPLASH is no different than the absence of actual sex in most BDSM exercises.8. Fake setting: L.A. substituting for NYC = zero atmosphere.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?,"Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' asks, ""How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?"". The answer lies in you, clearly on what you define as perfection. In Chazelle's World, perfection is ruthless, brutal & life-threatening. But, despite its hardcore approach, 'Whiplash' is a film that's worth watching, thanks to its mostly tight screenplay & bravura performances.'Whiplash' Synopsis: A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.'Whiplash' narrates a frightening tale of a mentor & his student. The anger & ambition between the primary characters is lethal & hardcore. You watch a monster of a coach behaving inhumanly, while the student aims only to achieve goal, come what may. The thriving journey of both the characters, is commendably structured.However, Chazelle's Screenplay gets slightly monotonous after a point. The repeated confrontations get a bit boring, especially towards the second-hour. However, Chazelle delivers a highly impressive culmination to the story. His Direction is sharp. Cinematography & Editing are good.One of the prime reasons why 'Whiplash' works, is because of its performances. J. K. Simmons is electrifying as the fearsome instructor, displaying rage & power, magnificently. Miles Teller is unbelievable. He takes upon a role that's challenging & he translates the part into a career-making performance. He's extra-ordinary. Simmons & Teller, both, are Oscar-Worthy!On the whole, despite some flaws in its screenplay, 'Whiplash' deserves a watch for its tense proceedings & fabulous performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Whiplash: A Great Example of How Good Cinema Can Be Made From Anything. Even a Drum Set,"+ JK Simmons: What a brilliant performance from him. He plays the ever-threatening Fletcher with the ease of an actor who has owned the character and made it his own.+ Miles Teller: While there are no words to describe his amazing performance behind the drums, he has also managed to break his mould as a sidekick in sci-fi movies otherwise.Whiplash will forever be remembered for being a film that has built so much around the humble drum set. Miles Teller plays Andrew, a teen enrolled as a drummer in a prestigious school called The Shaffer Convservatory of Music. He encounters Terrence Fletcher (JK Simmons) who is a teacher at the conservatory with a brutal and abusive teaching style. Things start looking up for Andrew when he gets picked up by Fletcher to play for the school band with the exception that he has to deal with the ruthlessness of Fletcher's teaching methods.Whiplash is intense. The sheer chemistry between Teller and Simmons is something that takes the film experience to a whole new level.The last drum solo is a scene that is much talked and for obvious reasons. Sellers delivers a stellar performance. The transformation of Simmons during that scene is also something to watch out for. There is also a difference of opinion going around the same last scene. People who are criticizing the scene for being vague and confusing need to understand the emotional aspect of the two characters in it.JK Simmons delivers his career best. His on screen presence is something that is rarely seen in cinema these days. Miles Teller surprises everybody with his unassuming personality which goes haywire when pushed to the limits.Whiplash makes one believe that good cinema can be made from anything, even a drummer and his drum set.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Gritty, intense, astounding indie drama about the risk of perfection","This independent drama (Damien Chazelle's feature directorial debut) is really compelling, filled with the director's love for jazz music (as the main character is a jazz drummer) and, certainly, well-acted. J. K. Simmons delivers an outstanding performance as Terence Fletcher, the abusive instructor who pressures the members of his band beyond their potential, in order to make the best out of them, earning him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Miles Teller is also remarkable as the promising young drummer who pursues his dreams and success, and stops at nothing to achieve his goals, no matter the cruelty he endures from Fletcher. His inner shifts and challenges are portrayed realistically (romance, family relationship, competition with siblings) and his emotions, as well (especially anger, sadness and anxiety which are usually caused by Fletcher's methods). Soundtrack is well-done, with jazz prevalent during the whole film. Depth of field is efficient, when used, and the direction is also great, adding to the thrills of this movie. Its message about how dangerous is the pursuit of perfection, even when it starts off as just dream-chasing is effectively conveyed through heart-rending scenes and outbursts, as well as with decisions of the protagonist to sacrifice everything in favor of his success. This motion picture gets slightly exhausting at times, a fact that doesn't detract from its wholeness, and on a positive note, it's exhilarating as well. There are many similarities between this one and ""La La Land"", Chazelle's subsequent feature film, particularly in some shots, but they are nice ones. The ending might not be as redeeming as we would hope, but it offers us a much-needed catharsis. It is recommended to every viewer who would like to watch a standout indie, which blends music and cinema together, in such a successful way, and it's proof that great films don't need large runtime or impressive special effects to make them special.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Whiplash is like a time-bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie's climax,"Whiplash turns the conventional teacher-student relationship on its head. There are two words that come to my mind that wholly define the movie: BLOODY INTENSE and ELECTRIFYING. Easily, Whiplash is one of the most thrilling dramas that you will ever come across. The movie rightly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture as it captures the various human emotions like passion, determination, perseverance and dedication to superior effect. One can actually feel the emotions like currents flowing through the veins of the actors: Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons and both of them carry the movie together with utmost brilliance.So, Whiplash is about a music teacher, Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) and his student, Andrew ( Miles Teller) and their struggle to master the art of drumming. The film talks about the extents to which one can or should go to survive in the current scenario of cutthroat competition. One may surely not relate to Fletcher's teaching methods but J.K. Simmons plays the role with such authority that he makes it very difficult not to love his character as he walks on fine lines of an anti-hero. The power packed performances make the movie what it is and a tight screenplay adds on to its thrilling quotient as the movie deals with the teacher-student relationship in the most reckless way imaginable.Coming to the cast, J.K SImmons as Fletcher is a music teacher with highly unconventional teaching methods that mostly involve barking orders, cursing like a sailor because according to him, everything is fair in teaching as it helps him bringing out the best in his students. There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'GOOD JOB' , this particular quote can be called as Fletcher's teaching ideologies in a nutshell and explains his psychology quite perfectly. He gives the performance of his lifetime in Whiplash as the movie derives most of its intensity from him and in my opinion, he surely deserves an Oscar for this. Miles Teller as Andrew plays the role of a determined student who is an apprehensive lad, pressurized to his saturation point by his music teacher, Fletcher, but at the same time he is very optimistic about his career as a drummer. Miles Teller brings in the much required, vulnerability as well as realism to his role and he completely wins your heart in the third act of the movie.The film kick starts right from the word go and once it gets the momentum, there's no looking back. That's the beauty of Whiplash. It has some brilliantly crafted scenes that are so intense and snappy that you might need a moment or two to catch your breath again.Whiplash is like a time-bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie's climax. The drum solo of 'Whiplash' played by Andrew in the live concert with Fletcher finally acknowledging Andrew gives the movie a perfect finish as the chemistry of both the actors on-stage reaches a state of euphoria. That's the point when Fletcher discovers that the true potential of his student has been finally realized and the relief on his face says it all. It's like the whole movie was desperately trying to reach there and the immense satisfaction that the movie leaves you with is brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"The Drumming Possesses You, Body and Spirit!","Another Oscar movie with a Princeton connection. Director Damien Chazelle was ""inspired by"" his musical experience at Princeton High School to explore how the drive to excel can become all-consuming. Not that the character Fletcher, superbly played by Oscar-winner J. K. Simmons, the tightly wound and sadistic studio band leader, mirrored Chazelle's own band leader (""fear inspires greatness""), he is at pains to say, but still . . . Chazelle wanted the film to explore the line between a healthy passion and an obsession, and, boy, did he do that, garnering five Oscar nominations in the process. Miles Teller is terrific as the young drummer pushed to the limits of his skills and endurance—and beyond—by teacher Fletcher, ""sworn enemy of the merely O.K.,"" says Anthony Lane in The New Yorker. Characteristically, Fletcher says, ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'"" The Hank Levy tune ""Whiplash"" is the rack of a tune upon which the drummers in Fletcher's jazz band are broken.

With so much pleasure to keep the audience glued to their seats, Whiplash is a fascinating tale about a passionate drummer called Andrew (played by Miles Teller) - who's undying dream is to become a musician as a drummer, even if he has to go off the deep end by severely injuring himself, in practise, which he, ultimately, does, when music professor, Fletcher, abusively doubts his talents. It's a careers best for J.K Simmons, whom delivers a masterful performance as Fletcher, as he horribly abuses the students in his music class, in order to make them successful and talented musicians - but Fletcher is not to be messed with. Miles Teller also delivers a mesmerising performance as the young master drummer, Andrew, whom will stop at nothing and will cross boundaries, even with Fletcher, to achieve his dream. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and of all time - and an extraordinary new achievement in filmmaking!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
One of the classics of our time,"I have never written a review on this site before. Never. I have been and IMDb member since 2012. I felt to need to write a review after watching Whiplash. I sat perplexed when the end credits rolled over my scene. I had just seen one of the best films ever created and already a classic of the modern time. Raw emotions, amazing performances by both Teller and Simmons great music breathtaking cinematography amazing sound editing. I don't think there is going to be a movie like whiplash in a long, long time. Even if you don't like jazz, I would recommend this movie to anyone. Cinephiles and casual movie watchers alike are going to find common ground in whiplash.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Music makes revenge into synergic Triumph!,"When I went to see this movie I just knew that this one will be a story of a music enthusiast trying to make his way up. I had no idea what 'Jazz' music was and I was unaware of all the jargon used in the band. I won't give much of the storyline in this write-up, but it is surely one of the best movies I was ever watched, ever! I was clentching my fist all the while, when the 'perfect' music was demanded by the bald headed music aficionado from his team. This movie has three stages: The guts to fight it out, the payback time and the ultimate synergic win! I just loved how this movie transpired to be so real yet so alluring at the same time. The acting was as good as it can be. The movie builds up a tempo and never for a minute bogs down. 106 minutes of pure, exhilarating entertainment. It has emotions, anger, despair, revenge and yet, it all ends in a supposedly triumphant journey.Long story short, Whiplash will blow your mind off! Phew ... genuine legend!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Amazing acting; excellent movie overall,"What I love about this movie is how it makes you feel exactly what the character(s) are feeling. The acting is exceptional. Andrew is a very relatable character, even if you don't do music. And don't even get me started on how phenomenally good J.K. Simons is in this, he's a freaking master. He's my new favorite actor. Also Miles Teller impressed me. I mean I saw him in Divergent & The Spectacular Now, and he wasn't bad. But damn, he was legit in Whiplash.And one particular scene literally gave me the chills (yall who saw the movie know what I'm talking about) like it was unreal.

Whiplash indeed is the BEST film of 2014,"a perfect 10! my words simply cannot describe how good this film is. very powerful and at the same time, very moving. never thought a drummer would have to suffer so much in order to achieve the greatness. there's a sentence that made me feel so right: 'good job' actually is the reason why put off people to become great. because good job also means mediocre, it only means that you just reach a high plateau or just on the foothill instead at top of the mountain, the ultimate greatness. the year of 2014 was another year that gave us some of the best films, and 'whiplash' is right on the top list. Simmons had won lot of nominations and awards, but i do think the young actor also deserves the highest praise. before watched this film, i never paid any attention to this young actor, but now, i'd concentrate my focus on this young talent. also, the writer/director and all the supporting actors in this film are great too.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Satisfying on a visceral level, but overcooked and conceptually absurd","Saw the film this past weekend and, after mulling it over, ultimately came away liking it. but not quite loving it. I think the movie is superbly made on a technical level: it's tremendously edited, the use of sound is terrific, the whole thing is incredibly kinetic, has great energy, and is an absolutely enthralling, gripping experience. But on a conceptual level, it's just so preposterous and absurd, I had a lot of trouble taking it seriously (and maybe I'm not supposed to(?)). But for this film in particular, it was problematic for me and kept me from embracing it completely.This is going to sound harsh, but the movie played to me like a really, really good student film. It just feels overcooked, sort of ""show-offy,"" but without much justification for all the razzle dazzle. It's set at such an outrageously high pitch from the outset, but the dramatic beats don't feel earned or believable in any way. It makes me wish the film were set in a different world where the character dynamic is still the same, but credible in a different narrative context. I get that part of the appeal of the film is that it's set in this world where you wouldn't necessarily expect this kind of tension and intensity to be wrung out of it but that's part of the problem for me. It's like Chazelle started with this idea and setting and graphed the drama onto it so forcibly that the whole thing just feels inorganic and overtly ""concocted"" if that makes sense.So much of it works incredibly well, but it just lacks a convincing conceptual backbone This may seem like a strange comparison, but I enjoyed the film for the similar reasons that I liked Blackhat (another film I saw this past week) I found both films to be very engrossing and satisfying on a purely visceral level, in spite of their shortcomings.Chazelle seems like a promising filmmaker, and this film is impressive on a craftsmanship level, so I look forward to whatever he makes next.Again, I ultimately liked it but not enough to call it one of the best of the year. I feel like I'm in the minority in saying that because I've seen it on so many people's top ten lists.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A brutal lesson in developing & maintaining a tough skin to achieve musical excellence,"An uncompromising psychological drama focusing on jazz student and promising drummer, Andrew, who experiences mentally and physically abusive training from his jazz teacher. Fletcher instills extreme methods to bring out the finest performances in his students. Both Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons are superb in this film and have an acrimonious, volatile mentor-student dynamic.One of the best on-screen renditions of how far a person will persist through difficult teaching methods in honing their instrument skills to aspire to be one of the greatest musicians of their generation.

It's really cool how the film rehearses develop a more loving relationship with my boyfriend and the father, the more he does, he focuses on the main drama that not the protagonist, that's fantastic, Whiplash is a film that has to be seen, final scene is something surreal, spectacular, all of it is amazing, in the end you already practically inside the screen, you're already hitting on her knees playing together.

A brilliantly tense movie,"""Whiplash"" is a brilliantly tense movie. It has a nice 90's feeling to it. The mental and physical battle between the ruthless instructor and the talented young drummer was so well written. It reminded me a little bit of Ari Gold & Llyod's relationship in ""Entourage"". JK simmons's performance as the instructor is very good but a lil overrated. I personally think Miles Teller was better as the Drummer, because his character had more layers to it. Whilst the instructor is straight up unlikeable. The drummer skips around from likable to unlikeable throughout the whole movie. I also like how it asks the question ""Where is the line between motivation and abuse?"" It is edited to perfection. Not a dull or false moment throughout. A Must See! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"""Whiplash"" is a captivating and intense masterpiece of filmmaking.","Ah, ""Whiplash""! The film that swept audiences off their feet and left them with racing hearts and sweaty palms. Directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons, ""Whiplash"" is a drama that explores the price of greatness and the lengths one must go to achieve it.At the heart of the film is the relationship between a young, ambitious jazz drummer named Andrew (Teller) and his tyrannical, abusive instructor Fletcher (Simmons). Fletcher is a master of manipulation, using fear and intimidation to push Andrew to his limits and beyond. Their relationship is tense, volatile, and constantly shifting as Andrew tries to prove himself worthy of Fletcher's praise.The themes of ""Whiplash"" are complex and thought-provoking. It's a movie that asks difficult questions about what it means to be great, and whether the pursuit of greatness is worth the cost. The film also explores the idea of mentorship, and whether the ends justify the means when it comes to teaching and pushing young talent.The acting in ""Whiplash"" is exceptional, particularly from Simmons, who won an Academy Award for his performance. He is both terrifying and magnetic, a force of nature that commands attention whenever he's on screen. Teller also delivers a nuanced and deeply felt performance, perfectly capturing the drive and desperation of a young man willing to sacrifice everything for his art.The direction by Damien Chazelle is stunning, with a frenetic energy that perfectly captures the intensity of the world he's created. The score, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is a tour de force of jazz music that will have your heart racing and your toes tapping. The cinematography, production design, and editing are all top-notch, creating a world that feels both gritty and polished, realistic and heightened.But what really resonated with me about ""Whiplash"" was the way it made me feel. This is a movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will leave you both exhilarated and exhausted. It's a film that will make you question your own beliefs about success and how far you're willing to go to achieve it.Overall, ""Whiplash"" is a must-see film for anyone who loves drama, music, or just great filmmaking in general. It's a film that will leave you breathless and make you want to stand up and applaud. So go see it, and hold on tight. You're in for a wild ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
I never liked jazz,"most people don't.Jazz is dying for that reason.As a former drummer, if I had the choice between being the core drummer at Lincoln Center or being the drummer in a famous rock band I'd choose the latter.Most music fans don't care how fast someone can drum and they don't care for drawn out drum solos.Also, if there ever is another Buddy Rich or Charlie Parker, they'll be playing as unknown session musicians...there would be no fame and glory or people talking about them after they die..except for friends and family.They had their time and their time has passed.Great movie by the way, even though there is a massive plot hole with the JVC concert at the end..(as mentioned in this forum).",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Scary...disturbing....a master class in abusive behavior.....but an EXCELLENT film.,"Well.....one thing's for sure - this movie clearly polarized the reviewers. Numerous 9 and 10 ratings, and a whole heap of 1 to 3 ratings. This alone shows we aren't dealing with an ordinary movie - it's exceptional.As you can see, I'm with the 9 and 10 ratings - rarely have I seen a more though provoking and challenging movie. It's an essay in obsession and how those who are obsessed can and are exploited by others to fulfil their own needs. Definitely not pretty. Definitely not pleasant viewing. But a compelling examination of manipulation and ruthless behavior, and what it does to the victims.Fascinatingly, a lot of the low-scoring reviews come from people who felt the movie didn't realistically portray what might actually happen in a top (music) school. Or that they felt the manipulation being dished out by the JK Simmons / Fletcher role was too repellent to be true. Seems it just made a lot of people very, very uncomfortable, and they watched behaviors they'd rather believe don't exist.Two points to that. Firstly, the film is clearly allegorical - I agree that in this day and age it's unlikely that the sort of scenarios described would for a moment be tolerated in any decent, Western school. That said, we see around us in the papers every day a storm of evidence of where the powerful in positions of trust have done essentially what was portrayed in the film, and much worse to boot. So I for one believe that this film is a very valuable examination of the model that can exist where a trusted person in a position of power builds themselves up by tearing down, playing off and humiliating ruthlessly those left in their trust.J K Simmons in my view stole the show. He convincingly created a role of pure evil. Initially he ingratiates himself with the vulnerable young Miles Teller / Andrew role. Naively Andrew believes he may have found a champion. Fairly quickly we see that Fletcher is in fact a very nasty piece of work who thrives in brutally playing off one member of the band against the other. His word is law, and anyone who even looks like challenging him is ruthlessly crushed. He's charming when he thinks it will benefit him (like many narcissists) but exists only to build his own ego at the expense of those around him. Ruthless, abusive, manipulative.....bullying isn't nearly strong enough - he's a psychopath.Sadly - the kids he's dealing with are either too scared of him to react, or they are hoping that they may avoid his wrath and benefit from the ""discipline"" he exerts.This film's message is so direct and powerful that I'd almost suggest it should be compulsory viewing for all kids in early youth. The ""take away"" would be....YES...people like this DO exist, and they will destroy anyone who lets a monster like this into their lives. So know what you are dealing with, and absolutely keep your distance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Where does Greatness come from ?,"Define Greatness ? almost everyone has a idea of who the ""Greats "" Are. In fact almost every body knows the back story of their great and who they are and how they came to be. But What is it what does it meant to be truly great ?Whiplash is a movie that struggles with that Very question. as it tells the story of Andrew a young man with a love and a driving passion for the drums. his idol is Buddy Rich and he lives for jazz. he studied Charlie Parker and simply lives to play.The most telling part takes place at a dinner party where Andrew is belittled by his family, for having a lack of friends. And Andrew Retorts that he would much rather live and die like Charlie Parker then to live Like them. When Andrew is reminded that Charlie Parker died alone and friendless with a arm full of heroin He relies that at least Charlie Parker is Remembered. And not only is Parker remembered but he is now a immortal legend. And that would be fine for him. Andrew is driven to be one of the greats .then he is selected by his university's leading music teacher a jazz musician named Terrence Fletcher.. Fletcher is as driven as Andrew is. Fletcher lives and dreams in terms of music and his one driving goal is to discover the next Charlie Parker the next Buddy Rich. And in doing so he will push Andrew to the breaking point. he will drive him to limits he never knew he possessed. and both of them will end up on a collision course with madness.Whiplash is a study in passion and the drive to be great. And what it takes to be great.Its also a study in fear. the fear of what would happen if yo failed achieving what you wanted to be great at.I was first made aware of Whiplash during the Oscars and saw the stunning footage of J.K. Simmons and I thought to myself I must see this movie . Simmons alone makes it great. the story is engaging and makes you think and its easily one of the best films to come along in a long long time that did not depend on explosions or super heroes like the Imitation game this films greatness lies in its very humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Perseverance to the max,"The extreme interaction between the teacher and his pupil was thrilling to watch. Absolutely amazed by the two guys performance. Thanks! With all the music in the movie it was hard to sit still. The movie was built like the song whiplash itself. It started out nicely with miles being a drum-student at a fortunate music school. On the way it got more and more intense. The real 'forte' started with him putting his drumming way above his relationship, but came to an ultra height when he got hit by the truck. Still keep on trying to make it he forced himself. Then prepping for the final hits he came back stronger and more deliberate than anything I've ever seen before. With an outstanding performance at the end I am sure he will make it at the top. The movie showed the two sides of success as kids have to fight these days to compete. A study in medicine, music, business, to make it to the top there is no taking it easy. But is it worth it??

Too ill-natured and rough for a movie about jazz,"Yelling and foul-mouthed superiors/teachers are still seen here and there, but I can hardly imagine them ""flourish"" in the field of ""mild"" arts; I myself have collaborated in several choirs and bands, my close relative worked for decades in a theater, so I know that artistic people are very thin-skinned and soft-hearted, certainly not ready to tolerate crudity for years, even by someone with contacts and talents. This sort of person we saw in Terence Fletcher is more fitting to sports or war-zone.True, the dramatics was skillfully created, there were several twists paving the way for witty, yet odd ending. The performances of two protagonists - Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman and J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher - were thrilling to watch particularly thanks to pace and dynamism, but sidelines and background were relatively empty, especially regarding Fletcher. After all, the viewers obtained some information about Neiman's background and life outside music.All in all, a vigorous drama with multiple strong and opposite feelings present, but it is difficult to me to envisage how (jazz) musicians would experience this movie plot-wise.

One of the greatest!,"I recently had the opportunity to watch a movie that has completely swept me off my feet. I can honestly say that I have watched this movie three times this week, and I still can't get enough of it! It's hands-down one of the best movies I have ever watched in my entire life, and I'm 100% sure I won't find something like it anywhere else.This movie is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. The characters are so well-developed, and their stories are so captivating that you can't help but get immersed in the movie from beginning to end.

Whiplash,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J. K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever.

Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.,"No synopsis of the film, just a summary of impressions.Some films stay with you for various reasons. After seeing this film a few days ago, I find that it is sitting in my head, just in the background where my subconscious continues to toy with it. Frankly it is a disturbing film with powerhouse performances by JK Simmons and Miles Teller. Worth seeing but be prepared for some unsettling content.There are lots of reviews that discuss the plausibility of a man like Fletcher existing in academia today or if one can really drum until your hands bleed.I don't think either issue matters from a thematic point of view of the film. Both of these aspects of the film could be attributed to dramatic license to convey a deeper meaning. This is how I approached this film while watching it and in this review.This does not mean I believe that the Fletcher character is implausible in real life. In fact, I don't think that this character is much of a dramatic stretch. Its pretty typical to see coaches and teachers in the arts bully their students. Growing up in a backwater midwest town I recall having a music teacher who employed tactics like Fletcher-- He threw temper tantrums for similar triggers as seen in this movie and tossed his baton, chair and music stand from time to time. One time I remember he even grabbed a student by the neck (a drummer in fact) and pushed him against the wall. Ahh, the good ole days of education in middle American. Anyway, suffice to say I think that this type of teacher or coach is a plausible reality.The scenes of Andrew pushing himself to and beyond the his limits are a bit unbelievable with the blood and wounds and all. Implausible yes, but I think this was an intentional device to convey a deeper meaning so that no one could miss it. All of these scenes are effective in conveying the one big theme in this film---only pain creates great art.This theme seems to prevail in the arts and there is much evidence to support it if you look at the biographies of the great painters, novelists, etc. Pain is a great motivator to inspire and change human behavior. I think that this idea rather romanticizes the suffering that many great artists experienced during their lifetimes . And perhaps this idea seems ingrained in the arts because its such an effective sales pitch for these artists work postmortem. Anyway, whether or not pain is necessary for great art will probably be debated for eons to come. This theme in the movie was not that interesting to me. I guess I should note that the film does take a position on this issue, coming down firmly on the side that pain is necessary to bring out artistic greatness.Okay, so the big obvious theme of the movie did not intrigue me. Yet, there is something that intrigued me about this film, something I found very unsettling and set me about writing this review. This film offers a rather realistic portrayal of the systematic abuse employed by someone who fits the profile of a sociopath or narcissist fairly well.Support for this conclusion: Fletcher manipulates his students and Teller's character in particular from the very first scene. He puts Teller's character Andrew through a cycle of idealization and devaluation again and again. He gas lights Andrew again and again. He systematically uses triangulation to manipulate Andrew. These are the tactics of a textbook narcissist.In this same vein, Andrew is the perfect victim. We see him lose each and every personal boundary, including one that would induce him to care for his own survival after being seriously injured in a car accident.Why does Andrew do this? Its all an effort to receive approval from Fletcher. Andrew is the perfect victim in this film. And his path in the film takes him to the place where many victims end up when tangling with this type of human being.In the finale where Fletcher sets up Andrew for the ultimate humiliation for the sole purpose of vengeance, I found this to be one of the most chilling things I've seen on screen in a long while. For me, the film should have ended right there as this is what can happen when you tangle with a narcissist.The film continues after this scene. We see a wild performance and Andrew seems to get what he has sought from Fletcher from the very beginning of the film. It feels a bit like a tacked on scene, like something that was forced on the story--a typical Hollywood feel good ending that was probably added to make the project more palatable to a test audience or producers. Given the nature of the characters as portrayed in this film, the ending would not end up in feel good land. Rather, it would likely end up as the Casey character mentioned in the film---Fletcher's prodigy who eventually hung himself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Above average,"This isn't the sort of movie you want to watch over and over - maybe not even a second time and maybe because it's hard (for me) to listen to lengthy drum solos! But it's certainly good enough to watch if you want to spend a little time with something that's different and a cut above most of the drivel that's out there nowadays.There were some character and plot weaknesses that made the movie weaker than it could have been. It was difficult to develop any affinity with any of the two main characters in the movie, partly because they were so thoroughly ugly (except for the single redeeming feature of spirit in one), and partly because every other character was part of the backdrop against which they were drawn. The guru's character immediately becomes obvious, and yet the hero repeatedly and stupidly falls in to his humiliating traps, which just seems so unbelievable. At one point in the movie the guru is shown to have a soul, yet when an event occurs which echoes that which haunts the guru, there is no believable outcome from him.That aside, there is good acting, at least interesting main roles, a sort of a slowly developing duel that crescendos, and there is good translation of that horrible, self-obsessive thing in humans that drives them to excel and be in the spotlight so to be permanently recognised, but at the cost of the destruction of all that should be dear to them, their character and even that which nourishes them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Good cautionary tale about extreme teaching,"I first learned about Whiplash in college from my teacher who saw something either educational or inspirational about the film.

However, having seen it, I think one might safely draw a lesson from both student and teacher here.The lesson I take is there is a problem with the idea of pushing oneself beyond one's limits, just as there is a problem with not pushing enough. In this day and age the problem is likelier to be students aren't pushed enough; however, the teacher's extreme actions in this movie is clearly not to be romanticized in the way that it seems it has been by reviews here.I would say that this movie isn't about passion so much as it is about ambition. The teacher wants to teach ambition, focus, and drive, with the assumption that his extreme teaching methods will eventually sort the wheat from the chaff until he finds his next ""Charlie Parker,"" who would never get ""discouraged"" no matter how many cymbals were thrown at his head. It's a thinking model that allows the teacher to think very little or most or all of his students, with the justification that his teaching methods would be necessary for that one, legendary student that he may never actually meet. An example of black and white thinking if there ever is one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A modern day masterpiece,"Damien Chazelle has proven himself to be one of the best directors right now. La La Land is one of the best musicals made but I discovered him through Whiplash which I consider to be a modern day masterpiece.Whiplash follows Andrew Neiman, a young drummer who enrolls in a class at a music conservatory led by the frightening and abusive Fletcher who stops at nothing to make sure his students are the best they can be.I remember how amazed I was after watching this film the first time and after multiple viewings Whiplash became one of my favourite films of all time. It's such a simple story but at the same time there are many layers to it. After each watch I discovered details I had missed that brought so much development to the characters whether it was something shown through the visuals or subtlety in some dialogues, it shows how great of a storyteller Damien Chazelle is.I didn't think much of Miles Teller before I saw this film but he shows how great of an actor he. I really felt the passion and drive he had to become one of the greatest drummers and the emotional range he gives Neiman is brilliant. However, the main attraction is J.K. Simmons in his best performance to date. I didn't believe for one second I was watching J.K. Simmons play Fletcher. He fully transformed himself into Fletcher and conveyed the angry, abusive and unforgiving nature of Fletcher perfectly allowing each scene to be as intense as possible. He fully deserves the Oscar for this movie. Chazelle's script is excellent. It's bursting with fiery dialogues and creative insults that J.K. Simmons elevates with his striking performance whilst also fleshing these characters out and helping us get inside their mind and understand what they're going through and why they're doing what they're doing.With a runtime of 1 hour 40 minutes, Whiplash wastes no time. The intensity is consistent throughout leaving us with barely any room to breathe and that's also thanks to the crisp editing by Tom Cross. Chazelle directs each scene with utmost confidence and ends the film with one of the most tense and entertaining finales to ever exist.Everything about Whiplash is incredible. The captivating story, the marvellous acting, the immaculate editing and confident directing all combine to make one of the greatest films of the 21st Century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

All the amazing shots that perfectly compliment the tense moments.

One Of The Best Films Of Its Decade,"Essentially a conventional plot, but there is so much that sets it apart as one of the best films of its decade. The performances, the script, and the direction are of course essential to its success, as is the economic run-time. But for me what really makes it sing is the way the movie's whole craft - but especially the editing and cinematography - cast it more as an action film than as something more conventional for the plot's structure. Almost everything to do with music in the film is cast with military/action overtones and the result is adrenalised, breathless, and thrilling - with a romantic subplot that's also suffused with heart and soul. All of this means that when a character falls, trips or some other genuine physical incident, it leaps off the screen and grabs the viewer with an intense impact that is missing in many genuine action films. A question at the film's heart - if the relationship between teacher and pupil is bullying, abusive or inspirational - is left tantalisingly unresolved, in the care of the viewer meaning this is a film for heart, soul, and mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

The story is too pretty, the package in which it is delivered is too nicely wrapped, the character development falls short.

"Brutal, unrealistic Hollywood garbage","I'm giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made, and what goes into great performances.Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer, played by Miles Teller and a teacher, played by JK Simmons, who directs jazz in a top music school. The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII, a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive. His head is shaved, he wears a black ""muscle"" shirt almost continually in the movie, he screams at his students, uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers, throws chairs, and finally slaps the Teller character in the face, repeatedly. I don't think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly, with just about the worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact that the acting is impressive can't save this film. The script is terrible. And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling.Worst of all, the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education. Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned-off The film is about mind-rape. It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage. It has nothing to do with music, or creativity, or teaching. It is Hollywood at its worse.There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power, but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school. One student would simply turn on an I-pad, record what goes on, then pass it around.The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail.One reviewer called it a ""steaming pile of excrement"".

An enthralling and vicious drama,"An exhilarating drama about an aspiring young jazz drummer who is pushed up to and over the edge by a sadistic college professor in order to reach his potential. What at first appears to be a standard story of a talented but difficult pupil being taken under the wing of an uncompromising and unconventional mentor soon moves into darker territory.J.K. Simmons is brutal as Fletcher, the band leader who terrorises his students to breaking point in order to achieve perfection. The physical and verbal abuse he dishes out is shocking and it's hard not to feel anxious for the the young musicians as they perform under unbearable pressure.Miles Teller plays the talented student Andrew Neiman, who initially comes across as an awkward and endearing loner but soon displays his own antisocial behaviours. Although some of the treatment he receives is hard to watch at times, the fact he is not a wholly sympathetic character makes it difficult to completely empathise with him and condemn Fletcher.The performances of the two main actors are excellent and as the film progresses a psychological battle develops as Fletcher's intense ambition to discover genius by essentially shattering and manipulating his students resolve clashes with Andrew's determination to prove his talent at all costs.This comes to a crescendo in the thrilling finale as the two main characters make their final moves, in a theatre packed with powerful music industry figures, to discover if Andrew really does have what it takes to become a jazz great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A movie about competition but not music.,"First, I will start off by saying that this movie would be perfect for non-musicians. This may be a great gateway movie into understanding or even appreciating music theory or jazz for that matter.May themes in the movie seem to be on the border of Hollywood hogwash when it comes to how over-the-top and unrealistic the scenes are.I understand they do this to entertain as spread out of a demographic as possible. But I feel it teeters on the verge of offensiveness to Jazz, Music Schools, and education. The amount of allowed abuse that went on in the movie was a shock factor for viewers and they dragged it out so much to the point of extreme abuse.
The director has said they wanted to flirt with abusiveness in the film. But I felt that what they did was beyond ""flirting"".All in All the movie had great acting and really good cinematography. A lot of the playing in some scenes was completely fake but allowable and some scenes of the movie will really hit home to people who grew up with an obsession for music or a music background.The movie never took you out of the moment, it kept you in the seat for the whole time. But after the movie was over it left a cheap thrill ride taste in my mouth. Many of the complaints about the movie could seem pedantic, but they are hard to ignore when a movie has such a specific theme they are working with.All in all, I give the movie a 6/10 and I would recommend as a good intense movie with a music background.

The obsessed boy genius who wants to be great and to be remembered after he's gone and his tutor, an absolute tour-de-force by J. K. Simmons. Abusive is quite frankly, not a strong enough word. He takes his own desperation and lack of personal success out on each of his students.

Complete garbage.,"Whiplash is the story of a dreaming teenage drummer and his interactions with a strict jazz teacher who team up to become some dynamic duo. That would be cliché as it is, but the writer/director tries to go for something different and fails miserably. Thankfully it's short, because there is hardly a single good thing about this waste of reel, except for perhaps a few nice cinematic shots.First of all, JK Simmons as Fletcher. JK is a good actor and plays the role very well, but the writing of his character is some of the worst in modern day cinema. Jazz is a very relaxed and fun genre. Smooth jazz is called smooth for a reason, you know. Fletcher is a jazz teacher who screams in his players face, belittles them in class, and even literally assaults them by throwing chairs at them and punching them in the face. This isn't the army, this is JAZZ. This character would be cartoony in an episode of Spongebob, let alone a live action film supposedly set in the real world. Do you really think people play SMOOTH JAZZ while being threatened and scared to play a single note incorrectly? No, they don't, they need to be calm. In one scene, Fletcher harasses an obese kid with a dumb name and claims he is playing out of key. He isn't, but second guesses himself when Fletcher calls him out. When the kid thinks about it, Fletcher not only calls him fat, but kicks him out of class. Another student had been playing out of key the entire time, and Fletcher says, ""I know ____ was actually in key, but not knowing what key you're in is worse than being out of key."" Are you kidding me? Of course you'll second guess yourself if a highly respected and very unstable man accuses you of playing out key. And literally the other guy who actually did play out of key gets off with no troubles. Unbelievable and very inconsistent with his character, as a real Fletcher would've given him some sort of punishment. All throughout the movie, Fletcher is belittling Miles, making fun of his dead mom and his depressed father, as if that would realistically motivate me to work with this guy further. If an instructor began making fun of my mom's cancer or my suicidal tendencies, I'd leave immediately and probably file a lawsuit. Again, this is very unrealistic for a character who is instructing a jazz band. Jazz players need to be as relaxed and free flowing as their music sounds, and they shouldn't be constantly on edge because of a sociopath Gunnery Sergeant Hartman of a teacher.Miles Teller's character is an smug, arrogant douchebag, much like the actor himself. I genuinely believed he had some form of autism in the movie. He separates himself from society and even belittles his girlfriend and family members for something he's barely good at. I get that the writer was trying to make it seem like drumming was tearing him apart mentally, as stated later in the movie, but there is a much better way to do it than ""you're an idiot and I'm gonna be famous one day!"" like he's a 5th grader brat. And then he later on tries to contact his ex-girlfriend, who he called an idiot on their final date, and asks her out despite the fact that he knows she has a new boyfriend. He's an immature child, and not the character we should like. In fact, not a single character is likable in this heap.There are so many more issues within the screenplay that it actually caused me to hit the 1000 maximum word limit, so I am just gonna jump to the ending. The film ends with the worst ending I've seen in a theatrical film this decade. Miles and Fletcher rekindle several months after the incident and team up to play in a new, not related to school jazz recital where Fletcher is the conductor. Right before the recital starts, we essentially learn that Fletcher is a mentally unstable child, who reveals that this entire teaming up was just a ploy to get his revenge on Miles. Yes, a 57 year old man with a job and career tries to get even with an immature autistic 19 year old college freshman. They also made it very clear that this was ""the big show"" and that the gig could ""either create careers, or end careers"". So Fletcher's decision to humiliate a 19 year old by intentionally screwing up the entire gig is super villain levels of evil, but not in a good way. In retaliation, Miles decides to one-up Fletcher by going on a six minute drum solo, where the most insulting part of the film comes. The final shot of the film is a close up of Fletcher grinning ear-to-ear and Miles nodding with another smile, implying that these two are back together again. The script even says ""...and Fletcher has finally accepted Miles..."" What a joke, and proof that something is seriously wrong not only with Fletcher, but this entire movie and probably the writer/director too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"8.3/10 - Smooth, Straight-Forward but Well-Wriiten Dive Into Obsession","Whiplash, directed by Damien Chazelle, follows the young, aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) as he pursues his dream to become one of the greats. His obsession, fueled by his harsh teacher, Fletcher (J. K Simmons), leads him down a dangerous road. How far will he go to achieve his goal?This film is one of the gateway films that got me into cinema, and I always loved it. One thing that I felt even more strongly now, after several watching experiences throughout the years, is how smooth Whiplash manages to be. I mean, yeah, it's jazz, it's supposed to be smooth - but even so, the vibes are just IMMACULATE here. The warm lighting, the Justin Hurwitz produced soundtrack (chef's kiss for that one), the perfect editing in synch with everything. Probably one of the best editing jobs I've ever seen. Fine, fine stuff.The psychological aspect of this film is pretty well-done. Quite straight-forward, but well-written overall. The way Fletcher just seizes power whenever he needs it, effortlessly and over anyone, is so uncomfortable to watch. He is the puppet master - no, the ringmaster - lashing his whip on the backs of his band, unaware or purposefully ignoring how it might end with a huge crash and broken people. J. K Simmons really does a fantastic job here.I can't say that I have big, bugging issues with Whiplash, but I will say this - this film is a case of being simple, yet effective. It doesn't draw me in emotionally completely, but it is sufficient in that aspect. It's not mind-blowing but it's a really, really solid movie.To conclude my short review: Whiplash is accessible, beautifully shot and edited, and totally a vibe. Its greatness lies in the smoothness of the music, the editing, the flow of the plot. It's a simple, straight-forward exploration of obsession that works really well because it's delivered so perfectly. I'm feeling an 8.3/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

It just seemed a bit boring and over the top.The kid was obviously driven, but it was not clear why he was so driven to be such a good drummer. What was his backstory? He seemed to be pretty well off, reasonable family life (divorced parents), well adjusted - but here he was playing drums like his life depended on it. Why was he prepared to cop so much abuse from his teacher?

"Powerful Drama, but Not Something Worth Recommending","Much has been written about Damien Chazelle's film with its powerful portrayal of a learner-educator relationship where the educator Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) goes to extreme lengths to establish mastery over his talented drummer learner Andrew (Miles Teller).In terms of dramatic effect, the film communicates extraordinary power through the use of close-ups that show Fletcher's intensity, which becomes so intense that we might expect that he has some kind of masochistic sexual attraction towards his learner. This might be true; but the director's attitude towards the material remains frustratingly ambivalent. Are we meant to view Fletcher's behavior with a critical eye as an example of what happens when an educator becomes jealous of the talent of his learners and vents his frustration through conscious sadism? Or does the director have a kind of perverse attraction towards his central character - which helped J. K. Simmons win an award for his performance?Whatever the rights and wrongs of the film's morality, I have to say that I found it offensive. Perhaps I am allowing too much of myself to permeate this review; but as someone involved in training educators of all disciplines, I think that the content offers a highly negative representation of educator power and how it can be so readily abused. Director Chazelle might defend his film using the famous Hitchcock dictum (""It's only a moooovie""), but the fact that it generated so much worldwide publicity attests to its power to generate viewer reaction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Very good,"Whiplash is the story of a young, talented drummer, Andrew, who enters a famous conservatory with a very demanding teacher. During the whole movie, we follow Andrew in his everyday life, where he has to train harder and harder to hope to be part of a concert ensemble. But his teacher is really obsessed by his idea to find the new Charlie Parker in one of his students, and is really tough with them.It's really interesting to follow the evolution of Andrew during the movie, and how the relationship with his teacher affects him. The teacher being violent, closed-minded and nervous changes Andrew's way of seeing his future. He sometimes feels that he can become one of the best drummers in the world, and sometimes that he is not good enough to be part of his teacher's band.This love-hate relationship is put forward by the fact that Andrew has a deep fascination for Terence, his teacher. He always wants to do his best but cannot always meet his teacher's requirements.The whole movie is just a portrait of how music at a high level can be difficult, and how students have to work to fulfill their dreams of becoming a great musician.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
(The Perfect Film),"I don't have many written reviews on this site: thousands of ratings , but no reviews. I'm starting to change this but it's going to start with the movies worth that kind of time. Whiplash is one of them. It is the perfect movie. It has a perfect script. The only movie that comes close is Back to the Future. Am I saying Whiplash and Back to the Future are the two best movies ever made? No. What I'm saying is that in terms of writing and pacing , it's really hard to find any flaws in how the story flows and how the character's interact. It moves at a pace that is extremely rapid and paranoid as you get piece by piece information on not just the protagonist's life but also the ""antagonist's"" if you want to call him that. It has twists and turns at the perfect times, and it ends on the highest note a film can end on. It's the kind of movie where everything fits perfectly , and for someone like me the satisfaction of that alone is too much for me to not admire. The ending scene is worth any price any streaming service or cinema is asking for. It is inspiring , it is intense , and it is art.

Incredible!,"This is a movie which I find to be among the most important.The way it portrays the want for success and the monster which pulls the protagonist further makes you question at which points the ends justify the means.The acting is stellar and compelling and I never felt a boring moment throughout all of it, and it's constant shocks leave you not knowing what could happen at any turn of the camera, leaving you glued to the screen.The way this movie shows itself makes you twist your perspective on it constantly, and you will find yourself constantly thinking about it and finding something new and enlightening which it tells you.Watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Can't stop thinking about this wonderful film,"Am writing this to try and stop thinking about this fantastic film. It won't leave my head after watching it yesterday from my sofa. Put it on as something to pass the time while I was doing the ironing, then had difficulty getting to sleep last night I was so caught up in it.The performances are wonderful. I find it hard to believe that the lead, Miles Teller is an 'actor', or that he has done other films - he inhabited the lead character to such a degree.One point other reviews I've read have not focused on is the portrayal of the relationship between the protagonist and his father (Paul Reiser). There are just a very few scenes, eating popcorn mostly, but that, and what we learn of their family, made the whole film so much more dramatic for me. The final hug was very powerful.So, characters - great. Acting - great. The plot also sizzles with some great twists. After they begin to come I had no idea where it was going, or where I wanted it to go. I had to stop the film at the climax, it was just too tense, and then came back to it the following evening.And it almost made me like jazz music.10 out of 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

And cherry on the top, if that was not enough, it says also that you must consider others at best as obstacles for your success.In short, to be a genious, it's not the 10% genious 90% work, it's 10% sociopath, 90% work.Cannot adhere to that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Great movie but a bit one dimensional,"So I finally watched Whiplash. It was really really good, J. K. Simmons was an absolute terror, well deserved Oscar win and the music was great as well. However I think the film would have benefited if it was a bit longer, the story is compelling but it never dwells enough on the pain of the protagonist. 107 minutes is a tad bit less if complex emotions are to be shown, in the immortal words of J.K. Simmons, it's rushing and not quite my tempo. Almost all films this season handled the drama aspect better than Whiplash, The Theory of Everything and Foxcatcher both showed the pain and moral dilemma better albeit both being inferior movies to Whiplash. At the same time Birdman and The Imitation Game not only showed better drama but in my opinion are better films because it just felt more appealing to a person of my age compared to Whiplash which seems to aim at younger college going audience, also it's a bit one dimensional even if that one dimension is excellent.

One of the best performances I've seen. The score is absolutely great (wouldn't excpect less from Justin Hurwitz) but what makes the movie amazing is the way Damien Chazelle directs it. It's just fantastic, and this and La La Land have so much in common. I love the close-ups, makes it all much more visually interesting and that paired with the camera movements creates so much emotion... Damien is a genius. The story is quite simple but you don't feel like it needs anything more, because everything is explored the way it should be and with just the right amount of tension.

It really is exceptional how he manages to be so utterly reprehensible Andy then likable and back again.

The actors in the two key roles are top notch; they bring out so many emotions as we oscillate from admiration to sympathy to repudiation to outright hatred. It's very emotional, very tense, and in the end one is not quite sure where we're left but it's a superb ride all the way. And the music: I'm not a jazz afficionado, but I loved it all.

A great film with a great sense,"WhiplashA lot of times I saw this film at the top of some movie recommendation lists. Finally, I decided to watch it, and, now, after watching it, I'm sure it's one of the most strong pictures I have ever seen.The cast is really impressive. Miles Teller acted a common guy who has a great dream, which is to become the greatest drummer. It's really difficult to share all the feelings and pain with a viewer, but Teller did it. When I was a kid, J. K. Simmons acted a newspaper company owner in Spider Man was my favorite supporting character and it happened again. Simmons starred a strict teacher who is the most demanding character I have never seen. Everything he wants is to find a musician who can go though problems and finally become the best.For the majority the plot is the most important aspect of a movie, and I agree with that, but there aren't a lot of films where its sense is more important than its plot. I tend to belong Whiplash to that type of films.The first half of the film was a bit boring. Nothing interesting was happening. But then I started empathize with the main hero. I felt everything he felt. It was really difficult way he chose, but, eventually, he made his dreams come true.While watching the film you think of some occasions that you had. You think of some people who were always rude and demanding to you, but after watching it you realize how wrong you was and how much they wanted to help you.Most successful people had been able to go though their problems and competitiveness, and that's exactly why they became those who they are now.Whiplash, a great film with a great sense.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"Outstanding performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, powerful direction and a tale of inspiration from the world of obsession","A new work of a young director, Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is a total blast of sweat from start to finish. It gives you a false sense of security as the film begins with a young finely talented student Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) plays the drums as he dreams to be the finest drum artist appreciated by others, of his new generations. Then, he comes across with a rather different type of a music instructor who will cause anything to realize a student's potential of music. As these two characters conflict on each other, most of the film progresses these events with very intense sequences that made my hands dripping with sweat.Whiplash can be diverse into a category of a dramatic film relating to the main topic of jazz music and a thriller film that never lets the audience take a deep breath of comfort throughout. The film illustrates perfectly of what every student might have feared the worst teacher who considers as enemies towards his/her's student, who will do literally commit anything to find his or her's potential. An instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons) is the exact type of professor that always challenges the student to a hole of death which they can never climb to breathe fresh air. While, the instructor being very relentless and brutally eager, he has a side of appreciation as he peels off layers of the student's potential. J.K. Simons portrayal and performance of this fearful relentless instructor is one to appreciate and gives a courageous and terrifying performance in which we as an audience, starts to be violated like as Andrew Neyman. In the other hand, a hard working inspiring student acted by Miles Teller, who has a true dream by heart is the one who meets Terence Fletcher as an instructor, and gets horribly treated, called with varieties of swearwords and psychologically tormented, is so heartbreaking and unbelievably touched. He gives a woody and thoughtful performance as he the protagonist gets forced to fall down to a hell and rise up facing a somewhat battle against Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons). It is so riveting of a process of how these personally opposite people clash with each other.This film is intense, inspiring and hand gripping from start to finish making it a brilliant praiseworthy filmmaker Damien Chazelle, one to look forward to and be inspired. Also, a riveting vehicle for stars J.K. Simons and Miles Teller, ones worth-ed to be complemented. This film has no sharp or outstanding flaws, making this one of the finest pieces of work of that time of period. This is definitely one of the best films of 2014. I knew nothing but a confessed drum artist, but glad that this film exists to illustrate these stories in an unconventional method.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Mildly entertaining with mind-blowing musical scenes.,"Now despite of what I'm going to say, I want to make it clear, that I don't think this is a bad movie at all. As usual, it's just the script, that fails to live up to it's premise and indie movie or not, Whiplash is being harshly overrated in my opinion.First of all, while J.K. Simmons' performance is highly enjoyable his character development is being entirely neglected throughout the movie, leaving me unable to comprehend his implied ambiguity at all. This is a major drawback, considering his motifs are a big part of the movie. Apparently I'm not the only one who noticed this, writer (and director) Damien Chazelle takes the cheap way out nevertheless and instead of giving Simmons some actual scenes to develop trough he just blatantly bashes in a monologue at the end trying to clarify the characters motifs. Chazelle instead puts all the focus on the character of Andrew Neyman and his rather trivial coming-of-age problems which are appropriate for an upper-middle class boy his age but nothing even in the ballpark of justifying a whole movie. He's studying music at an elite school and has to prioritize. His family doesn't quite get him. So what?The other thing being totally neglected is the chemistry between the two main characters. This might be understandable in context of the plot but in order for me to be able to connect with a relationship there first needs to be one. This unfortunately means Whiplash falls short on it's premise exactly where it matters, trying to be an underdog movie without a real underdog or a real mentor or real stakes making it impossible for the movie to live up to it's potential.These are just bad writing choices easily explained by simply not neglecting that Chazelle was the writer behind ""masterpieces"" like Grand Piano and The Last Exorcism Part II as well.Now while I feel the movie is being praised rather for what it could have been then for what it actually turned out to be I would still recommend it for most viewers. Teens and casuals probably won't be bothered by the shortcomings of the script and everyone is set to enjoy the musical scenes that are nothing short of amazing and fortunately receive major attention. The rest is kept together neatly by solid craftsmanship from everyone involved.All in all, Whiplash is mildly entertaining without any real lows and some amazing highs every time Andrew picks up those sticks.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Rythms of Obsessions and Intensity,"'Whiplash,' directed by Damien Chazelle, is a riveting exploration of ambition and obsession set against the backdrop of a competitive music conservatory. The film's narrative structure is as tight and precise as the drumbeats it revolves around. It follows Andrew Neiman, a young and ambitious jazz drummer, and his complex relationship with Terence Fletcher, an exacting and often brutal instructor. The pacing of the story mirrors the intensity of a drum solo, with moments of quiet tension exploding into frenetic energy.Thematically, 'Whiplash' delves deep into the psyche of artists, questioning the price of greatness. It's a relentless study of the drive for perfection, and how it can both create and destroy. The film doesn't shy away from showcasing the darker sides of relentless ambition and the psychological toll it takes on individuals.Technically, the film is a masterpiece. The editing is sharp, often cutting to the rhythm of the jazz score, which is a character in its own right. The cinematography expertly captures the sweat and blood of musical performance, making the viewer feel every beat and crash of Neiman's drums. Miles Teller's performance as Andrew is both vulnerable and ferocious, bringing a palpable intensity to the screen. J. K. Simmons, as Fletcher, is formidable and terrifying, delivering a performance that stays with you long after the film ends.Personally, the film struck a chord with its portrayal of the mentor-mentee relationship, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in the pursuit of greatness. The climax of the film is both a moment of triumph and a poignant commentary on the costs of achieving one's dreams.In conclusion, 'Whiplash' is a powerful and intense film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a story of passion, pain, and the thin line between genius and madness. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a film that challenges the viewer and leaves them pondering long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
The most intense thriller that's not technically a thriller.,"I wanted to kick back and relax tonight by watching three Damien Chazelle films back to back, because in my mind, they form a loose trilogy: Whiplash, La La Land, and Babylon. They all deal with the pursuit of making great art or achieving greatness, and how that clashes with various other things most people place importance on, to summarise the three as broadly as possible.I somehow forgot how stressful the first of these movies was, making it a difficult film to relax to. Even watching Whiplash for what I think is my fourth time does nothing to make it less stressful. Even Uncut Gems, which I've seen a few times now, has gotten a bit less intense with every rewatch. But Whiplash still makes me feel borderline light-headed for much of its runtime, and for that I really respect it. I also love how I still don't know entirely what I think of that excellent ending. The core conflict of the film is one I still think about often, and Whiplash not coming down hard one way or the other is the smartest things it does, at least thematically.Chazelle's later films are visually stronger and bolder, but Whiplash is just so wonderfully tight and free of even a second of filler. It's still a good-looking movie, but I feel like most of its visual flair comes from the editing, which is phenomenal, and heightens the intensity of the music, performances, and writing immensely. If Whiplash isn't a perfect movie, then it's so close it might well be. I love it immensely, even though it makes me nauseous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Crazed mentor meets obsessive pupil.,"Whiplash is one of the most powerful films that I have seen in a long time. The sheer emotion and power it is able to effectively convey is simply extraordinary. J. K Simmons Performance goes unrivalled by anyone else, and his character is just as well written as it is acted. Miles Teller is also great, and helps to amplify the chemistry between himself and Simmons. Director Damien Chazelle greatly captures the physical and mental toll that Fletcher's psychological 'torture' begins to show on Andrew, using a variety of film techniques. The brilliant writing is capable of capturing the true extent of Fletcher's evil humour, brilliance and his scarce humanity. Chazelle also demonstrates an exceptional ability to edit and direct the rapid paced and high tension segments of the film, which is able to effectively engage and relate the viewer to Andrew and Fletcher's dysfunctional and at times crazed relationship, maintaining the pacing and never inducing a disinterest or boredom. Also some great visual shots during the the high impact tension scenes, which help ground the audience during these sequences. Also, (to no surprise) no musical choices are phenomenal, from the funky stuff displayed throughout the performance scenes, to the eery and well placed sounds that help amplify an important or tense sequence. All of these significant pieces come together to form a truly well-realised Thriller that will keep you engaged from the opening credits. It may very well be the epitome of an 'edge of your seat' Thriller, one could even describe it as a masterpiece.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Fletcher's method is completely wrong,"This story mainly focuses on the relationship between a gifted music student, Andrew and his master, Fletcher. It turns out that this master uses an absolutely wrong method to deal with his students. Fletcher behaves more as a sergeant whose role in barracks is to form brute soldiers using violence, intimidation and humiliation, instead of behaving as an educator whose mission is to encourage his students to strive for excellence. I believe that values as love, friendship, solidarity, cooperation, team spirit, respect, stimulation of the self-confidence are more important to stimulate someone to focus on the search of excellence than threats and humiliating critics which undermine the self- confidence. Who is humiliated use to have one of these two reactions: he becomes traumatized and flees the challenges, or develops e great hatred against who has humiliated him. I believe much more in the approach of Andrzej Kijowski in the story The Orchestra Conductor, directed by Andrzei Wajda, where the conductor succeeds to improve the quality of the musicians of the orchestra that he conducts, by improving their self-confidence and not their hatred.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

One of the best films of the year.,"""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job."" Fletcher (J.K. Simmons)Fletcher and his uncompromising, ninja teaching methods do not include praise for pupils in Whiplash, or in any Marine squad facing a stolid drill instructor. This intense drama about a young drummer, Andrew (Miles Teller), who attends a Julliard-like music school, has the advantage of hyperbole—an abusive coach who coaxes performance beyond expectations by verbally and physically pushing his studio band to reach the best they can do.Because Teller was already a drummer before he took this part, the many shots of him drumming at a furious pace as he pursues Buddy Rich's ghost have a real feel, the bloody hands remotely suggesting a Christ-like devotion to perfection. The sacrifices demanded by Fletcher rise above the trite into a moving commentary on the challenges necessary to become great, not just in music but in life itself.When the driven Andrew must cut loose his girlfriend because he sees she'll distract him from his goal of becoming the best drummer, it is apparent that bloody hands and wounded hearts will be the constant companions in the pursuit of greatness.Writer/director Damien Chazelle and DP Charone Meir cut frequently to Andrew's blazing, bloody drummer hands to show the painful grandeur of excellence. We are only too aware that few humans are capable of such extreme passion.The core of Whiplash is the conflict between gentle nurturing (a popular learning philosophy over the last few decades) and the coaching that brooks no weakness, never admits greatness, and sometimes produces a Charlie Parker. Or Max Roach. Or Buddy Rich the apparent inspiration of Andrew's ambition. The film is dominated by Fletcher's take-no-prisoners method whereby he pushes to get performances beyond expectations.Both Simmons as the musical DI and Teller as the ambitious young musician should get Oscar nominations.

The movie is original and very intense from beginning to end. The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it's J. K. Simmons nasty methods that is impressive. The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short for some unknown reason but it's very entertaining and it got the recognition that it deserved. If you're not into drumming or jazz music, the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection.

It is the wonder of low budget filmmaking,"Whiplash (2014) - (MA)
TONY SAAD - MONDAY, 12 JULY 2019STAR - STAR - STAR - STARMusic is a key to a memorable satisfying film, and Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is no exception. The energy of double-time swing, and the spontaneity of drum solos really reflect the nature of this film. It is ruthless, and at times painful to watch. The inspiration, and the reality of it all is a testament to how music really shapes our lives even in the slightest of ways. At its simplest, Whiplash is more inspirational than a raging AFL team on a hot Australian summer day.Whiplash follows the story of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a budding drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He strives to become a world-class drummer like Buddy Rich. The Conservatory is conducted by Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), who will do just about anything to push his students beyond their potential.This film is all about music and musicians. Andrew joins the Shaffer Conservatory with the hopes to become a professional drummer. His passion directly impacts his relationship with his friends and family. I think Andrew is one of the most dedicated protagonists out there. His story alludes to those of many Jazz artists including Charlie 'Bird' Parker and Hank Levy. But he is not entirely innocent; his relationship with Terence is causing his fall among his friends and family.This film is also one of the tensest non-horror films I've seen recently. Chazelle took inspiration from old thrillers in developing the story, which was evident in the conflicting emotions of the characters. A Thriller is not a horror film! It is the genre in which no character is innocent i.e. they all engage in abuse of law (Murder, theft, cheating, you name it) and they have got few -if any- allies in their quests. For example, Neiman is our hero, but he intentionally distances himself from his family and breaks up with his girlfriend to work on his drumming. Fletcher is pushing his students very far, but becomes very violent whenever he has a fit. And as a result, his relationship with his students is very toxic. Throughout the film, you cannot help but be on your nerves all the time, because Whiplash is just plain aggressive. It's as if it is forcing us to keep watching in anticipation of what may happen next; who will hurt whom? What will cause the fall of our protagonist?Of course, the highlight of this film is the music. Whiplash is not an ordinary musical -the characters do not burst into song all the time-. The songs are sourced from famous Jazz artists like Hank Levy, and composed by Justin Hurwitz. I just wish I could watch the Shaffer Conservatory play the OST in front of me, or even better, me playing the drums with Neiman. My favourite pieces were Caravan and Too Hip to Retire, because I could not stop air drumming after having seen tis film.The film showcases the beauty of music better than The Greatest Showman. While the latter is grandiose and spectacular, it feels like a series of music videos sewn together. Whiplash is better than that. In fact, it is the wonder of low budget filmmaking. Even if it was a series of music videos, it's a lot more entertaining than The Greatest Showman. Through Andrew and Terrence's relationship, Whiplash pays homage to jazz and its artists beautifully. It is also an inspirational story of how a little bit of determination and commitment can make all the difference in the toughest of times.© Whiplash Film Review, 2019.

"Up-and-coming jazz drummer aspires to be ""one of the greats"" and the only way he can get there is through a brilliant but harsh instructor","Whiplash.While definitely being a movie that hid in the shadows for quite a while, Whiplash is an excellent film that grabs hold of your attention and doesn't let go until you've left the theater thirsty for more! JK Simmons performance is incredible as he portrays a bully that is too brilliant for his own well-being, while Miles Teller portrays an up-and-coming jazz drummer that doesn't see his own potential until his anger forces it out. Both are great actors that do this film justice and give the audience an exhilarating roller coaster ride of emotions. There are few movies that inspire me to follow in the characters footsteps, but surprisingly after this film I had wished that I could play in such a way as Miles Teller performed..

And even more so for people who *really* like movies because this is a masterclass. The directing is phenomenal, the acting is out of this world. The pacing... I got lost in this, I was fully sucked in, I didn't want it to end.Acting, all awards deserved and not enough given because what Teller and Simmons do, but especially Teller, is massive. Simmons had the presence and owned every second he was in, but Teller was the one you matched with, and were inside his thinking.The way the story is told, the twists and turns, the decisions, the plays. Exceptional. Makes me even more excited to watch La La Land. Also the moral ambiguity, I could see discussions arise, the movie does choose a path to follow, but personally it presents a painful aspect of performative arts, and the toll it takes. It's positives and negatives, it's up to your own morals and ethics to decide which is right.

Very Steady Film,"I'd like to start by saying I love Miles Teller, I'm also a fan of JK Simmons. I thought this movie was actually one of the best, if not the best performance by Simmons. Absolutely electrifying delivery of every scene, every piece of dialogue, every bodily and facial gesture! I think as film viewers we're typically used to several settings and a variety of locations, this movie is 70% filmed in the music room. I think this is why I only gave the movie an 8, because I'm so used to movies where theres 20-50 settings/scenes throughout the movie. This is not the type of behaviour I want to adopt, but unfortunately this is the mainstream mindset and I've become susceptible to it. However, I did think because of this circumstance, it provided a level of originality and uniqueness. It balances itself with all variables considered, I'm just leaning towards a rating of 8.P. S that final 10 minutes absolutely star struck me, I really thought there was going to be some civility between the two, but then again we see a wicked backstab (if you know, you know).Anyway well done directors and team, although I'm late to the party, nice to get a taste of a new type of genre or idea.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Enjoyable film as many microcosmic films are--a glimpse into an insular, eclectic world. BUT.....the last scene of the movie stretches credulity too far. There is no way this could happen in a prestigious jazz setting. Yea, it gets the message across that the student finally finds his voice in defiance of his teacher who acknowledges it, but how? By letting the young music student take over the proceedings completely. Fun to watch but no setting such as this would ever see something like this happen. It was almost laughable. Can give this film a six but man, I'm a musician, a drummer, and no way could any musician swallow the crescendo of the music and the movie itself without forcing down a gag.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

It's utterly ridiculous cr** and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying. What a disgrace.In addition, we found the story so predictable - it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music, except Rocky had heart, soul and a relatable endearing underdog story.

"Blood, Sweat and Tears: the Dark Side of Perfection and Abusive Student-Teacher Relationships","Whiplash is a phenomenal movie that's beautifully filmed with precision and style. A masterfully written story so tightly done that the movie goes by in the blink of an eye. With outstanding and unforgettable performances by J. K. Simmons and Miles Teller, this movie is a must-watch. This is without a doubt one of the best movies about musical passion, ambition, perfection and what it takes to become the best and reach your full potential. It's also a movie about the human condition and how flawed we can be as a species, but also how amazing our potential is when we set our minds to something we truly and utterly believe in. An inspiring movie that's equal parts intense, funny, exciting and captivating. Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece. There is nothing wrong with it and it is perfection.A very gripping character study that mainly focuses on two people that are flawed each in their own way. One of course being more flawed than the other - Fletcher being way more f'ed up than Andrew. Fletcher feeds his ego and his void by controlling and psychologically abusing, tormenting and manipulating his students. He's basically a power-hungry psychopathic narcissistic monster. Andrew on the other hand opens himself up to the abuse that Fletcher inflicts on him and he lets it happen because he values success, ambition and perfection above anything else - something that both Fletcher and Andrew strive for. It's because of this shared strive for perfection that Andrew is willing to put everything on the line, even if it affects his mental/physical health, his social life or even causes near death experiences. He strives to be the best while also seeking Fletcher's approval. Andrew's upbringing caused him to be flawed as well. We see it during the family dinner scene where it's evident that he was raised in an environment of toxic competitive people.This movie takes a somewhat exaggerated and cynical look at the dark side of teacher-student relationships. Fletcher was the sensei from hell but it was also what Andrew needed in order to become great. If Fletcher hadn't pushed Andrew to the lengths he did, he probably would've never reached his full potential. Each hardship that Andrew faced was a new lesson learned, a lesson that could be used and adapted not only in music but also in the real world. But the way in which these lessons were taught by Fletcher pushed Andrew into an unhealthy psychological and physical state. Andrew would then take out all his anger, self-hatred, frustration and doubts on the drum set. We would see this when he practiced at home and played until his hands and fingers were all ripped open and bleeding. It's a pretty dark look at abusive relationships and the dark side of the strive for perfection. It's also a very illuminating and insightful look at the human psyche and what we might be capable of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

It was so intense that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen,"""Whiplash"" is a tale that speaks about perseverance, a story that presents itself as an innate character study of those passionate personalities around us who crave nothing but perfection in their craft. They stop at nothing in their pursuit of excellence, even if it costs them a part of the lives or their life in itself!We only see the brilliance on stage or on-screen, often overlooking the involved artists and their countless sacrifices, discrediting the slew of sleepless nights, ignorant to their misery and their disturbed conscience.Damien Chazelle's ""Whiplash"" encapsulates all that and some more. It pays tribute to all aspiring and established artists alike, the film acknowledges and gives recognition to all those individuals who duly deserve their due respect, and I admire Chazelle for that.What a fantastic film, supported by two of the greatest roles ever enacted. Both Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons have done marvellous, especially the latter one, who was a force to be reckoned with! No wonder he had won an academy award for his part; he earned it.P. S. I do not have academic knowledge about Music, nor do I have any background in playing any of the instruments shown here. But I'm an avid listener, and I tend to admire Music in every form and shape. And I have to say, that last piece was something special; I was speechless!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Stunning performance from Simmons and Teller,"As an amateur drummer, I felt pretty connected to this movie, but it's of course a double-edged sword seeing as I was looking for any kind of slip-ups in jargon or Teller's drumming. The cross-editing of his playing was incredible and deserved every ounce of praise it got, but I learned that he was really playing in the movie and for that I applaud him greatly. On a similar note, Simmons' performance was nothing short of astounding and when he's screaming his head off in the film it really feels like he's screaming at you. The film was also very engaging for me as I found myself getting furious, excited, and even genuinely worried at times. Overall, great film with not a flatly-traited character in sight!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
The perfect portrayal of obsession,"The music -jazz- chosen was amazing and beautiful. The chase to be perfect, and the push of human physical limits. With the drummer, Andrew, Whiplash is able to portray the perfectionist side of human nature -musically for this particular movie- where nothing is enough. ""Not quite my tempo"" is probably the most memorable sentence in the movie, every single repetition -which sounds the same for those of us who can't really notice the difference between that slight dragging or rushing thing- shows us this chase for perfection. And Fletcher, our enemy, as well as our inspiration, shows us this pushing the limits side. I guess for most of the movie we all hated him, I mean who really likes to be yelled at? And we end up getting annoyed when he doesn't settle for what Andrew just played: we just want him to tell him ""Good job, keep going and next time try to do better"". But it's exactly because he didn't do that, because he kept pushing his limits -sometimes way too much, I've got to admit-, that Andrew became better, great even. Because those bounds were pushed, trespassed, Andrew was able to reach that limit, his highest point. When we push our limits, when we practice, when we get out of our comfort zones, we are able to be the highest version of ourselves: the one who keeps getting better every single day, the one who reaches success and fulfilment. Anyways this movie was perfect in many ways: not only the acting and music, but also the way it was directed and filmed. Every shot was perfectly executed and every single camera movement and placement was able to produce the exact feelings it wanted to capture. So yeah Id give it a 9/10 just because it's not my favourite movie of all time, but perhaps in a future, where I know more about music, cinematography, and acting, where I'll be able to relate more, I'll rewatch it and maybe give it a 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"A Taut, Intense Exploration of Obsession and Ambition","*Whiplash* (2014), directed by Damien Chazelle, is a riveting psychological drama that explores the dark side of ambition, artistry, and the drive for perfection. The film follows Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a talented young jazz drummer at a prestigious music conservatory, who becomes embroiled in a toxic and abusive mentorship with Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a fearsome and ruthless conductor. Fletcher's teaching methods push Andrew to the brink, creating an intense, high-stakes battle of wills between teacher and student.At the heart of *Whiplash* are the mesmerizing performances by Teller and Simmons. Teller embodies Andrew's obsessive pursuit of greatness, delivering a physically and emotionally raw performance as his character endures both psychological torment and physical punishment in his quest to become a legendary drummer. J. K. Simmons' portrayal of Fletcher is commanding and terrifying, blending charisma with cruelty in a performance that earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Fletcher's relentless pursuit of perfection pushes his students beyond their limits, blurring the line between mentor and monster.The film's pacing is relentless, much like Fletcher's teaching style, and the intense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere is amplified by its stunning editing and visceral jazz score. The music scenes, particularly the intense drumming sequences, are electrifying and shot with precision, bringing viewers into the physicality and emotional turmoil of Andrew's journey.*Whiplash* tackles complex themes, including the cost of greatness, the destructive nature of obsession, and the sacrifices artists make in the pursuit of perfection. It poses thought-provoking questions about the limits of mentorship and whether the end justifies the means when pushing someone to achieve greatness. The film's final act, which culminates in an unforgettable musical performance, leaves the audience with an ambiguous and powerful resolution to the conflict between Andrew and Fletcher.While the film is widely praised for its intensity and craftsmanship, some critics argue that its message about success through suffering is troubling, as it seems to condone the abusive methods employed by Fletcher. However, this moral ambiguity is part of what makes *Whiplash* such a compelling and thought-provoking experience.Overall, *Whiplash* is a masterclass in tension, performance, and storytelling, offering a visceral look at the cost of pursuing artistic greatness. It's a film that will leave viewers emotionally drained and deeply reflective on the nature of ambition and success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

A movie for those who are both ambitious and fragile,"This movie resonated with me in ways which I didn't expect. It starts as a black and white, day and night level of contrast in characters but story becomes the melting pot and fills in the gaps, answers the questions in your mind with an indirect manner while displaying the gray areas in life. The movie touches multiple aspects of human life (family, love and career) and feels relatable to those who sought greatness with ambition and greed. The destructive path that lies ahead is painted by the movie and how much the process might affect you. It shows a love and hate relationship between a mentor and student.

thrilling but scary,"What a wonderful and thrilling but scary film it is. When I watched this as soon as it started I realised that I didn't know what type of music it was and just assumed that it was rock.

All schools can be splendid and cruel and there are always teachers that can be a little sadistic. With learning ballet or gymnastics, piano or athletics there are some people who love it and then there are some who need it and then there are teachers as with this one they need it and seem to go crazy With this it is drumming and I wouldn't have thought it could be so amazing, but it is.

This Movie Makes Me Really Want to Start Getting Into Jazz,"""The two most dangerous words in the English language are 'good job'""Whiplash is an amazing movie. Straight up. It is about Miles Teller's character who is a drummer in a very good school, who has the opportunity to be in this Studio Band taught by J. K. Simmons.Now, I know it doesn't sound all that interesting and to be honest it isn't exactly a fast paced film. But, Whiplash is the type of film that entices you by its use of psychology, dialogue, and characters. Whiplash is a great example of some of the best character development in film I've seen in awhile.Whiplash also definitely has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. The score in this film is absolutely amazing, and when I first saw this when I was 14 it really got me to start listening to jazz. The music and how it's used in this film is phenomenal. The psychological aspect behind it I also find fascinating in how Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons are combating psychologically through there use of music. (That ending scene).J. K. Simmons gives an Oscar worthy performance and Miles Teller gives his best performance to date tbh, but he's got a lot ahead of him. J. K. Simmons though, he really blows it away with a really amazing, intense performance. He might be the best part of the movie tbh. I also kind of agreed with some of his reasoning behind why he was so aggressive, but he def took it too far.The scenes with J. K. Simmons ripping Miles Teller apart are so intense and not only really shows how great of actors these two are, but also how great the screenwriting was for this film.Overall, Whiplash is a great film. The screenwriting, characters, acting, and the score are all absolutely amazing. It's dramatic and very tense and anxiety inducing. It was also beautifully filmed. There were a few times I was really biting my nails rooting for Miles Teller. While also loving the performance J. K. Simmons was giving. But, there's no sugar coating it; there's really no flaws with this film. The performances are Oscar worthy and that ending is one of my favorite endings of all time. I highly recommend everyone checks out this film. Especially if your a fan of music. You'll definitely appreciate jazz and the orchestra more than you already should.One of my favorite films of 2014.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A film about bullying.,"I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews. I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"". Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: ""A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential."" This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily ""overcome"" or ""harden up"" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated – completely satisfied – after watching films like Oldboy, and Sympathy for Mr & Lady Vengeance. Whiplash left me feeling disgusted, wondering about what kind of people made it, watched it, and enjoyed it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"Good job, Fletcher. Hats off to J.K. Simmons.","Damien Chizelle's Whiplash is his taken on the world of jazz music. Andrew Neiman is a jazz drummer wanting to make it big and live up to the legacy of his idol Buddy Rich. He joins Shaffer conservatory studio band to train under Terence Fletcher. Andrew joins as a replacement drummer but soon finds out Fletcher's strict ways of teaching and how he treats the students. Still, Andrew dedicates himself to earn Fletcher's approval, giving up everything including his personal life for the sake of his music. What is the cost Andrew has to pay before he truly realizes, Fletcher's way isn't the right way, forms rest of the story.I regret taking a decade to watch this classic and I was speechless by the end of it. J. K. Simmons truly shines in his role of Fletcher and his performance is something which doesn't miss a beat. I could watch this over and over again just for the climax alone. Damien once again is in full control in showcasing how Fletcher's influence gets Andrew to be completely self centered. His jealousy, be it with his colleagues or with his own family and his attempt to he single minded to achieve his goal was perfectly executed.

THE BEAUTY OF WIPLASH,"""Whiplash"" is a movie that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer with its intensity, passion and drama. Directed by Damien Chazelle, the film follows the story of a young drummer named Andrew (Miles Teller) who dreams of becoming the best jazz drummer in the world. However, he soon discovers that achieving his dream is not going to be easy when he comes face to face with the ruthless and abusive conductor of the school jazz band, Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons).J. K. Simmons' performance as Fletcher is one of the highlights of the movie. He portrays the character with a ferocity that is both terrifying and captivating. The way he pushes Andrew to the brink and beyond, in his quest for perfection, is a sight to behold. Miles Teller also delivers a brilliant performance as Andrew, perfectly capturing the pain and struggle of a young musician striving to make it big.The film's editing and cinematography are also worth noting. The rapid editing and tight close-ups during the drumming scenes create a sense of urgency and tension that leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat. The use of dark, muted colors throughout the film gives it a somber and brooding atmosphere that perfectly matches the film's themes.The story is compelling, intense, and thought-provoking. It raises questions about the nature of art, the sacrifices that must be made to achieve greatness, and the human cost of ambition. The film's final scene is both thrilling and emotionally satisfying, delivering a powerful message about the value of perseverance and the rewards of hard work.In conclusion, ""Whiplash"" is a movie that is not to be missed. It is a cinematic masterpiece that combines stunning performances, gripping storytelling, and brilliant filmmaking to create a truly unforgettable experience. If you are a fan of music, drama, or simply great movies, ""Whiplash"" is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Music is never a competition.,"The main argument of this film is that music is like a sport. You have to put yourself to the limit to be a top player. And this is not true for music. Music is all about feeling and soul and touch audience with the performance, not to be able to play at 400 BPM. Being a musician is an inner path to lead to a self discover. Virtuousness come with the practice and talent, but not being assaulted physical and emotionally. Music is an art, not a competition, so is subject to be interpreted in many ways, so being a best musician is not matter of math or time clock. Jazz is a language, not a race.

Excellent,"The demand for musical (jazz) excellence is melted with the extreme relationship between the student and the teacher. In this movie we are confronted with a situation between the will of the student to become an all time GREAT musician, ready to do everything for it, and the teacher who wants to discover the new Charlie Parker.The great part about this movie is the psychological relationship between the student and the teacher, extreme and violent. It appears that the teacher seems sick-minded about his class, threatening the students not to bring his reputation down. You sometimes wonder how a student can accept this but it also seems like all the students admire him and especially Andrew (the student), and his ambition to be the very best makes him forget all the things Terrence Fletcher (the teacher) is inflicting on him.The performances of the 2 lead actors J.K Simmons and Miles Teller are really special, a great psychological battle between theses two. We can really feel the tension and the ambition of each character in this movie. And, the realization allows us to see all the pain Andrew goes through.In a more general way this movie puts in perspective the extreme demands and standards of the highest music schools and all the psychological pressure that theses youngsters have to deal with. Is it normal to allow this or does the path the greatness require this?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"Feverish and Original, Whiplash excels","Whiplash is an ingenious clash between jazz and psychology, bringing with it a resounding tale of terror, music, and insanity that resolves itself so perfectly, viewers will be truly speechless at the end of the film. The film depicts Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young drumming student at the fictional, yet very prestigious Schaffer Conservatory. A teacher at the school, Terrence Fletcher, finds Andrew and adopts him into his band where he proceeds to harass, verbally as well as physically abuse and push Andrew to his absolute limit. The dynamic of the two characters is riveting: A young, yet highly ambitious (he dumps Melissa Benoist to pursue drumming. I mean, you have to be ambitious to dump Melissa Benoist) student attempting to impress his seemingly unimpressible teacher who pushes and pushes Andrew inevitably to his breaking point. Damien Chazelle crafts Andrew's practice scenes exquisitely, often tuning cuts between shots to drum beats hammered out by the sweaty, bloody, and often exhausted Andrew as he wrenches his face and pounds away (once even punching a hole in snare drum out of sheer frustration) at a dilapidated old drum set. Andrew becomes cold, reckless, and violent in his pursuit of ""greatness"" while all this is encouraged by his teacher, pulling him deeper and deeper into an inescapable, sinister, and hopeless rabbit hole.I believe that the only issue with this film is its occasional lack of loyalty to a certain subject. At certain times it seems to jump between the central theme of jazz and the central theme of ambition, creating a sort of cinematic identity crisis. However, this is quite easy to overlook.But still. Watch it for the jazz. Watch it for the excellent performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Watch it for the unrelenting depiction of human ambition and what it can lead one into. Or watch it for Melissa Benoist.Whiplash is truly an excellent film with a mind-blowingly awesome ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"""Whiplash"" is exceptional filmmaking, but is just about one minute too long.","What price success? That's basically the question asked in ""Whiplash"" (R, 1:47). Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal? How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential? When does motivation become abuse? We've probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything, or had a parent, a coach, a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it. Well, what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation? Can we expect the result to be excellence – or tragedy – or both? Miles Teller plays Andrew Neimann, a freshman at an extremely prestigious (but fictional) music school in New York City, called the Shaffer Conservatory. Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great, but to be one of THE greats. His only friend is the single father (Paul Reiser) who raised him. He doesn't have friends or girlfriends. He needs to be free to focus on his music. He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer's most demanding professor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who picks Andrew for the school's very exclusive Studio Band. Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987's ""Full Metal Jacket"" look like a purring kitten. Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood, sweat and tears, but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor. Fletcher regularly abuses all his students – emotionally and even physically – especially Andrew. It's Fletcher's idea of motivation. He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness, and greatness is what Andrew covets, but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial. It's toxic. And combustible. As the tension builds, Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher – if Fletcher doesn't destroy him in the process. It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps. Inevitable.Besides asking some very important questions, ""Whiplash"" gets credit for excellent execution – mostly. First of all, the acting is terrific. Simmons deserves all the awards he has won for the role and one wonders why Teller wasn't nominated for any awards. The film's cinematography and editing really add to the on screen tension and the music is so much a part of the story-telling that it's practically a character unto itself. This film will probably do more for jazz than any film since ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999). The only real problem I had with this film is the ending. What seems to be a strong narrative thread, a consistent message and a uniform tone (all thanks to writer-director Damien Chazelle, who based the characters on his experiences as a music student) gets off track in the film's final scene. This movie is simply 30-60 seconds too long. Except for that, this is a very artistically intense film and deserves a look – and more than a passing thought about the questions it raises.

"Simplistic, Predictable... Well Acted, Good Music","It's not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey, but it's just about as simplistic. There are two characters, plus a couple of others are hinted (at with several seconds of screen time).I loved the music. The acting was good, but the roles were not especially nuanced.The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film, you know Andrew's goal: to be an elite drummer. Great. You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk (or worse) and is going to ""challenge"" Andrew. So, for the rest of the movie, all we have to wonder about is whether he'll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer, or whether he'll give up.It kept my attention, but I would never watch this movie a second time. There just wasn't enough substance to it. There was no nuance. There was nothing more to think about.The pseudo-philosophical, pop-psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty.There are some shades of side-story. There's a paper-thin character of a girlfriend. She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal, but since Andrew isn't likable at all, I didn't really care if he ended up with her.Anyway, the movie wasn't really a 1 star...

"Yes, excellent but...","This movie could give us a dangerous idea of the ""cost of greatness"", and I have trouble with it. As a psychologist, and like everyone I suppose, it's obvious how dangerous these kinds of obsessions can be: anxiety, stress, depression, severe mental disorders in general that can conduct to cardiac arrests, illnesses, deadly diseases, and suicides, to all that it joins a flood of collateral damage with third parties (relatives, friends, couples, children, etc.)
After everything Fletcher did to Andrew throughout the entire film, Whiplash ends giving us the idea that perfection (obsessions) can be reached by human beings, which is stupid because this only exists as an ideal. It makes us believe that through ""hard work"" and immeasurable demands, a musician can become ""successful"". Maybe with these ideas the film could also give us some kind of justification for Fletcher's behavior with his students.Whiplash is an excellent movie: cinematography, acting, music, and many other things were magnificent. But I like to think that this film wasn't created just to try to inspire people to highlight in an, increasingly, competitive and individualistic world.
Instead, I want to believe that it was made to warn people of how dangerous can be this ""way to success"", the cost of it, and its several consequences. To incentivize mental (and physical) health care above anything else must be a priority for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Drum roll please,"Whiplash sat on my hard drive for a while longer than most. There was no real reason for this. I was aware that J. K. Simmons had claimed his Oscar and that the film was well regarded on release. Sometimes films have to age like a wine and your palette needs to be ready.The continuity announcer - this was taken from a terrestrial channel - indicated the word bullying and my wife almost exited the room. The one failing of watching a film at home, you do tend to lose your film buddy much easier than if they're 'trapped' in a cinema seat.This is a good film. I've given an 8. So possibly I should be saying excellent. But I think 8 is sufficient and good likewise.If you like drum solos and you enjoy jazz you will enjoy the soundtrack. Miles Teller plays Andrew a budding drummer who come s up against J. K Simmons as a sometimes mentor sometimes bully. But the latter is subjective. Simmons, as Fletcher the head of the Shaffer Conservatory of Music, seeks the best, not just from Andrew but from all of those who play in his jazz bands. There are other moments in the film that confirm that Andrew is not Fletcher's only target where perfection is concerned including one moment which forms the foundations for the film's conclusion.This is a great two hander with solid support from a cast who are probably better known for the TV work and some smart editing from Tom Cross who also picked up an Oscar.Whiplash has its visceral moments but overall it is a worthwhile experience and one that is likely to hold up well as the years pass.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"A ""Music Movie"" that manages to get everything about music completely wrong.","As a professional musician of 20 years, I would like to say a little something about this movie and it's odd ""message"". (or lack thereof...)Becoming a great musician takes years and years of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. However, the real process, in real life, looks NOTHING like this movie. The idea that a mentally unstable, psychotically aggressive and (perhaps worst of all) completely INCONSISTENT teacher/mentor like the Fletcher character would be of any actual use to an aspiring musician is pure garbage. It might make for great ""drama"", but it does not reflect how things work in the real world at all.What saddens me is the thought that young aspiring musicians might watch this drivel and think it's an accurate portrayal of what it is to be a ""great"" musician and what you have to do to achieve that greatness. Or even worse, that some aspiring teacher might watch this and be ""inspired"" to follow Fletcher's method of ""teaching by terror"" because of the results it achieves in the movie.In reality ""Fletcher's method"" is flawed. It will not create ""a new Charlie Parker"". It will, in fact, not create any new ""great jazz artists"" at all. With a little luck, it might produce a few semi-useful second row puppets, but that's about it.

A gripping tale of obsession and ambition,"""Whiplash"" is a powerful drama that delves into the intense and often brutal world of competitive music. Directed by Damien Chazelle, the film follows the story of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a young and ambitious jazz drummer studying at a prestigious music conservatory. His life takes a dramatic turn when he is mentored by the ruthless and demanding conductor Terence Fletcher (J. K.

Simmons masterfully balances the character's tyrannical methods with moments of vulnerability, making Fletcher both terrifying and compelling. Teller's performance as Andrew is equally impressive, capturing the character's transformation from an eager student to an obsessive perfectionist.""Whiplash"" excels in building tension, not just through its intense character dynamics but also through its phenomenal soundtrack and exhilarating drum sequences.

As symbolic as it is chaotic,"The 2010s had some offbeat, high-brow dramedies that blurred the lines between insult humor and serious subjects. Perhaps one of the better examples of this is Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash,' which follows the story of a love-hate relationship between a rising drummer prodigy and an elite a-hole jazz band conductor.At its core, 'Whiplash' is intended to show how similar these two characters are to each other, despite the fact that neither appears to identify with the other at the surface level. The incredible acting between Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons makes the film what it is; it's hard to imagine another duo trying to recreate this to the same success. But it's not just the ferocity of their performances that make 'Whiplash' stand out - the symbolism (not cymbalism) and imagery that is woven into the fiber of the film make it louder than any crescendo you can imagine.It's quite possible 'Whiplash' couldn't have been made in this era, so it's important to appreciate the film for what it is - an electrifying coming-of-age story that shows how passion and grit can make the most beautiful music.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

I've never been sucked in to a movie like this. There were points that I just stopped breathing and was sweating so much because for me it really feels like you're in the movie. Because at one side you're thinking that Andrew has to just run out of this music world because he's been treating so badly and pushing his self to limits that aren't healthy anymore. But on the other side you really really hope that Andrew makes in to the music world beca you can see how badly he wants it.

"Good, then not so.","For most of the of the runtime it's a very good movie, well executed, but wraps up bringing about a sensation like a dull version of a Black Mirror episode (minus the science fiction of course). The two main antagonists end up looking entrapped with each other in an unexciting, sort of mechanical way.I'd praise mainly the portrayal of drum playing as action scenes, sometimes like duels, with even a war-like scene once when the guy enters the rehearsals room bleeding and injured after a car crash (however you wanna feel about that).Yes, it could have had him connected to a blood IV line whenever he practices, yes it could have had him wearing lead bracelets as well but here's not like that;

It's hard to turn away from the on screen drama, but it's not always easy to watch. As a non-musician I can't really relate to the discipline maintained and the pain that the chief protagonist is willing to go through, but it is no less believable. The mentor / teacher is a at once a beast and a proponent of tough love. My only frustration is that there is no redemption, no justice, no perspective....at least none that my value system can recognise. There is only continuance of obsession, from one generation to the next. So a little unsatisfying, but well worth the time spent nonetheless. Exhausting...",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

No Jazz for Me,"I love music but surely I'm not into the hip blues jazzy scene which I imagine the other 95% of the population is not either. So I decided to give this a go because I am into movies and I try to watch them all. JK Simmons is absolutely without a doubt worthy of his OSCAR, you can not keep your eyes off him. He is mean, obnoxious, passionate, tough, and definitely loves his craft. It's kinda watching Michael Jordan play basketball, you know how to do everything he does, but you don't have the TALENT to accomplish it, so you critique every move and especially the mistakes. In other words you know HOW to do it, except you don't know HOW he does it which creates petty animosity. It brings you back to the realization if you had HIS talent you would've been better than the original.

A Brutal Character,"A previous reviewer mention Full Metal Jacket, the Kubrick film about the vicious Drill Sergeant who dehumanizes his men, but one of those men in particular. However, in that movie, the young Marine probably had no business being where he was. Here, a young man wants to be a drummer who will be remembered, like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich. He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher (Academy Award winner J. K. Simmons). His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers. People know he's the best there is, but what a price to pay. He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker's head. While this is good entertainment, if we were to look into the successes of many great performers, most of them were never terrorized. The drumwork is astounding, but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched. Ask some drummers you know. The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window. Still, if you buy into the possibility that such a psychotic can command these musicians, it's very entertaining. The drumming is beyond belief, although I'm sure there were some strategic cuts along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"A remarkable mix of ""Full metal jacket"" and ""Black swan""","""Whiplash"" is about the relationship between a young drummer (Andrew played by Miles Teller) and a dictatorial instructor (Fletcher played by J.K. Simmons) at a New York music academy.The dictatorial instructor acts (and talks) very much like sergeant Hartman in ""Full metal jacket"" (1987, Stanley Kubrick). However, the victim of sergeant Hartman is the wimp of the group, who is lagging behind by each excercise. The victim of instructor Fletcher is an (over)ambitious student. For this student Fletcher is not only a bully but also an idol. A complex relationship of attract and repel arises. This relationship is more in line with ""Black swan"" (2010, Darren Aronofsky) than with ""Full metal jacket"".""Whiplash"" can be seen from different perspectives.Andrew faces the choice between ambition and social life. He chooses for his ambition, sacrificing his girl friend to his drum kit.Instructor Fletcher has to decide how demanding he has to be with respect to his students. He decides to be very demanding. In his eyes: ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"""". To utilize the full potential of that one talented student he does not shy away from burning down the many average students.In my opinion one very revealing scene is when Andrew is back home. The moderate succes of his nephew in American Football is higher rated than the succes of Andrew in one of the most demanding music academy's of the country, something that made me think of ""October sky"" (1999, Joe Johnston). After that, there is a conversation a the dinner table. This conversation centers around the question what is the essence of success, is it money or is it fame? Andrew has a pronounced opinion about this question. Referring to Charlie Parker he says: ""I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was."".""Whiplash"" is a multifaceted film. J.K. Simmons plays Fletcher in a very convincing style and he got an Oscar for this role. However convincing he was played, the character of Fletcher is not very plausible. His behaviour mavbe accepted in the army, a music academy is a very different world (I hope).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

If you are going to watch with an expectation to learn or know more or to understand jazz music, stay away, please. Except for few mentions of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Buddy Rich and a few more, this film has not got any jazz.

an excellent movie,"## Whiplash TV Series Review""Whiplash"" is a series about the competitive and intense atmosphere of the music world. This production, which will be familiar to those interested in jazz music, deserves to be examined in depth not only musically but also in the context of human psychology and relationships.### Plot and StoryAt the center of the series are Andrew Neiman, a young drummer, and his ruthless and demanding teacher Terence Fletcher. Andrew is an ambitious student studying at one of the most prestigious music schools. His biggest dream is to become a legendary drummer in the jazz world. The biggest obstacle he faces on his way to achieving this goal is Terence Fletcher's harsh and cruel teaching methods.Fletcher does not hesitate to challenge his students psychologically to motivate them. For him, music is not only an art but also a battlefield. Fletcher's attitude strains Andrew both physically and psychologically. One of the most important themes of the series is the effects of this pressure process on Andrew and how he reacts to this pressure.### Performances and CharactersThe leading actors portray their roles extremely impressively. The actor who plays the character Andrew displays his ambition, determination and moments of decline with great skill. The actor playing Fletcher appears as a complete tyrant. His performance offers the audience breathtaking tension. The dynamic between these two characters is one of the biggest factors in the immersion of the series.### Visual and Audio Elements""Whiplash"" also attracts attention with its visual and audio elements. The locations, music school and stage performances used in the series offer a realistic atmosphere to the audience. Camera angles and scene transitions are very successful in reflecting the intensity of the story and the emotional states of the characters. The shots in the musical scenes give the audience the feeling of watching a live concert.Music is at the heart of the ""Whiplash"" series. The jazz pieces in the series increase the emotional depth of the story. Especially the drum performances impress the audience both visually and audibly. The close-ups and sound effects used during musical performances reflect the power of the music and the stress experienced by the characters.Themes and MessagesWhile the series reveals the difficulties and competitive nature of the music world, it also deals with the themes of ambition, success and sacrifice. Andrew's story makes you question the difficulties that can be encountered while pursuing big dreams and the methods of coping with these difficulties. Fletcher's teaching style prompts the audience to think about how far one can go to achieve success.Criticisms and Evaluation""Whiplash"" can be described as an intense and at times disturbing series. The psychological pressure Fletcher puts on his students may be compelling for some viewers. However, these elements should be considered part of the story the series wants to tell. The tempo of the series constantly keeps the audience on their toes, and the increasing tension in each episode creates an element of curiosity and keeps the audience glued to the screen.""Whiplash"" is an interesting production not only for those interested in music, but also for those who think about human psychology and teaching methods. Musical performances, strong acting and in-depth themes make the series worth watching. All in all, ""Whiplash"" is a must-see series for viewers who want to explore the dark and intense aspects of the music world.---This review aims to provide the audience with a detailed look at the basic elements and impressive aspects of the ""Whiplash"" series. After watching the series, you can better understand how impressive the emotional journey of the characters and the power of music are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

An endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare.,"For a sizeable chunk of the film's running time, aspiring jazz-drummer Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is caked in his own sweat and blood; battered and bruised from hours and hours of incessant practise, his blood drips onto the skin of the snare, and the cymbals are littered with beads of sweat – his sweat. Perhaps this is the best way of describing the film: by no means perfect, but uncompromisingly passionate and energetic.I won't be too detailed in explaining what happens over the course of the drama as the film revels in its unpredictability. Besides you probably know the premise anyway. Just in case, Whiplash follows first year Shaffer Conservatoire student Andrew Neiman (Teller) in his quest for drumming supremacy. On the way he encounters big-band big-shot Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) who recruits him as a drummer for his formidable studio band. What then plays out is almost a battle of wits, with Neimen building up immunity to Fletcher's foul-mouthed tirades and Fletcher increasingly being provoked, intentionally or otherwise, by Neimen's ever increasing confidence.It portrays the teacher-pupil relationship as one of insurmountable hostility rather than encouragement, and JK Simmons clearly relishes the opportunity to let-rip some R. Lee Ermey-style ranting. If there are any weaknesses it's that first time (!) writer/director Damien Chazelle seems more comfortable with the musical set-pieces than at the human interaction, though even then a meeting between Neimen and love- interest Nicole (Melissa Benoist) is painfully well-realised, as is a family dinner scene. Clearly the film has no qualms with admitting that ultimately it is all about these moments of musical mayhem, and what wonderful moments they are, shot and edited with a ruthless and ferocious energy. It's an endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare.BLOG: https://thepictureinner.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

You will not connect if you are not a jazz fan,"People would definitely disagree with me. They might say even if you are not a jazz fan the movie is phenomenal. Well I partially agree. The acting of both the protagonist was top notch. Bill stellar was absolutely bliss to watch. And J. K. Simmons need no words to describe.But I come from a background where jazz is not understood, moreover it is not known yet. So for me the music of the movie was just different instrument trying to sync together.With utter humility I would like to say that I was not able to connect with the movie. I am from India we understand classical and we found peace in it but I am very sure it's tough for westerners to love classical as unconditionally as us. Same happened to me.

Jazz! Music for musicians,"I was eventually able to separate my hatred of jazz from the story by the third act. As biased as I might be, and as hyperbolic and contrived as this film feels in parts, it was certainly enjoyable; Performances, impeccable lighting and photography in general. For a fairly subdued movie on an action level (certainly not dialogue) it was incredibly engaging and the use of legitimate musicians was fantastic and appreciated. I don't think this movie could've been done without that level of authenticity.Jazz, in its traditional sense, is a musician circle jerk. Technical proficiency, time signatures you can't tap a foot to, ""standards"" recycled and reinterpreted. It is music for lifers to nod across a ten foot stage at each other and say, ""I see what you did there."" When mathematics meet traditions, I am rarely moved as a music fan. It doesn't mean there is no merit, it's just more about the players than the audience. That's why I think ""Whiplash"" is a fantastic representation of this music genre. I am not a career musician, nor did I attend a prestigious music school, but I'm guessing this movie is an embellished portrayal of that world. Maybe not... Either way, the message I received was this: it's not about expression, it's not about conveying a feeling, it's about perfection. It is about such meticulous, maniacal precision that any level of humanity and nuance is to be removed. Fletcher was essentially John Voight from ""Varsity Blues"", just much more clever in the dressing down of his team.There is a scene in the last act where Fletcher utters ""this is why jazz is dying."" To me, this moment was the most impactful. While the structure and beats of the story fit right in with any movie about sports, or ballet, or any insular world with rules and traditions, it is essentially a study of perfection and ego. Do you want to be the biggest fish in a small pond and look at the big lake with contempt because they just aren't up to your standards? Maybe it's dying because no one outside of your world cares what your tempo is.While JK Simmons if very much deserving of praise for his performance, I think Miles Teller deserves a great nod as well. They played off each other well and sold the nonstop tension well. It took me almost ten years to see this Oscar darling and I'm glad I finally got around to it. I feel like it is a tinge overrated, but definitely a solid, entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
It's about perspective,"People will take away from this movie very different understandings based purely on individual perspective. I think that is where the genius of this movie lies.The message the movie gave me, was aligned to the perspective and reasonings of Fletcher's character. Driving people to greatness means pushing their limits in every way imaginable, to find out what they're made of, and to what extent they will go to, and the hardships they will endure in order to achieve success.Others will see it is an abuser and abusee relationship, and that speaks to their perspective and mindset.

After this I watched him at Juno (2007). These two characters are really poles apart. Although one of this characters is a wild criminal, the other is a meek family man.

This Will Be Brief.,"I liked ""Whiplash"". It wasn't fast paced or anything like that because it didn't have to be. All it needed was the main characters looking for perfection and that's what made this this film a great one. Andrew (Miles Teller) joins a prestigious music school and is taught by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), An instructor who seeks nothing but perfection. What caused me and probably others to go out and see this film was J.K. Simmons' character, Fletcher. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) was like a musical drill sergeant abusing his students to get the best out of them. I know I'm not the only who thought this, but at times I was being reminded of ""Full Metal Jacket"". J.K. Simmons' performance in this film was excellent. That's why he won an Academy Award for best performance by an actor in a supporting role for this film.

It's a different kind of review because I know that world. The world of hard-edge, power-driven, maniacal coaches that push to the limit, often, and mostly, without empathy, understanding that human greatness will not soar forth from the banal and the 'good enough' effort. However, the mental and emotional games and the cruelty can be seriously difficult to watch in this movie. It's arguable whether hard-hitting and demeaning instructors make or break students, but there's always that chance that once in a lifetime, the extremity of humiliation, mind games and emotional battering will meet with the kind of resistance and brilliance that every coach can only dream of.A must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

A violent harmony of visual and audio,"Whiplash, as the name suggests, packs a serious punch. There hasn't been a musical movie, or any movie for that matter, that gives such intense human relationship. The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors, it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm. Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well, audience can't help to be drawn to its excellent tension.Andrew Nieman (Milles Teller) is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools. He's recruited by Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a well-known teacher who's searching for a new musician to join his band. Nieman is a very dedicated young man, he strives to win Fletcher's approval but little did he know that Fletcher's method of teaching is rather unorthodox. The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities, overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior. Lots of stick with barely any carrot.The two are embroiled in an odd relationship, and both leads perform magnificently. Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise. Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic, he's a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy. From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing, it could be unnerving at times, in the best possible way. If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider-Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor, they would have been truly amazing.Camera-work captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close-up, it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene, allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting. However, when the music hits, it goes into high gears. Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum, characters' subtle expressions or winces, down to the blood and sweat. The film's editing is wonderfully fitting, each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments. It's powerful, inevitably engrossingly.Whiplash is a monster of a movie, never skipping a beat. Rude, brash but stylishly captivating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

"The two harmful words in the English language are ""good job""","Geniuses. There are only a handful of them in the universe. They live life on a completely different planet than everyone else. In the process, they make sacrifices that most people wouldn't be willing to make. Sacrifices in relationships, social interaction, in any possibility of living a ""normal life."" Whether that's Einstein, or Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, Mozart, Michael Jordan, Lennon-McCartney, etc, these people lived a life that wasn't normal. In all honesty, normal to them, like Andrew Neimann and Terrence Fletcher in Whiplash, is insufferable and for the weak.Andrew Neimann doesn't just want to be a good jazz drummer, he wants to be the best. His idol is Buddy Rich, one of the best jazz drummers in history. Andrew doesn't have friends and outside of a short lived relationship, doesn't date. He finds people who live the ""average life"" like his extended family boring and of little interest. Drumming is what he lives and dies for. He looks at his father and sees what he doesn't want to be: a man, who wanted to be a writer, but let distractions never let him reach his potential.Neimann meets his match in Terrence Fletcher, played masterfully by JK Simmons, Fletcher is an abusive, sadistic teacher who pushes his students far beyond the line of appropriateness. Andrew sees in Fletcher a little of Rich: Rich was known as a temperamental perfection.The tension in this movie is thick and gripping. Miles Teller to many is the next John Cusack, but I see talent in him that is far more promising than even Cusack, and I like John Cusack. JK Simmons has always been one of my favorite actors. This role is far from his appearances as the Yellow M&M and the Farmer's spokesperson. I'm happy he was finally recognized this year for his skills by the Academy. The story of decisions and sacrifice have been told before in movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but the message here isn't as clear cut or one sided. It's very open to interpretation.If I have to knock a star off, it's some of the actions of Fletcher. At times, it was like ""Karate Kid"", ""All that Jazz"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" thrown in a blender. A music school in NYC would never let an instructor do what Fletcher did (physical abuse). Some of the actions were just slightly over the top and unbelievable. However, I did go to school in the arts and can tell ya, there are some perfectionists who demand greatness. It's not all laid back and easy going like some posters believe arts programs are.Overall, this isn't the easiest movie to watch, but the way it make you think about how geniuses operate makes it a truly unique cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Magical,"As a drummer student and Buddy Rich fan, I love this movie. As a movie lover I cannot forget my love for drums and will say that the music is fantastic and the editing is electrifying. However, it is because I love the story, the great performance of the actors that I will say that the movie is unequal. Some sequences are magical and sometimes it feels like another movie.

My take ....,"I found the whole drumming aspect of the film to be quite clear symbolism for the war against breast reduction surgery. The cinematic parallels between the intense drumming scenes and surgically removing big bouncy boobies is uncanny and is clearly Chazelle's way of expressing the opinion, that he likes big juicy honkers. The fact that Chazelle is willing to be brutally honest and not shy away from the subject matter is honestly empowering and I am internally grateful to have seen someone address this in film. As Abraham Lincoln once said ""God gave you big badonky donk boobies, why would you want to make them smaller?"" this quote directly captures the message that Chazelle was attempting to convey with this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
"It's about Passion, Ambition, and Desperation to achieve one's goal.","Young director Damien Chazelle's second feature, about a talented and ambitious young jazz drummer, takes us into the cutthroat, struggling and hardworking world of top-notch jazz musicians. The story is linear and simple, but offers so much insight into that world. The two actors selected to portray the main characters, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, are perfect; they were meant for the roles. They get into the shoes of the characters with such ease. Even the few scenes with side characters, like Andrew's dad, girlfriend and fellow drummers, are quite interesting.The story is mainly about passion, ambition, and desperation to achieve one's goal. It also sheds light on the things one decide to sacrifice in order to achieve their goal.Positive reinforcement vs negative criticism, which is more effective? This is a debate that has been going on for ages. The former might work for some, while the latter might work for others. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and his/her upbringing; everyone responds to different things.The story is packed with humour and inspiring moments. Simmons' dialogues are just fantastic; it might seem vulgar to some, but they're just hilarious. Other than the actual instruments being played, no background score is used at all; this works quite well for the movie. Nothing seems staged, everything takes place with such natural ease.And all this leads up to a foottappingly mesmerising climax. The open-ended approach was good. And the film's topics beg to be discussed and debated among groups.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
JK Simmons is the ONLY reason to see this,"Whiplash chronicles a jazz drummer's tumultuous relationship with a volatile instructor. While this is well acted and shot beautifully, Whiplash fails to catapult itself to greatness with bogging down its story with rather wooden supporting characters and a slow as molasses storyline. Whiplash tells the story of Andrew, a jazz drummer coming into a cutthroat art school and his instructor, Terrence Fletcher, an off the wall and emotionally abusive instructor. The strengths of Whiplash lie solely in the hands of J.K. Simmons. Simmons delivers a tour de force performance, turning a fiery rage into something inspiring for our lead, Miles Teller. Simmons has some truly great scenes, spouting off profanity laced rants when trying to bring out the best in Andrew. The scenes with Simmons send the film into overdrive, making you want to know what happens next. However, this feeling of excellence on screen quickly turns into boredom as we see Miles Teller try to captivate us the same way his co-star did and falters. At the end of it all, this comes down to talent. J.K. Simmons sets a high bar for his co-stars, and this actually ends up hurting the film because of his performance. Miles Teller seems as if he can't keep up in scenes with Simmons and rather than captivating us with his relentless drumming until his blood hits the sweat filled drum kit, it actually ends up feeling as if he is trying too hard to top his co-star in regards to intensity. This creates for an uneven film, one that never truly becomes the masterpiece it wants to be. Despite these lesser qualities, Whiplash does feature some truly great scenes of Simmons berating his students with some of the best delivered insults this side of Full Metal Jacket. Damien Chazelle does showcase his talents, lingering on the physical and emotional tolls that the environment takes on Andrew and other students. Despite this quality, Chazelle fails to connect his characters to his audience. But one thing that won't be lost in translation is where these characters are and how competitive it is. Quite honestly, I feel this worked better as a short film. There is simply not enough for audiences to latch on to or enough for them to care about. But one thing is for sure, J.K. Simmons is ON FIRE in this film and delivers one of the best performances of his career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Fantastic,"A musical thriller? This one's hard to categorize. One might say it's the exact opposite of an inspirational teacher movie, like Goodbye Mr. Chips. Miles Teller plays an eager drumming student at a music conservatory. He captures the attention of the head honcho of the school's peak band crew, J.K. Simmons. A normal person would wish they hadn't, because the guy's a total psycho. One wrong note or beat and the guy'll be roaring every curse word in the book at you. He's a legend, though, so no one would ever dare stand up to him. Teller is not a normal person - his dream is to be one of the best of all time, so he tries his damnedest to take Simmons' rage in stride. It's not easy. This film is simply gripping. Teller is amazingly focused. One ought not to disregard his physical performance, either. While the editing probably helped him survive this, he really is going to town on those drums. Simmons gives a performance for the ages. I wanted to murder this dude. As a supporting character, the film doesn't get too deeply into what his deal is, but the little bits that are shown are fascinating. The finale is absolutely outstanding. One of the year's best, no doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

A Visceral Explosion of Rhythm and Fury,"There is such a myriad of blood, sweat, tears, anxiety, screaming, and terror in Whiplash that an outsider might mistake it for a horror show instead of a cursory, superiorly breathtaking thriller of sorts. I'm not the kind of critic that uses tired phrases like ""kept me at the edge of my seat"" or ""made me sweat bullets"" as devices to trickily describe my heart-rate, but during Whiplash, I experienced both sensations; not in the same way I did when Ghostface was chasing around Drew Barrymore with psychotic fascination in Scream and not in the same way I did when Marion Crane was getting shower-knifed in Psycho. Whiplash invents an entirely new kind of thrill, one where an aggressive insult is as excruciating as a punch to the face and a drum solo quivers with the same acrimony of a fist fight where no one wins.Miles Teller (who is already becoming one of Hollywood's many underrated young talents) portrays Andrew Neyman, an aspiring drummer who has found a place within the halls of a respected music conservatory on the East Coast. Though slightly cocky, his talent is undeniable; he aspires to be the next Buddy Rich, and it doesn't seem like all too much of an exaggeration. Little does he know that he is about to become the punching bag of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a sadistic conductor who isn't afraid to hurl verbal and physical assaults on his students in order to achieve a sickened sort of perfection.Famously, the American Film Institute compiled a series of Top 100 lists, its subjects being stars, laughs, passions, quotes, and more. If they were to start again from scratch in the next decade or so, Terence Fletcher would, in no doubt, find his place as one of the Top 50 Villains. Simmons has made himself a kind presence before (Juno, all those insurance commercials), but never again will I be able to look at him without a cautious, passing fear. As terrifying as Darth Vader or Nurse Ratched, Fletcher seems to enjoy inflicting pain onto his students; even scarier is the fact that the film never offers any explanation as to why he feels the need to traumatize the impressionable youths around him. Most movies would use a dying wife or an abusive childhood as excuses, but not with Fletcher. He is evil, probably not even realizing it. Simmons snarls his way through screaming matches with unbridled ferocity, but more disconcerting is his ability to radiate cruelty even when his manners are at their very best.In Whiplash, we're never quite sure if Fletcher's alarming teaching methods will ultimately guide Andrew in the direction of the greatest drummer alive, or if they will send him over the edge. Teller, a brilliant and intuitive actor, is aware that Andrew isn't always likable but makes up for it with fierce determination. As he practices unbelievable amounts of time to polish a certain section of a particular piece of music, blood rips through his hands like a geyser, sweat pours down his face like a waterfall. But will he give up? The lethal rapport between Teller and Simmons is morbid enough to keep us guessing.Mention must also be made for Tom Cross' magnificent editing. The way he pieces together Fletcher's attacks on Andrew are inflamed in peril, flickering with rough movement that matches Fletcher's unpredictable mood changes; most impressive is the climax (which is basically a long, extremely intense drum solo), which captures every single detail imaginable, ensnaring any drip of sweat or instrumental spasm of the performance.When the closing credits finally popped up, I noticed that, in all my leg-shaking and shortages of breath, I was drenched in sweat. Whiplash doesn't allow for a smoke break or a second to get your bearings straight — the continuance of high tension makes it the most thrilling film of 2014.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A c-milking masterpiece,"As a drummer, I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film. I knew the general idea of the story and of its reputation, but it's hard to be prepared for the actual level of intensity and visceral emotion put into the performance. This is the kind of movie that deserves a close watch and attention to detail; it's by no means light watching or something to ""turn on in the background."" This is completely uncompromising and gripping drama that may also hold additional interest for drummers, jazz aficionados, or anyone who works at a craft that requires copious amounts of practice.The basic synopsis for this story is that Andrew is an aspiring jazz drummer at a music conservatory who will stop at nothing to achieve greatness, and his teacher Fletcher is a jazz band director who will stop at nothing to unlock greatness. One might think that this combination of goals should allow for a fruitful and cooperative partnership, but the way that the two go about pushing themselves to find this greatness is as destructive socially as it is constructive musically. This space isn't meant to give deep film analysis, so suffice it to say that this is one of several interesting ironies found within this story. Without getting into any finer plot points or spoilers, the meat of this film lies in watching Andrew fall into complete social isolation and obsessive/unhealthy practice habits to improve, while Fletcher pushes him in some less than conventional (and often illegal) methods that would make R. Lee Ermey or Louis Gossett Jr. blush. The contrasting notions of respect, conflict and hatred between the characters are extremely compelling throughout.Your mileage may vary, but this movie was a solid 10/10 for me. As long as you aren't overly sensitive or have a short attention span, I think the film brings a lot to the table. First of all, the acting is absolutely superb. JK Simmons is always good, but he's never been better than in this film. He plays Fletcher to the point where he draws so much contempt from the audience that it can be easy to forget he is just playing a role at times... and yet, there is this slightest twinkle of humanity that he manages to hold onto and instill somewhere deep within the character that leads you to wonder whether or not there is any actual goodness present and the nature of his true motives. The sights and sounds of the movie are top notch. The cinematography is a very strong point for the film. While the film sets aren't particularly interesting, and don't need to be for this film, the frenetic action drumming shots from various perspectives really feed the emotion and intensity of this film. The audience can feel Andrew's pain and his triumph as he physically and mentally pushes himself through these performances. There are a lot of great perspective shots off of the cymbals and drum heads. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a drummer in real life, and did perform these parts to a certain extent, but a ton of expert editing went into this movie to make the performances look 100% accurate and legitimate to actual musician viewers. Aurally, there's a good selection of well-mixed jazz numbers in this movie that really bring it to life.This movie is not for everyone, some people will always only feel comfortable with lighter fare and a more conventional plot sequence. However, in my eyes, this does not detract from the rating. Art doesn't need to make compromises. Greatness doesn't need to make compromises. This is a main theme of the film. Realize this: this film's very existence and earned success in modern mainstream cinema is almost an exact mirror of the struggle that Andrew and Fletcher face in their quest to create something legendary and lasting. Uncompromising and goal-oriented, unwilling to bend or show any leniency for social awareness... and yet the movie was able to garner an 8+ IMDb rating and 90%+ on other critic aggregate sites. There is no doubt in my mind: if this film reined it in a bit and adopted a more conventional and digestible story, it would have not received the same amount of critical or audience acclaim. The film is absolutely relentless from start to finish in the best way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A movie more about pursuit of mastery than drums and music.,"I know little about music and less about drumming, but this movie is not about the craft, it's about the pursuit for mastery (or even perfection). If you go into it knowing nothing about jazz, I'm sure your interest will be peaked.In this movie you follow Teller's character Andrew and Fletcher, the character played by Simmons. Both deliver fantastic performances, and considering they are both supposed to be practicing a craft on a high level, it's very impressive that they manage to do so convincingly.The entire movie follows Andrew around, and by doing so you understand what kind of life he chose to live, and while we don't see anything, what we see is sufficient to fill in the rest. The girl he dates is only seen in a couple of scenes, but you completely understand the relationship and Andrew's thoughts on it from them. The same when it comes to his position on friends and family. Simmons portrayal of Fletcher is very successful, in that he is a beast, but you find yourself rooting for him despite it.And to end with the ending: I am still having a bit of a hard time saying if it's a happy or ending or not, but I really did enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

Great writing, great acting, great directing, fantastic editing and amazing music. J.K. Simmons is an amazing actor. I remember him on OZ and boy did he blow the performance out the water... And you know what, Miles Teller met him step for step. This film is about obsession. Obsession of Mile Teller to be the best and Obsession of JK Simmons to never settle. The film centers around Miles as he is studying at a music conservatory. He is picked to be part of the best jazz ensemble in the school. But soon he realizes that the guy he admires is the toughest and most demanding person he has ever met. And you sit on the edge of your seat with each scene, ESPECIALLY when they are in it together.

Simmons is mesmerising,"The theme in 'Whiplash' could apply to anything at all in the world almost and I think that's part of what has made the film so popular. The movie chooses drumming as the subject for this particular story but showcases it in a way that makes people think ""wow, I wonder if I had someone to push me at *insert hobby/passion* and I was willing to devote my life to it, could I be the greatest of all time?"" It's an interesting notion. The answer sadly for 99.9% of people would still be no, but what's to stop them trying? Was the character in the movie ever going to be one of the greatest of all time? That's up for the viewer to decide but it doesn't even really matter. What matters is that he had both the person to drive him and also the capability to devote himself to it. So one way or the other, he was going to find out.J.K Simmons has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the the Academy Awards for his role in 'Whiplash' and is almost certainly to win. And rightly so. He is absolutely perfect in his role with shades of R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket' coming to mind. Every scene he is in is captivating to watch. We the viewer are actually as nervous as the characters are supposed to be at what his character will say or do to them next. A real pleasure to watch.The film is far from being simply for music lovers. I was surprised how entertaining I actually found the whole thing. A lot of the scenes (mainly the ones with Simmons) were very funny in quite a dark way but also Miles Teller played his role very well and was enjoyable to watch. The final scene is absolutely brilliant and tops off the movie perfectly. A deserved nominee for Best Picture without a doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
'I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity',"Damien Chazelle both wrote and directed WHIPLASH and his film won three Oscars and a lot of fans. It is s difficult film to watch on DVD - the small screen acts life a loaded rifle timed at your head and blasting your eardrums with both jazz and the raunchiest dialogue around. It I basically a two actor show (with some incidental and rather meaningless bit parts tossed in to try to offer a bit of emotional resting during this madhouse of a film.Andrew (Miles Teller) is a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious cut-throat music academy in New York who comes under the wing of the most respected professor at the school, one Fletcher (J.K.Simmons) who does not hold back on abuse towards his students. The two form an odd relationship as Andrew drams of greatness and Fletcher (we finally discover at the end of the film) will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential.Both actors offer top performance (as do the bit part player Paul Reiser as Andrew's father and Melissa Benoist as Nicole- Andrew's minor infatuation), but the film for the most part is a barrage of gross desultory and demeaning filth that pours out of J.K. Simmons' Shar Pei face and mouth. Vicious, cruel, demeaning he finally gets his due in part because Andrew is talked into reporting Fletcher's behavior when an incident happens with a fellow student. The last moments of the film make the first long one note song payoff – Fletcher's drive is intrinsically a desire to make his students be the best they can be.

A movie all about music for those that understand it,"A budding jazz pianist (Miles Teller) is admitted into the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory where he comes under the eye of the legendary Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), who promptly starts driving him like a dog, trying to take him as far beyond his human limits as possible.Frankly speaking, movies about music have never been my thing. I'm in no way musically talented or inclined, and thus whenever, for example, there's that one scene where someone has to play something over and over again, getting yelled at the same time to get it right, until it finally goes, it just doesn't open up to me. Every single take sounds the same. Might be that that's the purpose, but I do believe that you're meant to hear the subtle differences if you're good enough.And in that regard I don't think Whiplash has what it takes to take someone on a journey into the world of music. A movie about war, for example, can show you what it would be like to be there on the battlefield. But then that's explicitly what it is trying to do. Whereas Whiplash seems to be about music made by those that get it to those that also get it.Luckily music is only half of the movie. The second big theme is greatness and what is needed to achieve it. Because it cannot be just about raw talent. Every day a person is born with the capability to become a great musician. But few of them end up in the business and only a few of those have the drive needed to urge them onward even when they've already achieved some measure of success.Whiplash is a fine film.

His goals are tested by music instructor Terrance Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who will go at the most intense lengths to realize a student's potential.The film picks up speed immediately, where Fletcher sees Andrew practicing the drums, cynically asking him why he stopped when he walked into the room. It then takes you to non-stop suspense of Andrew ending up enrolling in Fletcher's band class, where he witnesses Fletcher's intense and abusive methods (from swearing/shouting at students to throwing music stands around) of teaching and where he goes through highs and lows to try to meet Fletcher's high standards of becoming the greatest drummer. This will make you become engaged to the film's plot as you try to find out if Andrew will ever meet his potential through Fletcher's eyes.Damien Chazelle did an outstanding job writing the script and directing the film, providing us with an intense and awe-inspiring plot and a well-acted cast of characters. J.T. Simmons did a spectacular job in his role as Fletcher, definitely worthy of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win, and Miles Teller did a great job in his Andrew role - ambitious and energetic. I enjoyed watching the love/hate student-teacher relationship between them, and also thought the father/son relationship between Andrew and his dad Jim (Paul Reiser) was heartwarming.I took music lessons throughout my kid/teenage years and this film does take me back to those days of music practicing, rhythm and getting the notes in tune.

Visceral and abrasive to the point of disbelief,"Following its critical acclaim, Whiplash was one of the films to see in 2014, a storied account of a promising orchestral drummer in over his head. On paper, this movie sounds like an excellent premise, non-conventional and darker than almost any other musically-oriented productions. However, the result didn't quite have the magic I was expecting; the aggression displayed by J.K. Simmons (who deservedly won numerous awards for his role) seemed misplaced given the nature of his job, and the film around him doesn't offer much else.Miles Teller (one of my least favourite actors working today) is well-suited for his leading role, balancing his character's fractured personality against his commitment to the music. It is also worth appreciating Teller's devotion to his performance, as he took 2-hour drum lessons 5 days a week for the 5 months prior to filming. Outside of Teller and Simmons, the rest of the film is just a foil to allow their chemistry to spark - constantly pushing against one another to see who will cave first. Their intentions, however, are not the same: Simmons has an element of pure hatred hard to capture on screen, further capturing the difficulty of his role.The camerawork is also strong, maximising darkened backgrounds and closeups to highlights the subtleties of each instrument's operations. Makeup is also used minimally but effectively, slowly building Teller's face up to emphasise the strain he undergoes for his job. Whiplash has a lot to like, but personally didn't grab me as the reviews suggested. If you can build the emotional connection with the leading roles, then Damien Chazelle's other directorial triumphs (First Man, La La Land) will also be worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"

If a perfect jazz band is what you're after log onto itunes and buy one.For Miles Teller, although drumming from a young age, to spend hours a day preparing for this movie, and play this well as an amateur player it should be commended not criticized! J.K. Simmons' performance as 'Fletcher' is Oscar worthy. The editing and sound is phenomenal, and credit to all other members of the band.It might not be perfect musically (although not being a professional like some reviewers on here I cannot comment it seems), but to my ears its a masterpiece and as this is a film and not a jazz album I am judging it on how it plays as a film.

Whatever people think about the brutality or how music teachers push their students towards greatness is really not the point to me. The point is that it takes extreme discipline to reach perfection. How does one measure perfection? The only measure I know myself is if I get goosebumps when listening to a performance and if I hear that Big Boy Tempo without any hiccups. This movie and its music gave me goosebumps. Simple as that.So 10/10 stars here - no ifs or buts about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
A classic.,"Simply put, already a classic movie.In years to come we'll be looking back to it. Yes, it's that good. Amazing performances, amazing screenplay, surprising twists,...it has the lot. The movie that should have won best picture of the year.If you happen to be playing in a band, it's even more relevant. If, by one of those weird synchronicities, you happen to see it just after a bad rehearsal on which you quarreled with the drummer, which I had, it's kind of an emotional experience. I couldn't help but root for Fletcher. If you are into music, technically he was right all the time.There's not a moment in the movie when he's not spot on. He's a bastard and you can argue if it's right or not to treat another human being as he did (which I don't think it is), but he was fair. When they played good, he said it. That's his saving grace. And he had no hidden agenda. Just musical perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Terrific and terrifying actor,J.K. Simmons really steals the show here. This film puts a horrific twist on the usual aspiring artist plot by throwing in a very alarming figure who distresses and abuses his students. Yet they stick around because they feel this is their only path to greatness. Is it worth it? This film explores the consequences.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Miles Davis would have hated this movie,"This movie is, as every one of the actual musicians here has noted, completely devoid of the reality, and, more importantly, of the JOY, of being a musician. The teacher's ludicrous verbal abuse, which fluctuates between politically incorrect and downright cruel, is so unrealistic and anachronistic in a portrayal of 21st-century educational life that I found it unwatchable. Simmons' character slaps a student repeatedly across the face, with no one gasping or saying a word about it, which had me rolling my eyes, it was like they were saying 1950s movie dialogue about how ""dames"" are dumb and can't drive, or something. I was offended, but I also kind of felt sorry for all involved, it was so... dumb.Beyond insulting my sensibilities as a human, it also insulted me as a musician, an artist. No credible teacher of art or music would think such negative extremes produce genius or even fine musicians. Discipline is crucial to becoming great, but so is flow, listening, and the creativity the truly exceptional experience when ""in the zone"" playing music with other people. This film gives zero sense of why anyone would actually want to become ""Charlie Parker"", I mean, does that mean famous? Parker was an innovator, a physicist of sound, not just some automaton who could play a million notes as fast as possible. It's like this movie was made by people who absolutely don't get why Coltrane makes you feel like you're inside the moon and why a Duke Ellington tune can float you away on the river of your own blood flowing in your veins. Miles Davis was famous for being able to encourage his bands to elevate their playing, I heard Herbie Hancock say that one time when he was blocked on a part Davis just listened and calmly said, ""put a B in the bass"". And everything flowed. No screaming, throwing, åsshølery, but something more masterful: a finely-tuned artist committed to creating greatness, communicating via his mastery of the mysterious, infinite language of music and a deep respect for the people helping him create it.A wasted opportunity to speak to the madness of wanting to be great, to achieve, and also a waste of the dynamic and always fun to watch J.K. Simmons, Watch him in his series Counterpart instead, in a part that displays all his swagger but also the sweetness and humour he mixes in so well.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Sensational from start to finish,"Whiplash reminded me of just how much I love films, it made me feel alive, it was an exhilarating experience from start to finish, and it's without a shadow of a doubt the best film of 2014. The most disturbing thing is just how taken aback I was by the genius of Whiplash.There is a staunch invigorating sense of malice about it, there is tension that ebbs and flows and builds and the result is a work of inspired genius that leaves you pleading for more. The film is edited deliberately like a finely tuned instrument hitting every line of dialogue and composing every shot with the sharpest precision. The cuts are meticulously crafted with the strongest effect possible. There is an arresting visceral sensibility about it. There is a heavy emphasis throughout the film on the investment of blood and sweat required to play a piece of music perfectly in tune, in tempo and on time.Though not the primary genre of music I listen to I can certainly recognize that writer/director Damien Chazelle is intensely knowledgeable on Jazz as a subject matter, this holds him in good stead to deliver something purely inspirational with this film. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons develop a relationship of tectonic razor sharp attrition the likes of which I've never witnessed. It's a two man show of relentless ferocity. Teller is astounding as a musician with aspirations of great. Teller is given the much less flashy role of anchoring the movie in an emotional core, he pulls it off flawlessly. Simmons' performance is nothing short of brilliant as the coach whose heavy handed tactics and unique methods he believes will reward him with a great student. Simmons chews up the scenery at every given opportunity. His character is possessed by an anecdote relating to Charlie Parker reaching the pinnacle of jazz drumming after getting a symbol thrown at his head. He is rooted in the ideology that pushing people beyond what is expected of him will get him the results he craves. It is through the underlying rooting of these ideas through the characters that give it that extra layer of texture that allows it to reach higher in during the centerpiece moments of the film.There is an integral understanding of the fine line that exists between abuse and pushing someone mercilessly towards notorious greatness. The finale is engaging, pulsating, exhausting and uplifting. I was on the edge of my seat, the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck, and it was a sheer joy.There may be some who are not as taken with it by its very nature, a movie about jazz drumming I guess doesn't sound very exciting on paper. Synopses are lame; they never capture the true vision of the piece that can only be encapsulated by the sensory delights of the viewing experience. I was floored, shocked and amazing at its strength of conviction. It put a smile and my face and a beat in my head for hours afterwards. I am truly thankful for Whiplash, it was a film firmly rooted in the ideas of what a film should be. It had an in depth knowledge and understanding of its subject matter and showed the ability to be fearless and step out of the often stiflingly rigid narrative structures. It's not afraid to be bold and take risks at the same time. It was the definition of sensational.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
the second Whiplash finished I turned to IMDb and gave it 10 out of 10,"Upon concluding the film, I immediately turned to IMDb and awarded it a perfect score of ten out of ten. The music and direction were exemplary, creating an atmosphere of constant tension and unexpected twists. The performances of Andrew and Fletcher were truly remarkable. After watching this film, I developed a deep appreciation for jazz and made it a personal goal to learn a musical instrument, particularly the drums
I must admit that the intensity of the film caused me to break a sweat. Additionally, I'm curious to know if others shared my experience, as certain scenes between Andrew and Fletcher Made me laugh or its just the tension i don't know .",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Quiet yet loud,"I have to begin by appreciating Miles Teller. He is a brilliant actor! After watching Two night stand, I thought he'd be stuck doing rom coms but he does Whiplash and shines! J.K.Simmons is a seasoned actor but plays his part amazingly. All the tension and nervous energy that we feel in the movie is brought about mainly by Simmons. He's mostly not likable and I, like many others, did not quite approve of his technique of 'pushing kids over the edge'. He should push but should also know when to stop. Also, I felt like the end dragged a bit although during the (long!)final sequence I was cheering Teller for his drumming slap to Simmons. It was definitely a great shot. All in all, I liked the movie very much and initially, because of all the tension, I wanted to stop watching, but I did not and I am glad. It has many golden moments that will make you go whoa! There are a few points which required me to suspend my belief, like the bleeding hands from drumming, but I guess that just made the movie all the more intense. A very good movie and although it did not inspire me, it surely satisfied me and I will not be surprised if it bags more than a few awards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Full Metal Jacket Goes Music School...,"All this effort to master an instrument. And for what? To make awful noise with perfect craftsmanship: Jazz.I think the scenes with the use of drums are completely exaggerated. Pure effect action film level on the rehearsal stage. Terrible realism. Good show.Basically, I think it is total artistic banality, because it's not the tempo that's important, but the groove. And to judge that, you have to give the drummer a few bars.So it's typical Hollywood: effect over substance.And what effect is a teacher's criticism supposed to have, if it's not explained? If he just says 'not good'?Just because our 'Top Gun' super-teacher imagines a tempo, that, in his perception, isn't reached after the second quarter by the drummer: is that really the measure of things to decide whether the drummer is good or gets kicked out?How would he play the groove after some time? Learn that groove. And how would the interaction with the other musicians develop after a few bars? No! Hollywood doesn't want to overwhelm the audience with such things...
The teacher's abilities are blown to superhuman dimensions of a metronome - just for the effect of dramatization.On the one hand, the film also tries to elevate jazz to something extraordinary (which it is not) - but on the other hand, it portrays Jazz, as if it was like a strictly quantized music and musicians were marionettes or soldiers (also for the cheap effect: the American music schools are 'the best in the world' with the 'best musicians in the world', just like American soldiers are 'the best in the world'...)Talent and practice, practice, practice. That's reality. But I didn't know that the Hollywood barracks drill, a la Full Metal Jacket, sadism and degradation, which is not even working for turning boys into good soldiers, was well suited to artistic(!) development, mastering an instrument...
Totally exaggerated.Actually ridiculous.However, also in typical Hollywood style:
In terms of the cinematographic craftsmanship, technology, the film is simply top notch.Great camera, lighting, editing (and even one car crash, that is so well done, that I was actually wondering myself, if it might have really happened inadvertently during filming).And IMO a really, really great sound. The rehearsal music recordings. The recordings of the drum set. As well as the dialogue sound and ambience.An acoustic highlight for me was the dialogue scene in the cinema: the intimate vocals with the cinema ambience - amazing.Since the structure-borne sound effects in 'Gravity', no sound effect has impressed me as much as the dry dialogue sound of the father-son conversation in the cinema.The acting is also very good. Lots of great scenes. And the way the main actor conveys his mastery of the drums - of course in unbelievably skillful interaction with the camera and editing - is so perfect that you could believe that he really is an obsessed music student. Great.So for the actors, the crew, the technology: 10 points. Excellent.For the producers and writers who make such an exaggerated, unrealistic cartoonish drama out of it: 1 point.Why always these exaggerations? IMO less would sometimes be more (without losing thrill).But since they need to get people into cinemas, I will simply ignore this economic aspect of the movie business in my rating, because it would do no justice to the amazing job of many of the involved people..",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Disappointing!,"I expected from this film much more then I saw. I think music is not about military discipline and swearing, it is just the opposite. How important is for a drummer to play his drums fast? Not that important. I think this film was made more for the actors and music editors then for the music itself. What a disappointment!It is also disappointing to see that this film took more Oscars then Boyhood. It is sickening! I really would like to add that I really expected more about this film then it delivered to me.I am sorry but I would not recommend this film for you to see. It is just so disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Brilliant for lovers of drama.,"Absolutely amazing film. Expect no pandering to the audience with run of the mill scenes of joyfulness and positive reinforcement which is so common in the modern film. Instead expect real grit and emotive acting in this dramatic, real and slightly psychotic film. Very good performances by the two main actors, portraying the student and teacher respectively, by Miles Teller and J.K Simmons. Even though this film is about playing an instrument essentially, you will be both eyes glued to the screen in anticipation of what happens next as it could be a great thing or a negative thing, acknowledging that not everything in real life is sunshine and lollipops if you're not willing to work at it. But there is also the opposite end of the spectrum...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
Definitely in my top 10,"This movie changed my life. It made me a jazz fan over night, I've seen it at least 10 times. No kidding. This legendary movie made J.K. Simmons spike up in my top 10 actors. He deserves his Oscar totally. He took my breath away. I feel stupid trying to talk about this movie, it's just so so above brilliant. I am one of those people who watch at least 10 movies a week, and has seen almost everything there is to see, but seriously, having to speak about this work of art leaves me paralyzed, I feel like I don't know enough and appropriate words to do it justice. Watch it. If you are born, seriously, if you aren't blind or deaf, WATCH IT. This is the kind of movie you replay after you finish it. At least for me. It's such a relief that this kind of masterpieces make it to the Academy Awards, it deserved more than the nomination, even though Birdman made it a fair competitor. Just watch it. Anyone who reads this. WATCH IT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Music"
