"Atmospheric, but very difficult to follow","Atmosphere: superb. Acting: outstanding. Cinematography: wonderful. Soundtrack: very nice.Still, I didn't like this film. And that's because of its only weak point: the storyline. I have never read the book it is based on, nor seen the television series, and I completely lost track of the intricacies of the plot. I had only a vague idea of what was going on, where the story was headed and what the time perspective was (indications of the years in the flashbacks would be helpful).I watched this movie late on a Friday night after a busy working week, so maybe I wasn't as sharp as I should be. You have to be absolutely concentrated every single second to understand everything that happens in this film.Perhaps the movie was not meant to be crystal clear, and perhaps the director wants the viewer to discover all the subtleties after a second or third viewing. But then you are left with lots of scenes in which middle-aged men with stiff upper lips exchange what seems to be incomprehensible inside information. The lack of much real action might be a plus for viewers who like serious films, but it's a disadvantage when you lose track of what is actually happening.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Genuine Achievement,"Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In, the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.Called back into service to uncover the identity of a Soviet mole at the height of the Cold War, retired British intelligence operative George Smiley is tasked with unwinding a vastly convoluted web of conspiracy, codenames, double agents, and deceit.The movement from relatively low-budget foreign language filmmaking to helming star casts in comparably costly productions is one that, historically, holds significant risk for directorial careers. Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.Hitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A tad confusing in the telling, but excellent in the tone","There is a certain snobbery with films that require more than a small amount of attention – an opinion that if you even ask about a small detail that you missed that you should then go watch Transformers and leave real films to the grownups. It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.I've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.This is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless ""war"". This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap ""do not unplug"" text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.Speaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.Overall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"James Bond, this is not...","Forty-six year old Swedish director Tomas Alfredson came to prominence three years ago when he directed the film adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel 'Let The Right One In'. After the initial success of the vampiric romantic drama, Alfredson became attached to an international adaptation of John le Carre's espionage-novel 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'. Based on aspects of le Carre's (also known as David Cornwell) experiences during his time as a member of the British Intelligence service sectors MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s, Alfredson creates a fine, absorbing picture which engrosses from beginning to end.Control (John Hurt), the leader of an unknown sector of the British Intelligence service, is ousted along with his long-standing companion George Smiley (Gary Oldman) due to a botched operation in Budapest, Hungary which saw the officer Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) murdered in public. Control was under the impression that there was a mole among the top ranking members of the service, referred to as the Circus by the other top ranking members due to its location in Cambridge Circus, London, and Smiley is drawn out of retirement to pinpoint the culprit after Control passes away. Alongside the young Intelligence officer Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley has four primary candidates to focus his investigation upon; they are the last remaining members of the Circus, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik).Utilizing an all-star, established cast, Alfredson allows the film to unfold at an almost flawless pace. Every sequence contains a small snippet of information which allows the viewer to conduct their own investigation alongside that of Smiley's. While the narrative is also driven along by strong performances from the primarily male cast, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, David Dencik, Stephen Graham and Kathy Burke all give strong, commanding performances. While the true artists of the piece are Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the young, and somewhat naive intelligent officer assigned to assist Smiley. John Hurt as the aging, instinct-driven leader of the British service, and Tom Hardy, who is Ricki Tarr the dirty cleaner for British intelligence's most fowl operations. Their performances go above and beyond in their supporting roles, and at times eclipse Gary Oldman's subdued portrayal of a man drawn back into the murky world of corruption, betrayal and treasure.Alongside the narrative and its cast, one of the more surprising aspects of the film, is Alfredson, Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and Editor Dino Jonsater's use of stylistic nuances that further enhance the viewing experience. Lingering close-up shots of seemingly insignificant objects and shallow focus shots constantly evoke the nature of mystery and intrigue which surrounds such clandestine organisations. Alfredson never rushes any moment, instead he allows for the audience to become accustomed to their surroundings and appreciate their beauty. Wide angle shots and long lenses are used for interior and exterior locations, showcasing the breakdowns of their interiors, while close-up shots are used to examine objects and characters in their most frail states. During the opening sequence involving Prideaux's botched secret mission, a simple concoction of jump cuts and lingering static shots concentrating upon various characters within the vicinity creates a sense of the tension, suspense and vulnerability of the situation and this is how Alfredson constantly keeps the audience engrossed. By providing those observing the action on screen with just enough information that they themselves become entwined within Smiley's investigation as he moves forward.Once the credits and a dedication to the films screenwriter Bridget O'Connor who passed away last year finish, the viewer is left with an overriding sense of satisfaction. Smiley's world is a far cry away from the glitz and glamour that the espionage genre has become accustomed to. There are no martinis in sight, but only reel upon reel of bureaucratic wrangling, childish bickering and greed-induced deal-making, where it seems everybody is working for themselves and their reputation rather than the nation's government that is employing them. Since its premiere at the 68th Venice International Film Festival 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' has been touted as an Oscar contender and it is easy to understand why, Tomas Alfredson has taken a solid source novel, utilized an established cast and infused the final concoction with elements from his own visual repertoire to create a wonderfully crafted film that does the original BBC televised series justice.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cold War Chills,"You know. When you are dealing with a complex writer like LeCarre, you are going to get a complex movie. Unfortunately, to the casual viewer, there's an awful lot that is going on that is grounded in the long dark past. While the story of the search for a mole in the network is a valid pivot point, there are so many intricacies that you are left to guess. Perhaps I am not that bright, but I need a bit more. I guess the question is, do I need a George Smiley playbook or a stack of books to follow this film. If that's the case, how many people can appreciate this? The time period in issue is really in the fairly distant past. I have to agree that so much of what we see is really dumbed down, but when the plots are so slowly developed and depend on so much inside stuff, even the astute viewer is left in the lurch. It isn't that I didn't like it. But I may have to give it another shot to really appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Class all the way through,"I have been eagerly awaiting this production for a long time and have not been disappointed. Never have I seen such a compilation of such fabulous performances together. No way is this another James Bond, it is how the world of espionage was, and is today. No car chases in Aston Martins or gadgets but a world of seedy little offices and the grim reality of this genre. What had the greatest impact on myself was the slow deep menace conveyed by all. Difficult to single out any one performance as all were amazing but I particularly admired Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Tom Hardy for their work. At times this film has some unexpected moments of shocking cruelty. Complex character portrayal is presented in a slow deep style that only inspires you to know more about the person. The story itself is a classic and known by many, yet this production introduces a few changes which work well. One of the most absorbing and classy movies I have seen and has left a lasting impact on me. Please, please, please, make Smiley's People now.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Fact It's Uncinematic Is A Major Problem,"John Le Carre is without doubt one of the literary greats of the late 20th Century . A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinemaYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematographyThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema . Let's not forget two of the most memorable movies of the 1970s THE GODFATHER and JAWS were based on novels dismissed as trash",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sigh","The first episode of the BBC series sets the tone perfectly, introducing the key players and telling us what kind of people they are, all by just having them enter a room for a meeting without saying a word. The trouble with the movie version is that we never get the chance to know the characters. They are faceless people with difficult names and we don't care which one of them is the bad guy. I have read the book at least three times, seen the TV series twice and was still totally confused by the movie. Anyone who hasn't read the book, I would suggest, doesn't stand a chance. The grimy landscape around the Hotel Islay was nicely done. But why make every scene grimy? Where was the circus? Where were the lights of Shaftsbury Avenue? Where were the green fields around Jim Prideaux's prep school? The key scene with Connie Sachs is destroyed by a totally out-of-place crudity and the climax, when the mole is revealed, is thrown away with zero drama. What was going on?",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nordic View Of A Very British Tale,"Freezing. John Le Carre's spy story has a new version. Tomas Alfredson the Swedish director of the chillingly great ""Let The Righ On In"" understands the British climate. Impersonal raincoats wore by the very personal Gary Oldman are only part of the story. An undercurrent of passionate wheelings and dealings with poker face players makes for an engrossing tale that allows us some kind of distance. The production design is a masterpiece on its on. Just look at the wallpapers. I'm not going to venture into the actual plot but the performances. Gary Oldman is superb in a slightly younger and more virile version of Alec Guinness who played George Smiley in a celebrated British miniseries in 1979. Colin Firth's bisexual turn brings a dark sort of lightness to the proceedings. Tom Hardy is also superb as are Mark Strong and John Hurt. If you're a Le Carre fan you'll be enthralled, if you're not you may become one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I really missed out on this one,"This film is set in London in the 1970s. Apparently, the plot is about the British Secret Service trying to a find a double agent in their ranks who also works for the Soviet Union . The film is based on the novel by John Le Carré.I truly have no idea what the hell this movie was about. Scene after scene, the execution looked fine but I was lost most of the way. I tried to understand the plot by reading it on Wikipedia but I was still confused.As the film is highly acclaimed, I felt I had missed out on something until I read an excerpt from a dissenting reviewer Peter Hitchens of The Mail on Sunday who wrote that the plot would be too baffling for viewers who had not read the book, and that the film's makers had ""needlessly messed it up"". Another quote: ""Unfortunately, the plot is every bit as bewildering with an overload of spy-speak, a few too many characters to keep track of and a final act that ends with a whimper, rather than a bang.""So perhaps I would have gained more if I had read the novel. Likewise, this film is a condensed version of a previous adaptation that had been made into a seven-part TV mini-series. In the past, I did attempt a Le Carré novel in the 1980s, ""The Little Drummer Girl"" and gave up after about fifty pages. Maybe this is just not my thing though I've enjoyed other spy movies in the past. - dbamateurcritic.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brain not brawn,"It really is interesting to read the above reviews. I've just come back from seeing it and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wondered if for people who hadn't read the book or seen the TV series it would make sense, and obviously it doesn't. It also doesn't fit the change in perception that the current generation have needing an edit at least every 5 seconds and a linear storyline, that's not ageist, just what we in a much older generation have left as our inheritance, sadly. I really enjoyed the film references whether they are intentional or not, they range from Rear Window to La Nuit Americaine to Mr Bean's Holiday to Godard. Gary Oldman as Smiley is very good, much colder that AG and as in the book a bit younger. It is also less of the feel of a group of Oxbridge Dons in charge rather ex servicemen as MI5 was in those days. I was in my 20's in the early 1970's and the general dullness of everything during that time comes through very well. I would think that after they edited it they wished they hadn't had some rather crass graffiti so prominent, but I remember it was all over London at that time. Good film with a plot that makes you concentrate and you have to use your brain, well worth seeing, but don't go if you want thrills and spills.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Performances worthy of viewing this John LeCarre Mystery,"Fans of mystery writer John LeCarre will be delighted with this artistic ""film noir"" style interpretation of his best selling spy novel ""Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy"". Performances by Gary Oldman as the quietly brilliant George Smiley and Colin Firth as a mysterious leading character create all the viewer should need to enjoy this movie; but, having read LeCarre's book helps, as watching the artistry of the film goes only so far. Eventually, the viewer must come to an understanding of the plot- a story about the way clandestine operations were executed, figuratively and otherwise, in the days post Cold War. Lots of Sherlock Holmes ponder- thinking goes into Smiley's ultimate conclusions, which makes this story a classic. Oldman is the perfect Smiley, so he kept the often confusing script together, simply by bringing LeCarre's lead spy to life. I recommend this movie but also suggest the viewer enjoy LeCarre's book prior to viewing. Wonderful performances throughout the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good film but not as good as the BBC's adaptation,"Going into watching this film, I had recently watched the BBC adaptation, which is a master piece of television. So when I review this film, it is in comparison with the BBC version from 1979.Firstly I have to talk about the Mise en scène. The film is set in 1973 and everything is made to feel drab, desaturated and used, as if the 60s never happened. The feeling is that Britain is old, not the power that it once was, where bureaucracy is beginning to take over and everyone is feeling negative.Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a very strong cast and I think, mostly everyone does very well. Gary Oldman is one of my favourite actor and his portrayal of George Smiley is one of the most subtle and destingished performances I have seen from an actor, He is soft spoken, often letting his gestures and movements do the talking. Tom Hardy again shows that he is one of the best up and coming actors, dominates his scenes, with skill and vigour, that never goes over the top. It actually show the skill that Gary Oldman has that he doesn't feel the need to compete and it reinforces the gravitas that his character has.Benedict Cumberbatch is good in his role, though I don't always feel that he has a toughness that his character should have. Kathy Burke handles a very hard role well, though she isn't in the film for long and her scene doesn't feel as important, as I feel it should. The role of Control is probably the most over the top and for me works the least well. Mark Strong gives a good performance but I would have liked to see slightly more of his character.John Hurt tries very hard as a man running out of time but the character feels forced and doesn't quite work. I am not sure if this is down to the acting of just the way the character was originally written.With the four members of the top of the circus, I have mixed views. The film starts to try and build the four of them up but then fails to keep the early momentum going. I think the acting is well done, though Toby Jones character isn't nearly as pompous as I would have liked and David Dencik just breaks down to easily towards the end. Ciarán Hinds is a very strong actor but he isn't given enough to do which does leave a problem. Colin Firth plays the most likable character in the entire film and does a good job, coming over as friendly and reliable.I am not a fan of films where the cinematography is particularly noticeable and this is one of the more distracting things for me with the new version of the film. Hoyte Van Hoytema is a very talented director of photography and is quite amazing, for me Oscar worthy if you enjoy it. But I just found that the constant use of and changing of depth of field, especially in the first half of the film was too artsy. It didn't help much with the pacing of the film, which I will go onto in a while. The score by Alberto Iglesias is very underplayed but perfectly fits the tone of the film, never distracting and extremely subtle. There is also a very interesting moment in the film where is played which although from the 1930s works very well.Tomas Alfredson is a good director and I suspect a very good actors director, bringing out some very good performances. I cannot give complete praise though. Scenes don't always seem to flow as well as I would have liked, in conjunction with the cinematography there is a lot of lingering around, where nothing his happening, which is meant to show a character contemplating but is just slow.In the end though the biggest problem with the film is time, Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan have done a sterling job of trying to adapt John le Carré book, but I just don't feel that they can succeed in the time allowed for a film. There are just so many little things that the film has to either cut or condense, and some of the characters are never given the space that they need, to build up the tension that is needed for a 'who done it'.The film is not bad, in fact it is good. It cannot compete with the BBC series though and how ever good Gary Oldman, he runs up against the classic performance Alec Guinness gave in the role. If you have not seen the BBC series, I would suggest watching the film first and then watching the TV series because it is the definitive version of the story and also leads to Smiley's People which for me is even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very different type of spy film,"Those more accustomed to a 'modern' spy thriller may be overwhelmed by Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, which is a slow pace, well acted spy drama, full of interconnected sub-plots, over a dozen characters, and a mere one or two action sequences (all low key, realistic affairs). Thus, modern spy fans may well be disappointed; overwhelmed with the chronology defying story and bored with the film's snail's pace. But of course, this does not make Tinker, Tailor a bad film, but rather something very different from what modern audiences are used to.Tinker tailor is a strange kind of film; marketed as a thriller, it is in fact a story driven drama which keeps espionage and spying to such a minimum that at times one would struggle to even call it a spy film. James bond it is not; it is far darker and infinitely more realistic. Yet equally it is also in no way similar to the Bourne franchise, Bond's darker brother. In fact, Tinker Tailor has more in come with a character driven drama than any modern spy film.I entered the film with no prior knowledge of the film or it's source material (or previous adaptations for that matter), other than its basic plot line; that is, a retired spy (Oldman, on top form) is brought back into British Intelligence (Circus) to investigate the existence of a mole working for the Russians. This simple premise is quickly elaborated on, and I found that, with my lack of knowledge of the source material, combined with the films casual and frequent use of the flashback without warning, that I quickly lost track of the plot. Characters are brought in, disguised as main characters, and then never seen from again until much later in the film. Names are thrown around but as the audience is not that familiar with them it is easy to lose track of who is who, and perhaps worst of all, the huge ensemble cast means that each character (even , criminally, Oldman) is given little screen time and thus almost all our underdeveloped. I would have preferred the film to have been a bit longer, to allow all the characters to fully develop. This character development is never fully achieved, and so by the end of the film, it is hard for the viewer to even care about whom the mole is, and thus the final reveal is a real let down, with no tension or shock accompanying itFortunately, the film is about more than just the final reveal of who the mole is; the journey is equally important, and at times, this journey is incredibly exciting. Standout scenes include Cumberbatch's (again, underused, considering his ability) sneaky attempt at retrieving a file from Circus (one of the films few tense scenes), and the brilliant ending scene with the juxtaposed soundtrack. In fact, it is a shame that the film didn't have a few more scenes like the final one, which had a real scenes of fun and style, despite the violent and serious events portrayed .Moreover, anyone going to see the film with even a slight interest in cinema, will instantly realise the cast is a magnificent one; in fact it was really the cast that drew me to the film in the first place. Oldman is terrific, and it is good to see him in a meaty starring role again. In addition, there is an abundance of well known names including Colin Firth and John Hurt, and some relative newcomers; specifically Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch. All play their roles to perfection; it is hard to think of even a single weak link.Thus, the film in theory should be a good one; a great cast, combined with some excellent scenes, and an intriguing plot that demands multiple viewing. However, in practice, the overall package is a real let down. As previously mentioned, the film is very hard to follow for someone who has no prior knowledge of the source material. The complex plot is not helped by multiple flashbacks, and a huge cast of characters. I found it exhausting to keep track of the plot, and judging from the audience response in my screening (a handful of people walked out), I am not alone in thinking this. Thus, on first viewing, for a person in my position, this film is very much a disappointing one. The film is not quite what one would call a 'mess', but it is certainly all over the place.But, that does not mean it should not be seen; the complexity of the plot demands multiple viewings, and I can imagine it would be incredibly rewarding to watch the film over and over again, slowly piecing it together. Therefore, I would recommend that people in my position give the film a miss in the cinema, and instead get it as soon as possible on DVD; watch it once, then immediately watch it again.However, this will not affect everyone. I want to reassure all fans of the source material who have not seen the film, that they will more than likely enjoy this film, which I understand is a faithful adaptation. A fan will have no trouble following the film, and thus will be able to overcome my main problem with it.In summary, it is hard to recommend someone with no knowledge of the plot go and watch this film in the cinema; they will more than likely be, at the very least, slightly overwhelmed. However, I have no fears about recommending this film to those already comfortable with the plot; do not let my slightly sow review score put you off; this is merely my opinion (an outsiders opinion). It is more than likely that overtime, with repeat viewings, this film with gain a star or two, but, for now, I must give it only an above average rating of six stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The classic Cold War spy thriller turned into a ravishing looking thinking man's thriller,"I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness, but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a masterful re-telling of John le Carré's seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley (played majestically by Gary Oldman) is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill (which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position) when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman's face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece; expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt (who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley) and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense, but which also acts as important plot points and clues.The film is about the hunt for a Soviet 'mole' in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6 but fictitiously known as 'The Circus') by George Smiley, an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer, a British agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam (Bendedict Cumberbatch) who is Tarr's handler, Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership, anyone of whom might be the mole, headed by Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) and his deputies Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) – the 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' of the book (codenames assigned by Control, Head of British Secret Service).The director, Tomas Alfredson, established his reputation with 'Let the Right One In', an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too, is a film about human nature, moral dilemmas and relationships – friendship, loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like 'Let the Right One In' Alfredson imbues 'Tinker, Tailor', Soldier, Spy' (his first English language feature) with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient, but this is richly rewarded with scenes, shot after shot, that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming's vigorous secret agent. Indeed, Robert De Niro's admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 'The Good Shepherd' (2006) has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson – a 'grey man' whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of 'Tinker, Tailor' is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the 'grey man' (note Smiley's grey hair, grey countenance and grey suit replete with over-sized glasses and shambling gait) of the secret intelligence service wins the day.The screenwriters, Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor, have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour potboiler without losing any of its exposition, characters, and plotting. John le Carré and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man's film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship, loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world. If the film does 'King's Speech' levels of business I think it just might and Hollywood would be the richer for it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The best spy film ever made,"I've watched it at least 10 times now and I must say it's become a bit of an obsession. The sets, the music, the mis en scene, the acting - particularly Gary Oldman's subtle expressions and incredible depth of character - and the casting is so perfect and the direction so flawless! It's mind-boggling. Such an incredible ensemble of actors telling a tale of absolute horror with restraint and only a while after watching it do you appreciate the quiet heroism of Smiley. I can't fault it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Spy Thriller ""Jazz""","Jazz music comes from musicians ""playing around the notes"". In other words, instead of playing the root notes on the downbeat, they deliberately omit the obvious melody, and fill in the spaces with embellishments that suggest the primary structure. For the educated ear, the way the musician artfully colours between the lines is the source of entertainment. As a moviegoer, I don't mind being presented a puzzle, where you have to think a bit at how the movie is playing around the more conventional spy thriller notes. Strangely, this well heeled story may have become more of a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces missing purely because of the running time. Reportedly the running time was much longer in the original cut, so these holes in the story may have been cut out of necessity.I am writing this review after watching it a second time, and can say that all the motives and activities are accounted for. I have to commend screenwriters as well as the editor for patching together a complex but intricately told tale. Part of the fun is being aware of the ride you are being taken on. For instance, George Smiley, our main character, is seen a great deal of time without every actually speaking. And when he does speak, it is very calculated, since he doesn't know quite who to trust. There is a subtext about secret sexual relationships, where Smiley's wife appears in a couple scenes but you never see her face. The main group of suspects are a who's who of familiar faces from some of the best films in the last decade. The supporting cast delivers poignant exposition and avoids stereotype dialogue. I could easily see how someone may not like the longer gaps in explanation as to why a certain character appears to be dead and suddenly is alive in an unexpected way. But a similar type of mystery surrounds each of the main characters, and is eventually played out as part of the larger payoff, who is the traitor in the British intelligence service? The greatest appreciation one can have is the ability of the filmmakers to tell a story this complex using visual cues as much as possible. Key moments in the story are told with spare conversation, allowing the audience to mentally piece together what is implied. The stone faced hero played by Gary Oldman, is akin the quiet hero, such as the tight lipped vigilante gunslinger, who carefully carries out justice.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Small pleasures, big impact","Clearly wasted on the attention-deficit cohort, this slow-burner rewards the effort and concentration you give it tenfold. It is only when you see the characterisation that cinema is capable of, in films like this, that you realise how crudely drawn and unsatisfying most performances are at the moment. Others have commented on the plot, but that is not the most interesting part of Tinker Tailor. It is the pulse that is palpable in the small static moments, where every image and gesture seems to thrum with an expectation of something wrong; a jarring discord that never lets the audience settle. You are brought into the personae of the characters in a way that makes you feel culpable; never letting you off the hook morally. This film is so good - packed with a thousand tiny pleasures - that it is sad that not everyone loves it. I wish it had had the confident US release that it deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
spy thriller from le Carre,"Nominated for three oscars, so it can't be too bad! Best screenplay, best music, best actor. Gary Oldman is Smiley, who MI6 is bringing back to find the mole in the service. Co-stars John Hurt, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, and Ben Cumberbatch Filmed in 2011, it tells of the events taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, which le Carré wrote about in 1974. Oddly, this was a TV mini-series before it was made into a full length film. According to wikipedia dot com, John le Carré had actually worked for the british intelligence, which explains his expertise in writing about it! So suddenly nobody trusts anybody, and Smiley isn't even sure there is a mole. This one moves slowly... lots of talk and conjecture among friends.. or at least co-workers. No surprises, but it trudges right along. Friends, agents. All doing what must be done. It's okay. Directed by Tom Alfredson. Story by John le Carré. There was another project announced, ""Smiley's People"", but it looks like the status is still up in the air... le Carré passed away in december 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Coma Inducingly Boring,"This movie was so thoroughly disengaging and completely uninteresting, I found myself examining the scenes for a sign the movie would end soon. I couldn't tell. Almost every scene was utterly flat and pointless. The movie could have ended at nearly any moment without seeming abrupt. That's how slow this film was. Smiley killed every scene he was in. Any energy it may have had immediately died, shriveled, and crumbled to dust. One sidelong smirk merged into the next as the scenes slowly crept by. I prayed each closeup of Smiley's slack, expressionlessly face would be his last.Unless you enjoy utter boredom, skip this pointless and protracted journey into the, evidently, mind numbingly dull world of cold war espionage.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good attempt, but the mini-series is better","I have delayed seeing this movie until I had the time and disposition to watch the BBC mini series from 1979. Having seen both, I can now compare them. The series was a lot better. It showed the connections between the characters, the things that made the betrayals, the infighting and the revenges so important and so personal. The film doesn't quite make it so.And look at the great cast. I do feel it was underused. Ciarán Hinds and even Colin Firth shown only in a few scenes, John Hurt has a similar fate. Then there is the story. It follows pretty much the one in the series, but with a lot of the details removed. I agree it is the only way to cram more than five hours into a two hour film, but the choice of the things they left out bothered me.Bottom line: even having seen the miniseries, I couldn't grasp some of the details from the movie. The cerebral way in which the series was made turned into a glacial and impersonal view of the story in the film. I can't imagine I would have understood the feelings of any of the characters just by watching the movie. Also many of the important bits in the series were completely skipped here, like the power struggle in the Circus or the personal connection between Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon or even the continued humiliation of George Smiley on account of his wife's indiscretions. Even if lower budget and a lot slower paced, I would still recommend the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An impressive emotional labyrinth.,"In the twisty, desolate world of espionage present in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, director Tomas Alfredson and a lush ensemble cast dive us into a world deceit and distrust during the Cold War era. The premise is simple; in the top ring of MI6 (known as The Circus) there is a Soviet mole. What follows this, however, is anything but simple. Characters weave in and out, giving us answers but leaving with potentially more questions. Often times there are films dealing with deceit that present characters who have a small grasp of what's going on but not much of an idea of the overall picture; rarely has there been a film that leaves the audience feeling the same.It's this interesting tactic that I think sets Tinker apart in many ways. For every move that you understand there are one or two that are left mysterious; a motivation you're unsure of, a conversation that may not be everything it seems. I think Alfredson does a terrific job of, almost from the very moment the film begins, establishing a world so filled with double meanings that even the most casual conversation can lead the viewer to question if we're seeing what is really going on. There's so much below the surface that watching the film becomes as much of a puzzle as the one the characters are trying to figure out within it.A lot of credit here goes to writers Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, who are surprisingly skilled at condensing a very dense novel into a two hour film. Every now and then you can feel the effect of maybe some characters not being as fleshed out as they should, but for every scene that we might not see on camera, the actors make up for with an insightful look into their souls. Eye-acting is something that I've always admired greatly and just about every member of this deep ensemble is working that skill to the level.At the top of the hill is Gary Oldman as George Smiley, the recently retired agent who is tasked with the duty of cracking this labyrinthine code, and he absolutely shines. Oldman is a performer who has many times been praised high for his theatrical performances in films like Leon and Sid and Nancy where he bursts at the seams with emotion, but here he proves that he can do the opposite by keeping that wealth of feeling hidden beneath those big frames.Through all of the twists and turns of the narrative that goes on here, I think that the film ultimately shines brightest as a character piece, strangely enough. In spite of having to condense the story at the risk of some character development, it still ends up being this heartbreaking study of the men who go into this line of work. Along with Oldman there is a wealthy ensemble of performances that hauntingly portray the pain and suffering that decades of lies and paranoia can eventually take on someone.There's a scene where Smiley tells Benedict Cumberbatch's character about a time when he tried to turn a Soviet agent and in that scene Oldman displays the toll that this life has taken on him and it is devastating. He does it without shedding a tear or even pushing too hard on any syllable, but in those eyes and that voice you can feel the things that haunt him at night and it's powerful stuff. Of course the entire ensemble brings their A game here, with very notable performances from just about everyone.Almost everyone gets their moment in the sun, except for Ciaran Hinds, and they all manage to impress. I just want to single out Colin Firth, who absolutely broke my heart in his final scenes, and Mark Strong, who after the past few years of playing the stoic bad guy finally got to dig into a part with more emotional layers to it and he really nailed it. These veteran actors all give us that sense of what this life can do to a man, and the roles played by Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy are just as important looks into the beginning of a path that will eventually lead them to the same location.In that same scene with Oldman and Cumberbatch, he tells his young protégé that in this world you are constantly looking for the weakness in everyone else and the acting here shows us just that; everyone is putting up such a front, trying to remain cold and complacent, as to not allow anyone else to see any weakness for even a single second.The puzzle leads to a rather conventional place in the narrative sense, but what it does on a deeper level I found to be extraordinary. We enter a world where the people in it don't even know what their motivation is half of the time. It's a new kind of espionage out there and some of these pieces just feel like they're playing a part. Some of the dialogue is so bold and eye-opening for this kind of film, a rare look into the actual hearts and souls (or lack thereof) of these people, rather than just an excuse for some slick action.Of course the technical qualities of the film are aces across the board, from the very bleak and cold tone in which it's shot to the wonderfully impressive set designs, but for me it really came down to this painstaking study of these people. I find it interesting when people say that they were bored by the film, because with this tone and these wounded creatures I honestly wish I could have watched this play out all day long.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Smart and well-executed adaptation,"Finally caught this wonderful film on DVD. Being a fan of le Carré's work I wasn't keen on watching it on the big screen. But I should have! Asides from the spectacular performances, the indelible score and the deftly nuanced direction, the adaptation itself handles most of the novel's complexities quite effectively. It's surprising, affecting and even touching. Yes, the Alec Guinness TV version is fondly remembered by most. However, I felt that this new version is more effective in how it challenges the viewer so that the reward at the end is exponentially more satisfying. Indeed, this is the type of film that begs to be screened more than once and I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that doesn't insult our intelligence,"I read all the ""bored to death/too confusing"" negative reviews and ""it demands multiple viewings to understand"" positive reviews before watching. I personally found both not true. I thoroughly enjoyed the intricate plot, extremely slow-paced intensity, superb performances and beautiful cinematography at the first viewing. If you are bored by this film you should stick to the shootout & explosion-type action flicks or rom-coms that explain everything with wordy dialogues. Those who find it too confusing to understand and give it one star should seriously grow some brain cells.
Gary Oldman is simply sublime as George Smiley. The script has almost zero exposition but you can clearly see what's going on by just watching his face and demeanor. He raises his voice only once in the entire movie and it's enough to show Smiley's anger, pity and contempt to the mole. Truly great example of ""less is more"" subdued acting. A standout among the stellar supporting cast is Mark Strong. I couldn't take my eyes off him whenever he's in the scene. Prideaux is perhaps the most human character in Tinker and he played it perfectly.
Overall this is a brilliant film in that it trusts its audience. Yes it takes concentration (and brain cells) to enjoy but it's really nice to see an adult film that doesn't play up to the desire for easy gratification of lazy moviegoers. Definitely a future classic in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece,"I have watched this movie 5 times, and I would love to do it 5 more times again; it will actually be my preference over anything I might have available to sit down to and don't quite feel like risking, any time I feel like doing it again.It has that perfect mixture of a good old European crime movie flow, underpinned with some of the best contemporary music ever adapted for the screen. And then it adds some of its own mystery on top of that.The cast is mesmerising, the plot just about difficult enough to figure out on the first watch, so the remaining four runs for me were simply pure indulgence in being able to watch a masterpiece again from four different perspectives and not be bored a minute each and every time.In fact, I enjoyed it more and more, every single time I've seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Neuters the Novel,"From the director of the amazing LET THE RIGHT ONE IN comes a movie with the same economy of image, but certainly not of narrative. Cinematographer, and general genius, Hoyte Van Hoytema turns in a vision of an era that seems almost entirely reliant on muted colors and a constant interior asbestos haze, which feels a little lazy, though the use of a lot of long lenses does successfully give the viewer the sense that they're spying on the whole endeavor from afar. The art and set decoration is amazing, with London at the end of its post-war weariness coming off looking particularly nice. All the actors are excellent except for Gary Oldman who manages somehow to overact even when playing the contained and muted George Smiley. The reveal at the end has all the bite of an old toothless dog and is arrived at in such a by-the-numbers fashion that it seems like a chore that needs to be gotten out of the way. The thing is that Le Carré's work may be this dense and even ""plodding"", but it's never this cold or unengaging. In suppressing and condensing everything the film makers have done him a disservice. All and all I'm a huge fan of real world spy thrillers and a student of the Cold War, and this is, of course a fictional retelling of the Cambridge Five traitors incident, so there's a lot here for people like me to enjoy and I do recommend it for that reason. The quiet reality of the Cold War is so rarely depicted in film and I'm always excited when someone tries. But when it's all said and done, I prefer the BBC mini-series staring Alec Guinness by a long shot, it simply seems to have more life in its bones.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Looking Film but Very Confusing,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)*** (out of 4)Gary Oldman plays George Smiley, a retired British agent who is placed back into the field to try and uncover the identity a mole within the ranks of the M16's who is giving information to Russia. TINKER TAYLOR SOLDIER SPY, adapted from John le Carre's novel, is certainly a very well-made movie and it features some terrific performances but I must admit that I got lost several times. It seems most people are commenting that they can't figure out the story and it seems many people are hating the movie for this and I can't blame them. However, even though I couldn't figure out all of the plot points, this type of confusion reminded me of THE BIG SLEEP with Humphrey Bogart, another movie where you couldn't follow the story but that didn't take away from the entertainment. Director Tomas Alfredson (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) does a marvelous job at keeping the film moving at a good pace even though it's deliberately a very slow one. It seems like the director wants to get every bit of detail within the frame so there are very slow, drawn out sequences where not much happens but you can look around and just about everything will grab your attention because you never know if it's a clue or not. I really loved the cold atmosphere that he brought to the film and it's almost identical to his vampire movie. The other very strong point is that you got some terrific actors doing strong work. Oldman is so great here that I'm surprised he's gotten as much attention as he has. This isn't James Bond and there's not a single bit of flash to his character but that's what makes the performance so great. I'm sure most actors would have wanted to add more flair to the part and this is something that Oldman did in many of his early great performances. He doesn't do that here and instead he really gives such a low-key performance that you just sit there riveted because his eyes tell you everything you need to know. What also impressed me was the way he came off to be constantly thinking about everything he's taking in. Several actors have talked that it's important to listen and think while on camera and Oldman does that brilliantly here. It certainly doesn't hurt that you have impressive support by Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, David Hencik, John Hurt and Tom Hardy. Again, the story makes very little sense or at least to me, someone who hasn't read the novel but everything else is just so perfectly done that the film remains entertaining.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Overall, it was an enjoyable ride.","I am a life-long fan of John Le Carré. He is one of my favourite 20th Century authors – and he is still going strong in his 70's. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier, Spy' was a classic of the cold war spy genre and it wasn't long ago that I watched the BBC 1979 adaptation, which I enjoyed very much, although I found the background music somewhat grating. So it was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch the 2011 celluloid version of Le Carré's classic.On the whole I did enjoy it and I think I will probably watch it again as I feel it is that rare kind of film that requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate its 'finer points'. I have to say that if I hadn't read the novel and recently watched the BBC version, I doubt that I would have had much idea about what was going on. The film is a 'film noir' to outdo all 'film noirs' and I think you would have you be a bit of a clever-clogs to really follow all the nuances of the convoluted plot if you hadn't previously read the book or seen the BBC adaptation. But given that I had and I did, I managed to follow where the film was going – just about, as they did change some of the finer points of the story line. I also found some of the scenes quite brilliant in their ability to evoke to a bygone age and atmosphere.I am now devoted fan of Gary Oldman who gave a masterful portrayal of George Smiley, but I do feel that most of the other main characters were pretty one-dimensional. Not the actors' faults, as they were all top drawer, and did their best with the material at hand, but more a fault of the screenplay. The exception to this was Smiley's wife, of whom we only ever caught the briefest glimpses, yet in some indefinable way, we somehow knew all about her. It is a 'patchy' piece of work – brilliant in parts and sometimes baffling, but never, as some have asserted, boring.The plot moves along in brief 'snapshots' of dialogue and action and as a consequence, you have to be pretty quick-witted to fully appreciate what is actually happening. Overall, it was an enjoyable 'ride', and I particularly loved the scenes of the spooks' 70's 'office Christmas party', which were so evocative, grotesque and almost scary. I also loved the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. Oh the music is totally brilliant!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Amazing cast help to overcome flaws,"The cast here is so exceptional - easily one of the best ensembles this century - and the story crafted so meticulously, that it overcomes the fact that for most of its runtime I was only comprehending it on the margins. This is 20lbs of story stuffed into a 10lb sack, but by the end most of the tumblers had fallen into place and the end result was an intense, white-knuckle spy thriller without one car chase or shootout.As I said, the cast is amazing, but not more so than Gary Oldman. The man is a chameleon, and this may be the finest performance of his career. But he's only one of a dozen great performances that help to shove aside any flaws and make 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' a fantastic spy thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film beautifully shot,"I really enjoyed this film. Gary Oldman's portrayal of George Smiley was brilliantly enigmatic. I liked the way the characters and locations were introduced verbally by another character and then visually in the film, so it was always clear where the action was taking place and who was in the scene. All the complex threads of the story were followed clearly. I remember trying to follow Tinker, Taylor, Soldier Spy when it was televised in days before video recordings were available and, if you missed an episode, you lost the plot! Not so with this film, which with a strong cast and intelligent filming makes for a completely engaging film. It will keep you guessing and get you trying to work out who the mole is to the very end. It was great to watch and the music was well chosen, complementary and not intrusive, never obscuring the dialogue. It makes a change for a film to challenge you to try to anticipate the twists and turns of the plot. This is definitely a watch-again film and I look forward to seeing more like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unforgivably boring,"I never got to see the original BBC series that this film originates from , although i do remember when it was on. I was a little too young on the 70's to watch it . This film brilliantly replicates the seventies look and has some superb acting from the cream of the British acting fraternity so it begs the question - Why was this film so boring ?This is the story of a group of British diplomats who find they have a mole amongst them. The cold war with Russia is at it's height and nobody on either side can be trusted.Gary Oldman has been nominated for an Oscar for his role as George Smiley and he is really good as are a few others but unsurprisingly Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy , the film , hasn't been nominated.This film really is slow. Don't get me wrong . it's definitely watchable because of the acting but the story is a complete non event. There is no tension , there is no excitement , there is no ooommph in the film.I've heard reviewers say that this is not a film about spy's but a film about trust and to some extent that is true but there is no cranked up tension whatsoever for the audience to feel any emotion about the characters.

Looking for depth and found dull,"This is quite possibly the dullest film I have ever seen. I was hoping for something a little more engaging on a Sunday afternoon but struggled to stay awake through it. It is a fairly simple story line and you know where it is going but instead of a tale with twists and turns it takes a basic linear path. In order to feign complexity all the Director did was cut up the time line. It didn't help that they focused on a particular character in a certain way which was out of context with how other characters were dealt with. Why did they do that? Oh because he is the bad guy. I was hoping that was a red herring. Unfortunately not, the guy I thought it would be 30 minutes into the film was indeed the bad guy.

"Good, but no comparison with the series","Not one for the Dartford audience, evidently. There was only one other person there for the late showing. You would have to have read the book or seen the series to follow it immediately, I think, or at least to appreciate the tensions that drove the story. The BBC series is my favourite DVD - I have watched it many times, and this suffers in comparison - to be fair, it had  hours to tell the tale, where the film had only 2. Gary Oldman turns in what could either be described as a beautifully restrained, or merely constipated, performance, depending on how charitably disposed you are to the film. There were some excellent performances throughout, some great casting, but it wears its artifice rather too consciously for my liking. Oldman plays a great Smiley. But Alec Guinness WAS Smiley. And that's the mark of a great story. This was merely very good. Worth seeing, but I won't be watching it 6 or 7 times in the future. Not like the series. If you only have £10, don't go and see this.

I couldn't tell if there were 10 or 50 time changes. I could tell from the silence in the auditorium last night that no one else understood it either, perhaps this is why the critics have given it such high ratings. I think this gratuitous confusion added to the film really takes away from it. I won't bother trying to watch and understand it again.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you enjoy dry, quiet films, this is for you (and me).","This is a very boring film. Seriously, although I enjoy it, it has a deep grey tone to it that is not shaken off at any point. There is a complexity of names, of situations and events involving the main characters that is perhaps better understood by those who read the novels, but for a stranger to the story, may very well prove to be both incomprehensible and frustrating.Despite these flaws, there is a steadiness and calmness to the film that will suit quiet and contemplative afternoons. The acting is very believable. The serious nature of circumstances eventually becomes weighty and of interest. This film is played very straight, and I admire it for that. I also admire its lack of flair, in these times of visual and thematic extravagance.Many viewers will get bored and switch off, and that is very understandable. But if you manage to get half way through, and still feel engrossed, then this film may well prove to be a gem for you. If you find that you enjoyed it, repeat viewings are essential. I would argue that this film improves with at least three or four.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as good as the mini-series,"I realize a two hour movie has to cut things out that a mini-series running five hours can leave in. However, it seems the heart of the mini-series was cut out. In the end, this is a suspense story - who was the spy (or spies)? In the mini-series, we are early on introduced to Alleline, Haydon, Bland and Esterhase, particularly in flashbacks when Smiley approaches them individually, at Control's request. We can also see motives for spying - Esterhase is a foreigner, and unmotivated by British patriotism, Haydon is a fop, Bland is working class with a left-wing background, Alleline has characteristics which would bring to mind Kim Philby. This is gone in the movie, we're barely introduced to the suspected spies, and have no ideas what the motives are.Then at the end of the movie, when it is revealed, we still don't really get an idea what the motivation for spying was, like we get in the mini-series. The entire Cold War context of this is drained. There was a real Cambridge Five in England, five men from the best families who went to the best schools, yet chose loyalty to the Comintern and the USSR over England. Fiction pieces like this are partially an exploration on what the motivations of such men would be, yet this is completely missing in the film. Absent the suspense, and the character motivations, the movie is rather empty. If they had switched around who the spy was in the movie, would it have made any difference? The answer is no, and that's the failing of this movie, ultimately there's about as much suspense as what card might get picked out of a deck - the answer is drained of all meaning.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great,Underated masterpiece with great acting. Movie is dificult but worth watching.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Neither Great nor Bad,"Technically an excellent film, with good to very good performances by all the main actors. Some of the ""games"" were cute, such as never actually seeing the supposedly beautiful Ann Smiley.While it is always fair game to re-do a screen story, there were at least a couple of annoying ""improvements"" to both the book and to the 1979 BBC mini-series. The one the sticks in my throat is making the character of Peter Guillam - played robot-like by ""Sherlock"" - gay. Why? It added nothing to the story, unless you assumed that his devoted service to Smiley was somehow sexual, which is absurd. Also in 1973 an open gay would probably be quickly booted out of the SIS.But I do sympathize with those who complain that the storytelling was ""boring."" There were too many long shots of Smiley walking along a street, for no reason. I lived in London in the 70s, and, while much glitzier today, it was not all the grim, dirty, run down place the director created. That was more London of the (early) 1950s.Also there was actually no ""puzzle"" for the viewer to solve, as we get only a tiny look at any of the potential traitors. So this business about a ""thinking man's thriller"" is nonsense. No thought is required.Once again considerable talent has been invested in a film which somehow just doesn't reach its potential. Sad, really.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well Crafted, Superbly Acted Film with Details that Lingers in Your Mind","Saw this at a special screening. LOVED IT. I'm bummed that the limited release doesn't open in any theater close to me, yet. I would've love to see it again. Not that it was confusing to watch or anything. But I found the layers and details so intriguing, it'd be purely entertainment just to see it again and savor everything. There are so many details that I still go through in my head even after weeks of seeing it.The pacing was perfect. For me personally, it was gripping. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, which has a lot to do with all the great performances in the film. I don't think there was a weak or bad performance by anyone.Gary Oldman is simply mesmerizing. I've been a long time fan. And to see him taking on a lead role like this is just....heaven. With the smallest infliction or twitch, he can convey so much information as well as emotion. In such a stoic character, I could still feel his character's incredible loneliness as well as his resolute for ideal. I can go on for pages about how terrific I think this performance is. If he doesn't get some award recognition for this, I'm going to be sick.Kathy Burke's cameo was superb. Her scene with Oldman ranks one of the best in the film.Like many others, I really enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy in the film too. Both of them have these moments that really touched me. Yes, they are not huge emotional moments that are ""designed"" to elicit some sob reaction from the audience. But that's precisely why they are so well done. They don't seem forced or contrived. (I personally can't stand those fabricated ""emotional"" scenes with the big crescendo music behind it just begging you to please cry.)I agree that the film can be distancing emotionally at times. I can see why some might dislike that trait. Thought it doesn't bother me at all. It fits the entire tone and theme (distance) of the film. And when it's time to get the glimpse into the characters' emotional state, I completely felt the pain and loneliness that the film wanted to portray.It ranks as one of the best films of the year on my list.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You must be kidding,"Let's start with the very simple premise that all filmmakers know, one page of script is roughly equal to one minute of film time. I did not read the novel nor see the TV series, but I am told the novel is 400 pages. Taking that into account the film must cut corners and cut corners they did. The movie was filmed with an absolute cloak of heaviness and shot well, but I did not see any groundbreaking techniques. What did come across was a heavy dose of despair. They managed to fit all the complexities of this masterful spy plot, but they left ALL character connections DOA. Gary Oldman does his best to convey the character and demeanor of a person that would occupy that station. That is simply not enough.It was well acted for what was written. Well shot for where and when it took place. But it simply made no connection whatsoever to the characters and the audience. If you read the book your mind will most likely fill the gaps automatically, but for the rest of us it simply was devoid of interest. This was way more ""The Good Sheperd"" than ""No Way Out"". I love a good slow character driven movie. This movie was slow and with no character development. It will no doubt win many awards and be a favorite, but mostly from accolades it did not earn.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unnecessarily Confusing.,"If anybody says they could follow this movie without having read the book, they are not telling the truth. The movie is unnecessarily complex and confusing and not the least bit enjoyable to watch.I would advise people to skip the first 2 hours of this movie and just catch the final 8 minutes. They will find out everything they need to know without having to endure a great deal of confusion and frustration.I think this movie falls into the same category as the story about The Emperor Who Had No Clothes.

If you saw the Alec Guiness TV version of TTSS and thought it was one of the best spy thrillers you've seen then prepare to be taken to a higher level with this film.I read the book four times, saw the TV series about three times and am already planning to go see this again. I won't go on anymore just suffice to say ""Go and See this Film!"" you will definitely NOT be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Engrossing, slow-burn espionage drama is adult viewing","It says a lot about the film that there's a post at the front page right now calling it the emperor's new clothes, doesn't it? Oh, the film may turn out to be complete bunk when you watch it, but you just know it's going to be interesting. Right?It is. It's one of the most engrossing stories I've been told. It ticks for me all the same boxes The Lives of Others did; Cold War, cold souls, coded eyes looking everywhere. The very best that cinematic deceit can offer.I cannot tell you what it does or doesn't to the book and TV series, only that I was so stoked that I have the latter here with me to watch. But that is another post.This, this you have to work to enjoy. It's directly structured to receive you but you have to be the spy, actively so. To better explain how this works, imagine Nolan had done this. There would be an architectural puzzle you'd be called to solve, boxes to arrange, but constant verbiage that would point for you the order of the pieces. It would seem like cerebral work, where in fact it would be like doing a crossword. Why this works by contrast, is the complete abstraction that permeates the story. Here, in dingy murky England, as well as abroad, then as well as now; there are no clear demarcations, and no one to guide us. Our detective is as much a cipher as anyone else, also part of the chess pawns we're called to move.The broader idea is that the powers in control of this world that many of us experienced from one corner and believed elsewhere to be better, brighter, are equally ruthless, equally cunning, that the game unfolding between them has been so diffused it has drained the world of any color that would make a difference. England looks every bit as we were told was on the other side of the Curtain, pallid shambles.So in order to get to the bottom of things, you have to abstract from your end. It's not enough to see spies outwit each other, you will have to see like one. You will need to be able to see every detail without being bogged down by any. You will need to leave this as you found it, having touched every corner. Move swiftly back and forth between the pieces, and move passionless, detached, knowing it's going to be always a little bigger and more intricate than you can immediately fathom.Gary Oldman is simply superb in this, a role he cultivated as Gordon in the Batman films. It's a joy to be able to watch a great actor erase his presence.For Smiley the point is to solve the case. Ours is getting to see how he tinkers and tailors the narrative. The resolution is an anti-climax, and we get to know all there is to know here. It was an aesthetic choice we learn, as much as a moral one.Again neither of this is what is at stake in our film. Aesthetically, it is a simply drab, controlled affair. It was perhaps a wise choice that a Swede was brought in to direct, from a country that never having had any stakes in the game. But it's the only false note here, because he merely colors the thing. Morally, the whole thing is meant to be moot. Who knows what ruthlessness Smiley and Control perpetrated from their end.No, the point is that you get to watch a world unfold beyond control. You can only spy. The whole shifting world is a distant reflection on your glasses. I get shivers just thinking what Antonioni could have done with this, it should have been his project after The Passenger.",,Anonymous,Mystery
No match for the original TV series,"Part of John Le Carré's brilliance is his ability to show the physical and psychological claustrophobia of his spy world as an extension of the social claustrophobia of the British political and intelligence classes, how the exquisitely petty social snobberies that define these people to one another also provide the scaffolding for how the intelligence machine runs while constraining its imagination and abilities. It has to smell stuffy and sour like a senior common room or a scuffed-up gentlemen's club for the characters and their motives to work. But this film inhabits some art-dream of 1960s London, Prague and Paris where the spaces are implausibly wide and cinematic and the characters like placed statues, not the drab smoky offices, cage elevators and tormented snobs of Le Carré's books. The film comes over as very design-driven, its world and characters an art piece rather than anything really evocative of the British spy world of the 1960s-70s. It's interestingly filmed, but the world is made of visual set pieces that don't always ring true, and sometimes the design is distracting - as, for example, when the actors' faces are almost obscured by a ton of buzzing ""period"" film grain. The original TV series did a much better job of integrating character, plot and setting much more plausibly.The film also has to move too fast for the plot, which means they had to cut and simplify so ruthlessly that It feels like a mere gesture towards the original story, a skeleton with no warm flesh. As such, it's rather uninvolving. Everyone does a decent job, and they're all great actors, but there wasn't much material for most of them to work with once all of the meaningful silences had been accommodated and the detail cut out. Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Tom Hardy as Ricky Tarr give the most emotionally arresting performances. There was very little hint of Smiley's rich inner life in Gary Oldman's portrayal, which may be more the script's fault than his own. But the characters of Smiley, Hayden and Esterhase were so much richer in the 1979 TV series than they are here, and if you've seen the original it's hard not to miss that.So not a bad film, competent and visually interesting, but emotionally very weak compared to the novel or the original TV series. It turns out that the intricacy of the original story and the accuracy of its social and physical portrayals are much of what made it so gripping. Pared down this much, it loses its grip.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Either I am a complete idiot (it IS possible) or this movie was incredibly boring....or both!,"I have a VERY high ability to pay attention to very long films (having seen all of the Russian version of ""War and Peace"" at 414 minutes---TWICE, as well as ""The Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" at 883 and 1620 minutes each), although I could not stick with ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"". I even tried watching this film on two different occasions--and just found my mind wandering. It isn't that the acting is bad (the film is made up of wonderful actors such as John Hurt and Colin Firth). And, perhaps it isn't because the story sucks--as a bazillion copies of the book have been sold and it also was a very successful British TV series. No, to me the trouble is the mood. The director chose to film the movie in the most somber manner possible. As a result, despite being a spy film, there is almost no energy. And everything is GRAY--very, very gray. Despite 1973 being a year known for its outrageous colors, everyone in the film wears gray and brown suits---and even the brown looked rather gray! This, combined with oppressively dismal music just made this a very unpleasant viewing experience for me. So unpleasant, I just didn't care at all for the characters and was kind of hoping international Communism would win JUST to shake it up and provide some interest!!

An older agent named George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is suspicious of The Circus and he recruits an operative named Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help him get intel on The Circus's activities.This movie requires your full attention.

Thoroughly disappointing,"I love the '79 TV serial and the book it was based on. I went to this expecting, given the cast and LeCarre's involvement, that it would be an interesting attempt to compress and update the original and that the noble effort would fall short. Unfortunately, this film is a disaster at every level. Not a single element rises to the level of the original, most are far worse, and the failures are stupid and unnecessary.In the course of trimming the material to film-length, someone decided to leave out character development. Lacon, Bland, Esterhazy and Haydon are semi-dimensional ciphers and Alleline and Control are peevish wasps. What a waste! Oldman, playing Smiley, tries for reserve and manages to look petrified; the botox budget must have been enormous. I have never appreciated the expressive and nuanced performances of Alec Guiness and the rest of the original cast so much.By all means, watch the DVD of the original and its sequel.

For Mature Audiences,"Yes, in the not too distant past Tomas Alfredson's film version of John Le Carre's engaging mystery-spy thriller would have certainly attained an ""M"" from the old ratings board, though not due to any overt displays of sexuality or nudity; and while there is one hilarious bit of profanity tossed out in the midst of the slow, icy grip of the plot developments, the language used by most of the characters in the film could hardly be described as ""mature"" in the pejorative sense.No, the maturity of TINKER is indicated chiefly by the staid, stoic behavior of the indisputably adult figures who go about their business in their chosen profession and by the intricate, labyrinthine permutations of the unfolding tale. And the tale is set into motion by one objective: find the mole. Who is the spy (from the other side) who has been gathering information on the other spies (from our side?)? As depicted here the answer to the question does not come easy at all; finding the mole is painstaking, dangerous, even deadly work. This is James Bond for grown-ups; Mission: Impossible for (perhaps) the seriously middle- aged (though not exclusively). Pyrotechnic exhibitions and ingenious toys of destruction would serve little or no purpose in a film such as this. Indeed, as already pointed out by quite a few reviewers on this site, aficionados of the ""high concept"", low complexity, jump cut, action-driven school of filmmaking may find themselves searching for the exit door after the first thirty minutes or so of TINKER.The audience is asked to attend and attend closely from the very outset and if there is bafflement in the viewers in determining who the mole is, there is equal bafflement among the characters in the film owing to the twists and turns and deceptions of the plot and the utter elusiveness of that slippery mole: the bafflement as well as the satisfying conclusion is well earned due to an excellent script, a tour de force of ensemble acting brilliance and superb direction.Despite the very entertaining restraint of the characteristically volatile Gary Oldman (it was fun watching him rein in his energy and verve) the George Smiley on display here, though subdued in appearance and demeanor, cuts a more dashing figure than the bland cipher created in the novel and later portrayed with nondescript perfection by Alec Guinness in the 1979 television series. There were six hour long episodes in the television show and if memory serves the show was also a very engaging viewing experience; there was, naturally, far more time to delve into character and clarify (but not simplify) certain elements of the story.Still, with a running time of just over two hours Alfredson achieves a wondrous compression of detailed information that, again, keeps you well engaged and yet gives the impression of a very sober, deliberate, unhurried immersion into a world apart, a world where trust is a rare commodity and where that close associate looking at you with cool yet friendly detachment from across the conference table may just be planning your imminent demise.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

About as good an espionage film as you can ask for,"This film, like the book and like the first version on film, is an accurate depiction of ""the great game"" during the Cold War. It's also a good representation of the politics and personalities in play within the SIS, particular at the top levels.The original portrayal of George Smiley by Sir Alec Guinness was so perfect, it's been impossible to imagine anyone else even coming close. Gary Oldman proves me wrong in this. He, and much of the cast, represent some of the very best of British acting, and seeing them in an ensemble setting like this is a joy.This is an intellectual film, a thinking-person's spy film, about a time when espionage was all old-school trade-craft, long before the days of Keyhole satellites, cyber-sleuthing, and hacking sat-phones. How the pieces of the puzzle are slowly identified and eventually put together to reveal the mole within MI6 is the core of the story, and watching these very fine actors make there way through it makes for a great viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tinker Tailor Spy Soldier,"Saw this one in cinema eventually several days ago, as usual, I am totally ignorant to the eponymous worldwide bestseller novel or the BBC TV mini-series in 1979 starring Sir Alec Guinness. And my instant response when the ending-credits rolls is that it is too intricate for a feature film and with sustained jumping back and forth of the actual narrative, a first viewing could barely serve as an introduction.The grainy texture of the film is retro and unassuming, like its protagonist George Smiley, and a lengthy running time with tepid fixation to the minimal details are tiring, foolhardily devoid of any suspenseful theatrical stunt (the scene of file-theft in the Circus library could merely be qualified for the aim); sundry gory scenes of death are infelicitously irrelevant with the film's avowed self-effacing tone, anyway, the film is too hard-bitten for my digestion system in a way grating my patience and diminishing my interest.Nevertheless the film has bountiful merits to demonstrate that it has its offbeat appeal, particularly towards its cold-war spy genre buffs, a pervasive austere gray-blue palette could not be more emblematic for the back story and director Tomas Alfredson's (whose debut LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008 is an unsurmountable milestone for any budding directors) knack for manufacturing a stylized cine-atmosphere is unswerving, a love-it-or-hate-it aftermath is predestined.The acting is practical but underwhelmed, Gary Oldman is acclaimed merely because it is against his stereotyped flare-up spitfire, and due to an appalling shame he had never been nominated before this film, at any rate it is not a new fuss, just an unspoken consensus all the players comply. So I do sincerely wish this will not be Mr. Oldman's career peak as we all know he could do way better! Among a male-studded supporting cast, Mark Strong is remarkably excellent against that almost everyone character is in somewhat underdeveloped ellipsis (save for Smiley), also a thumb-up for Kathy Burke, who magically generates the one and only chuckling.I admire the effort, but the platitude is that not all masterpieces could be made into films, so a mixed feeling of unsatisfied still hovers.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very poor casting, the story brutally trimmed back to what (and where it) was cheap to film, and all mixed up anyway as the writer seemed keen on avoiding the examples of the preceding production, and of the book. My goodness, they made a ridiculous dwarf out of Percy Alleline, and a beau out of Bill Hayden, as if they thought the audience would not understand their roles otherwise. Agreed, Le Carres original novels are complex, and rich of detail, wit and character, so not really suited for the mass market. This film seems to be an attempt to reduce the detail and refinery of the novel in order to make it all better digestible for the people who are not fond of detail and refinery.

Depends if you've seen the BBC serial,"As someone who watched the original BBC adaptation in 1980 and admired it as one of the best BBC series ever made, watching this film was a disappointment. It suffers by comparison in almost every respect. At key scenes I kept thinking back to the BBC version: Smiley's interviews with Connie, beautifully played by Beryl Reid; the scenes with Jerry Westerby played by Joss Ackland; the introduction to the main characters as we see them enter the Circus meeting room for the first time - particularly Percy's elaborate pipe filling. In this version we have moved on three scenes in the time it takes Percy to tamp down his tobacco.And that is one of the major problems with this film, the plot exposition is so compressed. It has been well done, but it was the slow unfolding of the 'beautiful knot' that was half the pleasure. The other half was the incomparable acting led by Guinness. Gary Oldman is a seriously good actor, but Guinness was a great actor and could convey with a gaze or a look the deep intelligence and melancholy at the heart of the character in a way that Oldman can't.Even the recreation of the 1970's, though convincing , has to be strived for, whereas in 1979 it was just there for the BBC, ready to be used.

Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy,"This film is mildly recommended.The spy game ain't what it used to be. That's apparent when one compares the recent arrival of two films of espionage this holiday season. The differences are quite startling. The first offering is Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, a retro look at the spy industry and the Cold War mentality during the 1970's. ( The second entry is Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol, but more on that film next week. )Trying to condense John le Carré 1974 British spy novel can be a formidable task, almost as daunting as finding a mole within the hierarchy of agents. Once an award winning seven part miniseries starring Alec Guinness in the lead role of George Smiley, TTSS now stars Gary Oldman as that super spy sleuth. Obviously, this film adaptation is shorter in length. It also sacrifices some important exposition, character motivation, and plot development in the process of revision.The plot, for those who don't know the original source, involves a double agent working secretively in British Intelligence. Control ( John Hurt ), the head of the organization, has narrowed down and code-named the list of suspects to include: Percy Alleline ( Tinker, played by Toby Jones ), Bill Haydon ( Tailor, a well cast Colin Firth ), Roy Bland ( Tailor, Ciarán Hinds in this role ), and Smiley himself ( Spy ). Also possibly on the list is Toby Esterhase ( David Dencik ). First Contol sends Jim Prideaux ( Mark Strong ) on the mission to track down the true identity of the mole ( if he chooses to accept the mission, which he does ). Things go terribly awry and soon George Smiley is heading the investigation.Oldman makes an effective Smiley, a man betrayed and unable to trust others within the organization. He is remote and cold, a bit of an enigma himself. Behind his wide frame glasses, Smiley remains a detached observer of the behavior swirling around him. The actor shows off this side of the man extremely well. But as it is written here, Oldman fails to bring out the insecurities and eccentricities of the main character. There is solid support by the aforementioned Firth, Dencik, and Strong, plus Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy as the younger breed of undercover agent. But some of the other supporting characters are given short rift and their lack of sufficient screen time hinders the compelling mystery. Ably directed by Tomas Alfredson, the film's structure and editing needlessly jumps forward and back in time, adding more confusion to an already dense plot. Though the mystery is finally resolved by the end, the moviegoer's journey to discover the culprit becomes harried and exhausting. Yes, the conclusion makes logical sense, but the film's lackadaisical pacing is all too tedious and conventional with the film's episodic format, undercutting any real impact.By far, the high point of TTSS is the fine period details in its costuming by Jacqueline Durran and the production design by Maria Djurkovic. Female secretaries, fashionably dressed, decode cryptic numerical messages as they listen to wiretapped conversations on large tape recorders, furiously pounding the keyboards on their then state-of-the art typewriters. Alfredson relishes the dated images as he creates a non-computerized world that never fails to fascinate in its atmospheric surroundings. ( A nice touch is the chessboard inspired boardroom at Intelligence headquarters. ) The director also films much of the action, or really the non-action, with distant shots ( ala Hitchcock's Rear Window ), or through grungy windows and narrow corridors to establish the paranoia of the times. The look of the film is so bloody good to watch!Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is just too convoluted for its own bloody good to thoroughly enjoy! GRADE: B-NOTE: The movie poster, with its clever mix of numbers and words, is one of the strongest thematic designs this year. As Oldman adjusts his spectacles for a closer look, the viewer is drawn into his stare. As we take a closer look, we can notice the changing hues of text that define his character and have hidden clues to the film itself. Just brilliant!NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
excellent movie,"Great movie, one of those movies you do have to watch more than once, to get the full jest of what's going on, but it's such a relief to watch a spy movie, that's not like a James Bond movie. A realistic enjoyable movie, excellent acting, great plot.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Darn Near Close to a Masterpiece,"I was hooked on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy from my first viewing of the trailer. Everything about it, from the gritty film print to the unmistakable voice of John Hurt down the pulsating background music, was exhilarating. Oh, and then there's Gary Oldman. No actor draws me in quite like Oldman and Oldman in a rare starring role is even more appealing. I looked forward to TTSS more than any other film of 2011 (outside of Harry Potter) and built it up so much in my mind that there was no way it could ever live up to my expectations. Or so I thought.In the midst of the Cold War, the head of MI6, Control (John Hurt), becomes aware of a mole within his organization. The operation to unearth the spy goes terribly wrong, however, and Control is forced to resign along with George Smiley (Oldman), a member of ""The Circus"" (MI6's inner circle) and Control's man through and through. A year later, Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), a field agent who was previously under Control's authority, comes out of hiding and brings with him the renewed belief that one of the members of The Circus is indeed a traitor. With nowhere else to turn, Smiley is brought on board to investigate the claims and root out the mole. As he delves into the work of The Circus and a particular operation known as Witchcraft, Smiley finds himself caught up in an increasingly complex web of lies and cover-ups that threaten to bring the world to the brink of yet another war.TTSS is the anti-Bourne, the anti-Bauer, and certainly the anti-Bond. I thoroughly enjoy those characters and their respective franchises but this is an entirely different sort of spy film. You could almost believe that TTSS is based on a true story. It is a real espionage thriller and one that stands up against the best of the genre. This is the definition of a slow burn with a narrative that moves at a snail's pace. But that isn't to say that it is boring or that it lacks in drama. While there are no fiery explosions, no nuclear threats, and very few shootings, it is still taut and riveting, the type of film that has you on the edge of your seat without you even realizing it. TTSS builds its tension through its masterful storytelling that mixes in timely flashbacks while constantly moving the narrative forward. This is a layered, deep, and complicated film but director Tomas Alfredson and his team of writers never make a misstep or allow the film to become overly convoluted. This is a thinking man's spy thriller, a film for adults, but it isn't so complex that you can't follow along, a fact that I truly appreciate. Every scene and every line of dialogue is carefully crafted and nothing goes to waste, the mark of a great film. In essence, this is really about as good as it gets from a storytelling standpoint.For all the good of the story, however, TTSS would fail without a killer cast. Fortunately, Alfredson assembled an impeccable and diverse group of actors who fit their characters beautifully. You know what you're getting from reliable veterans like Oldman, Hurt, and Firth (I'm not sure when exactly Firth went from a ho-hum likable guy in romantic comedies to a tour de force in meaningful films like this but I dig the change) but Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch provide a bit of youthful exuberance to balance out the reserved nature of the older stars. Cumberbatch in particular is a spectacular addition. His character, Peter Guillam, is sort of the audience's representative, as his sense of wide-eyed bewilderment at the grimy reality of espionage adds yet another element to the mix at work within TTSS. Every member of the cast comes through with flying colors, each delivering a powerful performance.But at the end of the day, this is Oldman's show and he makes the absolute most of it. Smiley basically doesn't speak for the first 20 minutes of the film and even after that his words are limited, calculated. And yet the entire time, Oldman commands attention. He is quietly calm in all situations and gives the impression that you had better listen closely to everything he says. So much information is conveyed without words and so much of the film's success depends on Smiley's ability to create a real presence. Even when he doesn't have the answer to the riddle set before him, Smiley displays a keen understanding of the world he is working within and for me, that sense of, ""this guy knows what he's doing"" only adds to Oldman's on-screen power. It's not just that Smiley knows what needs to be done; it's that he knows what the cost will be to get it done. This is an incredibly challenging and understated role and one that I think a number of very talented actors would struggle with. Instead, Oldman revels in the difficulty, giving a flawless performance. Deliberating over Oldman's best role is like picking which of Michael Jordan's six championships is his best (it's the third one, by the way) but Oldman's work in TTSS should be held up as a work of art, a masterful portrayal that should not be overlooked in February.Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An excellent movie with an unusual storyline,"The movie ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" may be a bit of a marmite on a breadstick. It's not for everyone, and at times difficult to enjoy because of its exhaustive portrayal of the less glamorous side of spy work, despite great acting by Oldman, Firth, Jones, Hardy... (I could go on and on). The film stays on point because of the masterfully crafted atmosphere. I loved Alberto Iglesias' score, and thought it had some brilliantly crafted moments (pun intended, of course) to further immerse you in what's happening on screen. Smiley, played by Oldman, is the best protagonist one could wish for in this story, a man who combines seeming bluntness with a complex air of mystery lurking beneath it. This film may not be a standard edge-of-your-seat thriller, but the story, based on Le Carré's source material, is so convoluted that a small amount of patience makes for a long, long way to go.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Couldn't Begin This Film, Much Less Finish It.","Totally unwatchable. You feel like you've been dropped into the 2nd hour of a 3 hour movie right at the beginning. The characters are not introduced, there is little action, and the dialogue is given with the energy normally reserved for NPR radio. I could not get past the first 20 minutes of this slow boat to nowhere, and my wife gave up on it sooner than that. I never turn off a film before finishing it, but had to break my rule for this one. I see now why Gary Oldman did not get the Oscar for this one, (although he was WAY overdue for that award, go see him in ""Darkest Hour"" instead).",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Put in effort and you'll get the reward,"First off, unless you're prepared to this multiple times you'll not get the shear brilliance of the film.Every second counts in this film. There is no filler whatsoever. Watch it once and it's good (maybe not fantastic), after the 20th time of watching it becomes apparent that this is one of the best films ever made.The film moves along with a pacey melancholic jazz score which meshes with action. Action in this case is doors opening, lifts whirring and railway points changing and which in this film are infinitely more powerful than exploding buildings, shootings and car chases. The film captures 70s London: grimy buildings, dull light, offices sinking in paperwork, clanking analogue machines, bland food and uniform like clothes.Everyone has a secret weakness which they hide with varying degrees of success. The film shows this in the expressions of the actors more than dialogue. Every actor in this film plays a blinder. Clearly Gary Oldman is up there. His Smiley is expressionless most of the time and dialogue delivered in studied way, however, he only has to modify this slightly to make it count, when he does the effect is devastating. The other actors deserve credit: Toby Jones constantly peevish smug Alleline, the haunted look of Mark Strong's Prideaux, Colin Firth's self satisfied Haydon and David Dencik's anxious ingratiating Esterhaze. There is a classic 'wtf have I done' moment of acting from a bit player that is fantastic, if you've seen it you'll know what I mean.The last 10 minutes wraps up the film completely and the inspired choice of soundtrack counterpoints the repressed desires of the key leads.Finally the plot is straightforward and linear, but it is made up of many many links which slot together seamlessly. At first watch you may miss many of these. On each re-watch another link will emerge which will further tie things together so making it a better film each time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Rain, Cigarettes, and Secrets","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a slow burn, but trust me, it's worth it. Prepare for lots of rain, constant cigarette smoking, and generally dull, grey environments - it's all part of the atmosphere. Don't let that put you off, though. This movie is absolutely captivating. The story is a complex web of intrigue that slowly draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is phenomenal, with everyone delivering top-notch performances. Beyond the story and acting, the film is beautifully framed and shot. Every scene feels carefully composed, adding to the overall tension. If you're looking for a fast-paced action thriller, this isn't it. But if you appreciate smart, tense, and atmospheric films, then Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is definitely worth your time. It's a masterclass in suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Compares poorly with the brilliant 1979 British television version,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this 2011 version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy with Gary Oldman, but when it finally arrived I was so disappointed that I considered leaving the theater shortly after the movie began. I didn't, but I should have.To be fair to this current film, I admit that I have seen the British TV series version with Alec Guinness many times, so perhaps I'm merely biased. Frankly, though, - and despite the wonderful reviews of this film from many people - I don't see how anyone can take this dull, lifeless version seriously.The acting in this film runs the entire gamut from A to B. Gary Oldman is no Alec Guinness. For all the taciturnity of his George Smiley, Guinness imbued his Smiley with genuine character, whereas Oldman is reduced to maintaining a stone-faced, unemotional countenance for the entire 2 hours 40 minutes duration of this film. Much has been made of Oldman's not saying a word in the first 18 minutes of the film, but this can be easily matched by some characters who had barely a sentence of two in the whole production. The usually formidable actor Ciaran Hinds must not have had more than 10 words total, and they were of absolutely no consequence. Academy Award winner Colin Firth had barely more to say, and I doubt if his role in the film contained even a whole page of dialog. Compare that to the brilliant 1979 performance in that role by the late Ian Richardson. The only character in this film who exuded any sense of real life was that of Jim Prideaux, played by Mark Strong. But Strong was not allowed to be anywhere near as ""strong"" as that of the character played in 1979 by the late Ian Bannen.If I had not seen the earlier British television series I honestly doubt if I would have been able to follow the plot of this current movie. The film is dark, the characters rather dull, and flashbacks abound. I really believe the makers of this film expect viewers to already know the plot before arriving in the theater.I have other quibbles. This film has the headquarters of MI-6 located in what looks to be a former warehouse. Inasmuch as MI-6 is an arm of the U. K. Foreign Office, are we expected to believe that the elite of the British intelligence establishment would be housed in those dark, dank conditions? And would spies work in an open office environment with no privacy? Hard to believe.If you go to this film I hope you enjoy it. But I'd also recommend you get a DVD of the 1979 British TV series in which the acting, atmosphere, locations, and music are all far superior to this current version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Control,"My notion of noir is simple: it is a form of narrative that recognizes that there is a viewer, and that the presence of the viewer reshapes the world to make an interesting story. That is, various unlikely circumstances occur; portholes to visibility by us as ghosts are opened; knowledge by the characters of what is going on are gated by what we know in a too and fro of dominance.It is, in other words, a world where the very presence of a viewer controls various aspects. A central character (usually one, usually a random man) struggles with how he is buffeted; comes perhaps to understand it and in the normal form achieves points in the game that puts him at the same level as the viewer.We are a sophisticated people, and this has been around for a long time — and in cinema and cinematically influenced art as well. So we have some clever adaptations and twists. One common form is the massive, all-controlling conspiracy. Another is the modern detective story where the discovery is about the detective's self as much as grokking the murder. Yet another is the con story where we follow the controller's actions but only at the end discover the means of manipulation.Here we have another variant, which is essentially a detective story to discover who is the control over the world that is manipulating our random guy, aptly named Smiley. It shares elements of the three examples above, but allows for a deeper texture because it recalls worlds that have dynamics we understand. So a talented filmmaker can reference these.And boy do we have a talented filmmaker!One world is simply the world of men with power and how they perform small ballets in their relationships one to another to be top dog, using deniable, even unconscious tactics. This becomes the foremost world in this film, and gives our main actors something to use. All of them are first rate; all respond with insights from the craft. Kathy Bates is perfectly placed as a displaced analyst with enough vision to value 'her boys' for their sexual attractiveness at the top of the heap we see.Another world is the cold war. It was hot when the book appeared, but the book already was treating it as a sort of fantasy world that came with prefabricated rules. In some ways, it has taken until now for this perspective to fully mature so that this film in this time can be far deeper than the original novel was in its time. Frankly, in its time it was trash for airport reading, of the Grisham variety.Yet another world is that of Britain in the early seventies. This was a bleak country, still not recovered from the war while its adversaries were soaring. It clung to the US instead of the continent. There is a wistful desire to please the master here that hits home for this US viewer, knowing what I know about the relationships of the intel communities.And we have the inner, personal world of loves, companions, friends, trust and sex. These are always where the bones of a story rest, and are broken.All of these are noir worlds, all manipulated by various controls (Controls, as a proper noun).All of these are masterfully called, merged and presented with us unsure of what we control.Already, I have this as a candidate for one of my two rare selections of the most important films of 2012 (my 'Fours').See it. See it in a theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Cold War Spy Intrigue at its Best,"A modern classic, a re-make of the old TV series starring Alec Guinness, and that was excellent, this is even better.It includes a great cast of British actors led by Gary Oldman, who is proving to be one of the best, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, John Hurt (just at the start), Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, Tom Hardy, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Graham, Simon McBurney and Roger Lloyd Pack, there was even a Swede David Dencik, all well used and well acted. There were Hungarians playing Hungarians and Russians playing Russians, the John Le Carre story is a classic (John Le Carre had an extra role in the movie), filmed in the correct locations, London Budapest and Istanbul, and that makes for a great base to construct the film around.It was directed sensitively, photography was excellent and gave it that 60's/70's feel, the scenes were well shot, particularly the ones in Budapest.

Excruciating concentration required,"Excruciating espionage film based on the 1974 book of the same name by John Le Carre. It basically follows the hunt for a mole in the British secret service or MI6. Semi-retired agent George Smiley (excellently portrayed by Gary Oldman, who is made to look about 20 years older) is brought in to hunt down the traitor. The story is set in the bleak London of the seventies and the cinematography excellently portrays this bleak feel.The film is more Spycatcher by Peter Wright (controversial 1980s book) rather than a James Bond action vehicle. The film takes deep concentration in its two hour running time. There are so many suspects that showcase an excellent cast of the cream of British cinema. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, John Hurt and last but by no means least Tom Hardy. Apparently this film was originally filmed as a six hour or so drama by the BBC in 1979. I can imagine the six hour running time being sufficient. The two hour running time tries to do to much within its time constraints. I originally watched this film years ago however I gave up then after half an hour so was determined to see the film out. However give me Sir Roger Moore in an alpine ski chase falling into the abyss from an Austrian mountain anyday rather than this overrated chirade.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A slow burn mystery...,"As with the last film I saw at the cinema recently (Hugo), this is another movie which has a leisurely, if not genteel pace. In my brief notes for this film I make a faux pas...I assumed it was based on fact. Not sure why I would think that...I've never seen any version of this story before, but maybe some names from it had seeped into my consciousness, like ""Smiley"", perhaps.Even though this is an English spy story, it's unlike the kind which are usually brought to mind by that phrase (such as the James Bond series). There are some moments of shocking violence in this movie or the aftermath of same, but they are spaced at long intervals. If you are patient, the main 'hook' of this movie is guessing who the mole or double agent in the highest reaches of Britain's secret service is. However, I don't think that this is a 'proper' whodunnit movie, as in the viewer being presented with clues which allows one to deduce who the mole is.That's the thrust of this story...after a British operative is killed in an overseas operation, none of the senior spooks of 'The circus' (the name the spies give to their organisation) are immune from suspicion. So, a recently retired spook is brought in to find the traitor.Personally I found this a bit hard to follow...if I'd made my faux pas here, I would have said a documentary form would have been a better way to know what happened, assuming one was interested in the facts of the case. Some of the senior spooks seem like likely candidates for the mole...I'd often find myself looking to one or other spook and hypothesising them to be the mole. In a sense the clues are 'red herrings', but in another sense they are merely misdirections, as the suspect could have legitimate reasons for acting in a way which may cast suspicion on their motives. Anyway, my hypotheses did get a bit silly at times!The movie itself looks like it could have been shot in the late 1960s or into the 1970s. The narrative is told in an elliptical manner...certain events and details being returned to, on occasion.There are some interesting titbits in this movie...be interesting to know if they have a factual basis...e.g. the staff of The Circus singing the Soviet anthem! (I think that that's what it is!) and what we learn of American torture techniques, which sound ghastly. Also liked the line in this movie about choosing sides in the Cold War ""It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one"".One of the failings of this movie, I think, is that it's not always clear what is happening in it...there's one scene where the man investigating The Circus for the mole - George Smiley, I believe, played by Gary Oldman - is upset by seeing a woman fondled by another man. I had no idea who the woman was and perhaps the man touching her either. I can presume who she was and the man too, but really, the audience should have been explicitly shown who these people were so that they would know why Smiley was upset. If details were given, then due to the leisurely pace of the movie, one could assume that we would have forgotten this information...hence a reminder being given to us would have been useful.Some irrelevant observations:Toby Jones - played by Percy Alleline - reminded me of the actor Dick van Patten!Peter Guillam - played by Benedict Cumberbatch - reminded me of the actor Glenn Robbins...in Kel mode...or the guy who did the daggy dancing in the Fast Forward sketch series, I believe! I think it was Guillam who gave me this impression...didn't make a note on it...and it relates to my point of feeling in the dark about these people...difficult keeping tabs on all of them...who they are...what they do etc.Was amused by the use of the song ""The second best secret agent in the whole wide world""...might be interesting to look these lyrics up!Anyway, I was glad I didn't make the faux pas of including in my notes the observation that it was ""odd"" that the film had the usual disclaimer at the end credits about it being a work of fiction...PHEW!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

a failed experiment,"My impression, while trying to stay awake during the first part, was of a failed experiment: let's vampirize the cold war movie genre (good intention) and take anything vital out of it. Which might have been interesting if the vampirization had given life to something else. Unfortunately this does not happen. The film is excruciatingly lost in details, and it's even more painful because of the beautiful cinematography, which feels wasted on this effort. It's like a heavy coat of lead covering... well, not much. The actors seem disconnected from the environment and from each other (not only the characters, which would make sense considering the context, but the actors themselves, they seem to be in a vacuum). I found impossible to connect emotionally with any of them, which makes sense as they're all quite dispirited, but the problem is that none of them actually develops into a proper character. The non-linear time-line doesn't really feel justified, it's just confusing, over a plot that (Le Carré) is already quite convoluted. The only things that kept me from falling asleep were the photography, cinematography and editing, which are definitively captivating. But it's a case of style over substance. I might have as well stayed at home to watch my espresso machine.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A British film aficionado's ultimate orgasm,"Gary Oldman. Tom Hardy. Benedict Cumberbatch. Colin Firth. John Hurt. Ciaran Hinds. To say that the cast of the film adaptation of John Le Carre's famed spy series is at an A-list level is an understatement; this film stars a ""who's who"" of British cinema. In keeping in line with the Cold War theme established in our recent Bridge of Spies review, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy replaces the Americans with MI6 (British Intelligence) against the Soviets, in a very thrilling cat-and-mouse game intent on unmasking the traitor embedded within the Circus (MI6's upper echelon).To start off, all those worried about the large ensemble cast potentially being too egotistical to coexist in minor roles within this the film can rid themselves of any worry, as the cast meshes perfectly and sees every actor deliver a stellar performance, regardless of screen time. Another thing to keep in mind is that this film is not targeted towards those that have an inclination for action-heavy spy films ala the Bond film series, but rather those that are willing to think and appreciate the subtle nuances that the film painstakingly recreates from its source material.It seems hard to believe that it was over twenty years ago that Gary Oldman was playing insanely over the top – and still memorable- villain Stansfield in Leon The Professional. In Tinker, Oldman heads the cast in the role of George Smiley, recruited by Control (played masterfully in a short role by John Hurt) to sniff out the spy at Circus, with the suspects being assigned codenames that are illustrated in the film's title. Smiley has two weaknesses that are established early on, his cheating wife and a Soviet equivalent named Karla. It speaks volumes about the quality of the script and the direction that not once are either of the two parties shown yet they both play an integral role in establishing Smiley's character and aiding in arriving at his decision determining who the mole is. Within the cast that we mentioned was as deep in high-end talent as any in recent memory, Oldman stands out for portraying his veteran character as someone that would normally be as nondescript as can be if not for Oldman mastering how to portray a brilliant mind and checkered past that helped earn his Smiley character his position within MI6's Circus.Accompanying Oldman are the actors mentioned above and it truly is a veritable dream team of the top British actors alive today. Cumberbatch and Hardy play roles one would not expect them in with their massive popularity nowadays, but it speaks to their quality as actors that they excel in their roles (Hardy was a delight as the disheveled Ricky Tarr). Mark Strong is amongst the least heralded of the cast yet delivers an equally poignant performance in his role as a teacher whose role in the introduction sets the stage for the rest of the film. There is no disappointment amongst the cast's performances, further helping the film stake its claim as one of the best of 2011.The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson, he of Let the Right One In fame, which established his credentials as an auteur capable of establishing the right blend of melancholia and tension amongst Tinker's less than happy group of spies. Alfredson's direction was just the right amount of subtle, capturing the smallest of facial expressions and presenting them in ways that make the viewer actively wonder who the mole could be. Although the revelation of the mole was a tad anti-climactic and should have been guessed by the more attentive viewers a few scenes prior, the setup leading up to said reveal was executed as well as can be, with Alfredson's presentation keeping the viewer in a state of suspense and tension throughout. Very rarely can one say that a film is just the right length as an adaption from a book –Peter Jackson's ludicrously bloated Hobbit trilogy, anyone? - but Alfredson manages to capture the essence of the TV series and book in the run time of 127 minutes. Here's hoping he gets another crack at adapting source material as well written and established as Le Carrie's spy series, his work on Tinker solidifying him as one of the better directors in cinema.The cinematography and sound that accompanies Alfredson's direction was nothing short of brilliant itself, with the sound editing standing out for its innovative use of conversation filters. To put it another way, the sound editing helps the audience listen to conversations within Smiley's head and filters it just right that it presents the key phrase which helps him solve the mystery as if it was homing in on it. A tad difficult to describe in text form but it is something that needs to be experienced in order to be appreciated for its innovativeness. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytemma's use of stylistic nuances further elevates the quality of scenes, as lingering shots that focus in on random or insignificant objects still evoke a sense of intrigue for the audience. The visual pleasure that Hoytemma's shots is something which must be experienced along with the aforementioned sound editing, with something as insignificant as a close-up of Oldman's character's furrowed brows on his face, draped in shadow, still somehow serving to showcase to the audience what his character stands for. Speaks to the quality of the cinematography that scenes such as this can be paired with the highly-tense opening scene that was focused on quick cuts and yet still flow well together.For those that appreciate old school espionage tales or just wish to see all of Britain's finest actors in one film together, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a must see. Nowhere else will you get to see Sherlock Holmes in a film with Mad Max and King George while Commissioner Gordon is omnipresent.http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com for more reviews",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Cast but hard to engage with at times.,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy should be by all means up my alley for films - I've been trying to find more Cold War movies and I landed here. The cast and their performances were great to watch as all of them usually are, with standouts for me probably being Cumberbatch and Oldman as my favourite scenes had them involved. You do have to keep your head in this film to properly enjoy it and maybe I was elsewhere as I really struggled to follow the plot at times. The director gives you no guide into following the movie which is fine in some cases, but here I felt that the dragging pace of the film can bore you at times. There is a solid 30 minutes of this film that just goes by in a blur because of how mundane it feels and it could be due to the movie's colouring at times. I'm not one to be put off if a film doesn't jangle colourful keys in my face the whole time but some vibrant pieces can make me enjoy a picture more. I just really couldn't get into this at times, so for me this is a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Deep Dive into Intricacy and Tension,"The film stands as a complex puzzle of espionage and human psychology, rich in atmosphere and intricate storytelling. Its deliberate pacing builds tension and rewards viewers who invest in its complexities. However, this slow-burning approach could be a double-edged sword. For those seeking fast-paced action or straightforward narrative, the film may feel tedious or even alienating. The need for constant attention to detail can make the experience challenging, potentially causing some viewers to disengage. In essence, while deeply rewarding for those who appreciate its nuanced approach, its pacing could limit its broader appeal.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What were they thinking?,"I'm a huge fan of spy movies! I loved The Day of the Jackal, The Bourne Identity. However, this film fails on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. First, we learn almost nothing about the characters. Secondly, I really got tired of watching filing, shuffling of papers, and scenes of men sitting in chairs over and over without any real action. The cuts back and forth are confusing, the actors look extremely unattractive, and most of the scenes are of men sitting down and talking. Or not talking. They stare, they stare again, they mutter. I found this film to be toxic it was so dull. And if the scenes are from the 1970s, how about sideburns on the men? Or double vented suits? This film was a terrible disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy decodes le Carré's informative novel into a taut spy thriller.,"In a game of chess, strategy must be dictated within a minimal set of moves in order to establish a victory plan. Observing the opponent's mindset and how they operate the various delicately crafted pieces. Divulging in deception, chess is a tactician's game. A set of rules that enable each player to extrapolate a weakness from one another. The Cold War, a historic elongated period of time revolving around geopolitical tension, pitted nations against each other in regional conflicts known as proxy wars. No large-scale battles took place, but rather instigation through gathering of intelligence. The Soviet Union would send KGB ""moles"" to the US and its allies to monitor governmental movements, allowing the former to proceed with advantageous military arrangements before other nations.Author le Carré had worked for both MI5 and MI6 during two decades of the Cold War, and thus utilised his experience to produce espionage novels, one of which was Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. A story revolving around the hunt for a Soviet double agent nestled within the top of the British secret service. Participating in a secretive operation known as ""Witchcraft"", which sees the trading of intelligence between the CIA and the Soviet Union, not realising that it's all just a front for the former. Five members of the ""Circus"", a colloquial term for the head of British intelligence, are suspects. Alleline (""Tinker""), Haydon (""Tailor""), Bland (""Soldier""), Esterhase (""Poorman""), and the feature's protagonist Smiley (""Beggarman""). Having been forced out of the Service, Smiley decides to investigate the proposed theory as a solo endeavour. To find the mole.The arresting aspect to director Alfredson's first non-Swedish feature, is undoubtedly O'Connor and Straughan's screenplay. Adapting a le Carré novel is challenging, given the cryptic language utilised and hesitant time period of the plot itself. To minimise and compress its contents into a fragmented narrative structure that reveals crucial minor details one minute at a time, is nothing short of masterful. Expositional dialogue is limited, consequently retaining an authentic accuracy for the meticulously constructed world and the characters that populate it. Some may find the plot difficult to follow because of this, subsiding into a purposefully slow pace with zero action. Others, including myself, will prefer the periphrastic approach. It showcases linguistic talent to supply taut thrills from words alone. The characters, aside from Smiley whose personal complexions with his wife power his motives, are non-relatable. There's no emotional connectivity with any of them. Just intelligence operators doing their jobs. And that's why it works so well! Going back to the chess analogy, the characters are simply pieces on a regional board that, when moved correctly, are able to progress with the game at hand. A meticulously constructed screenplay that does not garner enough acclaim.Alfredson's employment of flashbacks and non-progressive scenarios does cause the narrative to meander slightly, particularly when depicting Tarr's backstory in Istanbul, however manages to retain the central plot strand fully grounded. Bolstered by van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography that implemented noir aesthetics and Iglesias' smooth score musically exploiting Cold War-era styles. Accompanied by an outstanding list of British cast members, especially Oldman as Smiley who incidentally performs one of the best character monologues in modern cinema, that maintains an urgency for the central plot.However, Alfredson falters at the last hurdle. This adaptation's conclusion, including the spy's/spies' reveal and the proceeding montage of events for each character as they move on from the investigation, was utterly underwhelming. Smiley confronts the suspect(s), only for the tension to instantly dissipate when it cuts to a new scene the following day, which sees the accused splurge a multitude of confessions. The tautness that powered Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy had diminished, with an abhorrently rushed conclusion that relinquished two hours worth of investigation. It may be perceived as realistic, yet the overall editing execution during this climax ruined its chances at being impactful. Frustrating, really.Much like the sending and receiving of delicate intel, Tinker Tailor Solider Spy relishes in authentic spy tropes allowing viewers to decode its contents without the extravagance of Hollywood thrills. It's an adaptation that projects its intricate screenplay to the forefront, allowing the ornate words to perform the feature's duties. If only the conclusion had the same level of care, this could've been a Cold War masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

SUPER,"It took me three viewings to get the depth of this picture.
That makes me a moron! right ....
first view - i liked it
second view - i was in with it
third view - engrossed in it
for a great novel written by the great John le Carré , the movie makers did a great job too, only missed maybe some small details / or not.
Even though ..... not with standing the fact that they had 2 nice up and coming hardy as well as cumberbatch going top guns which I suppose they were lucky with :) getting them together.
Gary Oldman and Firth were what was required of them as always which is permanently soothing.

Keep Calm and Carre' on,"One of the films repeated on the BBC over the 2022 Yuletide period was Tomas Alfredson's adaptation of John Le Carre's novel ""Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy"". It was subject to a lauded BBC adaptation back in 1979, but this film, with an all-star cast was also well thought of and I enjoyed it, even if I can't honestly confirm that I always knew what was going on.A year after being ousted from his role in British Intelligence George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is asked to investigate his former colleagues, after credible intelligence alleges that one of them is a Soviet mole. Together with his protégé Peter Guilam (Benedict Cumberbatch) Smiley tries to weed out the guilty party by investigating the bungled operation that cost him his job and the actions of Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) a rogue agent who has returned to England with a story to tell.Again, you can't argue with that all star cast. Aside from the people detailed in the above paragraph, you can add Colin Firth, Mark Strong, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, Kathy Burke and Stephen Graham into the mix. Nor can you argue with the recreation of a dull, Cold War 1970's London, even down to the awful, depressing Christmas party that figures heavily in the plot.Now, I haven't seen that 1979 adaptation, so I can't say for certain whether this problem is unique to this version, or endemic of the story, but for me, there is a point leading into the conclusion where it loses me. Unfortunately, it's rather a key aspect of the story that I didn't quite get, in that it's how Smiley convinces the mole to head to the safe house. I did look up the plot synopsis afterwards and read it - and that makes sense in context of the film, but I still feel like the film should have done a better job of getting me there itself.It doesn't totally detail the experience for me, there is still much to admire in the performances, but I think it'll be another ten years before I try it for a third time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good: 7.0,"The Cold War was probably one of the most tense, complex times in human history. Two superpowers and a dozen smaller ones poised perpetually on the brink of nuclear war, each trying to scare the other into giving in to Communism, democracy, and many other things. It was a time of fear and paranoia, a time when wearing a red scarf here in the States could get you twenty-five to life. This is the mood that Tomas Alfredson's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy tries to convey at every opportunity. The entire film is a tense affair filled with hard stares, double crossing, encoded messages and one of the most convoluted plots I have ever seen. Each actor plays their part perfectly, each one seeming to have been worn down by the constant vigilance their job requires. They all seem to have short tempers, and each seems to be all but actively hostile towards everyone else. They all seem to have their own agendas (who didn't back then?), and once the idea that one of them is a mole is introduced, each one is a candidate. The story mainly follows George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman, and his investigation into this matter. Between many meetings in a smoky boardroom with the upper echelons of British intelligence, he contacts his trusted members of the organization to try to gather information about the movements of those suspected. His questionings involve flashbacks galore, some of which seemed to not matter to the overall plot in the least. Or maybe they did, and I just didn't realize it. I really cannot say for certain. This is a film that really could have used a longer running time. There seemed to be something happening nearly every second, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it gives you no time to process the last bit of story before you're being force-fed the next one. As with many stories, I am sure all the details are presented in some way that makes complete sense. Actually, that's probably exactly the case. But having read the book beforehand (which I clearly did not) is probably a major aid in the endeavor to understand this story. Everything else about the film is actually very well done. The acting is terrific; each actor is recognizable, and each manages to make their character feel distinct. The atmosphere is palpable, with smoke everywhere and characters filling the screen with their brooding, suspicious faces. The cinematography is suitably bleak, with everywhere always seeming like the sun is hidden behind a thick curtain of clouds. Alfredson's direction makes for some great shots that add to the tension, reminding us of his supernatural masterpiece Let the Right One In. However, the story is the primary focus of this picture, without doubt. And when the story is this tangled, all the filmmaking skill in the world cannot completely make up for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fast 5 lovers please look away now..,"This film is not for everyone. If 'Fast 5' is your idea of what a movie should be like (which I actually walked out of) then this movie is not for you. Don't expect unbelievable car chases, don't expect gun fights where a billion bullets are fired yet none of the 'good guys' are hit, don't even expect 'epic' fight scenes, that's not what this film is about.Fast 5 is like junk food for the mind. You don't have to think or concentrate because the story is fairly simple and is broken up with action scenes in case you get bored.

For me, its a breath of fresh air, a refreshing change from the usual style of films we see.My criticism is that because the story is complex it didn't fit into the 2 hours time given; some scenes felt a bit rushed, probably making it even more difficult to follow.

"One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year!","'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year is this British spy thriller. The film is based on the 1974 novel of the same name by John le Carre about an Ex-British secret service agent named George Smiley and his efforts to find a Soviet double agent. The film stars Gary Oldman (in an Academy Award nominated performance), Colin Firth, Tom Hardy (one of my favorite up and coming actors), Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds and John Hurt. It was written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was directed by Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson (who also directed the popular vampire thriller 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN') and scored perfectly by Alberto Iglesias (in which it also received an Academy Award nomination). On a technical level the movie is near perfect but lacks any true substance or heart to make it a truly great film (that and the fact that it's near impossible to follow).The film is set in the 1970's during the cold war and begins with a British Intelligence agent named Jim Prideaux (Strong) on assignment in Hungary. After the mission goes horribly wrong the head of the British Intelligence, Control (Hurt), and his right-hand man George Smiley (Oldman) take most of the blame and are forced into early retirement. The true reason the assignment went haywire is due to a Russian agent among the senior officers and Control was on to them (the Hungary mission was actually a plan to identify the mole). Control dies shortly after retirement (due to an ongoing illness) but Smiley is asked to come out of retirement, by a senior officer, and investigate new information discovered by agent Ricky Tarr (Hardy) on the mole. Smiley sees this as an opportunity to clear his name and seek vengeance by bringing the double agent to justice.Like I said the movie is masterfully made on a technical level, the perfect subtlety of each scene is amazing but the movie is almost too subtle. It takes way too long to get going and is never clear about almost anything. I had to see the movie twice just to fully understand it, paying much more attention to every detail the second time around. I sometimes like to give these kinds of movies credit for demanding a repeat viewing and not spoon-feeding the viewer but there is such a thing as being too vague (as well as being too slow paced). The movie crawls along at an agonizingly dull pace and this is part of the reason the film is too hard to follow; if you're like me your mind will often drift while viewing a movie like this which makes it easy to miss important details thus making it even more frustrating to follow and thus more painfully dull to watch. At least the movie does have a lot to offer in other ways (great acting, beautiful cinematography and a mesmerizing score) but the movie is not involving enough to warrant such craftsmanship. At it's heart it's a routine story with rather dull characters making it yet another example of style over substance (to the fullest extent).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I really thought that either my English language was not enough or my IQ until I spoke to one of the other viewers on the exit of the theatre and -thankfully- she confirmed to me that it was neither my English nor my IQ. The film is just plainly bad. Nothing moves or means anything. Obviously an intricate story is there, but someone has to be able to tell you that. Yes the acting is excellent, no denying that.

Look at the superb Karla scene!,"Espionage stories can be told in roughly two ways. The first way is the James Bond way with the emphasis on action and beautiful women. A typical writer in this category is James Bond author Ian Fleming. In the second way the emphasis is on paperwork done within the intelligence bureaucracy. A typical author in this category is John le Carré. Incidentally, both authors had previous experience ""on the job"" before their writing career.The heyday of espionage novels and -films was of course the Cold war. The most famous John le Carré adaptation (""The spy who came in from the cold"", 1965, Martin Ritt) was made in this period. After the Cold war espionage thrillers became less popular and John le Carré changed subjects accordingly. Think about ""The constant gardener"" (2005, Fernando Meirelles), also based on a Carré novel that was written after the end of the Cold war. Viewed this way the success of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" in the middle of the post Cold war period is remarkable. Of course after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 it is possible that the fortune of espionage stories will change again.""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is situated in the '70s and this period is portrayed in a very realistic manner (just look at the big eyeglass frames) and not in a caricatured way such as for example in ""The shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick).There is one scene about a company party of the intelligence unit the main character is working at. This party is even more corny than the average company party. More remote from a James Bond film is nearly impossible.""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is about the hunt for a counter spy. For this hunt main character George Smiley (Gary Oldman) has been recalled from retirement. His job is inherently lonely, because there is no colleague he can trust. This made me think of movies about the former East Germany (for example ""Das Leben der Anderen"", 2006, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck) in which you could not trust your neighbour or even your child.In ""Heat"" (1995, Michael Mann) there is a very famous scene in which Al Pacino (playing a cop) and Robert de Niro (playing a criminal) drink a cup of coffee together. In their conversation clearly resounds some mutual respect. In ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" there is a scene in which Gary Oldman, having drunk (too much) Whisky, reminisces the only time he met his Russian counterpart. Also in this memories the respect clearly resounds. In my opinion this scene, called the ""Karla"" scene, is (at least) on par with the scene in ""Heat"" and deserves to be as famous. It is a brilliant performance by Gary Oldman. When I wrote this review there was a short documentary about this scene on ""You tube"". Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Will take any remake on Tinker Tailor,"Many of John LeCarre's spy novels have been turned into movies and TV shows. The best of them, in my opinion, is the BBC series of Tinker, Tailor. Smiley's People is the close second. Other novels by LeCarre that have been turned into movies are of mixed qualities. But I can't blame the movies because they can't be better than the original novels. The Deadly Affair was good, but in a weird sort of way; it was more of a psychological drama than a spy thriller because it dwelled on the agony of Smiley over his unfaithful wife (though the protagonist is called by another name). The Tailor of Panama could've been good, if they had cast someone other than Pierce Brosnan. The Perfect Gardner and some other movie whose name I can't recall now were based on topics that aren't as interesting as the Karla trilogy.Turning Tinker Tailor into a two-hour movie is a difficult job considering the multiple characters and plot twists. When I was watching the BBC version, I had to constantly look up the character list and the spy jargon definitions in the DVD package to follow the story. So the director did a marvelous job producing the movie version.I think that LeCarre was one of the most intellectual and sophisticated thriller writers of the 20th century. And he covered the most interesting and intriguing period of the espionage war during the Cold War: the Soviet moles in the British intelligence. It was a time of betrayal and conflicting loyalties.I hope that they make a movie version of Smiley's People, too. John LeCarre is no longer with us, but his legacy lives on through his masterpiece espionage novels.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Stinker, Tailor, Soldier...","Maybe it's because I'm a part-Swedish native English speaker--or maybe Tomas Alfredson's Nordically glacial and dull TTSS-2011 misses the mark on a more straightforward level, but Alfredson's cluelessness of the subtleties and entendres of spoken English weigh especially heavy on this film.TTSS is a decidedly British period piece whodunit with a labyrinthine back story and subtext. In order to enjoy and admire such a work (and be interested in each character), the English dialogue and included idiom and colloquialisms *ARE CENTRAL* to the film as plot points and character raison d'etre. The most important and satisfying elements of the piece lie in its character's use of British vernacular and slang (some Brit spy stuff included), and its dialectical delivery.Le Carre(Novel) and Hopcraft/Irvin (BBC version) got it right, but it's all missing as O'Connor/Straughan, the writers, and the forgivably Swedish Alfredson have ""thrown out the baby with the bathwater"" in condensing this work to a 127 minute film. None of the characters appear to have much to say at all, with the vacuous staring going on, but when they do speak, we get a foreshortened and 2 dimensional view of their motives and place in the plot; As dull and plodding as a real British spy's life could be in the '70s cold war, we need to be interested and entertained by the peculiarities and persona of each character in a film, and with the exception of the fine performance by Tom Hardy, as Ricki Tarr, most of the cast play as gray and flat as the film comes off in whole.I LOVED the book & '79 BBC version, and lived in London in 1973, so this film should have impressed and satisfied, as much as I would have liked it too upon hearing of the upcoming release in early 2011 - Only it didn't...Other reviewers have praised and extolled the direction, the script, the acting, the musical score, and the photography; And I certainly respect the actors' work in this most subtle and (on the surface) potentially confusing story.

Watch the miniseries first!,"If you only see this movie without having seen the Alec Guinness miniseries, then you're doing yourself an injustice. Le Carré is about people as much as plot. We know what an intelligence service does, but what kind of people do it? Both sides have an overriding interest, to gain an edge over their adversaries, on behalf of ""the higher good"". Le Carré's theme in all his books is, Is it worth it? The miniseries gives us a chance to explore this theme -- the movie does not.In the Harry Palmer Michael Caine vehicles the hero is a cynic, but because he's still young he's not beaten down. In le Carré, everybody (except ironically the villain) is beaten down, either figuratively or literally. You get a sense of torpor, or moral exhaustion. But in the miniseries, you understand why. In this movie everyone and everything is just SLOW, including the camera work.The Spy Who Came in From the Cold successfully depicted the le Carré malaise, because Richard Burton was an expert at the worn-out protagonist. (See Night of the Iguana and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.) Actually, Gary Oldman is pretty good as George Smiley. He's not quite the cipher that Alec Guinness was, but he's close. Unfortunately, director Tomas Alfredson has Smiley doing this stage business with the glasses, which is just that -- stage business -- while with Guinness, the glasses serve to make Smiley opaque.I hate to think the makers of this movie are making a word play of Smiley's name, because throughout, Gary Oldman sports a frigid smile. Are they goofing with the audience?And then there are the Tinker, Tailor, Soldier...characters. The point of the exercise was a classic whodunit cliché: Lots of suspects, now who is the perp? The story examines each candidate, and it's up to us to guess who. Everybody has an ax to grind, a conventional setup. Problem is, in the length of a movie there's no time to make us care about them.Maybe this is what makes Alfredson approach Tinker Tailor the way he does. Perhaps he understands that most of the audience already knows the mole, because they read the book and/or saw the miniseries. So, why should they watch it again? To see how the human beings are dehumanized by their, at the time, very important work. But this really doesn't happen in this movie, because there isn't enough time. The characters were certainly dehumanized, but it's like they were just parachuted into their roles.If you haven't see the Alec Guinness miniseries, then see it first. If you have seen the miniseries, then be ready for a letdown.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not intended for Le Carre's enthusiasts,"(2011) Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
ESPIONAGE/ MYSTERYAlthough, I agree with movie critic Robert Roten that it's so emotionless, it's still absorbingly captivating as ever. Almost immediately, and right along the beginning has to be one of the most boring scenes I had ever seen for we don't really know who's who as well as the characters appear to be bland and artificial for it's like watching ""The Tree Of Life"" all over again. It states the complicated situation rather than immerses us and it's done in this fashion because it assumes that we already know all the characters involved when that is not the case at all- we don't know about any of them until at least after the movie is finally over. Which I have to say, one of the opportunities to watch this on DVD was so that viewers can make sense of it by the simple press of a button- so that we are able to retract and revisit what we are viewing since some of those images are too subtle for viewers to remember, for instance some of the passerby characters deemed as unimportant are just as relevant as the main ones. Based and adapted by John le Carré's popular novel who was also credited as executive producer and is now a theatrical movie - should not be compared to anything else anyone has ever read and seen before but as it's own film and on it's own terms. If you don't know how to adapt to something that is different that may be different than something you had read and had seen before then you might as well be hiding underneath a rock. As I've said, at the first 5 or 10 minutes, has got to be one of the most boring scenes in movie history for I can truly understand how frustrating it would be for viewers to watch this theatrically, but in order for this film to be fully understood may require a couple more viewings because it's another one of those films which as soon as you know how it ends you have to re-watch it all over again to fully know that it's self-explainable. It's designed like a math problem, once you already know the answer- you'd want to seek for the solution. The beginning when the guy was shot from behind was not the full story as it turns out that theirs more to it than that. I was even curious to some of the movie's social commentary provided by director Tomas Alfredson as well as it's star Gary Oldman since I wasn't able to understand everything what was happening, which if they didn't say anything about it at all then my rating may possibly be lower. Anyways, from the first 5 minutes and this was before the title was even shown, Control played by John Hurt instructs Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a dangerous assignment, and that was to go to Budapest to retrieve some important information for a revelation regarding the mole within' the British Intelligence or as they call it the ""Circus"". Jim who was on his mission then gets shot right at the back as he was walking away by a Hungarian waiter who was serving them as well as a woman holding her baby- this scene is shocking on so many levels because we the viewers are oblivious about it's motivations. The responses as well as the reactions don't come up until much later which softens that crucial scene. Control then dies from old age, and the British minister then recalls George Smiley (Gary Oldman) since he was the only person Contol had ever trusted who has just secretly been reinstated to uncover this mole, but he does this by operating indiscreetly in another secret location. Smiley's right hand man is Peter Guillam(Benedict Cumberbatch) who's not among the top but is still employed in the same office where secret gov't information had been filed. And he is supposed to gather information similar to what a right hand man is supposed to do- similar to what a lawyer would use except that he's doing it indiscreetly. I'll say it once and I'll say it again, the movie uses many flashbacks between what happened before and what is happening in the present which may require viewers to use a remote control to retract what s/he had seen since that was what I ended up doing. For instance, the Russian embassy consolat played a huge part in this movie even though he's not shown very much who happened to be their when Jim Prudaux was shot except that viewers didn't know that at first until much later (using the 'Rashomon' method of multiple camera angles from different directions)and that it is not shown until much later in the movie turning that shocking scene into a self explainable one. Like any kind of complex puzzle, this movie doesn't require one viewing but may need people to look back. And during the audio commentary, I was quite disappointed that not everything was addressed but was still satisfied that some of my questions were answered which is better than none at all giving this movie a solid 80%. It's like a painting where you can't just look at the center but have to look at everything else too, and that it's not intended to those who are impatient since the revelations occur if people are willing to be patient and pick up on it, and films often don't usually do that and can be frustrating to some but fascinating for others.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good solid old fashioned spy story,"I'd been waiting forever for the movie to be released and for the most part it was worth the wait. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been handled very well- for one thing it's so much easier to follow than John Le Carre's novel (but Le Carre fans might disagree).The first plus point is the plot, which focuses solely on locating a traitor at the top of British secret intelligence, which is known as the Circus. It's very hard to pinpoint, from the viewer's point of view, who the traitor is as we never see any of the main characters engaging in suspicious activity right until the very end and for that it's worth the wait. The acting is another plus, with Marc Strong, Toby Jones and Gary Oldman putting in some strong performances.The downsides are few but worth noting. It's very important not to lose focus of the story because there are times when the plot deviates and it can be distracting and confusing. Also, if you've read the book it makes following the story easier and also the characters because the familiarity will allow you to over come the slowness of the pacing, which in itself is bit of a negative point. For me, colin firth spoiled the casting as I didn't think he offered much to the movie or towards his character. But then again I dislike firth intensely so that's just a bit of biased opinion. I've also seen the original series that starred Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley and I preferred Guinness's Smiley to Oldman's. Gary Oldman felt too stiff, too reserved for me to truly enjoy his performance.However, all that aside, this is a good movie to watch which sets itself apart from the latest Bond action fueled rubbish. Not all cloak and dagger movies need a requisite car chase or an exploding building to be considered quality. This is a definite recommend to all espionage fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lost for most of the film but superb acting.,I tried so hard to get into this film as it has a superb cast that I love but also as the trailer gave the sense of film that would be a lot more dramatic than it turned out to be. Instead I found myself lost for most of the film with no idea what was going. I understood the intro set up but once it cut away from that was when the confusion kicked in. Towards the end of the film when they took us back to that character I was able to piece some of the film together as they supplied information for that to happen. The film then seemed to pick up and go at the dramatic pace I was longing for until it then seemed to end very abruptly. I seemed to have finished the film with more questions than answers and thinking of rewatching it in the hope I might be able to piece more of the film together.Honestly I feel a bit sad at how I went in with high expectations from having seen the trailer and almost none of them where met. Other to unconfuse myself I wouldn't watch it again.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gives the 1979 mini-series a run for its money,"During the cold war, it looks like that is a mole in MI-6. Control (John Hurt) and George Smiley (Gary Oldman) retire after a botched mission. Just because Smiley retired does not mean it is not him. Yet he gets the task of coming back unofficially to find the mole. We go through a multifaceted search. And of course, it is supposed to be the last person you suspect.I do not remember that much detail of the series. But I enjoyed watching it. I assumed this version would have to cut a lot out and might leave you guessing at how they got from one scene to the next. I was wrong. Every word and look had meaning. There is a tad too many flashbacks but time constraints probably force that. For a minute I thought of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" where there were too many clues.

Curate's Egg,"I can only recommend 1- read the book 2 - view the BBC series with Alec Guinness. Gary Oldman and John Hurt stand out but I was surprised to see that the budget was 20M. Obviously not spent on the script since very few people got to say anything and it looked like a made for TV movie in its set pieces. This is one of the seminal espionage stories so why mess with the details. Ricky Tarr's story was altered and none of the major suspects in the book were given any voice in the film. Characters were not developed properly - what a wasted opportunity. No sense of the betrayal of friendship which is what the book is about and no sense of the humanity, frailty and intelligence which pervades the book. Disappointing all in all.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Espionage Mastery,"From the very beginning, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011) captivates with its mesmerizing original score, setting a beautifully haunting atmosphere. However, the narrative demands unwavering attention, as it weaves through a complex web of espionage with a non-linear storyline. This film is the epitome of a spy thriller, replete with intricate details and jargon that require keen focus and perhaps a bit of research to fully grasp.The plot's back-and-forth structure, while challenging, is a deliberate choice that enhances the film's aesthetic and depth. It immerses viewers into the tense world of espionage, where understanding the subtleties is essential for appreciating the unfolding drama. The central mystery of identifying the 'mole' within the British intelligence community is clear from the outset, yet the journey to uncovering the traitor is a demanding intellectual exercise.The palpable spy vibes distinguish it sharply from typical detective films, where clues are laid out more straightforwardly for the audience. Here, initial assumptions are often upended by plot twists that are both mind-blowing and thought-provoking, making it a heavyweight contender in the thriller genre. It's not a light watch but a film that challenges and rewards those who engage deeply with its narrative.Gary Oldman's performance is nothing short of exceptional, embodying a cool, calculated intelligence that anchors the film. The supporting cast also delivers stellar performances, contributing to the film's overall brilliance. Despite its intricate and demanding plot, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" ultimately offers a somewhat satisfying conclusion, though it might necessitate expert analysis or further reading to fully appreciate its nuanced meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A tribute to British acting talent,"Languid and laconic are the words that most come to mind when recalling this accomplished film adaptation of the famous John le Carre novel of 1974. The plot unfolds slowly and the silences are prolonged; yet the pacing and paucity work so well in this espionage drama because the direction by Swedish Tomas Alfredson is so assured, the script by British husband & wife team Peter Straughan & the late Bridget O'Connor is so compelling, and the multi-talented cast is so superlative.We are used to the British Gary Oldman playing American characters of evil intent, but here he is brilliant as George Smiley, the resilient and lugubrious hunter of the mole in MI6's Circus. He heads a roll-call of terrific British talent which includes John Hunt, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Ciarán Hinds and Benedict Cumberbatch. Even le Carre makes a momentary appearance. This is a very male movie but Kathy Burke rounds off what is almost an embarrassment of thespian ability in one film.If you've not read the novel or seen the 1979 BBC serialisation (as I haven't), you may struggle at times to follow each twist in this tale of betrayal at so many levels, but this does not spoil the experience so much as encourage a second viewing.",,Anonymous,Mystery

for the discerning few,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor, Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief.This is a common counting game, or nursery rhyme. This is also the greatest spy story ever told by arguably the finest writer of the genre, John LeCarre. And like Fleming, why are leCarre's work so inspired- because of his own spy background. In the real world is name is David Cromwell, and he was unfortunate enough to have his cover blown to the KGB by a MI6 double agent. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in many ways then is the story of his own life.Control: ""I know Moscow has planted a mole in MI6, and it is one of five men- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman and Beggarman"". A failed conversion attempt of a Hungarian general by a MI6 operative sets off the witch-hunt for this elusive mole by ""Beggarman"" Gary Oldman. This forms the basis of the movie, which is an intense concoction of dramatic interrogations, revealing flashbacks, and all pervading sense of paranoia.Set in the 70s mostly in grubby London and some more of Europe, this movie is about the real world of spies vs spies- No gunfights, slam bang car chases, high stake heists and liberal use of weapons of mass destruction. Rather this one is grim and cerebral, consists of whispered conversations in sealed rooms that help put snippets of the puzzle together to flesh out someone who has been an enigma till date. The movie has moments of dullness where nothing happens, yet so utterly engrossing that you don't move out of your seat till the final chapter plays out.And a large part of the film's appeal lies in the iconic, all British starcast- John Hurt as Control, Toby Jones as Tinker, Colin Firth as Tailor, Ciaran Hinds as Soldier, David Dencik as Poorman, Mark Strong as Jim and of course, Gary Oldman as Beggarman/Smiley. All these masters put on their best acting suits to keep the viewer engaged in an essentially drab, weathered, smoke filled setting, where the closest thing to excitement is often the telephone bell ringing. There are occasional moments of shocking cruelty but yet why the movie really works is that every little scene remains important allowing us to simultaneously conduct over very own investigations into the case, and the fact that till the very end you don't know who to trust and who not to.As the inquisitive Smiley, Gary Oldman is stupendous- here is a spy who due to personal issues may be beaten but is not broken, who pursues his task through a world filled with distrust, and corruption with a quiet sense of capability, intelligence and ruthlessness. Colin Firth, fresh from his Oscar, has a small but significant role is brutally effective, John Hurt plays his usual fatherly self, while the supporting cast of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy put in crucial and nuanced performances.Director Tom Alfredson has already impressed with the authentic vampire story- Let The Right One In, and here in addition to condensing source matter which the BBC did in 7 hour-long episodes, into a compact 2 hour feature, he also stitches together a gloomy and impenetratable atmosphere along with layered performances from the cast to create a film not for everyone, but rewarding for those who know how to look and listen. 9/10 and for the discerning viewers only.

This is no 007,"It's the 70's in the world of British Intelligence. One of their four senior operative is suspected to be a Russian mole. George Smiley codename Beggarman (Gary Oldman) was forced into retirement but brought back in to hunt down the mole. Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) is codenamed Tinker. Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is Tailor. Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) is Soldier.If 007 James Bond is the glitzy fanciful action hero spy in an unreal world, then John le Carré writes the exact opposite vision of the spy world. His is a murky, morally corrupt, unsatisfying world. And that's what we have here. The actors are beyond reproach. It's full of double speak, lies, and misdirections. Can they truly figure it all out? It's a great head scratching watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well-acted, stylish, nice cinematography, but...","I really wanted to like this film more than I did. The actors are among my favorites, the story has always gripped me. And, much of it I do like. It's moodily filmed, generating a strong and believable atmosphere of real-life espionage, and is, as I would expect from the cast, very well acted.The problem - and it's huge - is that the film makes very little sense unless you are already familiar with the book (or one of the preceding TV or radio adaptations). Even then, it's somewhat frustrating, because, much more so than prior adaptations, the plot has been tweaked, characters omitted or changed, and the dialogue fairly brutally hacked in an attempted to streamline the dense and convoluted plot. It fails to do this convincingly, in the process making the narrative less believable. Its greatest failure is to dilute the tension of the hunt for the mole, largely because none of the suspects are developed on any level as a convincing character despite the best efforts of the cast with the few minutes allotted to them for dialogue. You can argue that this is a fault of the novel too, but le Carré supplies just enough meat for you to get a convincing sense of motive and action. This is missing from the film. It not missing from either the excellent Alec Guinness TV adaptation or the equally fine Simon Russell Beale radio adaptation. Both of those I would recommend over this film.Ultimately, the book is too complex and too multi-layered to be shoehorned into a feature length movie. A gallant failure, this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
HK Neo Reviews: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"It's been a long time running since the last time I did not follow or get a movie. I am proud to announce that my latest espionage spying experience has ended in tatters as I somehow never out into it, involved or understanding the whole point of a waste of two and a half hours of my time. It is that disappointing and even more so, considering the performance of Gary Oldman (getting an Oscar nomination for the role). At the end of the day, this film is far too inaccessible for mainstream audience and even for those that do get it, I cannot see the joy of the ride.Despite Gary Oldman best efforts and probably deserved Oscar nod, the film sense of direction, pacing, editing and story are all borderline boredom. Perhaps it is not targeted at the general public, but for even a festival film experience, it is an hour too long and tad too daunting to endure. Don't get me wrong, the locations, the film sets and the film as a whole actually looks great and it is clear that the director and producers have out a lot of effort into the details. In fact most of the dialogues are cleverly written. However the problem exists in its inability to engage the audience and transcends them from boredom.All in all, to say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a bore fest is probably an understatement, but it is probably safe to say that the film has good intentions and a decent display from Gary Oldman. In spite of this, the film fails where it matters most, namely assuming everyone in the audience knows the historical backdrop of the 70s and resulting in losing the audience in the process. As much as I wanted to like and embrace this part of work, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy just doesn't work or click with me. A disappointing experience to say the least Neo rates it 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Smiley's catch,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a best selling novel, turned to an award winning BBC television serial and now a condensed version has been turned to a film with a masterful performance by Gary Oldman at the centre.The film is effectively a 1970s British noir, a 'whodunit' as veteran spy George Smiley is brought back into the secret service to flush out a Soviet mole. Oldman has to bring a different take on Smiley from Alec Guinness and manages to bring a stillness where you try to figure out what he is thinking inside his head.Swedish Director Tomas Alfredson brings a stylistic retro view of the past and relies on actors such as Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch to bring out nuggets of their characters as Smiley gets closer to unearth the mole.The film has its detractors, those who have read the book or viewed the TV series felt short changed as the film had to cut out lot of the material. Karla is unseen and some may view Mrs Smiley being virtually invisible when her behaviour is fundamental to the plot.However the film has to be seen in its own merits and its a slow, thoughtful and a deceptively good version, finely acted.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Smiley, past and present.","I have the audio and video versions of the Alec Guinness portrayal of George Smiley and enjoyed both. So I was intrigued as to how a new production, complete with new actors would supplant my ingrained vision of Control, George, Bill, Toby, Roy, Peter, Connie, Riki, Mendel etc. I have to say you need a blank sheet when watching this version as the whole thing has been re written for the cinema so comparisons will be unfair.The writing and acting cannot be faulted, how can it with such an august cast. Oldman, like Guinness, portrays Smiley as a studied man and therefore the film is just as you would expect of a spy film, as has been mentioned in other reviews, a slow burner. There are different angles explored but one thing I didn't like and it goes for all films that I watch, and that is the use of flashbacks, which, unfortunately for me, this film uses.The story is the same, its the way its portrayed that is different and now we may be able to look forward to a re-make of Smiley's People in the future.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Know it's a cliché but: disappointing for those who've read the book,"I don't know what people who haven't read the book (or any of Le Carre's other spy novels) make of this film, but for those that have then I'm sure they'd agree that the film is a bit of a disappointment. Not because it doesn't follow the plot of the book - it does that fairly well - but because in the novel, the narrative switches from Smiley's thoughtful perspective and laid back pace to the drama of the events that other characters experience quite successfully, maintaining the tension throughout the novel and keeping the reader eager to read further and know more. In this film, however, that contrast between Smiley's scenes and the action, tension and drama of other parts is lost, and everything seems to happen at the slow, silent and thoughtful pace of Smiley. Compare this film with the original ""Day of the Jackal"" with Edward Fox, and you'll see how it's possible to pull off this kind of story successfully on film. Other than that, it's well made, the scenery is great, the actors do a good job. The ending is certainly very poor, missing the confrontation between Smiley and the other antagonists that was the culmination of the novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Riveting Esponiage Film!,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is about as realistic you can get depicting spies in a movie. Based of John Le Carre's novel, this film is complex, well-acted, and it doesn't rely on car chases or action sequences to tell a story. I like action scenes, but there are some movies I'd prefer to watch without them and this is one of them. This is a story that could happen in real life and that is what makes this movie even better.Tomas Alfredson's film is about how there was a mole detected in the British MI6 and how everyone tries to find out who exactly the mole is.As mentioned before, this is very well-acted. Gary Oldman makes a perfect George Smiley with his long raincoats. There are other great, well-respected British actors here such as Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. They really did well with all the turns and twists and I always had a changing opinion about who is the mole or not.Overall, this is a riveting spy thriller that does well without the action sequences. I found myself hooked to the film even though movie many people found it boring. I did feel it moved a little too slow in parts and the length was a little long.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Boring,"I love all of these actors, mainly Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, but the story didn't really work as a film.

Complex story lines can be extremely interesting, such as in a film like Inception, but it doesn't work if the characters (that we should care about) aren't put into more harrowing situations.Overall, this doesn't change my opinion of any of these actors, whom are all extremely talented, but I think people in the industry need to stop assuming that hot-selling books are automatic crowd pleasing movies, especially when the script is as slow as Tinker Tailor.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The TV series was slow but it had style and atmosphere and suspense. This film version didn't have any of these things. Gary Oldman as George Smiley could just as well have been played by a dummy dressed in a suit. He had no emotion, no energy and just seemed to sit there looking into space. How he ever managed to get a wife with his zero personality is a bigger mystery than who the mole was. No wonder the poor woman sought solace and satisfaction elsewhere. Everything just felt flat and waiting for that spark to get the all thing going, never came. I knew who the mole was from the start after watching the original TV series, however, had I not known I would hardly have been sat on the edge of my seat wanting to know because I would not have cared.

The casting left me dead cold.,"When a well-known novel is brought to the screen, a large part of the audience is bound to be made up of people who've enjoyed the book. For that reason, if not for artistic integrity, I think it's important to try to recreate the original characters as close to their book descriptions as possible. The casting in this film left me dead cold; none of the characters seemed at all right.Much as I admire Gary Oldman — an actor capable of brilliance in a wide variety of roles — I felt he wasn't able to do justice to the role of George Smiley. It's impossible not to compare this film unfavorably with the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guinness, whose bland self-effacing — almost bumbling — Smiley defined the role for all time. Oldman projects far too much presence for Smiley & just doesn't seem able to damp it down. The renegade Ricky Tarr comes off way too contrite & nowhere near rebellious enough; David Dencik is another actor who comes on too strong for his assigned role as perennial pleaser Toby Esterhaze, Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke) was neither blowzy nor bumptious enough; & the very idea of a short plump Jerry Westerby (Stephen Graham) is ludicrous to anyone who knows & loves the original John Le Carré novels. The only casting that really hit the mark was John Hurt, who captured Control perfectly.The fault here lies squarely with the casting rather than with the actors, who did the best they could in ill-suited roles. Having read & reread the novel as well as having watched the BBC miniseries, it's hard for me to judge how clearly this film gets the story across, but I suspect quite a few moviegoers walked out of the theater scratching their heads.Big books need more space. Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove, for example, was turned into a brilliant 6-hour miniseries. Nothing less could have done it justice. The original BBC version of Tinker Tailor was done the same way for the same reason. I'd like to see a lot more such miniseries; I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to ""Jeremiah"" Johnson that way.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If you want to torture people then just make them watch this film.,"First of all I have to say, I find it hard to think of many films at all that I hate. This one definitely fits into that category though.Not only was this the most confusing film I have ever seen, it was also the most bored I ever remember being. I do like some films which require some thought process to enjoy, but there has to be something to actually think about or they are pointless. This film had nothing: no discernible plot (as far as I could tell), no characters that I particularly felt that I got to know or cared about, and I have to say that I am left totally confused by some of the characters, events and scenes (such as the point of the first scene) and about how they actually found out who the 'mole' was (as they were obviously always going to). I always think that films that start out boring have potential to pick up at the end and redeem themselves, and many do, but this one never came close.I was never expecting a James Bond style film with car chases, fire fights and gadgets but it would have been nice to have something to actually make the film at least slightly interesting. Both myself and my girlfriend, who I went with, could feel our eyelids drooping most of the way through and when leaving most films we usually talk about the good bits, whether funny, surprising, thought provoking or just memorable, but there was absolutely nothing to discuss about this film that fits into the above.As you may have gathered I was not a fan. If you, on the other hand, can understand the confusion, get the point of the bland ending and manage to make yourself sit through the 2 hours of complete boredom then good luck to you though...",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but just a touch disappointed,"I have seen the original on many occasions so there are bound to be comparisons in my own mind. However the Alec Guinness-led version has much longer to expand the characters so that must always be taken into account.The most important factor is whether you would recommend someone to go and see this film and the answer is a definite yes. So what of the film are the best and the not-so-brilliant? Excellent were Gary Oldman, as good as Guinness and less frustrating in his meekness and Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr. Very good were the rest of the cast, with the exception of Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Graham.These fine actors are obviously perfectly capable, but were. for me miscast. Cumberbatch was far too young for Peter Guillam, the man who ""ran"" Ricki Tarr as his boss, underlined by the fact he is only one year older in ""real-life"" and comfortably looked it. The last time I saw Stephen Graham was as Billy Bremner in The Damned United and with his scouser accent it just did not work for me in the role he was given.Unfortunately the climax to the film when the ""mole"" is revealed was over in a flash and there were times in the film where we spent longer watching the pouring out a glass of whisky or the many silences to music.The Director also failed completely to give us even the remotest idea as to why the ""mole"" had served his Soviet masters for so long and betrayed his country and colleagues, sending people to their death. The late scene including the traitor and Oldman promised to do so but then ended, again far too quickly. The film was unbalanced with a slow start and a rather speedy conclusion.That been said it was a good film, but I have to say that I was just a touch disappointed. I was hoping for better and the reaction of the small audience when I viewed the film, upon the end was a bit like ""is that it""? I have given the film 8/10 but it could easily have been a 7 mark and viewers would do well to concentrate hard or else they will in trouble following the plot. There are so many short scenes that quickly move on. Hence the inability of the director to allow most of the character's profiles to be made better known to the audience, who would then find the end scenes more satisfactory as a result.I would suggest another Director is given the opportunity to work on the Smiley's People follow-up, with Oldman in place and definitely a new Peter Guillam.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Was a great second watch for me,"I remember watching this movie 1st time 10 yrs ago and thought it was interesting but it was bit hard to follow back then.I rewatched it yesterday again and it kinda blew my mind.

"a cerebral and absorbing spy story, never ordinary‏","The international espionage seen in most of movies is basically car chases, action scenes and shootings. This one on the contrary, based on a John Le Carre's novel, is totally different, full of weary and normal men, having meetings in sealed rooms and strange conversations in obscure corners of London. Everything's perfect with this direction (Tomas Alfredson) and this screenplay. The camera moves in a sinister fashion, rooms are full of smoke and fear, and - overall - all the characters are real. ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is exactly right, faithful to the tone set by the novel. The viewer will see a huge number of events, characters and possibilities. Usual and ordinary spy movies have scenes that keep audience oriented, that's why they end up not looking real, whereas in this story every piece of information is mixed and meshed, forcing the viewer to think and making every performance believable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boredom at its loveliest,"The Cold War in London 1973. Can any environment be more depressing, ugly and have worse lunch restaurants?

A major disappointment,"There is no two ways about it, this version was a disappointment. The production values were top notch but somehow it seemed to skip over the story with no real substance.What I found particularly frustrating was the total lack of character introduction and development in most cases. This was particularly noticeable with the four main suspects, a couple of which hardly have speaking parts at all. Half way through the film, I was still trying to figure out who was who in some cases. It would have been nice with a simple shot of each person, with someone addressing them by name, or something equally simple.And why have some of the book's locations been switched, apparently for no good reason. Thus Prague has become Budapest, and Lisbon has become Istanbul. Perhaps it is just a case of filming convenience.The film is shot for cinema (obviously) and this means it doesn't always work that well on CD. It can get murky and rather distant. And don't get me started on the miniature subtitles.Sorry, but even allowing for the constraints of a film rather than a miniseries, I think this was only a so-so-effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Circus Mole,"Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the best-selling 1974 John LeCarre' spy novel, opinions on this movie will cover the full spectrum. Many will find it painfully slow and impossible to follow. Others will be thrilled with the subtle clues and reality-based exchanges between British spies in the early 70's. This is no James Bond thriller with exploding yachts, world class fist fights and bikini-clad women. Rather, it's a peek at what real life spies do ... huddle in soundproof rooms and exchange information through stunted conversation where just shy of enough is said.John LeCarre' actually worked for the British Secret Service prior to becoming an author (also wrote ""The Constant Gardener"" and ""The Russia House""). He based the story around when a traitor was uncovered during the biggest scandal in the history of British intelligence. This story covers some of that and even more. We see how trust and loyalty are so crucial, yet none of these men ever fully trusts the fellow agent sitting next to him. Very little is spoken, but much is communicated through a nod, raised eye brow, a slight cock of the head, or even the adjustment of one's spectacles. Cigarettes and scotch are the common ground from which discussions spring.Director Tomas Alfredson is from Sweden and delivered the exceptional vampire drama ""Let the Right One In"" a couple of years ago. Mr. Alfredson has a distinctive feel for the look of a film, and atmospheric is a word that fits this movie, as well as his earlier one. The tone, color and texture is key to this world and we are immersed in blues and grays. His camera work is unique and wondrous as he massages the small, confined spaces and allow us to pick up the gestures of all involved.The cast is a group of wonderfully talented (mostly) men: Mark Strong, John Hurt (Control), Toby Jones (Tinker), Colin Firth (Tailor), Ciaran Hinds (Soldier), David Dencik (Poor Man)and Stephen Graham. Especially enjoyable are Tom Hardy as a rogue agent who breaks the ""mole"" theory wide open, Benedict Cumberbatch as the youngest agent, and of course, Gary Oldman as George Smiley. Oldman's performance will awe many and bore a few. This is a man trained to say only what must be said. You can see the resolve in his eyes. These still waters run VERY deep. Some will compare him to the performance of Sir Alec Guiness in the BBC production, and both terrific and strong.While a rousing recommendation would be nice, it's just not in the cards. This movie will have a very specific audience ... those who thrive on mental jigsaw puzzles and are inspired by juggling an endless stream of characters and possible plots. If that describes you, then get in line on opening day.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lack of character description,"This might be a very good spy book but the way of narrating that the director chose is very hard to follow. There are lots of names (also nicknames) and events can easily confuse minds because we are lack of character descriptions. When reading the book, I guess all the characters were picturized well so when a dialog comes through about who is doing what than we could understand the situation easily. But in the film, there are just events and dialogs which might be the easiest way to make the scenario for the director but the hardest way to follow for us. Acting and the details of 70s are quite good especially the shots in İstanbul.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's AWFUL! Save your money and your time, give this one a miss!","The trailers were incredibly misleading and it is not the audience's fault if they expected more. Nowhere near as good as the book.This film is truly awful. There is no emotional development of the characters, so you don't care about them. Suspense is not built and the plot is unnecessarily slow and plodded along. Key scenes are shortened or inexplicably cut in order to give the illusion of mystery. In addition, there are random scenes which do not add to the film in any remote way and can only be described as 'filler'. There is no continuity or flow. The soundtrack is obscene.Oldman is not acting, rather just staying very still and looking pensive. Hurt's mannerisms are a carbon copy of his role as Sutcliffe in V for Vendetta. Firth is pompous. Cumberbatch and Hardy have some redeeming moments. The rest are anonymous.I heard a rumour that this was Oscar tipped. After the Hurt Locker and The Social Network soundtrack beating Inception... it is clear the Oscars are useless.Worthless film, save your money.

At this it triumphs, with Gary Oldman effortlessly pulling off the daunting task of reprising a role already made his own by Alec Guinness in the original TV version.It's one major failing - like anything else set in the seventies - is failing to convincingly recreate the sheer sartorial ghastliness of that decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The changes from the novel version didn't help,"This is an excellent movie, don't get me wrong. I loved the cinematography and the acting was superb. To fully review all of these points you would have to write an article that would be too long for this review.What I want to write about though are the changes from the novel-Version. And I don't refer to the fact that George Smiley was always described as a little overweight...The Scene, in which Smiley refers to his encounter with the Soviet head of intelligence was explicitly narrated in the novel, whereas in the movie version, it was just a short narration of Gary Oldman. Although the movie generally uses lots of flashbacks, this is where I really missed it! (Although it is great that you never see the antagonist...this could have been achieved differently).Other more substantial changes have been made to the story of Jim Prideux (Mark Strong) that did in my opinion not help the movie-version. It even left out a lot of action-scenes which could have made the movie a little more thrilling. I get it that this is not supposed to be a James-Bond clone, but you kind of expect a little action in a Spy-Thriller, don't you? Although it is possible that by my high expectations (I really loved the novel) prevented me from making up a balanced opinion, I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, if I had not read the novel I doubt that I would have understood it completely on first viewing...In conclusion, it is still an excellent movie, but it should have stuck a little closer to the novel.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"What a blast. Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who did the acclaimed horror film Let the Right One In, followed up that effort with yet another adaptation of a novel, this time written by the famed John le Carre, who himself was a real life British intelligence operative who left the service to become a full time writer. His name may not ring a bell at first, but he's responsible for countless of stories that involve spy vs spy, and in the last decade had his stories The Tailor of Panama and The Constant Gardener, amongst others, made into movies. His main protagonist of George Smiley is to him like how probably Jack Ryan is to Tom Clancy, and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the first in what would be known as the Karla Trilogy, and I'm hoping the rest could be made as well, if this is indicative of how the rest can be.I have to admit that the film moves at meditative pace, quite unlike most spy films which tend to focus on either the intrigue behind the politicking, or the action sequences. This is like an anti-thesis to the Bond films, where the figures that lurk in the shadows, stay in the shadows, rather than to blow their cover at each possible opportune. The narrative moves forward and backward very freely, and it's up to your own devices to piece things together in chronological order. But Alfredson does this without alienating or frustrating the viewer, and in fact putting scenes in their place so that they make sense, and provide you with a little bit of fun and work to figure out the complex web of relations and accounts that already exists, putting you in the driver's seat just as George Smiley (Gary Oldman) gets tasked to try and figure out the identity of a mole in the top levels of the British intelligence service.Assembling a small crack team that he could trust, the crux of the story is like an investigative drama, where suspects and witnesses get paid an imposing visit by the unsmiling (contrary to his last namesake) Smiley whom you know brings about a certain gravitas in his presence, compelling one to cooperate rather than to go against. Gary Oldman, when his character George Smiley is on to you, there's no escape and even without firing a shot his deep stare and monotonous voice hardly betrays any emotion, and will make anyone pee in their pants out of unfounded fear. In many instances one will find it perplexing why he goes about in his investigations in a certain peculiar way, and only when it's revealed much later on that it all made sense, tying in with the way the scenes got presented together, sometimes without very clear answers, relying on your ability to put 1 and 1 together.To say anything more will be to betray the necessity of the viewer to pay really close attention to every word said, and every scene being played out. There are plenty of thick dialogue in the film that calls for your utmost attention, with failure being to miss out on pertinent clues in this cat and mouse hunt, played out when one has to operate from the outside to probe into an office one held before, to look for clues and evidence without alerting the proverbial snake until the time is right. And playing probable snakes are a myriad of characters, with some of the best ensemble casting that any film will find envious of, such as Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Oldman himself, amongst others.With the spate of public officials being caught with their pants down in various scandals here in Singapore, this film couldn't be more apt when one thinks about the kind of probes that get sanctioned in order to weed out the rot right at the top, such as the appointment of a commission of inquiry to go in with authority, and with a grave mission at hand to seek accountability. In essence that's what Smiley had to deal with, being tasked out of retirement to do just that and get down to the bottom of things, with what I thought was actually a brilliant masterstroke by the mole to do things in a certain personal way that will cast doubts into the mind of its possible, powerful adversary, thinking multiple steps ahead in deliberately measured chess game. And the fact is that the story is also quite close to real life, being le Carre's novelized account of his own experiences of the 50s and 60s scandal that revealed the Cambridge Five traitors within Britain.In most real life spy versus spy cases, there's always a distinct lack of pomp or to keep things under wraps for fear of having one's cover blown apart, or jeopardizing the prospects of other agents. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy also subscribes to this mantra that shuns big movement and action, but in its place comes the real treasure of the intricate work done to uncover leaks and spies with tools of utmost secrecy, and diplomacy to a certain extent where deals get cut and made. It's old school spy 101, but has more than enough fuel in its tank to warrant repeat viewings just to catch all the subtleness and complexities. Highly recommended as the thinking man's spy thriller!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too slow pace,"How does J.K. Simmons in Whiplash appropriately say 'Not quite my tempo'. It's the same for me with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.The starting position is not even bad. Interesting basic story, good staging, brilliant cast and a consistently high quality. But these quality features can't make me overlook the fact that the movie is simply boring for long stretches. It is treading water and not really making any progress. At around 2 hours, the movie doesn't even have a long running time. I even thought to myself at the beginning, hopefully the movie isn't too short.That may sound paradoxical. Basically, I think it's good when movies take the necessary time. It just has to fit the overall construct. I feel that the movie wallows in its nostalgia and created style, forgetting to entertain the viewer as well.The movie has its good moments but the main problem is the pace.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A complete waste of a mind-bogglingly good cast.,"This is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen, here is why... The audience at the cinema was choc-a-bloc with silver haired, distinguished types probably yearning for an intelligent spy thriller which would pay homage to the Alec Guinness's famous television mini-series. What they got was a snail paced, bland piece of story-telling set in a post-cold war era that seemed to lack any sense of conflict or relevance. The story is essentially about the Head of British intelligence believing that there was a double agent at the top of the organisation. He then subsequently dies, so little is made of this that if you mistakenly enjoy a long blink, (which you probably will during the course of the film) you would miss what I would've assumed to be a fairly significant event. Smiley (Gary Oldman) is then brought back from retirement to investigate this further... I just feel like so many different story trails were started and never addressed, let alone finished. What was the information being passed on? Was it significant? What was the motivation for being a double agent? Was there anything sinister about the Head of British intelligence's death? Well the answers won't be revealed by this film. I am all for subtlety and a thought provoking, engaging plot but this left me feeling that each scene veered from egg white to cream. Another dire aspect of this film was the lack of depth to any of the characters. Put simply, I didn't have a bleeding clue about the background of well... anyone. Annoying as the acting talent available was so obviously outstanding. This was either a bad film, or I didn't appreciate the meaningful stares, unspoken dialogue or mysteriousness-ness of it all. My advice is to avoid this film, or counteract it's soporific effects by renting The Rock , Mission Impossible or Bourne Identity to blow the cobwebs away from your mind immediately after.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Also, as a foreign audience, i had some troubles to remember and tell the characters' last names, first names, secret code names, etc. I had not read the books, and maybe that's the reason why i felt this film is quite hard to follow... my brain went through the tough time.However, I also think that it is very worth to watch it, because I might have unconsciously felt that movies on spy are supposed to be splendid and full of visually thrilling stuff. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy actually broke the stereotype, and i'm grateful. Besides, in fact there are lots of scenes which make my palms sweaty even though the movies go so calm and silent all the time. This is very interesting and brilliant. I think this movie is one you should watch if interested in spy genres.

"Stinker, staler: an epic in dull, plodding movie making","This is one of those films in which everybody looks at everybody else deeply meaningfully, to convey a story that by now lacks both originality and interest (who is the mole in the organization?! wowee!). The characters even walk slowly and purposefully to ensure you realize they're involved in something terribly significant.Every small step of the plot is unfolded with the kind of heavy handed, overblown technique so beloved of the pretentious auteur directors of the 1960s. I thought they didn't make them like this any more, but unfortunately I was wrong. I'd like to give such an obviously high quality cast and production team the benefit of the doubt; that they caught me in a bad mood on a bad day. But when you see even railway trains overacting you have objective evidence that you're watching a film whose makers think they're a darn sight smarter than they really are. One cutaway shows a portion of railway track switching — presumably symbolism that someone in the story just got the point (geddit?).I'm sorry I couldn't like this one better; it is meant to give us a realistic view of the tedious but dangerous business of cold war spying. But it takes ponderous, pretentious movie making to new heights. Perhaps we should put it on the record as the first film in which the techniques of method acting are extended to infest everyone concerned, right down to the chief grip.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In fact there were no childish gimmicks, it stuck to the story which is much more the dark real life of cold war espionage.A very strong cast with some outstanding performances. Gary Oldman is one of the best film actors around today and his performance here was on par with the great Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes John Le Carre and especially those who enjoyed the TV series. I would advise those with a short attention span or can't handle thinking to steer clear.

Requires more than a 30 second attention span,"I loved this adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I think the casting was about as perfect as it was possible to be and the setting of the Circus was grim, forbidding and claustrophobic. Mark Strong's performance as Jim Prideaux was very moving and this movie shows what a versatile and clever actor he is. Gary Oldman was quite simply astonishingly good. he captured the dark brooding thoughtfulness of Smiley to perfection. I really can't say there was an average performance by anyone throughout the entire movie, they all shone, especially Benedict Cumberbatch after Smiley advises him to assume he is being watched. I cannot name the actor who plays the mole in case you have not yet viewed the movie or know its outcome, I'll just say his fall from grace was amazing.I know some people have complained it's difficult to follow, but the world of espionage is not like the James Bond world, and lets not forget, David Cornwell (AKA John Le Carrié) was actually one of the funny people. He knew the world we never see was populated by intelligent but socially inadequate losers.

Not for newcomers,"I suspect that if you've read the novel, or seen the mini series, then Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a thoroughly enjoyable watch. For my sins, I have not, so my review is from that perspective.I'll admit that knowing the plot outline of George Smiley needing to root out the mole from four suspects, and seeing Firth, Strong, Cumberbatch and Hardy on the cast list, I was excited. It's possible that my assumption that there was correlation in the fours was part of my issue. However I don't think so. Perhaps the characters played by Hardy and Strong are the most charismatic, or have the most interesting story in the original source material. However when squeezing it all into a two hour movie, you need to reduce things to the bare bones. Ultimately from that respect, this movie spent far too much time concentrating on two characters who weren't really that relevant to the main plot. The result was that we had very little screen time with the suspects and were given little opportunity to join in with George on his investigation.In the end, due to the way the story was cut down for the movie, it played out that two very simple steps from George revealed the culprit. Steps which he actually could have taken right at the start of his investigation.The acting was superb as you would expect (Oldman's subtle performance against type was particularly impressive), and the sense of time and place at the height of the cold war was captured perfectly. Ultimately though, this came across too much like a film solely for existing fans of the book. And to be honest, what's the point of that?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Spent and Dark World of Spies as only Le Carre Can Tell It--007 Could Never Conceive It,"The idealized world of spy adventure which is the trademark of the James Bond books and films really has nothing to do with foreign intelligence. Unlike Ian Fleming (who wrote the James Bond novels), John Le Carre's vision of the world of spies came directly from first-hand experience. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Le Carre worked for British Intelligence and the British Foreign Service, taking part in wire taps, break-ins, and defector interrogations. This is a world of shadowed corners, darkened rooms, uncomfortable headsets, and endless transcriptions, not ski resorts and casino hotels.Gary Oldman offers the performance of his career as the older intelligence genius, George Smiley, assigned to find the ""mole"" inside a branch of British Intelligence code-named ""the Circus"". A mole is a double-agent, someone pretending to be on one side but in fact working for the other who has burrowed himself inside the upper-reaches of the organization, allowing for easy access to classified information which can be leaked to the other side. When a younger agent, Jim Prideaux, is sent on a mission to Budapest to meet with a general supposedly defecting to the west, it becomes obvious the other side knew almost immediately about the meeting. The meeting point is at a café which turns deadly when even before the meeting has begun, he is shot at. In other words, someone in British Intelligence had informed the other side of the meeting. Also, a another young low-level agent goes to the east and befriends a young woman looking to defect who claims she has knowledge about an intelligence mole.Smiley goes on a kind of murder-mystery-like investigation to determine why the Budapest meeting became a fiasco and simultaneously uncover the identity of the mole. Each of the witnesses give their understanding of the story, how they are involved, and how each story fits into a larger mosaic of intrigue and betrayal. Part of the trick to navigating this film is understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment. The top suspects are all high-ranking British Intelligence agents, and given code names: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poor Man. When he identifies the perpetrator, instead of indicating them by name, Smiley will simply offer the code name.An outstanding, if darkly atmospheric film which is a much more realistic portrayal of the shrouded world of foreign espionage. Some younger viewers may be frustrated because of the lack of action and the less than straight-forward linear progression. Each piece of the puzzle takes time to come to the fore. This film is more of a subtler suspense thriller rather than an action movie. Early on, many incidences are revealed without explanation at first. But if you can be patient, the film really starts to kick in at about the 30 to 45 min mark.What we really learn is that the world of spies is ultimately about secrets. Who has them, who doesn't, and who doesn't want which secret to be revealed to whom. And all of the participants are haggard, spent people, not the glamorous icons portrayed in Hollywood spy thrillers. The skis, cocktails, waitresses, and roulette tables are strangely absent. Dim halls, unkempt studies, and damp cells are where these people reside.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The  unglamorous world of espionage.,"Director Tomas Alfredson and company do their best to deglamorize the surly double dealing world of counter intelligence in John Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor soldier spy. Drained of color and muted in every way ( tan and gray seems to be the fashion choice for everyone ) it is a long way from the jet setting action packed world of James Bond.After a mission goes very bad in Budapest the head of a British Intelligence branch, Control ( John Hurt) is forced out along with agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) of the bureau. When it's discovered that a mole is operating within the agency Smiley is brought back in an attempt to expose him.Without the fast cars, gadgets, babes and things to blow up TTSS is a pretty somber and low key affair that has an intriguing enough start. The agents are mostly surly, cynical and distrustful and suspects are numerous. The narrative itself is a series of confusing flashbacks and dark shadows however and the film soon begins to drown in convolution bogging down in excessive wordplay and the occasional shock incidental.Oldman as Smiley looks and moves with a convincing world weary persona of a man who takes his work seriously, maybe too much. Director Alfredson's intent to keep things low key drains the life out of most of his characters, especially Smiley and by extension the picture itself. His direction overall is erratic at best as his juggling act of adding peripheral characters and placing more importance than needed on superfluous scenes only serves to make matters more distracting and confusing. Sober as it is most of the way Alfredson tacks on a mawkish denouement with a touch of happily ever after summed up in natty threads and an expression of smug satisfaction which deviates in a jarring way the film's mood and tone over the previous two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very possibly the most boring movie i've seen in years.,"I went to see this with a small group of frequent movie goers and in a decently filled cinema and i must say it was terrible. The pacing was so incredibly slow and boring that half of the cinema was struggling to stay awake through it, the plot is disjointed and although the main plot has so few actually notable points that it can be summed up in a paragraph; it's space is stuffed mostly with endless boring monologues explaining points that probably shouldn't take so long, the extra space could be used to make the plot more interesting.The plot doesn't progress until halfway through the movie and even then its a slow crawl to the end, with the emphasis on the slow. The acting was delivered on par with the rest of the movie, slow and dull, and at this point the levels of awful the movie was putting out had me actually in hysterics, for the sheer lack of significance the movie seems to put forward. Everything seems pointless and i could spend half the movie asleep and i could still give you a detailed summery of the important points of the movie, this is not an argument in its favor.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sublime,"This film really is my cup of tea. I loved the acting, I loved the pace, I loved the story, in short it was, for me, 2 hours 7 minutes of cinema heaven! That said, I can see it's not for everyone.I did not catch the BBC TV series, and have not read the book but, I had no difficulty with the plot. The understated direction and lack of Jason Bourne style action was refreshing and undoubtedly a lot closer to real-life espionage. Another reviewer described the pace as ""glacial"", that's probably fair but, a glacier is one of the most powerful and majestic forces of nature, you just need a bit of patience to see the massive impact it can have.If you're an action-film-only fan then best not bother with this one. - though, if you already have, don't be too harsh (like saying nobody should ever watch it) but, instead, try and appreciate there are horses for courses. Personally I have time for both Smiley AND Bourne but Smiley is just a bit more my style.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Murky and enigmatic,"Until now, I thought a mole was something like a small permanent mark on the skin, or a spicy Mexican sauce (molé), but I discovered in Tomas Alfredson's spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy that a mole is also an individual who has infiltrated a high-level organization in order to provide its highly guarded secrets to the opposition/enemy/other side. Murky, enigmatic, and often confusing (if you haven't read the book or seen the TV series), the film is supported by an outstanding ensemble cast that includes Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch, and manages to be worth figuring out, but the ride is not always illuminating.Based on the 1974 novel by John le Carré and the 1979 television series that starred Alec Guinness, the current adaptation by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan has less time than the others to capture the essence of the byzantine narrative yet, in the end, it probably doesn't matter because the film is more about mood and character than plot. Set in Britain in the 1970s at the height of the Cold War with the War in Vietnam still in process, the head of British Intelligence named Control (John Hurt) as well as senior agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced to resign after a botched operation in Budapest, Hungary (under Soviet control at the time).In the operation, Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) tries to track down a rumor that the ""Circus"" has been infiltrated by a Russian agent, believed to be one of four key figures in the agency. His job was to bring in a Russian general who allegedly wanted to defect and could provide the name of the infiltrator but Prideaux was gunned down and there was no defection. It seems apparent that Prideaux has been killed but later, when we see him teaching a class at a private boys' school, we are shown in flashback how he was able to survive. Smiley, a close-lipped professional diplomat who has a look on his face that suggests many hidden secrets, is asked to come out of retirement by the new Circus clown Percy Alleline (Toby Jones).His new job is to track down the mole in order to protect his own operation which he gives the dubious name of ""Witchcraft."" The plot gets even thicker when Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) another British agent, appears on the scene telling Smiley that he had met Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who is married to a Soviet delegate, professes to know the identity of the mole. Additionally, Smiley's visit to Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke), another colleague who was forced to resign, leads him to the Russian spy Polyakov, who turns out to be a very important player.It is soon clear (if anything is worthy of that description) that the mole can be only one of four people codenamed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, or Spy. These are Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hands), and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), along with Tarr, who some suspect is a traitor. Smiley works with an agent named Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), who he sends to collect information, often from the same British intelligence agency for which he is currently working.Like the 1966 Richard Burton film, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the spy business is shown as cynical and ambiguous, where loyalty and betrayal can be two sides of the same coin, and where both good guys and bad guys operate in the same moral parameters, meaning do whatever it takes and ignore ethical considerations. While individual scenes succeed in building tension and paranoia, putting them all together requires work, and the effort does not always produce results. When we do find the name of the culprit, the discovery lacks any real emotional impact. When Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy works, it has some wonderful engaging moments that resist the temptation to sensationalize, but unfortunately, these moments are few and far between.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The premise is hard to fit into two hours and into this sort of plot-structure,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a movie adapted from one of the best Cold War era crime novels, with the same title with a slight difference: ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy"". When you put commas as they appear on the 1974 novel cover, you get to understand that a tinker is a spy, a tailor is a spy, and a soldier also is a spy. And when you think of it, you get to ask yourself this question:""Why would a tinker turns a spy, and a tailor, and a soldier too?""Take a guess to answer the question above. 'Cause if you don't, the movie, which is terribly directed, won't tell you what the spies are trying to find out. Here is the truth after the unknown. The truth lies underneath a tongue twister game Children of the Cold War in Britain used to play. The tongue twister is this, as it appears on the prologue of John le Carré 's novel:""Tinker... Tailor... Soldier... Sailor... Rich... Poor... Beggar... Robber, take the sea-shells and take the jacket buttons, trade in daisy leaves and trade in sunflower seeds, now you did, we are friends, we are friends, we are friends""While reading the novel, which is consisted of 42 episodes, 7 episodes for each occupation from the children's tongue twister and there are 6 pieces in the game of Chess. 7 times 6 equals to 42. When you pair them with each other, you get to solve the mystery:Chess pieces from highest rank to the lowest rank: ""King... Queen... Rook... Bishop... Knight... Pawn""Let's pair them: ""Tinker is King... Tailor is Queen... Soldier is Rook... Sailor is Bishop... Rich is Knight... Poor is Pawn""When Bishop(Gary Oldman as Smiley) explores the Rook(John Hurt as Control)'s chess board with the names and photos of his subordinates(Knight and Pawn), even Smiley didn't know that he was the Bishop. And when the Knight(Mark Strong as Prideaux) is assassinated, what should the Rook do next? That's what the movie is about.Since the promise is a heavy secret, which both the screenwriters and the director hides away from the audience, to fit the story into this sort of plot-structure ; then you don't have much to tell.John le Carré 's novel is one of the best boring novels I've ever read in my life, even though it has a unique mystery. Yes, it's a mystery, but in fact there is nothing happening at the present time. It's just all thoughts and ideas about the events in the past, in order to find the mole that destroys the organization's plans. Should every crime story necessarily be involved with a mole?So, don't expect nothing original to find, when you're watching Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, except some unique production aspects as follows:1- Unpredictable hero 2- No bad guy to challenge against 3- An unrevealed secret turns good guys into bad guys 4- Suspicion, kills! 5- Spectacular views from some European cities, the shots from the city of Istanbul are the most accurate ones(except the Hotel shot) after other hit movies such as Eastern Promises, James Bond: From Russia With Love and a Jackie Chan comedy/crime flickIf you really want a good crime/thriller/mystery watch Robert De Niro and Matt Damon 's The Good Shepherd(2006), since in this specific genre and sub-genre mix no better movies filmed yet.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This film rewrites the thriller genre,"Call me old-fashioned but isn't a thriller supposed to be kind of 'thrilling', isn't the clue in the name? I don't mind films that start slowly but this film never gets going. In fact, Gary Oldman's affectations make it even slower. Do we really need 3 images of him swimming in the Serpentine? Or wherever it's meant to be. I don't remember any meaningful dialogue, for me it was fairly obvious the way it was going to go, I couldn't have cared less about the characters. What a waste of the cream of British talent. I wouldn't even know where to start with 'How could it have been better?'

'There is a mole amongst us. Lets all sit down and talk about it.' I loved it!,"This is already turning out to be a movie that you'll either just love, or hate. Or perhaps this is a bit of a too simple thing to say really, since it's also really being a movie that you must be in the right mood for. I guess I was in the mood for it, since I basically loved every second of it.It's a spy thriller but a very talkative one. There really is no action in this movie and also no crazy gadgets or any over-the-top movie villains, that try to destroy the world. Just a bunch of middle aged guys inquiring and almost constantly suspecting each other, in the midst of the cold war frenzy. And this is of course also what it really is and was like for most MI6 agents. It makes this a more realistic movie than the average spy thriller but also obviously a far less exciting one. Not that I minded this though.The movie simply has other qualities to it. I for instance really liked the movie its atmosphere. I admit that I'm often fond of cold war thriller and their overall visual style and atmosphere, so this movie was right up my alley. I really liked its time period and the almost constant sense of paranoia. Even when you don't always get what is going on in its story, you still should be able to be grabbed by it, due to the way it is all getting told, by its director, writers and actors involved.It really was foremost Gary Oldman's performance that got me into this movie and put me in the right mood for it. I had never seen him act so...well, British! He is of course a British actor, that is however far better known for his work in big American productions. Seeing him- and hearing him play a very British, literary character, was a great experience. They even aged him up convincingly for his role in this movie, which made his character work out all the better. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more movies with the George Smiley character in it. As long as he also still gets played by Gary Oldman of course!But he most definitely is not the only well known and great actor in this movie. Actors like Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciarán Hinds, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch are all in this!I enjoyed every second of it, though I can definitely see how this movie might bore certain people. It's simply not a movie for just everybody and it also really requires you to be in the right mood for it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Behind Glasses,"I haven't seen the original mini-TV-series from the UK, so I can't judge the movie on behalf of that nor compare it to it. What I can say, is that this movie has superior acting in it, a story that does condone repeated viewing and just enough ""action"" to make it work. Why do I say the latter? Because there are a lot of people who'll dismiss this as talking heads movie. And this perception is not really wrong, because if you really want to see action and stunts and all that, than you shouldn't watch this movie.On the other hand, the talking heads do an amazing job and every nuance in their performance is just great.

Compelling but confusing,"I didn't see this in the theater, and just watched it on TV. (Well, ""It's not TV, it's HBO,"" heh heh.)I've read many John le Carre novels, including TTSS and most of the George Smiley saga ~ but not recently. Nevertheless, I had a very difficult time following the plot of this film.The 2-3 pages worth of User Reviews I just read seem to be split between high praise and full-out criticism. My reaction is somewhere in-between. I was NOT put off, for example, by the generally seedy look of all the settings; I accepted that as realistic. My main problem was with the lack of exposition, and the seemingly random back-and-forth transitions between present time and flashback.I find it hard to believe that ANYONE could follow this film who had not RECENTLY read the book or watched the BBC video.Nevertheless, for whatever reason, I couldn't stop watching, I had to watch a second time, and now I have the book on hold at the library and the Alec Guinness series lined up in my Netflix queue.While I found the film difficult to understand, something about the film made me really WANT to understand.

Excellent Spy Thriller and Mystery,"In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.Other reviewers have complained that the film is too ""obtuse"", and in fact the movie was recommended to me because the person who watched it did not know what they had seen and wanted to know if I could figure it out any better. And yes, it takes a while to get the timeline and characters straight.But I think this is a strong movie for just that reason.

stellar performances,"Brilliant film... Stellar performances from Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Tom Hardy. Everyone actually - it was a real ensemble piece. The pace was slow and back and forth, and that added to the overall style and gritty realism of the film. The silences and un-answered questions were tantalisingly intriguing adding to the mystique of the spy genre, I felt I was investigating too... Having not read the book, I am ashamed to say, I didn't know what to expect of course. Lots of homo-erotic subtext, which added another onion layer to the piece, which I understand wasn't in the book, and I felt the cinematography, and spirit of the film was very in keeping with the era. The film was graphic in an emotionally gripping way, not in a gratuitous way, and there were so many scenes that will stick in the mind for various reasons and for the brilliant way they were portrayed; a certain bullet hole... the love scene... tears when a partner leaves etc. Smiley was always known as being invisible, a grey/brown character and the perfect spy and the whole film sort of took on that mantle. Superb film. Tom Hardy adds again to his chameleon status, he really was incredible. I don't quite know how he does it!! There will be gongs a-plenty for this!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A complete failure,"I have seen the TV series of this novel made in 1979 three times and the performance by Alec Guinness as George Smiley was one of the great milestones in the history of television drama. Compared to him, in this sad and failed new film version, the performance as Smiley by Gary Oldman is utterly pathetic. Oldman is so wooden he should really be growing in Kew Gardens. On the rare occasions when he moves or tries to show some expression, it is like watching the twitching of a corpse in its coffin, having been given a slight shock by a portable battery. The only decent performances in the film are by John Hurt and Colin Firth, who simply do not know how to be bad, no matter how hard the director attempts to make them so. Mark Strong as Prideaux does well. Everyone else is lost in a wilderness of incompetent direction. The screenplay is so bad that it could enter the list of Worst Film Scripts of All Time. The film is rambling, incoherent, incomprehensible, mumbled, vague, affected, pompous, stupid, and an offence to the viewer's intelligence. It is as if Donald Duck had been asked to film Shakespeare, so comical is it as a pastiche of a spy film. Was it the intention of Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner to make a comedy on the sly? Is that their game? If so, why was Dawn French not cast as Smiley so we could have some real laughs? Now, that would have been worth it. This film is what my late friend John Trevilian would have called 'wrist-slashingly depressing' (which was one of his salubrious phrases). Of course, what does ooze from this misbegotten film, as it does from any John le Carré story, is the omni-presence of treachery in Britain. Britain over the past century has produced traitors in the way that a stagnant pond breeds mosquitoes. There must have been at least 150 major Soviet agents working for the British Government between 1930 and 1990, most of them in the Foreign Office, though always some in the Home Office. In the TV series, the 'finger code' was prominent, for identifying the mole. This was probably based upon the 'toe code' which appears really to have been used by MI6. When Kim Philby reached the Soviet Union he sent a cryptic message back to England by an individual whom he trusted saying that 'the middle toes of both my feet were black'. I always took this to mean that he was not a genuine defector but a 'plant' sent to find out who the mole was, but from his message it appears that there were two. The film omits the finger code altogether. The only famous traitor I ever met was Sir Anthony Blunt. I spent an uncomfortable hour discussing an art matter with him in his grand office at Portman Square when he was Director of the Courtauld Institute. At that time no one would have dreamt that such a man could be a spy. The instant I set eyes upon him I sensed that I was in the presence of a dangerous killer-reptile. I have never hated anyone so violently at first sight, and he seemed to feel the same way about me. It was as if we had known each other in a former life and hated each other before. He was one of the most arrogant, supercilious, snobbish individuals I ever encountered, and utterly loathsome. He covered himself in a vestment of unctuous politeness which oozed vanity and contempt. The atmosphere in the room congealed into a solid state of mutual hatred. We somehow made it through our meeting, despite the fact that to judge from our eyes, what we really wanted to do was lunge at each other's throats and attempt to kill one another. Fortunately, I have never had this happen with anyone else, as it was most disturbing. The hatred was so intense and so instantaneous between us that I am at a loss to give any normal or rational explanation. Many years later, when he was unmasked, I was at last able to say to myself that he was genuinely a villain, and I had not been imagining it. Security chiefs can also be odd. Long before anyone had ever heard of her, or could conceivably have imagined that she was a spook, I sat beside Stella Rimington at dinner, and she did her best to appear an ordinary person. She was tense, brittle, sharp as a whip, totally on the ball, and intermittently prickly. Strange how little innocent Stella at a harmless dinner party steered the subject of conversation onto what I thought of Soviet penetration of the Foreign Office. Such an innocent, in a simple frock! I once saw Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller interviewed on the television news. I thought she came across as an idiot. Let's hope it was just bad 'presentational skills' and not congenital idiocy. Perhaps this all goes to show that security bosses slightly resemble human beings, in that they too can range from the brilliant to the terminally foolish (with all the disastrous consequences that the latter implies). Surely the worst security boss the West has ever known was Allen Dulles, and that was not because he was a fool, but for the opposite reason, that he was too clever, and thought controlling the CIA was not good enough for him, so why not the world instead. The depiction of security bosses in this pathetic film may indeed be its one merit, for if this serves to inform the public that some of the weirdest people in the world are in charge of all our destinies, and that many of them appear to have been dragged foaming at the mouth from an insane asylum in order to preside over assassinations, 'the war of terror', renditions, torture, and the humiliation of airline passengers, then congratulations!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not good!,"The reason for my going to this movie was simple Gary Oldman.

It is not a bad story, but could have been developed much better. Still, I am giving all the credits to Gary Oldman and his acting in the movie. I am thinking to myself, if there was no Gary Oldman, I would have badly regretted going there! Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not a bad movie, but it is not a good one, either.

So much so that I came away from the cinema feeling emotionally drained from the moving ending, the complexity of plot, the suspense, and the great acting, etc. I felt very rewarded for having the patience to pay attention and not give up!! This is not everyones type of film, and I think that's part of the problem. I'm not being snobby at all, but some people are just not interested in 'serious' films like this, and some people are.

"John le Carré, RIP","John le Carré died recently, so I decided to watch the movie adaptation of his ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", having missed it when it got released.

Despite there being protagonists and antagonists, no one's really a good guy; there are shady things going on everywhere.It's one movie that really grips you and leaves you shaken. I recommend it to everyone. In addition to Gary Oldman (in an Academy Award-nominated performance), it stars John Hurt, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and Toby Jones. To put that another way, it stars Winston Churchill, Adam Sutler, George VI, Dr. Sivana, Bane and Truman Capote.In conclusion - to riff on the Rolling Stones song that incorporates the nursery rhyme from which the novel got its title - dandelions don't tell no lies.PS: Right before the US invaded Iraq, le Carré wrote an article titled ""The United States of America has gone mad"".

"In my opinion, i hated it","When i saw the trailer for this film, i thought it looked alright, then i saw a poster on a bus stop and realised it had some good actors in that i liked. 10 minutes into this film i realised it was not what i had thought, it had a poor start (= a poor first impression) and the whole film is just dull, pointless and boring. The actors are good, but in terms of action, violence, bad language, or anything that may give a slight adrenaline rush, there is none. The only people who would enjoy this is people over 60 who lived through the seventies. I did not understand what was going on through the whole film and it was so boring i considered leaving half way through. The props and scenery are not too bad i suppose and the effects are terrible. eg. when they're in a car or a boat you can tell they're not really and its a green screen effect. There is so many pointless and random scenes, eg. Gary old man swimming in a lake with a load of other men, there is not even a hint why hes there or where he is, and when Benedict cumberbatch gets into the elevator, there is a sign in bold saying ""close the door when you leave or others cant call the elevator"" or something like that, and when he leaves the elevator he leaves the doors open. But it has nothing to do with the movie whatsoever. 75% of the scenes are old men in an old fashioned office, smoking (which they are pretending to do very badly, they take it back and then when they speak there is no smoke..) and discussing in a weird language that they have to find out who the mole is, and leaving the cinema at the end i think no one had any idea at all who the god damn mole was.

"Beautiful and mesmerising, it is a masterpiece.","I have not seen the original mini series that this is based on (At the time of writing this review, I plan to see it) but this film blew me away. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is crafted perfectly with matriculates detail. The look of the film is beautiful, setting the tone perfectly for the film, and showing the style of the era. The All-Star cast of British actors all do amazing jobs in their roles, Benedict Cumberbatch and Garry Oldman stealing the show. One of my few complaints is that John Hurt and Stephen Graham did not get anywhere near enough screen time, as they are both fantastic actors, but that is just nitpicking. There is also a bit of score in the scene where Cumberbatch's character is infiltrating to get a file that didn't fit the scene that took me out of the movie, but is nothing major.If your expecting a spy film with car chases or big explosions or cool gadgets, look elsewhere, this film is a different look at spy thrillers, and pulls off its goal perfectly. The pacing is great, but for people more accustomed to James Bond-style spy flicks may find it slow, if this is the case, then this isn't the film for you.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy easily gets a 9/10 from me and is one of the best films of 2011 and of the the spy thriller genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A thriller that thrills only half the time,"So this is a good ""who done it"" Cold War thriller, but with some small changes it could've been GREAT. The cast is solid and it has a really interesting plot (especially if you're into espionage). Gary Oldman is very good (as expected) and there are very, very strong supporting roles. As an ensemble, the cast was very impressive.The problem is the first half of this movie is just really way too slow, I mean just brutally so. As hard as I tried, I was battling staying awake while watching the first half. The director just spent way too much time detailing the monotonous activities around spies and the initial investigation that they completely lost me. I like my thrillers to be a little more upbeat and better paced (and by a little I mean A LOT).The second half however really picks up and they are some really good, unexpected surprises as the mole is eventually uncovered. It's a little convoluted, but not much more so than your average film in the genre. It's a shame though; edit or cut out twenty minutes out the first half of this film and I think you have one of the best thrillers of 2011.

A man should know when to leave the party...,"This must be the real world of espionage. Not the car chases and excitement of James Bond, but men who sit and smoke and drink and discuss.The film requires concentration. It isn't dull, but may strike some viewers, especially younger ones, as exactly that. There are a lot of characters to juggle in the search for a mole.Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In) provides a chilling and atmospheric story that presents clues in oblique references.With John Hurt as Control and Gary Olman as George Smiley, the film features a host of more than competent actors. Smiley is brought out of retirement as part of a covert effort to uncover a Soviet turncoat. With the help of his protégé Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), Smiley has to determine which of his former colleagues it might be: Percy (Toby Jones), Bill (Colin Firth), Roy (Ciaran Hinds), or Toby (David Dencik).If you're in the mood for expertly handled tension, subtle menace and superior acting by everyone involved, this is not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Impressive adaptation of the famous spy novel.,"We do not meet George Smiley straight away. He wears a dispassionate, icily glazed expression upon his face. He is aging: his hair is turning silvery grey, and at first glance, whether it be his reticence, his stiff movements, his thin, tightly pressed lips, or his daily swim in a nearby lake amongst others his age, practising backstroke at a glacial pace while leaves, brown and decaying, blow onto the surface of the metallic water, we may conclude that he is tired and indifferent – not that interesting a character at all. That is our first mistake. For behind those observant, grey eyes of his, magnified a little by his darkly rimmed spectacles, burns a quiet, festering rage, born of unhappiness and the cruel realisation that the cause he may have believed he was fighting for in his youth is a worthless, corrupt, brutal sham.Yet his cold determination and impersonal, terrifyingly brilliant logic betray him. He knows the rules of the game, has been disgusted by them, and yet keeps on playing. Where most fiction would take a protagonist like George Smiley and simply turn him into some kind of martyr, what we find here is something far more disquieting. For Smiley, in his undercover investigation of a possible mole in 'The Circus' (commonly known as MI6), finds a primitive satisfaction in his success; his own horrible realisation of the reality of his work is long in the past, buried deep somewhere behind those large, grey eyes, and this might be the only source of pride that he can feel as he begins to age. Perhaps he was emotional when he was younger – indeed, in one of the best scenes in the film (one of many, I hasten to add), Smiley tells us of his desperation to save the life of a Russian spy; this venture was perhaps the last straw for Smiley, and fully secured his disillusionment. The film ends with Smiley facing the camera, and we can almost see him smile, for the first time in the film. But this isn't a happy ending, and I didn't leave the cinema liking the protagonist at all; instead, he gave me shivers.Of course, the source material - John Le Carre's brilliant novel of the same name - is over 400 pages long, and was long ago adapted into an award winning miniseries starring that cinematic giant of yesteryear, Alec Guinness. Gary Oldman now has the role of George Smiley, and safe to say, he excels. An Oscar nomination will doubtlessly come his way next year. It is an exquisite performance – all nuance, body language, gesture. Only once in the whole film does Smiley even raise his voice above his tired monotone; yet the performance is an incredible, unique, vividly memorable piece of art.Of course, the notion of having Tomas Alfredson as director was always a stroke of genius. Still fresh from universal critical acclaim for his 2008 masterpiece 'Let The Right One In', here he demonstrates once more just how important a director he is, injecting his own unique brand of 'Swedish melancholia' into his brilliant new adaptation. The result is fascinating; Alfredson gives as much weight to files being transported from one floor to the next and stored away in a cupboard to a botched assassination across the seas. Here, the assassins, rather than just being dispassionate, unfeeling cogs in the clockwork of the plot, are terrifyingly human – their hands shake, and beads of sweat threaten to betray their real intent.Alfredson transports us to a Seventies of grainy greys, browns, blacks, and heavily diluted, artificial greens and blues, executing his palette with such loving, meticulous precision that the oppressive atmosphere of corruption, sorrowful disenchantment and the danger of violence lurking just behind every corner, almost becomes a character in itself. This could well be the most unglamorous spy thriller ever made. Of course, as hinted at before, the plot centres around Smiley's investigation as regarding a mole at the top of MI6, a fact that Smiley's boss and friend, Control (a marvellous performance from John Hurt) was sure of; his determination to discover the culprit led to a disastrous mission in Budapest, from which he was left reeling shortly before his death. Now, the task is left to Smiley.The bad guy is painfully easy to spot – it shouldn't come as any surprise when the 'twist' is revealed. But that is irrelevant – for where this film excels, and what makes it so outstanding, is in its exploration of the disappointment, cruel disillusionment and suffocating emotional claustrophobia that these characters have unwittingly signed up to: emotional ties are dangerous, and often unsustainable. Smiley knows all too well, and it is another stroke of genius that neither his wife, nor his 'nemesis' Karla are ever seen in plain view – they are obscured memories, slowly decaying in some part of his imagination as his anger and wounded pride continue to fester. Of course, Alfredson has done his homework. He has read his source material and managed to condense it into a single 2 hour film without it ever feeling unduly rushed – indeed, it is actually quite measured and stately. There are countless masterful scenes, including one involving Benedict Cumberbatch in the Government Archives, that is nerve shreddingly tense – Hitchcock would have been envious. The supporting cast is also a dream: a magnificent medley of British acting talent, including John Hurt, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and Toby Jones, to name but a few.'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is an excellent piece of filmmaking – dark, uncompromising, perfectly measured and alarmingly detached, restrained and cruel. It is, even with its niggling little flaws (personally, I found the climax a little underdone and the outcome predictable; although the stunning final sequence more than makes up for it), one of the best films of 2011. That's saying something!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sober espionage thriller,"Based on the novel by John le Carre, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a throwback to films like ""The Ipcress File"" and ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" - that is to say, a sober, serious tale of secret agents set in that period quaintly known as the Cold War.Gary Oldman plays an agent for British Intelligence who's called out of retirement to uncover a possible mole in the top echelons of the agency. Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense. The tone is subdued and carefully modulated, the pacing slow and deliberate. And fine performances by Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, et.al., and an appropriately chilly atmosphere make for enjoyable viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No Depth to Characters,"I went to see this film expecting great things, a thinking man's thriller is what I had read. Unfortunately in trying to squeeze a very complex plot into two hours no amount of fine acting was going to make this movie any more than a superficial cover of the original TV series. The movie, however, still felt long and drawn out probably because I never engaged with the characters. We were not given enough detail or history on any of the key characters or 'suspects', we did not really know what they did or feel any affinity to them, therefore by the end I not only wasn't shocked or surprised by who was the spy or why they did it, I just didn't care. In essence although there was some good acting the delivery of the story was flawed and left massive holes for the viewer to fill in. All in all a waste of a couple of hours.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Done right.,"I had been ditching this film for quite a while because I thought it would be like one of those boring spy-mystery films where nothing much happens, but this movie surprised me.This movie it is so different from anything else but in a very interesting way, and I think all credit for that goes to the director. The film feels so well studied and controlled - you know that the director has it very clear in his head what he wants from everybody involved and he knows how to get it from them. I'm surprised that the director didn't got an Oscar nod for this, really I would put this among 20 best directed films of the decade.Other than directing what I really loved in this film was the cinematography and the score. This film has some incredibly beautiful shots but more than that they are very fitting with in telling this story in the proper way. I love the way the camera moves, I love the way they use the close ups and the way they use the shadows, really really beautiful. The score also works perfectly in setting the tone of the film, it makes you more invested in the movie.I think that Gary Oldman is one of the most overrated actors on Hollywood and this role, this performance of his is no exception. I don't know how he has everybody bewitched into thinking that he is such a good and even special actor, but man he is far from that. I can easily explain why his performance it's so bad but not without spoiling the movie, so...Overall I think that a lot of people wouldn't like this one if they are looking for a movie to have fun with, but from a technical-filmmaking standpoint this is one of the best works I have ever seen, it's extremely well paced, extremely well directed and written and it deserves more recognition.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Watch the 1979 BBC series instead with Sir Alec Guiness!!,"Seen both the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy versions (recent movie & 1979 BBC series) and this movie is a prime example of how a movie version can completely ruin a story. Watch the series, it's absolutely amazing! Slow, methodical, characters evolve much better and the payoff in the end is so damn good. The movie just left me cold. Couldn't really connect with any of the characters except Peter Guillam played by Benedict Cumberbatch. If you watch the series (7 episodes), I loved Jim Prideaux's character, Ricky Tarr's character, even Control! Each one of them was properly fleshed out and felt real.

"Stylish, Atmospheric. But a little hollow and pointless","""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is an incredible name for a spy book or a movie. Pity what lies underneath is an competent but average story. Starting with the school-boyish obsession with talking in code (where the title comes from) to the ho-hum Russian characterizations and overly stuffy and bureaucratic view of the British intelligence structure, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" becomes as dramatic as a chess move with a dramatic name.While I was watching the movie, I caught myself thinking about different things, my thoughts wandering because there is just so much space between what goes on. As we get more characters and sub-characters, each one played by as recognizable an actor as the other, all the alluded bombast, gravity and grandeur of the espionage world just boils down to what seems like petty personal bickering. The old cold war character templates, the beautiful Russian girl and the sadist torturer, just feels tired and one-dimensional and personally, just reminds me of the moldy smell of old paperbacks more than anything.The huge hype around the movie got me to see this but while perhaps enjoyable in its atmosphere and music, it's probably the making of simple things overly complicated that made the movie feel hollow and pointless.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truly a (underrated) masterpiece.,"Truly a (underrated) masterpiece.By far the best movie adaptation of a Le Carre subject IMO. Dialogs, cinematography, acting, settings, storytelling, editing and music are at highest, almost perfect levels, in a harmony seldomly seen.
The slow development of the story with its limited dialogs is the one, most winning point of this production, leaving open the unpredictable resolution up to the last moment. Although the real appreciation of the development of the story probably grows only after a second view, once you are aware of the content. The serie of 1977 with Guinness already was a very valuable production, but here this movie even tops that IMO, although some interesting details in the story are lost in its brevity.The play of Oldman is stellar, as is the one of Colin Firth, giving the winning, sinister-sympathetically manipulating villain here. Don't miss the scene with the bee!It's one of those rare movies you can watch 10 or 20 times and you'll like it again without being bored. My congratulations.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I could follow it anyway,"I will say upfront I'm a mystery-suspense-spy fanatic. If a film has any of those elements, I've seen it.""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a story that has been around a long time, but one that has escaped me. When I tried to read the book, I couldn't understand what the heck they were talking about and had to stop. I may have tried to watch the Alec Guiness version, but I'm vague on it. I have a feeling I just couldn't follow it.So I approached this film version with some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a very straightforward story, if underplayed, about Smiley (Gary Oldman) and his search for a mole inside the ""circus,"" the top echelon of the British Intelligence Service.And what a cast - Colin Firth, Cirian Hinds, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch (who seems to be everywhere except where I want him to be, in front of a camera filming another season of Sherlock Holmes), and Tom Hardy.The film is set in the 1970s, and locations include Budapest, Paris, and Istanbul.Though I believe this film could have used better editing - it slips in and out of the past and present very awkwardly, which makes it confusing - I liked it. It's very British in that it moves slowly but it still manages to be absorbing.""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" isn't your typical spy movie. It's not James Bond, it's not Jason Bourne. You won't be breathless from the excitement or special effects. But if you want a good story and good acting, you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Downer Bummer Boredom Yawn,"Filmed at the time when Oldman ceased to be a box office draw, this film makes an attempt to capture that former glory. All it captures is silliness and pretension. Oldman seems restrained, almost lost, in the trifle he is asked to play here. Kathy Burke has her shrill moments but there are times, especially by the fire, when she is especially lovely. Mark Strong has nothing much to do, though she does it fine enough. Péter Kálloy Molnár as the main Hungarian Waiter is especially wooden. John Hurt does come off the best, playing a total creep, as The Bollywood Insider puts it.We never get a sense of the the espionage that would have made more apparent the strain Oldboy was under. We never see his reactions, most likely because the producers would have thought it would have made him seem like too much of a heel.The philosophy in this movie is heavy-handed and especially disappointing since two famous writers wrote the screenplay.Another absurdity is that Oldman lives in what is described as a shack. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn't trade their house for that shack in a split second. Also, for a starving government employee, how does he afford it? Movie logic, that's how.There are two reasons to see it, though. One is the aerial photography of gloomy industrial districts. Truly phenomenal. The other is the truly lovely score by Aziz Mandel, which has haunted me for about the last 20 minutes.Really, watch the first five minutes and the end credit sequence and you'll have seen everything worthy this movie has to offer. And let's be honest, Gary Oldman as Smiley, the wily, worldly-wise, and world-weary cuckold, is a badly thought-out casting decision, to say the least.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In many ways an instant classic but...,"The 1979 BBC series of the same name, starring Sir Alec Guinness has always been considered the final word on this cold War set spy novel. So any film adaption had an uphill task to convince sceptics that it had something new to say.The fact that this very English story was to be directed by a ""foreigner"", Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, added further consternation.As the cast was assembled however, it was clear this was to be no ordinary adaption. All stops had been pulled, the period setting nailed down, first class actors in place and a screenplay that had managed to compress this complicated novel into an audience friendly 127 minutes.The film is set in the early 1970's and centres around the ""Circus"", a lightly fictionalized headquarters of British Secret Service. Every thing is brown, smoke filled, building and information security is almost non-existent, most of the higher echelons of the service are ex-military, plotting and counter plotting against the perceived Russian Communist threat.The whole enterprise still has an amateurish old boy network feel, although involved in a very deadly game, where torture, murder and clandestine ""wet work"" occurs, albeit largely off screen here.The film employs many flashbacks and the story is deliberately labyrinthine in complexity, spies spying on spies and paranoia filling every frame. No-one is to be trusted, certainly the US no longer will share their intelligence with the British, as they have a ""leaky ship"", a potential mole within the very top echelons of the organization. Handled by the mysterious and never seen ""Karla"", a Russian spymaster.Smiley (Oldman) and his boss ""C"" or control (John Hurt), have been managed out into semi-retirement, only for Smiley to be brought back to ""clean house"" and find the traitor. He is assisted by the loyal Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Mendel (Roger Lloyd Pack). Smiley has always been Le Carre's greatest creation, investing by his own admission, many of his own early personality traits into his makeup. Crumpled, anonymous, inexperienced in love, all knowing and yet knowing little, he watches and observes and is never disappointed in man's frailties and flaws.Smiley has four characters to choose from, if he discounts himself as the Mole, which from an audience point of view, we should not. Tinker (Toby Jones), Tailor (Colin Firth), Soldier (Ciaran Hinds) and Poorman (David Dencik).The existence of the mole had been hinted at but was confirmed following the liaison of Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) a rogue field operative, with a Russian spy's wife. The film itself commencing with a disastrous ""extraction"" set and filmed in Hungary with Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), proving that moving pawns around is far easier and safer than being one.To summarise the plot further would be to provide spoilers and would be difficult in a short review. There are occasions where the full story and motivations for characters are difficult to grasp, perhaps the feel and tone of the film is as important as comprehending every story nuance.Author Le Carre, obviously spring-boarding from his own intelligence experience and the real life traitorous Cambridge five, Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Caircross and Blunt, all of which is well documented elsewhere.Oldman manages to channel Guinness into his performance without being perceived as a caricature. On occasions the timbre and cadence of his voice sounds similar, however he has made this role very much his own. Oldman has an ability to disappear chameleon like into the role he plays, all different and no doubt nothing like his ""real life"" persona. Donning the famous character glasses, he personifies the Smiley many fans will know and love.Oldman is assisted with a ensemble cast that reads like a roll-call of top acting talent, all performances are believable and fit the production and tone perfectly. It is difficult to imagine that the interpretation and presentation of the source material could be bettered. Whether the subject matter and realistic approach to spycraft, will appeal to a modern younger audience is less likely.Smiley is the very antithesis of James Bond, there are no gadgets here, no exotic hotels, no flash cars. Just hum-drum, anonymous people doing shabby, boring, laborious and seedy work, interspersed with occasional acts of off screen violence, amply demonstrating the stakes all participants realise they are playing for.Was it all worthwhile, the sacrifices made, the threat real or invented. Perhaps only those in the know will ever really be able to judge. In an interview (on the DVD/Bluray), Le Carre suggests that spy's are and always will be necessary but they should be subservient to the democratic process, listened too but not always seen as a panacea for societies ills and acted upon blindly.So a story that is fixed in time, that is in many ways anachronistic now but a story well told and with the highest quality of acting.SummaryIn many ways an instant classic, with a mesmerizing performance from Gary Oldman and sterling support from a glitterati of mainly English acting royalty.However, this may not be to everyone's taste perhaps, with little action and a complicated plot that remains largely true to the original very dry and complex Le Carre book, upon which the film is based.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why bother?,"'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a damn good story. The BBC dramatised it very well with great actors and, more importantly, using a mini-series format. Which led me to wonder what the makers of this version could have hoped to add. With a well acted miniseries version out there creating a feature film version is akin to creating a Ferrari based on a moped engine. i.e. it just cannot be.So I have just watched it hoping to find out because (i) I wanted to make a 'fair' comment, (ii) there was a tiny chance it MAY have been worth seeing & (iii) I had nothing better to do.Perhaps Gary Oldman could have created a really good Smiley but he doesn't have the time to develop the character anywhere near properly. Perhaps he may even have been able to do even better than Guinness (scoring 11/10) but the the actual result, with the BBC version out there, scores him very low. There is far too little of him to judge compared to what Alec Guinness & Simon Russell Beale have given to Smiley. He stood no chance.That comment applies equally to the whole film. No matter how many great actors, money, etc the makers may throw at it they had no hope of creating as good a version, not without the extra time. And they failed miserably.And that's exactly what I saw when I watched it. I found the question 'What could they hope to achieve' unanswered.So, before this film even reached the box office anyone honest would have said ""Don't bother with it. If you want to see LeCarre's story WELL told get the BBC version. We've only got two hours to tell the story in, not a hope of beating them. This remake is pointless"".If you prefer cod-roe to caviar, cola to champagne, Ford Fiestas to Ferraris & plastic cutlery to silver then this might be the version for you. Anyone else get the BBC version where there is room for character development, drama & suspense. A 9/10 version. Or even better - read the book.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should I See This Film? It Depends On Your Taste,"You cannot go into this film expecting an action packed thriller, like Mission Impossible. Nor can you expect an action packed mystery like Sherlock Holmes. It is a slow paced mystery, that is probably more appropriately classified as a drama.If you like good acting, this film is packed with it. Gary Oldman's performance in this film is unforgettable. I could write and write about his, and all of the other actors performances, but this would turn into a very long review. To keep this short I will just say, the acting from every performer is brilliant and well worth viewing.I found the story to be phenomenal, and I have never read the book or seen any previous versions. Many however, complain that it is too confusing, and to tiresome to watch and pay complete attention too. I felt the story and pacing was refreshing. To often I find today's pictures to be too repetitive and obvious. The way this story was told was wonderful and real. It interpreted perfectly aspects of Cold War conflict. But, if you bore easy, this film will be terribly long and pointless. A good judgment of whether or not you will be bored by this film is if you are still reading this review. :)If you love the art of film making, cinematography, lighting, costuming, acting, storytelling, etc, you will love this film. If you go to the cinema to be wowed by CGI, to solve a mystery that you can solve while watching, or to get your lover in the mood, this is not the film for you.Lastly I would like to say, this film is not dark. (I'm not saying it is appropriate for young audiences, not just because of the rating but because of how bored they would be.) If you upset easily over very graphic, vulgar filled, over sexual films, this one will not upset you. It is pretty tame in those regards. I would still suggest reading the parental guide IMDb offers. Keep in mind the descriptions are very detailed on that guide though, and often make it seem worse then it actually is.I hope you found this helpful.

A thriller for adults,"In a world of James Bonds and Jason Bournes, George Smiley and his lot are hardly the most outwardly provocative offering in the spy genre, but that is not the game here. The character previously of John Le Carre novels, then television series is a spy for adults. So is this movie.Everything about Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is measured. Director Tomas Alfredson has painted his film with bleak London scenes and flat 1970s tones. He shoots through the bars of fences and the frames of windows, immediately entrapping us in the dark, claustrophobic world that was the Secret Intelligence Service during the height of the Cold War.When Control (John Hurt), the head of the ironically referred-to ""Circus"", is forced to retire in response to an operation gone wrong, he takes his right hand man, George Smiley, with him. We find George (Gary Oldman) a slightly sad man who continues a routine of swimming and leaving his estranged wife's mail on the table, keeping track of the sort of little details a man who has spent his life in the spy trade would come to value. But while he was forced out, he is compelled back into action to pick up the trail of a mole in the organization. As someone on the outside, Smiley is uniquely to look in.Given an agent, Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch), to assist his investigation, one of the first things Smiley discovers is that an old colleague, Connie, was forced out as well. As they look through photos of the old days, she remembers fondly the old days, before the secrecy and dealings of the cold war.As Connie seems so keen to do, we bounce back to the past, and from England to Hungary and beyond. Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), a young spy who is accused of being a deserter, appears suddenly in George's home with a fantastic story that opens our investigators to another world of treacherous possibilities.The film is filled with brief scene-setting shots—some mundane, but others filled with detail and plot. The viewer is left trying to put together these sporadic glimmers of story as more involved scenes roll on. The result is an occasionally frenzied attempt at thought in a film otherwise as austere with pace as it is with revelations. And, while these two hours are packed with well-cultivated tension, there is little relief. There are many twists and turns, but very few bring with them as much intensity as may be expected for such a high-stakes game.The acting is superb from a cast of British elites—most especially Oldman, who is convincing in both his advanced age and quiet desperation. We see that no one is innocent of treason. We watch as friendships, relationships and solemn oaths fall victim to the pursuit of the greater good. And everyone, even the ultimately-revealed mole, believes what they do to be the right thing.After two hours of restrained acting, music and even colors, the ending comes together laced heavily with scenes of a past holiday party, smiles and laughs and overwhelmingly cheerful music. Resolutions for all and such an upbeat finale seem to break somewhat from the tone and delivery of the bulk of the film. After being snubbed of a true dramatic climax, it seems a bit dishonest.Walking out of the theater, however, what lingers about Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the meticulousness of it all: the acting, the attention to detail and the use of metaphoric imagery. Despite this being his first international foray, director Alfredson's confidence shows in every minute. He has created a film that will linger with the viewer long after the credits stop rolling.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligently Done and Believable Spy Film,"During the height of the Cold War in the early '70s, a British In-tel operation is trying to uncover a mole in its ranks who's giving the Soviets some info that's, at least apparently, about as crucial as crucial can be.Although I haven't read the book or seen the original '79 film, I found the whole story and presentation here very engaging. TTSS is one of the few films of its type dealing with some very BIG conflicts yet lacking elements that seem contrived or too much of a stretch. Given close attention, the storyline is lucid enough, has some well-done and believable surprises, and does not just mess with one's head for the sake of it. It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth.TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd. The large cast of characters is also a bit hard to keep track of on first view. Non-British audiences may need the subtitles due to the heavy accents and use of slang in this film. All the same, TTSS should appeal not only to international intrigue aficionados, but to anyone who's ever been in a group situation of any sort that's full of bad politics, everyone suspicious of everyone else, etc.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Going in, I was aware that many people had found the movie too slow or confusing, and I was told that much of the movie would be in flashbacks. Knowing that, I found the movie much easier to follow, and understand than my friend, who had no previous knowledge of TTSS, the back story or the cultural events surrounding when the movie is set.

So Boring you would rather go to the dentist and have all your teeth pulled,This movie is so boring... When I say boring I mean boring you literally to death... You might want to hang yourself off the end of your sofa watching this movie... Everyone in it is old... especially Gary Oldman... He is truly living up to his name! Nothing happens in this movie - ever - so if you are sitting and waiting for something to happen you might as well throw yourself off of the sofa because nothing is going to happen. Even my dad (who LOVES boring movies) thought this movie was boring - and for My DAD to think a movie is boring - Oh my God you might as well move to the Moon for its spectacular countryside views rather than watch this movie. You might like to do the washing up and watch it dry - rather than watch this movie. In fact getting shot in the foot would be way more fun! And exciting! And Entertaining! Watch the kettle boil! Watch paint dry! Watch the sun go down and wait for it to come back up again! All these things are better and more entertaining than watching this movie. Tinker Tailor Snore Snore Yawn Yawn - is a much more accurate title. Why oh why? Even the young and improved Sherlock Holmes actor Benedict Cumberbatch is made bleached blond and rather dull...... Aaaaaaaaahhhhh do not bother to waste your valuable air breathing time - by watching this movie. Stare at the nearest painting on your wall. Or count air bubbles under your wallpaper.....,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Great, Solid Movie for Those with the Patience for it","You've got to have a bit of patience when settling in to watch TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. It's not the sort of secret agent/spy film the general public has come to expect; this is no James Bond or Jason Bourne. The movie is based on a novel from John le Carré and depicts a more realistic view on the world of espionage. The action is minimal and the plot is dense. After my first viewing, I had a good grasp on what had gone down but I was still a little confused as to how it all came together. There are a lot of characters to keep tabs on and twists and turns in the story to follow as it leads you to the final reveal. From Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, the movie is a slow-boiler that stars some of the biggest names in British cinema. The movie is set in the midst of the Cold War in 1973 Britain. The head of the British intelligence service, Control, believes there is a mole embedded within the organization's highest ranks but a mission to flush it out ends in failure and Control's forced resignation along with his right-hand man, George Smiley. Control dies soon afterward and information arises that might mean Control was right, and Smiley is asked to return as head of an unofficial investigation and determine which of the remaining heads of MI5 is selling the nation's secrets to the Russians. No explosions, no car chases, just sold storytelling and powerful performances.Right off the bat, this movie will loses a lot of peoples' interest in its execution. This movie is a little more than two hours of talking heads. Information is doled out slowly and gives the chance to try and come to conclusions at the same pace as our hero, George Smiley. The problem, and the film's only weakness in my opinion, is that there is just so much information to track. At the end, I wasn't surprised at the reveal of the mole and I understood his motives and even spotted some of the clues, but I had a rough time getting there on my own. When the movie finally gets to that point, I just readily accept it and try to follow the path a little better in a second viewing when I know what (and who) I'm looking for. Despite its often baffling density, I really did enjoy this movie. It's not often we get an espionage movie that isn't just a series of action scenes and a villain with a grand scheme. These spies use subterfuge and misdirection as their tools. The pace is slow but the story grabs you; it doesn't need expensive effects to entertain its audience. The movie is a bit of a brain teaser and I dig that. And the production design is superb in its recreation of the sights, sounds, and styles of 70's era England. Alfredson and his crew paid amazing attention to detail in their immersion into the era.And the best part of the movie is the cast. Seriously, they have pulled together some of the best for this movie. First and foremost, there is the spectacular Gary Oldman in the film's main role, George Smiley. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role here, and it was deserved. He is a tense man with a lot boiling under his surface while maintaining his cool the entire time. He's the penultimate polite Englishman here and the ultimate professional. His colleagues include Colin Firth, Toby Jones, David Dencik, and Ciarán Hinds. Some receive more attention and screen time than others but all put forth fantastic performances, especially Jones and Firth. The movie also boasts John Hurt (in a limited role as Control), Tom Hardy (in my opinion one of his best performances as a suspected turncoat), Mark Strong, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch, who I'll admit I never heard of before this film, is an integral role in the movie as Smiley's inside man and nails it. This cast really is a collection of some of the best Britain has to offer, and they have to be because the movie rests entirely on their shoulders. I would love to recommend this movie more widely but I can tell right off that the majority of general audiences would be bored to tears. So if you have a bit of patience and love an intricate plot, I certainly recommend this film but be prepared for a second viewing if you want to walk away with a solid understanding of its events.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Manages to achieve mediocrity,"I remember the mini-series being fantastic. I really wanted this movie to be just as good. It was OK entertainment but I was disappointed. It just fell short of the original. Maybe it is due to the time constraints placed on a film. By comparison, the mini series had the benefit of more hours available to tell the story. I think the story did a decent job up until the climax. It was from that point on that I felt there was a rush to tie things up. The last 10 minutes of the film left me unfulfilled. I would still recommend this movie but if you want a real treat, see the original mini-series instead. Alec Guinness was wonderful and that format allows for a much richer story telling.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Intelligence for the intelligent,"""It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has become so ugly."" The defector's rationaleGrab a Beefeaters, put on the fire, and get ready for a Cold War spy tale chill and dense with just enough information to keep you interested but not enough to figure out who's the defector until the very end: ""There's a mole, right at the top of the Circus. And he's been there for years.""If you get your kicks out of Bond or Bourne, then be prepared for the less athletic, unsexy world of real espionage as George Smiley (Gary Oldman) returns from retirement in British intelligence, or the ""Circus"" as it's called, to find the Russian defector in its highest ranks.You're right there in the early '70's, not computer driven and considerably less frenetic than intelligence work depicted in cinema today. But that grey cinematography and drab operatives may come closer to the minimalist reality of plodding intelligence work than the gadgets and gymnastics of contemporary cinema's takes on spies: ""For twenty-five years we've been the only thing standing between Moscow and the Third World War!"" Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds)Based on the John le Carré novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is an engaging film about intelligence for intellectuals—slow, serious, and more like chess between Holmes and Moriarity than banter between Bond and Goldfinger. Certainly don't expect a Bond babe like Pussy Galore. Oh, there's blood alright but at a British reserve amount yet always a reasonable circumstance from the first shooting in a café to a final rifle shot.It's more like a fox hunt where the trappings and the talk eclipse the final take of animal and movie.

Absorbing and more true to life than many would like,"This is a film for watching closely.

I then discovered it to be a very clever piece of work, and if you take the time to watch it closely and not let your concentration wander, it becomes thoroughly absorbing and all the pieces fit together wonderfully well.The cast is impressive and the performances given are memorable. This is a spy film that one could believe. I am no Bond fan, I like my entertainment to be credible, true to life, slow for much of the time, and with little false glitter.If you give the film the credit it deserves by clearing your head of extraneous matters and giving it your undivided attention, you will be handsomely rewarded.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I Think I May Have to Watch This One Again,"Can you really say that you liked a movie even if you do not fully understand the story it just told? After watching this latest film incarnation of John le Carre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", I fully agree with several reviewers who said that they know they have seen a cinematic masterpiece, yet cannot grasp the complicated story that just unfolded on the screen.I caught this film mainly because of Gary Oldman's Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He is very subdued, but very good in his characterization of retired agent George Smiley, who was called out of retirement to flush out a Russian mole within their spy organization. The way Oldman really disappears into his roles, I am not really sure what he looks like in real life! In my opinion though, this movie was more of a ensemble cast acting, rather than a showcase for a single actor. Colin Firth, Mark Strong and especially Tom Hardy all shine in their respective roles, which I cannot really label as merely ""supporting.""The film was beautiful to watch, with those imaginative camera angles, the energetic editing (but an slam-bang action film this is NOT), the stark colors of the 1970's set design. Is it the director's fault then that I, who had not read the novel nor seen the Sir Alec Guinness TV- mini-series, did not get the whole detailed story right away? I am reserving my right to judge this film with finality on my second watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
with fresh eyes I enjoyed this,It has been a long time since I read the book or saw the miniseries. And that is a good thing as I watched it with fresh eyes. It did take a long time to get going in a way but not in a bad way. I too got confused at times especially as things unfolded at the beginning but I was patient and things were mostly revealed. It seemed like a very brave movie to let things unfold. One thing that was jarring and not consistent nor beneficial to the movie was the final scene to the French music. It really seemed out of place as it seemed somewhat triumphant. I did not get Smiley as triumphant after everything that has happened. Of course he would have felt relief but the cold was if far from won and he knows it.I give this an 8 as I think it was skillfully done. But i am champing at the bit to rewatch the miniseries or perhaps read the book. I seem to remember feeling much more dread somehow watching the miniseries.

Further, there is no vested interest in a central characters(s) and I found myself not caring a fig for what happened to any of them.

The story has enough ambiguity and understated tension keep things interesting without being difficult to follow. The movie's best quality is also its most difficult to define; I can best describe it as fictional period realism. Whether it's accurate or not there's an immersive sense that this is what spycraft would have actually looked like at the height of the Cold War, an unsettling mixture of everyday bureacratic banality, pervasive paranoia, and spasmodic interludes of targeted violence and national crisis.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The TV episodes were long and drawn out but at the same time they were genius. This film is only a few hours long but feels much longer without the genius. Sad, sad, sad. I just can't understand how it is getting such good reports. The portakabin offices of The Circus should have been my first clue. Totally unbelievable. I was 12 in 1973 and so the next clue should have been the complete absence of any kind of believable London street scenes. All the traffic was shot in close-up and it was almost all comprised of London Routemasters and Taxis. Don't waste your time. This is a film that ought not to have been made. The acting is wooden and even the cinematography isn't up to par which is odd considering that this is often what makes a remake worth watching. I can only postulate that any good review that you might read of this film on IMDb (and there are sadly many of them) has been written by a spotty 18-yr-old who doesn't know he's born.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The BBC then, didn't have caged rooms where the 'opposition' couldn't listen in. Just, crappy, government offices in Cambridge Square. Which was how it was. Then they may have had a 'Faraday Cage' ? More likely they probably sat in the bathroom and ran the taps.There was little, if at all, character development.Smiley was a ghost that drifted in and out. Peter Guilem was a homosexual that Michael Jayston would get hot under the collar about. The excellent and important character of Jerry Westerby was buried in the poor script. John Hurt was John Hurt, they even had to make a gimmick out of his end.The only character I liked was Ricky Tarr. They made a dog's dinner of this as well.Hollywood produces soap-opera or blatant propaganda.Or the so-called European Art-Film people produce this rubbish. I thought it reeked of English clichés. Perhaps it should have been called 'Carry On, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' ? The acting was not that good, it just had famous names.Toby Esterhase, Bill Haydon ? Mere shadows.Hyped up to the rafters.I don't think there are any decent directors and writers, and it shows ! I hope the father Hasse Alfredson isn't as pretentious as the son? To conclude then : A great spy story, dragged down to the level of soap opera. Which is all about you get these days. Just gimmick and gore for the sake of it. Almost got a nerve to give the film that title. I could have done a better job after a trip to the pub. Subtle and intelligent, it definitely is not.‎""How's Ann?"" Alfredson plays light with some of the fundamental relationships in the story.He creates about as much atmosphere as a Bradford railway station. He would have trouble directing traffic on an empty street.I expect Alfredson will be asked to guest direct, Coronation Street and Eastenders. That is his true forte. Alfredson's next two films will be:- 'Deep Dirty Raincoat' and 'The Trondheim Lawnmower Massacre'.‎'The Trondheim Lawnmower Massacre' by Tomas Alfredson- a true coup de grace(gras) if there ever was one.Do yourself a favour, avoid this trash, and save your money !",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very well done, lovingly crafted. Great Cold War spy film","Great movie. It is slow, the action is very subtle, and the plot is complicated. However, for those of us who lived through the Cold War, reading spy novels, and wondering if WW3 was right around the corner, this masterful film is a well-spent visit down memory lane. This is a snapshot of a time in history when tensions ran high on each side of the ""Iron Curtain"", a time period that lasted for decades and nearly disappeared over night. It had become a way of life, a time which many today never experienced and the rest of us often forget ever happened.The lighting? For the mood and for the time, is spot on. The slow moving plot? Well, this is exactly how the Cold War would play out. Moles, conspiracies, and covert operations were often years or even decades in the making. Until the Reagan/Thatcher era came along, this is exactly how the Cold War played out; it was not like a James Bond movie. To back up this claim of realism, I offer this information from Wikipedia: ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is John le Carré's novelisation of his experiences of the revelations in the 1950s and the 1960s which exposed the Cambridge Five traitors, among them Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, John Cairncross and Kim Philby, as KGB moles employed by the SIS. Karla is modelled after KGB Gen. Rem Krassilnikov, whose obituary in the New York Times newspaper reported that the CIA considered him as such. Moreover, skewing in favour of the latter, Smiley reports that Karla was trained by ""Berg,"" Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov, an NKVD intelligence officer who defected to the West in 1938. The character Bill Haydon is derived from Kim Philby, who, in the late 1950s, transcended SIS suspicions that he too might be a traitor, given his connection with the defector Guy Burgess, and continued as an SIS intelligence officer until defecting to the USSR in 1963. David Cornwell (John le Carré) worked as an intelligence officer for the SIS (MI6) during Philby's tenure, and has said that Philby betrayed his identity to the Russians, which was a factor in the 1964 termination of his intelligence career. Connie Sachs, the Circus's principal Russia researcher, is modelled upon Milicent Bagot."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker,_Tailor,_Soldier,_Spy)If you are up for a slow, subtle, and artfully presented trip into our not-too-distant past, this is as good as it gets. The plot is complex with many players who may have straddled each side of the fence at one point. Oldman is masterful. If you follow him, his character will lead you through all the smoke and mirrors until you are able to wrap your head around the plot. Great movie if you are one to handle the pace.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Subtleties Lost in the Confusion,"I love this type of genre where the story, plot, and acting is valued greater than action. If you've read the book or seen the TV mini-series, you'll probably like this at about an 8 level. If you haven't been exposed to the story, it will be a confusing and boring experience.Like the TV series, the emphasis is on limited dialog, plain locations and spaces, and acting space. Some would call it dry, but there is power in the silence as the characters share meaningful looks and furtive glances. If the TV series dialog was measured, the movie dialog was more rationed. I think there were a solid five minutes George Smiley (played by Oldman) said a word after his first screen exposure.The general plot is not that hard to follow, but this is a story based in subtleties. Nuances are difficult to interpret if you don't know where the story is going. Suffice it to say, everything you see is important and sometimes you don't realize the importance until later. Following the high level agents takes attentiveness not usually needed in a wide-release film.Still, I like the style and substance of the movie, even if it is difficult to catch all the meanings of each plot step. Several people nearby me mentioned that while they liked the movie, they were confused about certain events.

The characters know more about the material than you do, and they do not stop often to explain it.Gary Oldman is amazing. His George Smiley is absolutely stoic. He has only one moment of naked emotion, and even that moment of apparent character development is later revealed to be meaningful to the plot.The best films all reveal more and more details each time you watch them.

Now i know i fly in the face of popular critical opinion here, and i will say that that the acting talent functions perfectly well, but i can honestly say i was never gripped or inclined to care about the characters or events. I understand subtlety and how effective a slow build can be in film, and i know there's lovers of this film out there that will claim anyone that hasn't enjoyed it has A.D.D, but for me, the director placed little emphasis on making his film compelling and pandered more to a certain 70's style of film making. In summary i'd say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was a well acted but plodding tale told at a one gear pace with little in the way of character depth or discovery.

A feast,"Mainly set in London in the 1970s, the story is entirely carried by the dialogue between the characters.

There are, however, paper files, newspaper cuttings and a distinct feel of over-burdening bureaucracy, it's tentacles infiltrating all aspects of the characters' professional and private lives. In so doing, it tells a story of intelligent, but socially inept and emotionally stunted bureaucrats playing primary school playground politics.Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is very much set in a damp, grey London playground for spooks and spies.

Dense and Unnecessarily Convoluted,"7 January 2012. There's sophisticated and there's overly dense movies...When audience members have to think real, real hard, when they aren't sure what's going on due not to the plot, but due to the editing and omission of important plotpoints, then a movie becomes more a hardship than an enjoyable mystery experience. With this version of La Carre's novel, the beginning even provides an exaggerated parody of sophistication as the movie pans carefully on each character and supporting cast, forcing the audience to suspect every person of possible collusion in some nefarious espionage plot when in reality by the very nature of espionage such behavior would actually be much more subtle and covert. The movie than turns suddenly into a much more confusing and sometimes almost unnecessarily artful movie with shots that seemingly have little relevance except to attempt to portray underdeveloped human characters.Perhaps much more direct but yet indirect by deliberate disinformation which maintains a sharper and much more heightened sense of artistic, dramatic confusion can be found in such movies as The Three Days of Condor (1975) and the well richly underplayed but riveting espionage film The Russia House (1990) that captures the slow, non-action but emotive spy drama. Spy Games (2001) also had the high intensity, misdirection and graphic espionage drama that offered the audience a mentally riveting and challenging plot line that balanced both the action and mental substantive machinations of espionage. Other espionage movies that retain both the more underplayed but effective dramatic presentation include The Good Shepard (2006), Spartan (2004), Breach (2007).Tinker, Tailor almost needs unnecessarily a decoder ring to really enjoy and understand the movie, the movie itself become captured in its own cipher.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A little over-hyped, and it had some problems, but overall an OK movie.","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie. I've not read the book, but I did see the BBC series some years ago when BBC4 repeated it. I had hoped they wouldn't turn it into a fast paced, big action, more 'bond' style movie, and they didn't.The visuals and sound were great, and the acting also. The pacing was pretty good, and they did a reasonable job of compressing it down to about 2 hours. There were some good moments of tension and a couple of shocking moments.I'm curious how people who know nothing of the story would find it. It seemed like it may be a little confusing in parts, especially the way it ties up at the end.

Kathy Burkes part was weird, especially her voice. There was a weird crow-baring in of some music at one point (I think it was blood sweat and tears?)

I remember there were a lot of twists and interrogation scenes and violence. Now I was surprised it didn't have much violence and very few real interrogation scenes actually. The tolerance to violence must be due to watching a lot of violent content in movies in the meantime. But I was still surprised by the twists and turns it took and actually the calculated pacing of the movie. And of the characters' lives as well. It can be dull for five minutes and then there's something unexpected. I did enjoy it a lot. And the cast is who's who of British cinema. Quite a lot of delightful appearances. I am glad I left it for New Year's Eve.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good,"While very well done considering that it tried to condense 6 hours into two. As a result it was unable to develop the characters to its fullest extend which will hamper any attempt to develop this into a series. The entire LeCarre suite needs to be developed without regard to time. Either do the Quest for Karla or make each individually. It would help to begin with the Spy Who Came in from the Cold and move forward. LeCarre is not James Bond, but is more realistic than what Ian Flemming portrayed. Espionage is not clamorous or is without bloodshed. It is a dangerous game that often results in good men going to the wall while idiots get promoted with dangerous regularity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Horrifyingly awful,"I've logged onto IMDb for the first time in a long while to put this review up; so the film ""moved"" me but not in a good way !With the combination of cast and source material, I thought this film would be excellent. I'm in my 40s so more than happy to watch something that isn't riddled with CGI and has scenes lasting longer than 5 seconds......however, this was like watching some existentialist French movie from the 60s. Far, far, far too many scenes that drag on with sparse (if any) dialogue. Once you've seen Oldman looking pensive once, you've seen it a thousand times.The final scene set to music was an unbelievably poor way of finishing the story.Incomprehensible, pretentious crap. 2 stars for the evocation of the 1970s - no stars for the director / producer who managed with the materials at hand to create an absolute stinker.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cat and mouse game among spies 7/10,"Thomas Alfredson, Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan team up to bring to the big screen one of the more complex pieces of literature written by John Le Carre.Upon watching the film, I enjoyed how slow paced it was in setting up the story, figures and moral codes among characters. Many signs to be picked up during the plot.It was nice to see a spy movie centering on MI6 without having the same format of action, chase scenes and etc. As most movies nowadays. While watching Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, I enjoyed how the vast majority of the film is mainly a chase among spies, like a game of cat and mouse.The ensemble of cast is truly impressive and amazing, Gary Oldman takes on the lead as George Smiley the protagonist, along with other great actors who all portray the potential suspects.Overall I really enjoyed the film and it's slow pacing of details, laying the information bit by bit. The interaction between the characters is great and overall it's slow and tense pacing is what works so well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that could have actually been longer,"In most cases a movie can condense the subject matter of a novel or story it is based off of. Such was the case in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. However, in this instance it should be said that this movie could have gone on for another 30 minutes or an hour and that would have been perfectly acceptable.The film could be described as a analysis of the psyche yet a better way to describe it would be to say that it is an action film with no discernible action. The drama is there but your on the edge of your seat because it's your brain versus George Smiley's - wonderfully portrayed by Gary Oldman - and that's a battle you can't help but lose. Although it should be said that if one doesn't figure out who the mole is before he is relieved you're not paying enough attention to the film. The pieces are placed before you and explained but it's up to the audience to put the puzzle together.The casting done by Jina Jay was wonderfully done. The roles were fitted snugly and were great representation of the characters created by John le Carre. As mentioned Oldman portrays a great George Smiley, and Colin Firth as the likable Bill Haydon. John Hurt, though a small role, showed Control as a character you couldn't help respect even if you didn't like him. But perhaps the character that deserves the most credit was Peter Guillam played by Benedict Cumberbatch. A relative unknown when compared to the rest of the cast, Cumberbatch was able to balance the youth of the character with the responsibilities thrust upon him by the likes of Smiley.It's no wonder this movie is getting rave reviews but note that if you truly want to get an understanding of these characters it's certainly not too late - even after seeing the film - to pick up a copy of le Carre's novel and find out just who is Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman, and Beggarman.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A proper Cold War thriller,"I can't believe this excellent film has the lowly rank of 7/10! But there again maybe I can.

This is a great film, no bells or whistles, just a good old British spy flick, it captures the dark intimate world of Cold War espionage, double agents, never trusting anyone fully, always checking your front door before entering, being suspicious of everyone you see or what they're doing.

Good Spy Film,"I was prepared to be blown away by this film, given its stellar cast, its great pedigree and the rave reviews. However, I felt a tad disappointed. But I think the reason was I have not read the book. I got the distinct feeling that if I had read the book, I would have enjoyed it more. In my defense, the director was liberal with the use of sudden flash backs, which were sometimes interesting but other times hindered the flow of the film.In any case, I still enjoyed the film. As always, Gary Oldman was outstanding. He is my favorite current actor, he has amazing versatility and commitment to the role.

Sometimes the film version destroys that illusion. This was not the case at all. I thought that I had lost the opportunity to watch the film, but when Apple TV offered it, I jumped at the chance. Perhaps it is because Gary Oldham is a lead in Apple's Slow Horse mini series. I was not at all disappointed by the film. The characters were brought to life brilliantly by the cast. Le Carre's book emerged perfectly in this film. No spoilers here. Read the book, read as much of Le Carre's writings as you can find. One of the best films I have seen for a long time.

"Not bad, but not progress","I wouldn't recommend reading all John Le Carre's books - they can be a bit same-y - but 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', about the uncovering of a mole within the British intelligence services, is a perfectly judged thriller, a spy-cum-detective story set against the backdrop of perceived national decline. The book was also the basis of one of the greatest television series of all time, perhaps owing to the fact that this is an ensemble story, allowing a collection of some of the finest British character actors of their generation to play off each other. Alec Guinness's portrayal of retired secret agent George Smiley is widely considered to have been his finest role; but arguably, Ian Richardson and Michael Aldridge also gave us their best stuff in this series. So one attraction of a remake, this time as a movie, is that it gives another generation of actors the chance to shine. But one question is, what can the film add to what the book and television series have already done? And while the movie doesn't butcher the source material, I fear the answer is not much. Of course, it's hard for a fan of the earlier work to watch with neutral eyes. Where the casting seems consistent with that used previously (John Hurt as Control, for example) everything feels fine; where not (Kathy Burke as Connie) it just feels wrong. More objectively, one can say that the inevitably more compressed format loses retains the mood of the original but loses the broader focus on the whole range of protagonists; when the mole is finally revealed, we care less because we know less about him. One can also note that in places the script departs from the book unnecessarily, but with the effect of losing subtlety and also plausibility: there's no reason for Irina to be shot in front of Prideaux, for Smiley to catch his wife in flagrante, or indeed, for Smiley to take a gun to his meeting with the mole, except to ram home a point that was better left implied. The soundtrack is also peculiarly deployed and contrasts with the unbeatable opening music and introductory credits of its predecessor. This doesn't make this a bad film; but if you watch just one version, pick the other one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I guess this is what it has been like in MI-6 or other agencies at troubled times, who is covering for whom, who is to be trusted or maybe is not and how can the web be untangled.There are many great actors in this film and they all play their roles to perfection, their characters are very different, but all have good, sad or character defining or changing moments and these are great to watch.The film is long and not action packed, not even in the action scenes, the pace is very smooth and calm, just like the main character played by Gary Oldman.

"Cold War espionage tale is challenging to follow, but boasts a superb craftsmanship from start to finish","Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy strays far from the familiarity of other spy films such as the James Bond franchise. This Cold War-set mystery piece sheds the treatment of tense gun shootouts, big-budget explosions and high-octane chase sequences in favor of a more authentic approach to the world of espionage. The story here follows a man with to hunt down the villain using his intellectual skills rather than high-tech gadgetry or firearms, and what transpires is a solidly complex, yet fascinating spy thriller. Taking from the pages of the novel of the same name by British writer John Le Carre, this historical fiction piece offers a layered story of paranoia and deceit that enlisted cultural relevance to the dark days of the Cold War during the 50s and 60s, and transcends into an enthralling tale where action is minimal but the suspense is high. Set in 1974, this film tells the story of MI6 agent Jim Prideaux (played by Mark Strong) who is assigned by head of the department Control (played by John Hurt) on a mission to Hungary. When the mission goes terribly wrong, Secretary Olive Lacon (played by Simon McBurney) learns that one of their agent is secretly working for the Soviet Union and hires retired agent George Smiley (played by Gary Oldman) to uncover the mole. With no one to trust but Agent Peter Gilliam (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley must use his intellect along with classified information by field agent Ricky Tarr (played by Tom Hardy) to uncover the traitor.Those who go into this flick expecting action and tensions in the veins of a James Bond movie are more than likely destined for disappointment. Inspired by John Le Carre's source material, this Tomas Alfredson-directed thriller opens light on more complicated world of international espionage that many films of the spy genre tend to embellish. Tomas Alfredson presents the film with both a narrative and visual compulsion that strengthens the authenticity of its Cold War climate, the latter of which involves incorporating a limited color palette of brown and gray in give each scene an old timely look from the 1970s. But it is the story that takes the crown on breathing life into the atmosphere. The film follows the lead character as he navigates for clues on who the informer is, and it journeys through a dense labyrinth of character explorations and twists that firmly build suspense for the final act. Everything moves at a significantly slow pace as the most of the action consists of characters engaging in long conversations. As tedious as it sounds, the long stretches of dialogue are actually what contribute to the blistering suspense that steadily pays off as twists and turns are frequently fired at us. It will keep you guessing until the end. While it is easy to grow exhausted by the over-sophistication of the plot, there are plenty of little surprises sprinkled throughout the stretch.Arguably one of the most celebrated aspects of this historical fiction piece comes from wide cast of A-list English actors who dominate the screen. Stepping in the lead role is Gary Oldman, known for his role as Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy boasts an emotionally stimulating performance in the role, easily one of the best performances he's displayed in his career. Standing by his side is Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the television series 'Sherlock', who does a fair job as MIG agent Peter Gilliam. Simon McBurney also makes for an appealing on screen performance, but perhaps nothing too memorable. John Hurt does his job here as well, but his much of his memorability here is deflated by his short amount of screen time. Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, and Ciaran Hinds make the best of their limited screen time, nothing out of the ordinary. In the end, it is Oldman that stands out among the crowd with his performance.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a fascinating Cold War espionage vehicle empowered by a superb craftsmanship by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson as well as stellar performances from an inspiring cast. As engrossing as it is, the film is not an easy one to follow and could require a second viewing for the brain to compete with the narrative complexity. The film is itself may not be the groundbreaking entry in the spy genre it sets out to be, but it does great justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Old spies like they were in  the Cold War era...,"Tinker Tailor has made quite a name for itself. A classic novel by Le Carre it spawned a much loved BBC TV series and various sequels. This film is a modern adaption of the book and comparisons will be inevitable. I've read the book and was intrigued to see how the film compares.Our lead spy is brought out of retirement to hunt out a mole in a highly secretive and important British intelligence unit. This being the early seventies Cold War epoch, you can cut the atmosphere with a knife, it's that taut.If you're looking for heavy action, zooming cameras, wild chases and good cop/bad cop relations, then this is not for you. The story flies in the face of Hollywood movies, and can be more old men in smoky board-men meetings and the tension between them. It's all spoken word. Action is minimal. This depicts the spy world in a more mundane light than we've been led to believe but probably is more realistic for it. It's a very intriguing world.The ensemble for the film is the best part of it all. Gary Oldman is wonderful in the lead role as ""Smiley"" and is joined by a great cache of other top notch actors (mainly British) young and old who feel perfectly suited to their roles.The settings are very evocative of the old era and there are enough old references (esp for the British) that really bring out the old settings perfectly.However, despite the great acting and filming, the film is actually very difficult to follow. It will likely require repeat viewing. The question is whether you were interested enough to want to do so again. Personally, I will but saying that I'm not as in love with this as others. It's a very slow film at times but will keep you intrigued. There's so many characters that on first viewing you can't help but be confused trying to keep tabs with them all, especially as most of the action is verbal rather than physical. It can be hard going.A good film with a very strong intelligent story. Hard to keep up with it all, but the excellent cast and setting will definitely keep most intrigued and interested, others will likely just switch off. Each to their own.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

IF you can make it all the way through it.Without giving anything away (like it would really matter) here's my impression.... there are English people in this flick, so you will need an ""English to English"" translator to understand what the heck they're saying...and there are Russians, couple of Americans, some other nationalities I couldn't identify. A guy gets shot in the back. You get to see that a few times in flashback. A hot woman is seen through a window having sex with someone who's not her husband....they don't show any good parts 'tho....then the husband kicks her ""arse"". She gets shot later.

If you prefer Hollywood-popcorn films don't watch it and be ashamed of yourself.,"""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is a Thriller released in 2011 and the first English-speaking one by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson. It is based on the same-titled novel by the famous author John le Carré. The Story is about George Smiley, a MI6 agent who gets fired together with his friend, the MI6's boss ""Control"", after a failed mission in Hungary. The plot takes place in the mid-seventies so the cold war is the background of the film. Soon after his retirement, ""Control"" dies and Smiley is ordered by a state secretary to investigate the suspicion that there is a mole in the new leadership of the ""Circus"". He is supported by active MI6 agent Peter Guillam, who is very well played by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Tomas Alfredson has put together an amazing cast, consisting of such great actors as Colin Firth, John Hurt or Mark Strong. They are all playing their roles superbly, but still are all outshined by the unbelievable performance of Gary Oldman as George Smiley. He suits this role so well, expressing the emotions of this very inconspicuous though extremely intelligent character only by using little details, that even the creator of George Smiley, John le Carré, remarked how impressed he was by Gary Oldman. The overall atmosphere is well made due to good cinematography, prop work and soundtrack. The director has an incredible eye for details and this fits the movie very well. He uses a picture language which tells a lot without the audience hearing a single word of dialogue. The film is relatively close to the novel because John le Carré participated in the writing of the screenplay. This means that its pacing is slow. We like it very much because it allows for the building up of a much tighter atmosphere and creates more tension. But that is only our opinion and not everyone may like it. It is neither a James Bond film featuring exotic locations, loads of attractive women and unrealistic gadgets, nor a ""standard"" modern action movie like the Bourne Trilogy. It tells a story that could have happened in the seventies without tons of visual or special effects, without big gunfights or helicopter shots in huge collapsing set pieces. To make it short: You can clearly see that this film is a European production and none made in and by Hollywood. So if you like ambitious stories that may sometimes be somewhat confusing you must watch the film. If you prefer Hollywood-popcorn films don't watch it and be ashamed of yourself.Christopher K., Jonas P., Mirco K.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An intriguing spy movie about the fiendishly complex trail of international espionage and betrayal,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) has suspense, intrigue and extraordinary acting by an excellent cast . Gary Oldman is the definitive Smiley in this superb production of John le Carré's gripping novel. In the 1970s, the failure of a mission led by MI6 chief (John Hurt) in Hungary triggers a change in the leadership of the British secret services. Smiley is already in retirement, undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) calls veteran agent George Smiley (Gay Oldman) back from forced retirement to ferret out a mole and stop the flow of vital British secrets to the Russians. MI6 gives him a special mission, since there are suspicions that a Mole is infiltrated among the high levels of the secret service and only someone from the outside can cover him up. Smiley is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by rogue Agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), that there was a mole. With the help of other companions and a faithful agent (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley will gather information and put together the pieces that will lead him to the traitor. Along the way he will find stories of betrayal, ambition and lies. How do you find an enemy who is hidden right before your eyes? The secret is out!.Trust no one!. Suspect everyone!.The enemy is within!.At the height of the Cold War, only a master spy could be trusted to expose one of their own!.Who can spy on the spies?The Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) directs this new adaptation, after the television starring Alec Guinness based on the novel written by John Le Carré. Nominated for three Oscars and BAFTA winner for Best Screenplay adapted to Best British Film, this is a competent spy film with striking performances by Gary Oldman in his first Oscar-nominated performance, John Hurt, Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Graham, Simon McBurney, Tom Hardy, Roger Lloyd, Mark Strong, among others .This interesting movie is a cold thriller plenty of suspense, mystery, tension and a little bit of violence. Including a suspenseful musical score by Alberto Iglesias, as well as evocative cinematography by Hoyte Van Hotama. This is one of many adaptations based on John Le Carré novels , including the notorious 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' (1965) and George Smiley character already appeared in 'Sidney Lumet's The Deadly Affair' in this film, James Mason was the second actor to play John le Carré's famous George Smiley character on screen and TV and adding the excelent series 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' (1979) the acclaimed BBC production of John le Carré's classic spy story starred by Alec Guinness, Michael Jayston and Ian Richardson. Although the story gets several ingredients for entertainment , the plot is some embarrassing and flawed, the screenplay has gaps and results to be some confusing and hard to follow, though entertaining enough.The flick belongs to spies sub-genre developed during ¨Cold war¨ and its maxim representations are John LeCarre's novels rendered to cinema in movies as ¨The spy who came in from cold¨ (by Martin Ritt with Richard Burton) , ¨The Kremlin Letter¨(John Huston with Nigel Green), ¨Russia House¨(Fred Schepisi with Sean Connery), and ¨The Tailor of Panama¨(John Boorman with Pierce Brosnan), these films get similar atmosphere and twisted intrigues about spies among East and West World, but with no relation to spies from James Bond novels by Ian Fleming .

"No tension, tedious political correctness","It's obviously not easy to boil such a complex story down to movie length. Clearly there was no option but to go for a total re-write. Even the most ardent Le Carre fans must understand that. This is a brave attempt, but the movie is strangely devoid of tension. The characters are drab too, not nearly as well observed as those in the old 1979 TV series. A couple of things interested me: why was it necessary to turn Smiley's actively heterosexual sidekick Peter Guillam gay? And why, when Smiley was remembering his one encounter with Soviet spy master Karla, did he have to be given the extra line that the ""Americans had got to him first and torn his fingernails out?"" This leaden political correctness and tedious anti-Americanism seemed pointless as well as irritating.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Sensational film with a faultless ensemble,"Retired British Intelligence officer George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is forced out of retirement to investigate a possible mole in the system. Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), a spy returning from overseas, confirms the suspicions after having a brief affair with Soviet Agent, who revealed that an insider was passing information to the Russians. Assisted by Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley must investigate his former colleagues, dubbed by his former boss Control (John Hurt), as 'Tinker' (Toby Jones), 'Tailor' (Colin Firth), 'Sailor' (Ciaran Hinds), and 'Poorman' (David Dencik). Also on his list of interviewees is school teacher Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), who is a former agent that was shot and captured by the Russians in a previous bungled operation, and has now been cast out by the agency nicknamed the 'Circus'.After the Harry Potter series ended earlier this year, it's great to see that a stellar British cast can still be assembled. And what a cast it is. The danger, obviously, is that with such talent on display, some people can get left behind or the film can feel over-populated. But, with the exception of Ciaran Hinds, each actor gets their chance to shine. The notable stand-out in my opinion is Hardy, who with his recent back catalogue, can only be described as the best young British actor around. He's a world away from psychopathic jailbird Charles Bronson in, er, Bronson, which is his greatest performance to date. Here, he's a damaged and emotionally-torn grunt who is dealing with the fact that the woman he's possibly fallen in love with has disappeared and most likely dead.With Alec Guinness making the role of Smiley his own in the BBC adaptation of John le Carre's book, Oldman faced a challenge. But of course, this being Oldman, he makes his turn as the bespectacled, brooding and miserable super-spy into one of his best performances. He's not the over-the-top bad guy or the larger-than-life personality that we're used to from the likes of Leon, Sid And Nancy or The Fifth Element, but he is quiet, dutiful, and ponderous. I believe in the years to come he will be remembered as one of the finest actors this country has ever produced. The whole film is a tour de force of acting, and mention must go to Firth also, who demonstrates once again why, at the age of 51, he's getting more work than ever.The film itself is sensational. Every frame, sound, and line of dialogue looks carefully considered. Just like the collection of grumpy spies, the film is slow-moving. It's a film of tone and mood, of greys and browns. This is portraying 1970's Britain, and from the looks of it, it was a miserable and paranoid place to live. The Cold War was in full flow, and Britain was in danger of being left in the wake of it's American allies. The characters reflect the mood of the country, it would seem. The spies are the people that must risk torture, murder, or arrest, all for the apparent safety of Britain, and they must do it all in the shadows. They are unhappy, and have every right to be.It can be confusing, but when the credits roll after an exceptional closing and lively montage, and all the pieces come together, it's apparent that it's a relatively straightforward plot that has been arranged in a complex manner. It doesn't feel like this was done to make the film seem more intelligent than it is, but a way to keep the narrative interesting, and allowing us to learn things as our protagonist does. It jumps back and forward in time as the various players tell their story, or Smiley finds another piece to the puzzle, and credit must go to director Tomas Alfredson, who directed Swedish vampire masterpiece Let The Right One In, for keeping a firm grip on everything.

Time travel exists,"If there is one thing is this film excels in it is the eye for detail for every prop you see, all is early 70-s horror. Whole streets are reconstructed, all the cars are period correct even if they pass in the background. The trolleys files are transported in are deliciously ugly. The spectacles on peoples noses are gigantic and hideous. Whole office floors are transformed into early 1970-s misery, even the sepia colors the film was created in accentuate the fact that the flower power is dead, drab is back. And than around the 20th minute in the film there is this huge box on the desk full of files in the middle of the frame. It says Dual 505-1 on the cover. Which is a turntable that was produced by the German Dual company in 1981 and 1982. A miracle, no science, back from the future. Time travel is possible!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier... Not enough Spy","This movie adaptation of John Le Carre's classic novel is an average spy movie. Gary Oldman inscrutably plays the role of a semi-retired MI6 spy rehired to uncover a mole in the Circus, ably assisted by Cumberbatch (our TV Sherlock). There are many other great actors in the movie, but their roles are quite small and forgettable (except Firth, who leaves some impression).The screenplay is good enough, but is quite emotionless and doesn't get you much involved. It's quite slow and unexciting for a spy movie. Even the characters feel a little less developed.This movie by Tomas Alfredson is a good attempt, but it's not as good as his 'Let The Right One In'.If you're expecting gadgets, thrills, car-chases & fight scenes, you'll be disappointed. It's not a bad movie. It's watchable if you're looking for a spy movie with a different feel. And it's mainly the acting & background score which keeps you from getting bored.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Boring,Dull and Tedious","I enjoy a wide range of movies, all styles and genres: Hollywood blockbusters, Art House, Foreign Films, Sci-Fi, Action movies, Dramas, Thrillers, Rom Coms etc. and especially this sort of spy drama/thriller/mystery I think I am generally favorably inclined to most movies. Even films I do not greatly enjoy I can usually appreciate some of their qualities.However not this film.It has been a long time since I have found a movie as dull and boring as this movie, to the extent that I felt compelled to jump on the net and add my views to the comments being made about this film.Dull, boring, tedious and uninteresting are the words that spring into my mind after putting up with this wholly underwhelming movie.I wanted to enjoy this movie and I kept holding out hope that at sometime during its interminable 127 minute duration it was going to get better. Alas it did not, boring from start to finish.Being a fan of Gary Oldman I can only blame the director for the dull performance he delivered in this movie. Even characters that are meant to be played as complex and deep need to convey some spark and insight from the actor. Here there was none.I watched this movie because it was generally being well reviewed and had an IMDb rating of 7.3 and was nominated for a number of awards (eg 11 at BAFTA). Now I cannot understand how this has occurred.A bit more research now and I find it was snubbed by the Golden Globes so it seems not everyone has been sucked in.I also found out that there are a number of members on IMDb who share my opinion. I now wish I had taken notice of them before deciding to see this movie.I had the choice of viewing this movie or the Iron Lady. I can only hope that my comments here may save some poor soul from making the same mistake that I did. In my opinion any other movie playing now or at any other time in the foreseeable future would have been a better choice than this boring and disappointing movie.By the way did I say this movie was boring? Just wanted to make sure I got this point across.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
proof that sometimes even subtle can be too subtle,"The first thing you notice is that the critics' reviews do not match the IMDb members' opinions. The next thing you notice is that the film is based on the iconic work from one of the best espionage writers of all time. Next you look at the cast and shake your head, wow, was there anyone on Britain's A-list that they missed? Then it gets complicated. If you know the story, you are spellbound by the edits they made and the shortcuts they took. If you do not know the story, you are generally confused but still happy. The quality, the richness, of the production cannot be ignored. And Oldman was then, and still is now (SLOW HORSES), a master at this type of role. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

A great film.,"I read some of the reviews on this board before I went to see the film and am fairly puzzled by some of the haters who slated this film. It is good film, but it isn't going to be liked by everyone although it does not deserve to be slated by morons. John le Carre lovers and those with a brain and an understanding of real life spy stories and the cold war will love it, but there are millions of who will never get it.There are several really stupid reviews but I single out one by jackcarver2009 who went to see the film with his mother and his aunt. In a painfully feeble attempt to be funny he wrote that the two women found it more painful than childbirth. Hilarious, so so funny jack..you sound like a very silly ten year old who was taken to the pictures by Mumsy and auntie Doris, who sadly got 'Tinker Tailor' mixed up with 'The Smurfs'..you were watching the wrong movie you dimwits.This is a very good film and not to be missed, it is dark but that's what real life cold war espionage was like. Gary Oldman delivers a great performance as Smiley and the cast, direction and screenplay are all superb. I would advise anybody who lives in the real world to go and see this film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A slow-burner that really hits the mark!...,"Having seen the critical acclaim this has got I had to see it when it finally landed at The Picture House, my local cinema. I remember the TV adaptation of this John le Carré novel, starring Alec Guinness, being aired, but I never really watched it at the time. So it was all new to me and I have to say I was impressed. It's not for everyone, it has quite a slow pace and there are no frenetic fight scenes, chase sequences or gun battles, it's all very calm. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is the 1970's and the cold war with Russia is at its height. Control has had word that there is a double agent at the top of the organisation and decides to leave, taking George Smiley with him. Some time later, Control is dead and George is asked to come back to find out who the mole is. He enlists the help of Peter Guillam, an agent, and former Special Branch Police officer, Mendel. The suspects are; Percy Alleline, Bill Haydon, Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase. The investigation begins by looking at an incident in Budapest involving another agent, Jim Prideaux, who was shot by Russian agents. Another source of information is Ricki Tarr who comes to George wanting to trade what he knows for the life of a Russian woman he has fallen for. There are plots within plots in this very complicated story and there's no way I'm gonna give the game away or the Spoiler Police will have me marched off to Siberia as quickly as I can say 'spy'.Beautifully shot with really sharp imagery, I'm always impressed by that when I see a film on the big screen. The incidental music was good, but, for me, there wasn't enough of it many long silences in the dialogue. Moving on to performances, well, I have to say that Gary Oldman as George Smiley was superb! He really nailed it and went up a great deal in my estimation. I also thought the performances of; Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr, John Hurt as Control, Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were all most excellent! I really hope at least one of them gets an Oscar if not a BAFTA. Oh, it was also nice to see an appearance from Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs.As I said at the beginning, this film will not suit everyone, it had a very complicated plot and it's one you really have to concentrate on or you'll miss something. Concentration was quite hard at the viewing I was at because it was quite hot and stuffy in there. Not to worry, I stayed awake for the duration and really enjoyed what I saw. It's the kind of film, I think, you might have to watch a few times to get the little nuances put in there, little clues to the identity of the mole. Some of it is told in flashback and it can be a little confusing at times figuring out whether it's a flashback or not It certainly keeps you on your toes! I will certainly be seeing this again at some point. So, for those that like a good cold war thriller, a slow burning plot with many twists and turns, then this one comes very highly recommended.My score: 9.1/10 IMDb Score: 708/10 (based on 2,892 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 97/100 (based on 38 reviews counted when this review was written).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Confusing, great cinematography","I enjoyed the fact that in this movie, unlike some others, they didn't feel the need to completely pull you by the hand, such as a camera zoom on that clue that you have to see. But alas I found myself checking my watch and wondering when the film will end. The story was very confusing to me and found it hard to follow characters by name when many were not really introduced. Perhaps if I had read the book multiple times (like one reviewer on here mentioned-and gave a very positive review) as a prerequisite, I would have been able to follow the story.I regret going to see it.

an aperitif for the TV series,"An interesting take on it, but for me the definitive version is the TV series. Gary Oldman is quite good, but Alec Guinness is simply superlative.The new version is necessarily like an MP3.. highly compressed so that you lose the original flavor yet adding elements which are conspicuously absent and inconsistent with the book. The greenish wash of the post-processing is particularly distracting to me, and it is ironic that the final scene has such an obvious (and to me strange) French theme since the film was a combination of French (and, I suspect, Hungarian) funds with a Swedish director.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incoherent and dull,"I watched this the other night and still have no idea what happened.The character development is pitiful, you feel nothing for any of them and i struggled to work out who was who all the way through the movie!

On the plus side the acting was good, but not enough to make me recommend this to anyone.I presume you need to read the book, or at least have a brochure explaining what the heck is going on.If you haven't read the book or watched the TV series from the seventies then don't bother with this.A total waste of a fine cast.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Taut, compelling political thriller, the sort of high brow stuff that never gets made into a big blockbuster anymore","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAdapted from the John La Carre novels that were made into a TV mini series in the 70s, the film opens in the early 70s during the height of the cold war, where British Intelligence suspect a Russian spy has infiltraited their ranks. On a mission in Norway, Agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is apparently killed after things don't work out as planned. Now, Control (John Hurt) has narrowed the suspect down to four people and has called in the assistance of recently ousted Intelligence Analyst George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to get to the bottom of the matter. But as he does, he finds everyone around him increasingly harder to trust.In the heat of the recession era movie industry, where endless, soulless brain dead, big budget popcorn fodder the big movie execs know will rake in the big bucks is the only thing that gets shoved in our faces, it's even more dis-spiriting that here we have another re-make...but a re-make that is of the more high brow, intelligent, sophisticated end of the market, a cerebral political thriller that demands all your attention and makes it's pay off by gripping you right to the end. Given the average movie goer of this generation (me, anyway) has the attention span of an amoeba, given it's exposure to excessive advertising, popular culture and MTV, it may be a flick that will require two viewings in order to take it all in and pick up on stuff you may have missed the first time round, but if you can figure it all out on your first viewing more power to you.Performances wise, Oldman does what he was born to do, naturally inhibiting the body and voice of an experienced, weary old political hack, whilst Hurt provides reliable support as the eccentric, campy man at the top and Strong raises his profile as the elusive, mysterious agent and that's not to mention support from the likes of Kathy Burke, Colin Firth and Stephen Graham, and with a line up like that you know you're on surefire ground.Although it's not an original idea, it somehow remains a taut and compelling one that is as dynamic as it originally was (apparantly) and is an encouraging sight given all the meaningless, big budget drivel we have to endure nowadays. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What a disappointment,"A book as complex as Le Carré's can't be filmed without serious compression of the plot, but this mess wilfully makes unnecessary changes - look at the character of the Hon. Jerry Westerby, for example, as shown here and as written - and fails to explain some key elements of the plot. The result is that, having watched matters unwind slowly over two hours, we are suddenly led to what looks very much like Smiley having suddenly noticed something he should have seen before. There is absolutely no description of what the men at the top of the Circus do or of their pasts - Bland in particular seems to be paid for doing nothing very much - and some incidents that have lost their point because the story has been changed. One example is the befriending of the schoolboy Bill by a major character.On the plus side, Mark Strong is convincing as Prideaux, and Gary Oldman does what he can with the part of George Smiley. Tom Hardy does a good job as Ricki Tarr, and David Dencik provides an interesting portrayal of Toby Esterhase. On the other hand, John Hurt plays John Hurt very well, and Toby Jones makes you wonder why anyone with half a brain would give Sir Percy Alleline any position of responsibility whatsoever. This is not the fault of the actors - they haven't been given much of a hand to play.The film is atmospheric and, I suppose, is an interesting enough film in its own right, but it isn't the film of the book. Whether the book is, ultimately, filmable may be doubtful.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I've read several reviews where people who had read (and loved) the novel were terribly disappointed. I have not read the book, so ignorance is bliss. A second run through is always good in order to allow an American to pick up the subtle points of the conversation. The director moves us through the story using some simple ploys in order to keep confusion from arising between the flashbacks and real time action. The movie boasts a fabulous cast that carry off their roles in a clean, concise direction with aplomb. From Hurt to Hardy, there is a range of accomplished actors with an appearance from Downton Abbey's Laura Carmichael. The ubiquitous Brendan Cumberbatch is sterling while sporting yet another over-the-top hairpiece. Gary Oldman restores faith in his thespian skills following his Batman roles.

The story has some plausibility problems.,"This is a muddled story set in a time that is now history. What was relevant in 1973 is no longer the case today. If one does understand the historical context in which the story is set, this movie will fail. Also, the protagonist, played by Gary Oldham, is not the most engaging of characters and it is unclear as to why any government agency would want to request his services. It is one thing for a story to include all kinds of twists and turns, but not to the point that it becomes confusing. A who-done-it format need not be confusing. Aklso, the premise of the story is not plausible. At the highest government level a mole will stick out like the proverbial sore thumb. It's one thing to have a spy operating in some office; such a spy can maintain their cover for years. It's another thing, however, to maintain one's cover at the ministerial because at that level everybody knows everybody too well and anonymity is impossible. It would be like an assistance secretary of defense in the U. S. being a secret double agent. No way. In any event, Gary Oldham gives a strong performance as a cynical operative and John Hurt is excellent as the frustrated and angry spy master.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(2011),"What a blast. Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who did the acclaimed horror film Let the Right One In, followed up that effort with yet another adaptation of a novel, this time written by the famed John le Carre, who himself was a real life British intelligence operative who left the service to become a full time writer. His name may not ring a bell at first, but he's responsible for countless of stories that involve spy vs spy, and in the last decade had his stories The Tailor of Panama and The Constant Gardener, amongst others, made into movies. His main protagonist of George Smiley is to him like how probably Jack Ryan is to Tom Clancy, and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the first in what would be known as the Karla Trilogy, and I'm hoping the rest could be made as well, if this is indicative of how the rest can be.I have to admit that the film moves at meditative pace, quite unlike most spy films which tend to focus on either the intrigue behind the politicking, or the action sequences. This is like an anti-thesis to the Bond films, where the figures that lurk in the shadows, stay in the shadows, rather than to blow their cover at each possible opportune. The narrative moves forward and backward very freely, and it's up to your own devices to piece things together in chronological order. But Alfredson does this without alienating or frustrating the viewer, and in fact putting scenes in their place so that they make sense, and provide you with a little bit of fun and work to figure out the complex web of relations and accounts that already exists, putting you in the driver's seat just as George Smiley (Gary Oldman) gets tasked to try and figure out the identity of a mole in the top levels of the British intelligence service.Assembling a small crack team that he could trust, the crux of the story is like an investigative drama, where suspects and witnesses get paid an imposing visit by the unsmiling (contrary to his last namesake) Smiley whom you know brings about a certain gravitas in his presence, compelling one to cooperate rather than to go against. Gary Oldman, when his character George Smiley is on to you, there's no escape and even without firing a shot his deep stare and monotonous voice hardly betrays any emotion, and will make anyone piss in their pants out of unfounded fear. In many instances one will find it perplexing why he goes about in his investigations in a certain peculiar way, and only when it's revealed much later on that it all made sense, tying in with the way the scenes got presented together, sometimes without very clear answers, relying on your ability to put 1 and 1 together.To say anything more will be to betray the necessity of the viewer to pay really close attention to every word said, and every scene being played out. There are plenty of thick dialogue in the film that calls for your utmost attention, with failure being to miss out on pertinent clues in this cat and mouse hunt, played out when one has to operate from the outside to probe into an office one held before, to look for clues and evidence without alerting the proverbial snake until the time is right. And playing probable snakes are a myriad of characters, with some of the best ensemble casting that any film will find envious of, such as Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Oldman himself, amongst others.With the spate of public officials being caught with their pants down in various scandals here in Singapore, this film couldn't be more apt when one thinks about the kind of probes that get sanctioned in order to weed out the rot right at the top, such as the appointment of a commission of inquiry to go in with authority, and with a grave mission at hand to seek accountability. In essence that's what Smiley had to deal with, being tasked out of retirement to do just that and get down to the bottom of things, with what I thought was actually a brilliant masterstroke by the mole to do things in a certain personal way that will cast doubts into the mind of its possible, powerful adversary, thinking multiple steps ahead in deliberately measured chess game. And the fact is that the story is also quite close to real life, being le Carre's novelized account of his own experiences of the 50s and 60s scandal that revealed the Cambridge Five traitors within Britain.In most real life spy versus spy cases, there's always a distinct lack of pomp or to keep things under wraps for fear of having one's cover blown apart, or jeopardizing the prospects of other agents. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy also subscribes to this mantra that shuns big movement and action, but in its place comes the real treasure of the intricate work done to uncover leaks and spies with tools of utmost secrecy, and diplomacy to a certain extent where deals get cut and made. It's old school spy 101, but has more than enough fuel in its tank to warrant repeat viewings just to catch all the subtleness and complexities. Highly recommended as the thinking man's spy thriller!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
WTF . . .  It was total Crap,"I would have preferred to choose minus-1 for Gawd-awful, but the choice was not available.I went into the theater being VERY familiar with the mini-series. I went in as an enthusiastic supporter of the effort to convert this work into an original 2-hour(ish) movie. I had even downloaded the pod-cast series promotional materials from iTunes.So, expecting excellence from an excellent cast, I sat through the biggest pile of (steaming) nothing I've seen in a long time.How did it look? Like Crap! How coherent was the story telling? Crap! How was the character development? Crap!I think the director must have believed he was supposed to make a chain of coming attraction vignettes instead of a movie. Perhaps he should limit his future efforts to commercials for dog food and diapers for the aged -- thereby limiting the likelihood of his wasting more time, money and talent.Can ANYONE explain the logic of multiple scenes of Smiley wordlessly swim around in a pond -- instead of using the same time for character or plot development?Dose anyone besides me think that the Christmas party scenes were a complete waste?With all the promotional talk about the calibre of cast that has been assembled, we get virtually zero leverage out of Ciarán Hinds capabilities.With the rest of the cast going on and on about being intimidated about working with the great John Hurt the director provides us with virtually zero leverage on his capabilities. Did you see anyone leave the theatre saying wow, the John Hurt performance was spellbinding? Hell No.I saw people in the audience doing Facebook on their iPhones and I became envious of them. My only concern was that the strangers sitting next to me might be offended.What I really want to know is, where do you have to line up to get opportunities of this calibre with so little ability to deliver?An Anime version would have done more justice to furthering the proliferation of the story into diverse genre -- just find a different director.Congratulations on the biggest waste of an opportunity's potential that I have seen in a long long time.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dusty and Demanding,"Modeled after the ""Real-Life"" Spy World of archives, windowless rooms, and dust throated, liquor and cigarette Men of aging faces and protruding mid-sections, this is about as far from Bond and Bourne as it is intended. Those familiar with the Author's Novels and other screen adaptations revel in this oppositeness.But for others this may be a taxing mind hurt of unbearable proportions. It is dimly lit and everything is brown and shades of rust. It drags along at a pace that is cumbersome and confusing at times, and is as stale as a stakeout.That is the point, you either climb aboard for the slow-ride and be intellectualized by its layers of Plots and Subplots, vague explanations and cluttered conversations, or not. If not you are likely to throw up your hands and give up, if so, you may be seduced by its subtle cleverness and wish for more. Either way, in the end, almost everyone is looking for more and most likely the sequel (the Book has a follow up) will offer more or less the same wanting, because that is the Nature of this thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The melancholiness of spying,"The pace is languorous, at times excruciatingly slow. The music is sombre and deep, interspersed with long pregnant pauses of complete silence. The lighting is low and casts long shadows. The colours are muted, often grey and blue, but at times amber and ochre. The mood is distinctly chilling and sinister. Welcome to the murky world of counterespionage during the heydays of the cold war.After a bloody prelude set in Budapest, George Smiley is pulled out of retirement to unearth a ""mole right at the top of the circus"". How the laconic Smiley goes about this assignment is never made amply clear and the viewers are expected to workout the jigsaw puzzle for themselves. There are gruesome corpses, but the killing is mostly off-screen, except for two, one of them stunningly sudden. The narration is elliptical with flashbacks that are short and often confusing. The Russian passages of conversation are deliberately not subtitled. The editing is quicksilver and anticipatory. I am still trying to figure out the Freudian symbols of railway tracks and points, or the fat bespectacled kid.The movements of Gary Oldman's Smiley are laboured and arthritic. The wry British humour manages to ooze out in a couple of scenes. Through extreme close-ups, director Tomas Alfredson manages to evoke the melancholic world of spies. It is anything but fun and glamour. The atmospherics are brilliant transporting us to a world of ticker tapes and shrill telephones. It was a time when cigarette smoking was uber-cool.The denouement is deeply disappointing; it comes as a big anti-climax. This is a literary film; unless you have read the books you will not know that Karla is Smiley's Russian archenemy. The film is a must-watch if you are a Le Carré fan; otherwise it will tax your grey cells.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie vs. Book,"I understand the need to condense a book down to a time suitable for a movie, and I understand what is meant by ""screenplay adapted from the book by ..."".

But in the book, he is not only heterosexual, but is a renown skirt chaser in the Circus. I do not understand the need for the movie to make this change. It did not matter in the story. Was it done to make it more ""relevant"" to current Hollywood standards? To be more ""PC"". But I thought the movie was excellent. It required paying attention, just as the book did.

I also think that it's lack of action is filled by those great memories in which we learn more about the pass of our characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautiful film but impossible to follow the story unless you've read the book,"Extremely beautiful film. However, for us who have not read John Le Carré's book, the film is quite incomprehensible. The director has completely missed out that a story has to be told, in order to give cinema visitors more than just beautiful photo and splendid acting. I left the theater like a major wandering question mark, determined to read the book to eventually give the film a second chance.Seriously speaking, the film was painfully boring and nothing much happens. Every now and then it felt pointless. I did find myself looking at my watch, wondering ""When does it end?"". The actors, nothing wrong, but wasting their talent on this film was really a waste of money and time. And speaking of time - remember that if you see the movie, you'll never get that time back. I already miss the two hours I spent on this overrated production.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthy contender for Best Picture!,"Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one of the best British films for a long time and perhaps my film of the year. There is not much I can criticise about the film, the plot, adapted from the best-selling novel by John Le Carre, is top-notch; Alfredson's direction captures the Cold War perfectly and there is certainly nothing to criticise about its performances.This film has some of the best British actors working today, with Gary Oldman leading as George Smiley, an experienced spy with a troubled past, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy as operatives caught up in the hunt for a Russian mole, who could be a number of high-ranking men in MI6, including Colin Firth and Toby Jones and, as John Hurt's Control may suspect, Smiley himself.I recommend this film not only to people who enjoy espionage/ cold war thrillers but anyone who appreciates film in its excellence and a showcase of Oscar-worthy performances.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite a great cast and good script material, the film is tiring, stagnant, a bit gray and boring to watch.","This film is a remake of an older film from 1973 (I haven't seen it yet, but I intend to), both of which are film adaptations of a spy novel that was written by John Le Carrée. Being the original story known for its quality and this film being an elaborate super production and with a cast full of established names, I was expecting a great film... but the truth is that I felt disappointed in that expectation. The movie is not as interesting and good as I would have liked.In fact, the film has a lot of well-known actors, with the strongest and most impactful performance given to us by an experienced Gary Oldman. The actor regained his native English accent and was able to masterfully adapt to the character, fully deserving the Oscar nomination for Best Actor he received that year. Besides him, Toby Jones and Colin Firth were also in great shape in this film, but Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt and Tom Hardy are not far behind them.The story is relatively simple: in the midst of Cold War intrigue, MI6 tried to help a Soviet officer to defect in Budapest. This officer knew the identity of a double agent, undercover in the British services. However, the operation goes very badly, and it becomes evident to the leaders of MI6 that there really are one or more traitors, very well-placed within the Secret Service. To find out who they are, they call in George Smiley, a retired agent with a lot of experience.On a technical level, I can't help but appreciate the dark cinematography and the way it tries to recreate the dirty, foggy and somewhat paranoid atmosphere of Cold War London, in addition to the atmosphere of British houses of that time and all the effort of the set and costumes. The film is effective in its effort to transport us to the time and context, and manages to place itself in a pleasantly paranoid environment, where everyone is suspicious of everyone else. It's not an action movie and, therefore, the effects are few and discreet, functional.Despite strong performances from the cast and excellent source material and well-written script, the film has two main issues: atmosphere and pacing. Tomas Alfredson deliberately slowed the film, and that makes the film tiresome and boring, if you add the lack of movement, the endless dialogue, the way each action and movement takes as long as possible in front of the camera. Also, one has to be very attentive to the names of the various characters, and their role in the film, or we will never understand the plot while watching the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Kind of confusing story, but brilliant acting.",The storyline I find confusing. Had to rewind a few times so I fully understood what was going on or what happened.

Pay Attention!,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole AshlandThis is as much of an action movie as a film about the Cold War could be. Directed in interlinking fashion (with a very dense story-arc) by Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) and using one of the most well adapted screenplays of 2011 from a rather heavy novel from John le Carre (and also a 1979 British TV mini-series), ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is one of the more well orchestrated mystery/crime/spy drama's to come out of Britain in recent years. Containing a who's who of critically acclaimed English actors (maybe the British response to ""New Year's Eve""); including Mark Strong (Kick-Ass), John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Midnight Express), Toby Jones (My Week With Marilyn), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Tom Hardy (Warrior) and Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight), this is a film that while well constructed, well acted and should win some kind of award for cinematography and set design (every nuance of this film reeks of 1970's Britain), may work more to confuse and turn off American audiences who are used to films with ""Spy"" in the title being drenched with high flying stunts, slickly choreographed shootouts and Tom Cruise.Synopsis: The plot of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is very elaborate, so I am going to attempt to write a decipherable synopsis without confusing too many people or confusing myself. Set in the Cold War of the 1970's, the story centers around an old and weathered British Operative named George Smiley (Oldman), who upon the death of the head of British Intelligence, is forced to retire. When a hired Hit-man, by the name of Rickey Tarr (Hardy), brings it to the attention of the British Intelligence that a mole is thought to be working within the system and is undeniably a high ranking operative, Smiley is brought back to conduct a sort of internal investigation and flush out said mole. Like any well done who-done-it, this film effortlessly leads audiences through a veritable maze of a tension driven plot (like a subdued British game of Clue), only showing the viewer just enough to suspect to wrong person until the very end. And the final twist does work and is very much worth sitting through storytelling that is not only complex but also nonlinear (which will be the complaint by most who find fault with the movie). Suffice to say, there is no way anybody is going to understand every nuance, plot point or British slang code word in this film after seeing it just once, but that doesn't mean ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" doesn't have a quiet entertainment value, which will sneak up on you (if you like who-done-it espionage films that is).Excellent performances: And my new found love affair with Tom Hardy's acting style continues, after seeing him in ""Bronson"", ""Inception"" then ""Warrior"", as he is excellent in his bit but very pivotal role in this film (and is sure to be bad-ass as Bane in the upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises""). Another performance of note comes from the ever brilliant but at times overlooked Toby Jones , who should not be looked over this time for his subtle and very smug supporting role as the Scot, Percy Allelne. But, as I said before, every actor does some fairly upstanding work here. The fact that Oldman is being lifted up so highly for his performance as Smiley this awards season is something of a mixed bag of emotions for me, because while he does do a respectable job as the protagonist here, he is pretty much really good in everything he does. His chameleon-like ability to become immersed in a plethora of roles, be it Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series or Lt. Jim Gordon in ""The Dark Knight"" or even as Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" is magnificent, but in the end it is not his performance in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" that I didn't find award worthy, it is his character. Despite what many other critics may say, Oldman wasn't memorable here, plain and simple, hence not award worthy.Final Thought: Filled with superb performances, although none are worthy of an Oscar nomination, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is an elaborate and very well constructed spy thriller, even with the lack of countless shootouts or highly James Bond-esque choreographed chases. To say this is more along the lines of a British (uber-complicated) ""The Usual Suspects"" would be a more accurate assessment. But viewer beware even though I enjoyed this picture, ""Tinker Tailor Solder Spy"" is a movie which will make one work for their entertainment. You have to pay attention for the entirety of the 127 minute runtime!

Not What You Expect But a Decent Movie Nonetheless,"After watching the trailer for the movie, I was expecting a movie that makes you sit on the edge of your seat as you wait in anticipation of the next scene. In reality, the movie doesn't have any cliffhanger moments where you simply can't stop watching. I was also expecting an action heavy movie like the James Bond and Jason Bourne once but I think a gun is only shot twice and no hand to hand combat. This is the type of movie that communicates vital information through small clues so you have to pay close attention to every scene. Even then, it's hard to figure out what's happening at times until you take a few seconds to think.Story (2.4/3.0): The story really makes you think about what's going on as it plays. There are so many small clues that you have to catch to understand the movie. Make sure to watch it with subtitles on if possible or else you might miss something due to the heavy British accent.Acting (1.5/3.0): Gary Oldman received so much hype over his role in this movie but I really didn't think it was anything truly special. He spends most of the movie in stone-faced contemplation but he does do a good job of communicating the inner struggles that his character goes through. Colin Firth is in the movie as well but his acting is subpar compared to his role in ""The King's Speech.""Cinematography (1.6/2.0): The movie definitely feels like the Cold War era. A lot of gray and rain.Music (0.8/1.0): The music fits well with the movie. The music is perhaps the only suspenseful thing about the movie.Rewatchability (0.8/10): I definitely want to watch the movie again to catch any additional clues and to verify some of my ideas about the plot. Of course, if you're looking for a quick thrill in an action movie, I wouldn't suggest watching the movie at all because it will put you to sleep.Total 7.3/10.0",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good ... but,"while I did enjoy this I could not help thinking back to the BBC series with Alec G. as smiley. it had such atmosphere, it was like the early 1970's where dripping off the walls of smiley's flat, Gary O flat was much too nice. The BBC version did have the luxury of been able to use the whole book while this movie has to make choices about the content, why they lingered on Ricky T's relationship with his Russian female spy is beyond me. The cast are good though, John Hurt is just great, he shows the grim and dirt of London at that time in his face while Colin Firth is Cloin firth whether he is stuttering or not. I really did enjoy this, it just it is one of those projects that always going to bounce up against the original, so for people who have not read the book or seen Alec Guinness as smiley enjoyment is there to be had..

A good movie but I had high expectations so I was a little disappointed. I recommend this though. I say B-,"""He says there's a mole right at the top of the circus and he's been there for years."" During the Cold War '70's the head of MI6, Control, retires after believing that one of the four senior figures in the agency was a mole working for the Russians. Because of Control's leaving George Smiley (Oldman) is also forced out only to be asked a year later to investigate and find out who the mole is. This is a movie that I was very much looking forward to. I love all the actors and the idea of it is something I usually like. While this is not a bad movie by any stretch I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I knew going in what to expect and it's not the fact that it's a little slow moving but there was something else that it was missing that disappointed me. I don't know what though.

Mediocre Movie,"The movie is mediocre at best. The good part of it was it didn't rely on special effects to keep your attention, they actually tried acting. In the middle of the movie I found myself dozing off because of boredom though. I asked several other people from our team who saw the movie and they too said they struggled with falling asleep.Of course the director had to throw in a homosexual sub-plot, like this added anything to the story. Maybe if the director had spent more effort developing the plot rather than trying to throw in things like homosexuality, gore, or sex, the movie might have come out better.

Moles kill people.,"I watched this in Hereford recently with wife and 20 year old son. Not a film for teenagers, unless you are trying to tell them what it was like when you were young, so little chance of it being a blockbuster like 'Harry Potter'. Even our 20 year old found it ""strange"". Only thing he really got hold of, having the gift of absolute pitch, was the music score. He latched on to the upbeat music played against a background of very sombre almost eerie sounds – the net curtains,the guy garroted etc. On the surface everything is fine but but come back later.... sort of bland yet evil.'Perfect evil music score', he said.So it really is a film for grown ups. It's so authentic that anyone who was young at that time will remember the clothes and cars etc. Because the film moved so slowly I actually liked the 'action' scenes in Hungary and Turkey the most though the tension in the so-called 'Circus' was good too.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Call it the opposite of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the exact opposite of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. There aren't any stunts and the protagonist acts his age. This is an old school, plausible tale of espionage. I don't even recall the Tom Cruise of this movie running.George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is a recently retired British intelligence expert called back into duty to expose a double agent at the top of MI6. Some of the work has been done for him by his former boss Control (John Hurt). With the field narrowed to five individuals, Smiley gathers information to determine who is giving information to the Russians.The paranoia within the circus is widespread. No two people can trust each other. A simple scene shows Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) entering an elevator within the compound. The camera lingers on him and a sign that stresses the importance of closing the door after use so that others can call the elevator. Of course when Peter exits there is no thought of closing the door. It would have been traditional for a number of characters voice their concerns, so this far craftier conveyance deserves praise. But the story doesn't end there. Subtext overpowers the actual narrative. There are so many moments of termite art that one can lose focus on the spy hunt.Suspense isn't all in the reveal; that's something director Tomas Alfredson can't seem to grasp. In Let the Right One In a vampire is created only to die at the moment of that realization. The payoff: a fiery effects death that removes what could have been a formidable character while adding a scene that has no impact on the story. In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy there is a book full of characters thanks to John le Carré, a few too many for a concise film. Despite wonderful spotlight moments, few thrillers are this boring. Not to say that there's a lack of action—which is true—but any plans of action are kept secret from the audience. What should be a climax is simply a scene leaving the audience with questions. It's anticipation that builds suspense, not the resolve.The film carries the aesthetics of Masterpiece Theatre. It's hard not notice how some scenes are shot with an unacceptable amount of noise, which would have been fine had it been consistent. There's no effort at spectacle whatsoever. Even the sluggish music sounds like it was culled from a bin of discounted tapes. The set decoration and costumes are true to the early '70s , offering the visual appeal for the movie.Gary Oldman is believable and understated. Perfect for the role. I don't want to get into who else does what as spoilers can be easily dropped. Let me say that the cast is effective.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy leaves the viewer with a path to the correct interpretation. It's not the easiest read, but it appears the story is sound.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Have I finally found the best film of 2011? I think so.,"It may not be the flashiest movie of 2011 by any counts, but for my money, I wouldn't be surprised if it remains the BEST.The information and dialogue in this movie is staggering to be totally honest, but the movie's confidant pacing gives the audience time to piece together the narrative puzzles as the movie goes along. The script is pure brilliance, utilizing perfect blends of tension, intrigue, suspense, paranoia, chills, thrills... the list goes on, and the food for thought is incredible. Even after having seen it a few days ago, I still can't get it out of my mind.Tomas Alfredson paces this movie with precision, crafts it with a perfect eye of detail, and hits us with mistrust for on screen images in a way that continues to heighten the suspense factor. The cinematography and editing are pitch perfect, as is the Art-Direction.Most impressive is the cast, quite possibly the best assembled of the year. They're all as integral to the tension as the screenplay is, with sparks flying all around, and any one of them could not be who they say they are. The acting is not all flashy, but lies more within eye movements and vocalization to give a deeper, believable depth. Some of the excellence is owed to that of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Tom Hardy. Standout notice must go to human chameleon Gary Oldman, perfectly embodying George Smiley, and not just with his fine hair and makeup. He excels in this movie with his controlled emotional layers, impeccable timing, and flawless line delivery. Gary, you've done it again!It's also worth noting that Tinker Tailor improves upon multiple viewings, and the result is a film that can be called nothing less than flawless.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Spymaster...,"""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"" is an old-fashioned but solid and well made spy thriller. This is more in the vain of movies like ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", ""The Odessa Files"" etc.I was thinking of any movies I've seen in recent years which would be in the same category and what came to mind was ""The Good Sheppard"" (Robert De Niro's solid directorial effort) and even ""The Constant Gardener"".It boasts an all star cast comprising of such notables as Colin Firth, Toby Jones, John Hurt, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hinds with a singularly brilliant and astonishing performance by Garry Oldman (even those tightwads over at the Oscars seem to agree since they nominated him for a Best Actor award). If there is any justice left in the world...Garry Oldman should hands down win the statuette for Best Actor!For those looking for an action packed flick, this is not it, no James Bond or Salt to be found here. While I enjoy the Bourne movies, this is not it either.

"Tinkers, Tailors, Soldiers, Spies","I don't see how I can review this film without also reviewing the 1979 BBC version of the story. Especially because I prefer the new version.And that is nigh unto heresy, if you know the original. That version starred Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley, and his performance in it is often referred to (and rightly) as one of the pinnacles of his illustrious career. So my preference for this new version should in no way be construed to mean that I prefer Gary Oldman's performance to Alec Guinness' in the same role. That's not the issue. It's that the STORYTELLING of the new version of the film is better than the storytelling of the older version. It's simply a better movie, on almost all counts.The reason for this IMO is that they hired Tomas Alfredson (the Swedish director of ""Let The Right One In"") to helm the making of this movie version, and hired two talented writers (one of whom died during the production) to pen it. And the three of them done good. Real good. With only 127 minutes in which to tell their story, they did a better job than the best BBC directors and writers of their era were able to do with the same story in seven hours.The plot is as classic an example of Cold War Spy Storytelling now as it was when John Le Carré penned it. ""Control"" (head of the British Secret Service, played in this film by John Hurt) learns to his dismay that there may be a mole in the top echelons of the ""Circus."" He sends an operative to Budapest to find out who it is, but that operation turns disastrously and publicly sour, and Control is forced to resign, taking his top aide George Smiley with him. Fast forward a couple of years, and the notion that there is a mole resurfaces. Control has died and the four people he suspected are now in charge of the Circus, so Smiley is brought out of retirement to find out who the mole might be. The twists and turns are exquisite, Smiley personifying a master spy more akin to Bobby Fischer than James Bond. It's been many years since I last read the book, so I can't say for sure, but there is a possibility that this latest retelling of the story may be better than le Carré's original novel.It should be mentioned that Gary Oldman's performance in this film is as understated as many of his past performances have been overstated, and that's a good thing. But the bottom line for me yet again -- a growing trend in TV and television -- is that if you want a classic British story told well, hire a Swede to tell it. Tomas Alfredson even looks like George Smiley.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Complete travesty of a movie,"The only people that will applaud this movie is: movie critics of the all too common variety that thinks that the more boring, meaningless and artyfarty a movie is, the better it is, and fans of the book and/or original screening. Anyone else that does, should seek professional help. Because this is a movie that goes on and on without anything interesting or exiting ever happening. To call this a thriller, is like calling watching a tortoise move having a front row seat to a fast-paced race to the death. Only in the last scene something exiting nearly happens, but the director elects not to show it to us. He must have thought that after over two hours of interminable boredom, the shock of something actually happening would be too much for some and might cause heart attacks. Sometimes the editors make halfhearted attempts to liven things up - by resorting to completely unannounced and utterly confusing jumps in time and space. Gary Oldmans excellent acting skills goes completely to waste, and could easily be replaced by Sylvester Stallone and his infamous lack of emotions.

Guilliam is left by his male partner, to his distress, but to absolutely no plot development. That character was specifically hetero in the original - the change is pointless. Told in flashback, but sometimes the only thing that tells you so is that Smiley has different glasses - they even include a short early scene showing him getting new ones to make the point.

It is actually...,"too short. IF you have read the book and seen the BBC's dramatisation of Le Carre's work then you'll see things that aren't there which added to those tellings of this fabulous story; HOWEVER, this is masterfully acted by Oldman.

Even the voice at times, exactly the same. Absolutely brilliant. The sets, the scenes the attention to detail of the 70s spot on, again, lovingly crafted. The film is paced just as the book / BBC, a slow burning crescendo realising Smiley's quiet genius. I love this film but for me it'S only failing is its fast run, omission of scenes, play, intrigue.

"Intense, Relentless Intrigue","TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carré's novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney. Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve. Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
avoid this movie,"Compared to the BBC version with Sir Alec Guinness, which I strongly advise watching and rate that one a 10, and compared to the book by John LeCarre, another 10, this version is a real stinker.

The BBC version, however, is rich in development, high in tension and sense of loyalty and betrayal all supported by a terrific musical score that enhances but does not get in the way.

"A masterpiece of plot, screenplay and general acting","I admit, along with other people, that if you simply want to be entertained - and nothing else, this probably isn't the film for you. It took me two or three attempts before I fully understood the plot. However, that is exactly what I watch Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy for - to experience the complexities and the scale of the plot itself. If it was not so complicated, then the very idea and point of the film would be defeated. A war of espionage would never be simple and straight forward. A highly intelligent story is combined with a simply marvellous choice of actors. Gary Oldman and John Hurt are outstanding. I dislike the reviews that many people submit - stating that it has completely destroyed the original. It was never designed to be the original in a film context - it was designed to present the story in a new light.Another admirable aspect of this film is the authenticity - that feeling of Britain in the 1970s - having lost an empire - trying to find a place in the world. It has been achieved with great attention to detail. My only problem at all with this film is that maybe some actors could have been ""described"" with greater effect - ie, Mendel. He appears for the majority of the film but the audience never hears any relationship between him and Smiley.In short:-Movie-making: Masterful Visual Effects: None (not necessary)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just wow,"There is a lot of spoilers a review for a film like this can provide but i will try my best not to spoil anything.The plot of this film centers around an intelligent agent trying to find a mole which is high up in the ""circus"" (a fictional MI5 agency). Saying that, the film is way more complex and confusing then the one line synopsis i wrote and has so many layers for us, the audience to explore.I love this film so much i can write a novel praising this film but there is a character limit.Firstly, if you haven't read the book, you are not at any disadvantage for not knowing it in depth like some other books i am not going to name (Harry Potters).First of all, the directing is just amazing and i think is the star of this star studded film. The way we feel like an outsider peeking in to this world of betrayal and deception.The acting is just phenomenal from Gary Oldman who i think was robbed from an Oscar because he inhabited the role and Lt. Gordon or the corrupt cop from Leon disappeared and he has now developed another iconic figure in his legendary career. This has got to be the best British cast in a film and if you are looking at this review... Then you probably know who is in it.Overall, this film is highly recommended and is a fantastic watch, but if you are looking for an action, adrenaline rush. The go to Blockbusters and rent Transformers. If you want a fascinating, brilliantly made film, then give this one a shot.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not one for the masses.,"I know I am in the minority, but I have just come out of seeing this Film, and , not having read the book, I am completely confused as it jumped from scene to scene introducing numerous new characters, who then disappeared and no real explanation of why the things that happen do happen. The acting is excellent, but one feels if this how MI6 operated during the Cold War, it is wonder that more serious events did not occur. The photography is good, even though most of the buildings, inside and out, were drab, dirty and colorless. A number of relationships were hinted at, but not pursued causing more confusion. Gary Oldman was excellent in a demanding role, and he and his assistant, Peter, were the redeeming features in an overlong, dreary and confusing movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good movie where I could not guess the ending...,"I watch many movies, and for the most part movies are fairly predictable. I can usually see the ending coming a mile away. The fact that I can does not detract from enjoying the movie since some movies while being predictable are rather well made.This movie is different. It is made in the classical English style, even thinking this movie was made in the UK. Real UK movies are not North American movies as evidenced by say 4 Lions, or the series Utopia. Real UK acting tends to be slower and works the mind both in laughter and in seriousness. There is also less reliance on effects and props to tide the movie through.Having said all that Tinker Tailor Solider Spy was a good movie. I enjoyed it and was thinking, so who did it, and why. The twists and turns were very nice and made you think quite a bit about what would happen next.This movie is not a Bourne style movie (even though I thoroughly enjoyed those movies). It is closer to something like the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in revealing its plot. Overall I enjoyed the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too demanding movie (for an average viewer),"Through the period of the cold war I was a kid but I do remember it and everybody knew there's something going on ""behind the curtains"". But what? This movie does not explain anything. On the contrary - it shows how entirely absurd the whole thing was. Idelogy? What ideology? They were all the same. People were spying each other, betraying, killing and so on for no real reason (maybe money, but even that is doubtful). All ""affairs"" were just construction, one over the other, and all of them somewhere in the clouds. That's how I perceive this movie and the period described. Requires too much attention and background knowledge. Too much happening in too little time. One barely (if at all) distinguishes who is who in one scene, and here is already another with something totally different. Confusing and boring, yet beautifully photographed. The cast is full of ""stars"" but why? None of them really has a chance to show anything impressive. There are more characters than in local phone book. Everything is sacrificed for the plot, which probably 100 people in the world understand. I'm not amongst them. The only reason I could recommend this film is testing your patience. Sorry, but nothing more than that.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pointless,"I was in Venice last week so saw this film before its general release. I've been inspired to write the review because of the sheer volume of PR the producers are throwing at this movie ahead of its UK release, making out that it the greatest thing since Citizen Cane and a sure-fire Oscar winner.My main feeling at the end of the film was, ""What was the point of that? Why on earth would someone want to remake a 70s spy drama as a carbon copy of countless BBC efforts"". There was no attempt to bring anything new to the genre, no hint that they might be making some comment about the modern world (or even the Cold War world) or telling us something we didn't know. If you are over thirty (and you're the target audience) you have seen this all before. The roles are not exactly taxing for the actors who get to speak in their usual RADA accents and be as stiffly upper-lipped as possible.The plot itself is pretty silly (yes, I know it's based on all the Kim Philby type cases but I'm referring to the specific twists and turns of the storyline) and the pace of the action plodding.It's by no means the worst film ever made, just completely unnecessary and on the whole not entertaining.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tinker, Tailor spins tangled web of intrigue, betrayal and frosty brilliance","In a way, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is one of those movies that's easier to admire than to love. From a technical standpoint, it's pitch-perfect with a top-notch cast of actors who effortlessly burrow into their parts without any of the usual ""look at me!"" theatrics, sets and costumes that meticulously recreate Cold War Europe and subtly elegant cinematography, all blended together with precision by a promising, up-and-coming director. Yet, it's not the type of film that will inspire feelings of warmth or ecstasy from many moviegoers, more likely to leave them wandering out of the theater deep in thought than giddy or excited. In most movies, the stern aloofness that pervades Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy would be a drawback, preventing the audience from connecting with or caring about the characters, but in this case, it works, effectively creating an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust where the viewer is as wary of the characters as they are of each other.Based on the well-respected novel of the same name by former spy John le Carre, Tomas Alfredson's adapation manages to strip down le Carre's book to its bare bones – every scene, line of dialogue and gesture feels absolutely essential to furthering either plot or character, often both – without sacrificing its complexity or nuance. The story is elaborate, though its basic premise can be boiled down to ""there's a mole at the Circus"", code for British intelligence agency MI6, and as condescending as it sounds, it requires the audience to not only pay attention, but to think. At the center of it all is the famed George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman in what is probably the most low-key performance of his career, a stark contrast from the deliciously over-the-top grandiosity he has developed a reputation for over the past three decades. With his large, plastic-framed glasses, nondescript suits and soft-spoken manner, Smiley is reminiscent of an owl: outwardly, he's passive and remarkably still, virtually blending into the background, but there's also an aura of wisdom, the kind that comes with age and world experience, surrounding him; you can sense that he's constantly thinking, observing. Oldman conveys all this perfectly, easily inhabiting a role that should, but likely won't, earn him a long-awaited Oscar nomination. He's accompanied by a stellar supporting cast of some of the best British actors working today, including veterans John Hurt and Colin Firth, rising stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy, the always reliable character actor Toby Jones and Mark Strong, whose role here is the best he's gotten since first appearing on most people's radars in Ridley Scott's decent but otherwise unremarkable Body of Lies.The movie as a whole is a lot like the character of Smiley. On the surface, it's positively serene, but underneath, there's so much going on that it can be hard to keep track of it all as tension quietly builds toward the gripping climax, which features not a shootout or frenetic car chase, but a waiting game. It's a labyrinthine mind puzzle as tightly constructed and methodical as the clocks ticking in the background of several scenes. Making his English-language debut after receiving much acclaim for the vampire coming-of-age movie Let the Right One In, Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson proves himself to be a master of silence, of revealing everything using virtually nothing. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the definition of a slow-burner, but for those willing to be patient and attentive, it offers ample rewards.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A beautiful piece, don't look for a Bourne movie here.....","I went into this movie never have read the book, or looked at the show, or even read what it was about and loved it. I loved the leisure pace it set and how it unfolds. There was no chase scenes, shootouts-and thank god because I find now a lot of movies are under that genre and it's almost too straightforward at times.At the slower pace, I was able to pick up the subtle clues presented, such as the look on the character's face, or the way they're dress (to indicate if it was a flashback or not. The suspense was wonderful that it wasn't a boiling point like some movies, it unfolded as you were reading a book.I would see it again on DVD because-I loved it, and also to pick up on the clues that I did miss.

Disappointingly Dull,"Unfortunately, I disagree with most of the critic's reviews and comments about this, woefully dull, film.I cannot take anything away from the composition of the movie, the direction is very languid but excellent. The look and feel is outstanding ... it's beautifully shot. The acting is very, very good from a stellar cast.The let down in this whole project is the screenplay. Gary Oldman doesn't utter a word for (something like) ten minutes at the beginning of the film, despite being in nearly every scene. It felt rather cringe worthy at points, watching him stare into the middle distance and then sullenly raising an eyebrow; as if this would suffice instead of conversation. It doesn't.I was very disappointed in the general pace and tone of the entire piece, ambling from scene to scene. Never really acceding to anything or making a solid point. I like to be challenged by a film and like to have to muse over the sub-plots but in Tinker, tailor, Soldier Spy, I felt neither challenged nor had to think too hard to realize that all I wanted to do was have a snooze.It's a real shame. As I mentioned above, it really looks the part but needed much more (controlled) pace and punch to the script.Gary Oldman can really stare into space like a pro though ...",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

For Nobel Prize winners only?,"We went as a group, which included two retired academics (one a Professor), an intellectual woman with several publications to her name, and a medical doctor who is also an academic. None of us could make head or tail of this excruciatingly tedious, too-clever-by-half, pointlessly repetitious dog of a movie. The story is set during the 'Cold War', at a time when paranoia and reciprocal distrust was rampant on both sides of the 'Iron Curtain', for unclear reasons (a paradox which is admirably deconstructed in Hobsbawm's 'Age of Extremes'). It revolves around the squalid world of spies and double agents, whose boring lives are occasionally livened by a murder, or attempted murder, or two. In order to create an exotic background, the scene keeps rotating between London, Budapest and Istanbul which, at the time, may have sounded like destinations on other planets, but are now easily reached in a couple of hours on low-budget flights from Western Europe, and therefore fail to impress. The movie's 'hero' is apparently a secret agent called Smiley, who acts and behaves like a catatonic zombie throughout the over- two-hour-long tedium. It transpires that his wife has been unfaithful to him, yet it would be really surprising if she had stuck to such an unappealing, lifeless individual for more than a couple of years. According to reliable sources, there had been a previous incarnation of Smiley, played by Alec Guinness, who was apparently even more of a zombie. The movie is also marred by a series of flashbacks of unclear significance, some of which are repeated ad nauseam, with the result that the little comprehension one might have achieved is dissipated in the general confusion. Why it should be regarded as brilliant to make cryptic movies which perhaps one percent of cinema goers, if that, may appreciate, remains a mystery. Three cheers for Snow-white and the Seven Dwarfs!

Do not expect a James Bond film,"If you expect a bang-up performance of a John le Carre story, you won't be disappointed.

While fictional, the story remains highly credible.But if you are looking for giant explosions, chases in supercars that turn into submarines, and women in bikinis a la Ian Fleming's stories (which I also enjoy), you will likely not appreciate this.It's a cerebral drama, not an action film.

It was hardly confusing--there are 2 story lines which intersect eventually, and flashback scenes which you can tell are flashbacks by watching Smiley's glasses.The slower pace allows you to drank in the seventies London scenery and permits the tension to build immeasurably.

One of the worst films ever.,"To be completely blunt, this film was terrible. The acting was bland and samey through every actor. The plot was bland and boring. The film was unjustifiably long.

I went with my mother and aunt, and according to them, it was more painful than giving birth. And I find that statement easily believable.

"Engrossing, suspenseful","The night I saw ""Tinker,"" four people walked out halfway through it. Another person was heard to say, ""This movie sucks."" So it's not for everyone. But for the right viewer, it is two hours well spent. Each scene is brisk and highly polished. Skillfully assembled, the whole really shines. Perhaps its most effective storytelling device is a series of flashbacks to an office Christmas party. These, largely wordless, fill out the tale. And ""wordless"" is key. Many of the scenes don't have a lot of dialogue, and when people do talk, every word counts. So what this film mainly requires is attention. Without it, you will miss one of the best things about ""Tinker"": Gary Oldman's microscopic performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Smart,good writing, excellent cast","The movie opens brilliantly, and within the first three minutes if not less has your attention. If you started to watch for some background noise, you will be happy that this is a movie that will not allow you to back burner it, it will grab you in the opening.This is a mature film, not put together without intelligence, which is what Hollywood has mostly churned out. It is a suspense movie, which does not have CGI or explosions with every camera frame. Sometimes with suspense movies, the director or producer, or casters, will hire one or two big actors, and you can immediately, within the first half hour (depending on the movie, sometimes sooner) , know already who the 'bad guy' is. With this movie, every other actor is a familiar face and name and the movie will circle around these same actors, so you will not know the guilty party or 'bad guy' till the very end, when they are supposed to be revealed to you.Gary Oldman, really sets the pace in this film rather than the movie setting the pace; in some movies, you know the end is coming or the bad guy will die soon or what not, simply because the movie starts to rush, the music speeds up, the camera frames start flash faster, when the 'timing' is about to peak, but, here, Gary Oldman, sets the pace, the movie almost tries to rush at one particular scene, but when the camera is on Gary, he controls, he moves so purposefully, every word that comes from his mouth feels as though he had been thinking about what he would say and he will not be rushed when he speaks, also, his every motion, he moves with purpose and meaning, everything is calculated.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Briljant adaption of a great novel,"I thought this was a masterpiece and a movie that has been able to capture the mood of that era perfectly.

I do understand that some people found this to be a dull movie, if you are mentally unable to understand the plot you will not like this as it doesn't have big explosions or BS dialog between would be actors. The way Gary Oldmam gave figure to Smiley is on it's own worthy of an Oscar. Colin Firth maybe did not give his strongest performance, due to the limited dialog for his part, but also well played.

Subtle and classy,"A spy thriller by a director who trusts the skill of his actors, the strength of the story, and - not least - the intelligence of the audience. Wow! The acting is subtle but convincing - the performances are so good all around that it's hard to pick a favourite. Alfredsson's storytelling is minimalistic. He doesn't offer contrived scenes with characters explaining the plot at length; this movie requires its audience to pay attention in order to catch the fine detail, which is often only hinted at.The movie seems to move along quite slowly, but the story is actually told at a tremendous pace. I was particularly struck by the absence of gratuitous violence - the few violent scenes are brief, and brutally realistic. In this movie, violence isn't intended to entertain, but to horrify.Add to all that a great photo, and the result can only be top marks - this is a great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tinker Tailor Soldier Snore,"More like ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Snore."" Tomas Alfredson's big screen interpretation of John le Carre's spy novel may have won over many critics, and now the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, but it certainly didn't impress me.I would try to tell you what the film is about, but seriously, I had little idea what I saw until I got home and re-read the plot on Wikipedia...and even then, it wasn't terribly clear. But it is about an ex-Secret Service guy, played by Gary Oldman, who is looking for a mole in the higher ranks of the British Secret Service.Loads of things happen in this film, and I guess it was just done in a way that went so completely over my head, I spent the entire film just barely understanding what I was watching. It was like they condensed an entire season of a television series into a two hour movie, making it virtually impossible to follow. To understand it properly, I would have to watch it again.And believe me, that is not going to happen.The way Anderson directed it is well done in some ways, but with frame after frame of a backdrop so dreary, it makes London look suicide-inducing, the film plugs along without having any redeemable features that will truly grab your interest and keep you entertained. When someone gets shot in the head, you think finally! Some action! And then it sinks back into the greys and far too many words and names to keep track of.I think the only reason why the script got an Oscar nomination was that it may have been the thickest of them all, because it certainly was not written well enough for the average human to keep up with the story and keep one terribly interested. A nomination for the score? Sorry, nothing impressive there either. It was as long and drawn out as the film was.And then there is the Best Actor nomination for Gary Oldman. I would understand it if he were old enough to maybe not get another one, but out of all the performances I have seen this year, this one certainly did not stand out as deserving such a recognition. Yep, there could have easily been a spot there for a more deserving Gosling.Yep, after sitting through this overly complicated bore of a film, not only did my head hurt, but so did my wallet.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is all shrouded in patriotic colors and high ideals of God and country ( strangely how nothing changed since), but in harsh reality it is all about power, control and backstabbing in the lofty corridors of rulers of the realm.

Your new eyeglasses look excellent indeed!,"""Tinker, Tailor"" reflects both a past era in real life and in cinematography/film life. Magnificent photography and an all star British cast manage to bring back to life the - not so long ago - era of the Cold War. When all is said and done the viewer realizes he just bore witness to an evolving spider web, where actions, looks, pauses, even clothing and style speak much more than words. What is said is not only secondary, but some times it is also beside the point... And when ""La mer"", written by Charles Trenet, is heard during the final sequence of the film, everything becomes clear. The sea of oblivion, kind to some, ruthless to most, will crash onto the rocks on the shore and leave behind only an echo in time.

Terrible waste of time,"I should start out by saying that I have a very bad grasp of learning names, and I think that is sorely needed in order to follow this movie.With all the hype preceding this film, I expected something great. I was very much disappointed. For the first half hour or so I was waiting for the movie to get going. Gradually, I realized it never was going to. As others have pointed out, there were scenes where people were apparently supposed to be giving each other deep, meaningful looks. Interestingly, the music clashed with this device.In fact, I would say that the sound track was actually pretty good, and was looking for a good movie to accompany it. I found my mind wandering about such things as whether it would be possible for a sound crew to get awarded on a film that was otherwise a dud rather than paying attention to the film itself. Having said that, even the music seemed to sort of peter out before the end of the movie.I was also bothered by some technical issues. Near the beginning of the film, we are presented with a scene of Budapest. Apparently, the traffic must have been edited, because it bounces up and down relative to the city. No excuse for that, and I found it distracting. I grant that most people probably wouldn't notice it, though.It was all I could do to stay awake.

poorly done remake of a very good series,"The BBC mini series staring Alec Guinness was a truly great program. The acting was well done, the sets were appropriate and the story was well told. This remake wasn't any of those things. Many crucial aspects of the book that were included in the BBC version were left out, probably due to a lack of time. The actor who portrayed George Smiley, Gary Oldman, was not even in the same class of actors as Alec Guinness and was not able to carry the film as did Guinness when there was not much action nor could he display the range of emotion Guinness expressed with very small changes in expression, such as a slightly raised eyebrow in disbelief or the blankness of face when he needed to show no emotion. In the BBC version, you could feel the discomfort of Ricky Tarr as he was quietly interrogated by George Smiley. I would recommend that a person skip this version and go directly to the BBC version which is available on CD. After viewing that, see Smiley's people, the sequel.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic slow-burning future classic,"From its slow, languid, unfussy titles through to its half focused final shot Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is an exercise in classy film making. It possesses perfect period feel and the best cast of the year all delivering a masterclass in film acting.This is a slow burning story, played out predominantly in stuffy, over bright rooms laced with smoke and questionable decor. It is a game played across countries, by arrogant men with questionable morals and poor manners, deciding the fate of men and women in order to get what they all want: Treasure.With MI6 still reeling from the exposure of the Cambridge spies, shut out from the American Intelligence sources and desperate for a win in the game. Control (John Hurt), convinced of a Soviet spy in the intelligence service, is losing respect of his younger division heads. When an operation in Bucharest, known only to the highest echelons of the Service, is disrupted by the Russians, Control's enemies seize their opportunity and force the old man and his confidante, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) out. Now an outsider, Smiley is the perfect person to investigate on behalf of a suspicious bureaucrat (Simon McBurney) who begins to think that there may be something in Control's paranoid theories after all.As so the plot goes, twisting and turning, the pieces slowly coming together in the mind of Gary Oldman's Smiley. A quiet man, not into grandstanding like his contemporaries, instead he quietly and methodically collects information, building up the story. How do we know this? It's written on Oldman's face. Smiley is not a showy role, it demands subtlety from its actor. Oldman is not the first choice, given his scenery chewing roles in Fifth Element or Leon, but he is simply magnificent. In every twitch of his mouth, or long stare into the middle distance, a little something more is revealed about Smiley. What he thinks, what he needs, what he wants. It's all written there on his tired, unsmiling face.This is not a spy story for the Bourne generation, it's closer to a genre thought long dead - the true cold war thriller like The Conversation, though I kept being reminded of The Odessa Steps or Day of the Jackal. Its pacing is perfect throughout, similar to The Wire in it's slow unraveling of a story told through a lot of disparate characters and from a lot of different viewpoints.That's not to say there isn't drama or tension here, it's just a very different sort of drama. The most tense moment involves the theft of some papers from a cupboard. It doesn't sound like much, but it is a gripping sequence, full of fear and paranoia.We've mentioned Oldman, who must be in for an Oscar nomination, but the rest of the cast are all superb, with Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy especially impressive.Huge kudos to the production department for their recreation of early 70's London and all the grimness that entails. From Smiley's glasses (actually sourced by Oldman himself) to the awful Christmas party held by the Circus staff which, as a flashback, anchors much of the plot the detailing is perfect, especially when shot through the roving long lenses of director Tomas Alfredson.For all the sumptuous detail, consummate acting and magnificent pacing, something had to give, and unfortunately the final reveal of the mole is not the sickening gut punch it should have been. ""It was him, of course it was him."" It's a problem with this being a film, there isn't enough time to give all of the characters equal attention, keep that ambiguity going to the end.But this is a very minor quibble in two plus hours of sumptuous high quality mature entertainment. Perhaps my face resembled that of Smiley's at the end, as the montage of the winners and losers flows by, as he's finished putting the case to bed, as the betrayed come to terms with their situation. Smiley's plain features show the faintest ghost of satisfaction, of a man pleased with his work, and of a game well played.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Tense story in brown rooms,"The critics were certainly correct about the tense atmosphere and the rather morose feeling engendered by the drab, brown, smoke-filled rooms that feature so much in this film. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy evoked the atmosphere of my youth to a degree, probably more so than the TV adaptation. It is apparently set in the 1970s although I took the drab colours as being more indicative of the 50s.The acting is uniformly good from a stellar cast and the story gradually unfolds with the director maintaining a felling of tension throughout. It is a good yarn well told.However, there were a few things that I did find a little bit disappointing:The dull brown settings which were so interesting to start with, became rather tedious after a while. I am, not convinced that everything was brown in the 70s.After over 2 hours, I really did not feel that I knew any of the main characters (even Smiley) other than at a very superficial level.-The frequent use of flashbacks was rather disorientating and I am not convinced that some of them added anything to the storytelling.I was initially worried about seeing Gary Oldman in the George Smiley role, so brilliantly portrayed by Sir Alec Guiness in the TV series. It turned out that Oldman was well up to the task and made a very credible Smiley. Was it as good as the TV series? Possibly not, but then the TV series had the advantage of having 3 times as long to develop the themes and characters. But it was a creditable effort.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Complex, atmospheric, intriguing, somber","In seventies England, the Circus, the nickname for the British Intelligence Agency, has taken a hit. In Hungary, a top official was to give some important information to the Limies. But, something went wrong and folks ended up dead. Therefore, the leader, Control (John Hurt) is asked to step down and so is his right hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman). However, it becomes apparent that they were wrongly blamed for another government official suspects a ""mole"", a double agent. On the sly, this man comes to the retired Smiley and asks him to re-enter the Curcus quietly, to seek out this traitor. At first, Smiley is very reluctant, for his dismissal stung. Yet, he agrees to do it. Traveling from Hungary to Russia to other venues closer to home, Smiley learns how to untangle a very elaborate web of deceit. Along the way, George hears of lovely Russian ladies who risked their lives to help, logs that have pages ripped out, and former spies hiding in plain sight as school teachers. Can he do so before other lives are lost? This film is a quietly impressive work but, it is so complex that one would need to view it multiple times. The cast is a large asset, with Oldman leading the way indeed. Colin Firth, Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran hinds, and many others give great performances, too. Also, the movie has an atmospheric quality that has to been seen to be appreciated. It re-creates the seventies well and shows that most agents try to stay as ""invisible"" in their jobs to the point of blandness until a crisis occurs. Yes, there are various settings, too, but sometimes these are not the best the countries featured have to offer. Most importantly, the story is worthy of much praise, in its twists, turns, and revelations. An ending scene, where an agent is gunned down silently, is most sensational. One must honor the director, too, for taking a difficult book and bringing it to life. All in all, here is a film for those who aren't afraid to watch a tale that has hidden depths.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A superb screen adaptation of a classic Cold War spy novel,"This is one of those occasions when, having read some professional reviews of the film before seeing it (something I usually try to avoid doing), I am happy to report that my high expectations have been more than matched. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is an excellent, almost faultless film.The basic plot is as follows. George Smiley (Gary Oldman) reluctantly agrees to suspend his enforced retirement from the British Secret Intelligence Service to investigate the impact of an earlier botched exercise in Soviet-controlled Budapest. That incident had brought about his departure from the ""Circus"", the top echelon of the Service to which he had belonged, and that of its Control (John Hurt). The failed exercise had resulted in the capture and torture of one of the Circus's agents, who had been sent to Budapest to obtain information about the identity of a Russian mole who was believed to have infiltrated the highest sphere of the British Secret Service. The powers that be consider Smiley to be best placed to undertake such an investigation because Control has since died. Smiley's investigation necessitates his spying on his former colleagues at the Circus, one of whom is believed to be the mole in question.Perhaps not surprisingly, given that this is a film about Cold War espionage, there is much more to what is a very complex plot than that brief description suggests. Indeed, just about the only reservation about the film that I have is that its plot is so labyrinthine in nature that it requires one's total attention at all times. I found I had to rewind the DVD on two occasions to check that I had understood a plot development correctly and to ensure that I hadn't missed something crucial. (That luxury is not, of course, an option if one is watching the film in a cinema!) ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is brilliantly acted by all involved (the cast is made up of a stellar array of British actors) and expertly directed. It is beautifully shot and lit and atmospherically evokes what I imagine to be the shady, secretive and seedy world of spying. I have not read the novel on which the film is based - although I am now keen to do so - but I assume that it cannot have been an easy task to capture its rationale and its complexities as successfully and as reasonably accessibly as this film seems to do. So, great credit must also go the writers of the screenplay. The original music, by Alberto Iglesias (any relation to Julio, I wonder?), is also top-notch.""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is intelligent, thought-provoking and rivetingly entertaining. Indeed, it is one of the best films I have seen for a very long time. A must-see. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A complete and disastrous failure,"Being John Le Carre's (and this particular novel's) faithful fan for so many years, - I've been impatiently waiting for this film to appear, and even contemplating pre-order of the BluRay version scheduled to hit the shelves on January the 30th. In my impatience I could've never imagined the 2011 version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" would appear to be such a disastrous failure... Most surprising has been Mr.John Le Carre's having actually participated in adaptation of the novel for screen : my first impression was the creators of the 2011 version have never read the book properly. I could imagine ""squeezing"" the novel to 2 hrs of screen-time was not an easy task, but quite a number of changes done to the plot seem completely out of place and utterly unjustified. Garry Oldman is an excellent actor, but who on earth told Mr.Alfredson this actor could actually do George Smiley? Same goes for most of the other characters : except for Control, Bill Haydon, Peter Guillaume and, probably, Connie Sachs and Rikki Tarr (sorry, have omitted little Bill Roach), - they all seem to have nothing to do with Mr.Le Carre's personages. Gone are all the subtleties of the novel, so wonderfully depicted by the BBC TV series of the '70s with great Alec Guinnes (who WAS George Smiley indeed), gone is the whole magic of Mr.Le Carre's epic spy novel. While one could probably applaud the ""Circus atmosphere"" as created by Mr.Alfredson and his Art- and Photography Directors, - using the Connie Sachs' language (which I don't recall from the book), after leaving the theater one cannot but feel ""seriously under-f..ked""...",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"counter, counter, counter espionage at its finest","I've always been a fan of John le Carre's novels. I was thrilled to here that one of my favourite novels had been made into a movie, but until this week it didn't look like I was going to be able to get a chance to see it on the big screen.John le Carre's novels are an intimate look at the day to day work of a spy during the cold war era. Not James Bond, who all the villains know, but real spys. This has no absurd escapes like one would see in the Bourne Identity and no major shot outs like the A team. Its not an action film, its a spy story.The basis of the story is that control believed that there was a mole in the British secret service and wanted to find out who it was. The speculation was that some one in a position of power in the circus was a soviet agent. The phrase trust no one really is apt in this film. George Smiley, a character who never seems to smile, is asked to come out of retirement and spy on his colleague in order to figure out who is the enemy spy hiding in the British secret service.Its not an easy film to watch. The film has a grainy quality that gives it the look of a film from the 70's. The flash backs can get confusing and George Smiley spends a lot of time just thinking.From what what I recall, the book is not an easy book to follow either. But once you are immersed in this world of paranoia and betrayal and intrigue, its very enjoyable. My 12 year old son also enjoyed it. If you like films about intrigue and puzzles, this is the film for you I truly wish they would make more films like this.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Film That Comes from the Cold,"A few weeks after coming to Israel as a new immigrant in 1984 I started to borrow books from the public library in Lod. The first book that I ever read after becoming a free man was John Le Carre's 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Obviously the sophisticated world of Cold War espionage viewed from the perspective of the West was not the kind of theme that would allow books to be published in Communist Romania. I fell under spell from the first pages, and this was the beginning of a log term relationship of adulation and frequent reader mileage between me and Le Carre.I missed the very well made (as I hear) BBC series, so the film directed by Tomas Alfredson is the first screen version of the novel that I see. The principal lines of action and the relations between the characters are well kept here, and for most of the duration of the film the deep feeling of incertitude, the Britishness of feelings well concealed under manners, the foggy fights were the concepts of good and bad need to be found deep inside the hearts and minds of the characters receive appropriate translation in the language of cinema. The interior flow of Le Carre prose gets an equivalent in a series of short scenes, some happening in the present, other being flashbacks that get a pace and fluidity of themselves that make of the film a captivating thriller despite the lack of real action scenes. The Byzantine relations between the members of the secret services are translated into dances of characters that move and look to each other, or avoid one another like in sacred rituals. The Cold War atmosphere is put on screen using 70s-like effects, all blurred in smoke of cigarette, fog and frost.Some nuances get lost, and this is probably inevitable. Some characters get new dimensions or different perspectives. The sentimental aspect of the story (the relation between Smiley and his wife) is told, but loses in the context of the film the emotional importance it has in the book. On the other hand Gary Oldman builds a Smiley perfectly fit for the screen translation of Le Carre's intention. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is one of the best adaptations of a novel by Le Carre that I have seen to date.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fantastic, cerebral, but certainly not for everyone.","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a good reminder that the age of the spy thriller is not yet gone. In this movie, based on a fantastic book, we take a peek into early 1970s British intelligence, and come out the other side both flabbergasted and awed.This is a decidedly cerebral movie, and as such its rating here on IMDb is perhaps a little misleading - it is certainly not a movie that just anyone can sit down and watch. It's slow, deliberate, and requires you to be concentrated pretty much all the way through if you're going to understand what the heck is going on - and to feel satisfied at the end. But aficionados, as well as anyone who isn't afraid of a film where the most ""action"" is probably a few punches to the gut or a man being shot in broad daylight, will not only enjoy but revel in this film.If you're looking for an action-packed Hollywood spy story, this isn't it. It isn't Tom Clancy, it's John Le Carre, and the difference is immense. Like ""Russia House"", this is a movie that aims to stimulate your brain, and to give you a tiny glimpse of how dark and cold the Cold War really was for those who experienced it first-hand.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Prideaux is sent to - Budapest. Control takes all his documents home to his flat - where they are still lying around weeks after his death! I'm sorry, but this was a terrible film. How on earth they ever thought they'd come even close to the BBC series, I don't know. The characters are quite unsophisticated and the plot has been lost.

"Fantastic cast but awful script, screenplay and directing","Overall, I had the impression that plot had given way to a poor (and clichéd) attempt at an 'art' film in which sadly it also failed miserably. Let me state I was not expecting an action spy movie. I was expecting a more real, perhaps even plodding film where slowly Smiley works out who is the mole within 'the Circus'. Sadly we had a film littered with redundant (and pretty meaningless) scenes; at times it jumped around and it certainly over used flashbacks - some are important and some could have added so much more to developing/understanding the characters but somehow they failed; overall it was shot in a gloomy and dull way and in addition the film (and possibly sound) quality was poor - I had thought that perhaps the cinema were using a bad copy or had a projector issue but having read similar comments from other reviewers I begin to wonder. My suspicion is that all these devices were attempts at conveying the gloomy, boring, seedy, mysterious world of spying in the 1970s. To a point that may be fine but instead (and laboriously) they took over the film. With its superb cast and intriguing story this film could have been great. But one gained little insight about the characters who thus ended up one dimensional. And the story got lost. I do not know if I fell asleep at times and missed vital clues but it seemed as though important points (eg how did Smiley find Prideaux?) were skipped over as was most of the real painstaking work (showing someone rubbing their eyes after reading documents all night is simply not adequate). The only decent performance was by Benedict Cumberbatch as Guillam. The rest were stifled I suspect by a poor script and poorer directing. In conclusion what should have been an intriguing film where the mystery is 'who is the mole' simply left one thinking it was a mystery as to why they had bothered making the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An espionage film that is gripping for sure, but might not work for everyone.","An espionage film that is gripping for sure, but might not work for everyone.Now, here is an espionage (spying) film that is based on the cold war spies of 1970's. Based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carre, this film has a great screenplay that I must say is great as a screenplay but it's very technical at the same time. This film begins with mole in the circus, now what is mole and what is circus here, to get that itself, I had to sit through the whole film and well, it was not such a pleasant revelation either.Well, in this very film we have actors such as Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and the Sherlock guy Benedict Cumberbatch along with Gary Oldman at the helm. So we have got the best ensemble cast in recent years for a movie. About their performances, everyone does it with such rare understanding of their roles that even I as audience was astonished as to how was that emotion conveyed, when we have not known much of him yet.The production design is awesome and so is the art direction, above all I liked the background music and the sound design, wow kudos to those guys, and cinematography was right in every place as the scenes are well composed. The performances keep you glued, the direction is great and the whole look is great I must say. Yet, there is something that is missing, there is something that is just not right, I can attribute that to editing as I do for other movies, but for this I can't say even that coz all those details are absolutely necessary to conclude the story. So the missing element is the story in itself, it's a story that's specific to an age, to an incident and it's not very universal either, Despite that, it's an intense brain exercise that may even make you watch multiple times just to understand it.There is very little action, rather mostly words and dialogues that are tough to decipher. For me, I had no knowledge of such spies and this story and it came as a bouncer in the first viewing, I took the help of few links and then a second watch made me admire this. So for all the guys who are interested in the cold blooded, spy films this may be it, for others, they may of may not like it. This is a test for patience and fizzles out soon if one is not aware or admiring such stories. But if you know or even have a faint ide of what this film is about, you may fall in love with it. Now, thanks to wikipedia that helped me learn a good deal about this movie.So, I can appreciate this movie yet I may not just recommend for everyone. So, a 4/5 for a good movie that's great in it's own way but needed a prologue and epilogue to help a layman understand.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent evocation of the cold war,"An intelligent film for an intelligent audience which captured the era beautifully. Writing, directing, design, cinematography and acting were all first rate. I had wondered how the book and the TV series could be cut down to two hours while keeping the slow burn pace and sense of intrigue. It managed it very well. I will enjoy watching this film again in the future as well as enjoying the BBC serialisation and reading the book again. Perhaps it helps to have been alive in the UK in the 50s and 60s and to have been aware of the politics of the time which saw the exposure of Philby, Burgess and Maclean. While I thoroughly enjoyed it I can understand completely that others might find it boring. It is slow moving and it's not always clear what's going on - criticisms that were levelled at the BBC version at the time it was made. But I have enjoyed them both very much.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beyond James Bond...a Harsh Look at the REAL World of Spies...,"Expect none of the mind-numbing action of The Bourne Ultimatum, the exotic locales of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, or the suavity, wit and charm of James Bond, Her Majesties' most renowned fictional secret agent. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', adapted from John Le Carre's novel of the same name, offers a far more realistic and cynical look at the world of spies and international intrigue.The setting is London in the mid-1970's, in the midst of the Cold War. Retired spymaster George Smiley is called back into service for a crucial assignment-to identify the Soviet mole buried deep in the highest echelons of the British Intelligence organization known as the 'Circus'. What follows is two hours of spellbinding intrigue as Smiley uncovers layer after layer of omission and deception. Covert operations across the Iron Curtain, bureaucratic infighting and power struggles, and even infidelities and indiscretions are all but a few of the elements of this, one of Le Carre's most intricate plots.While the film is a very good adaptation of the novel, its treatment of the plot is overly complicated at times, and therefore, it may be on such occasions be mildly incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read the novel. Where the film really stands out though, is in the performances of the actors. Gary Oldman delivers a masterful performance as George Smiley. Though Oldman's Smiley is far more dapper than the character described in the novel, he is still the 'anti-James Bond' in every sense - mild-mannered, soft-spoken, middle-aged and bespectacled, above all a thinking man rather than a man of violence. Tom Hardy and Mark Strong likewise deliver solid performances as field agents Ricky Tarr and Jim Prideux; the former being closest approximation this film offers to the glamorous, womanizing secret agent of the James Bond mold, and the latter being the very portrait of a burnt out and betrayed spy. Colin Firth also delivers a powerful performance as high-ranking Circus agent Bill Haydon. The creation of atmosphere is another one of the film's great assets-where the world of James Bond is defined by exotic locales, night clubs and casinos, prolonged chase sequences and fight scenes...Smiley's world is comprised of suffocating board rooms, secret archives, English country houses and even a school playground.'Tinker Tailor...' is first and foremost a cerebral film; and certainly not your destination for cinematic thrills. But it is undoubtedly an intellectual 'treat' to watch nonetheless...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I think this is the most boring spy flick I've ever watched. You really have to pay attention to appreciate the intricacies and twists in this film, and I really had trouble staying engaged. I actually fell asleep twice and had to restart from the last boring scene that I remembered. By the end, I didn't care who the mole was.﻿ Maybe this is yet another case in which the novel was much better.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This was the first struggle. It was also impossible to figure out or follow the attempt at a plot. The word ""mole"" was said about a hundred times but this person didn't even seem to matter.

I liked this.  A lot.  But I wish I could have outright loved it.,"The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this passive. But this man is very actively passive. He may not move physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc.And the film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige and brown mazes.But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are (intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into the emotional or unshakably memorable either.I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker, Tailor"" has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation. Paradoxically, by not having to rush through a story this dense, there was room to really feel and experience it, instead of just working to keep up with it and take it in.But all that said, this is a refreshingly smart, adult, well-made and challenging film in a world with far too few.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unfortunately tepid and listless adaptation,"If you're expecting insurmountable intrigue from this adaptation of the John Le Carre novel, you might be in for some disappointment. The mood is well set, the scenes are well shot, and the thespians are at the top of their games, but the plot plods, so much so that you wind up not really caring who the bad guy turns out to be. Or, if you do care, you find that you yourself had narrowed it down to Him or The Other Guy about an hour earlier than George Smiley.Smiley (Gary Oldman) is a recent retiree of The Circus, the nickname for Britain's intelligence operations. More accurately, Smiley was forced out, along with the operations' leader, Control (John Hurt) when a mission in Hungary went horribly wrong. But now Britain suspects that a mole has infiltrated The Circus - and it's residing at the top of the metaphorical food chain. Smiley is brought in on the down-low to find out who the mole is and what he's up to.If it seems like a standard spy film, that's because it really is. Except that in this case, Control has figured out that one of five men - the tippy-top of The Circus - is the mole. Already, then, our list of suspects is narrow.Because of this, you might expect the movie to include plenty of distracting action, perhaps some crazy chase scenes, people dangling off landmarks, that sort of thing. But it's not to be. Instead, we get a somewhat painful slog through Smiley's endless detective work. There's hardly any action at all; there's a lot of thinking, which is logical given the chess-like nature of the spy business, but it doesn't often make for good cinema. In fact, there are long stretches where Smiley hardly utters a word, even in voice-over. This makes things a little tougher to follow, and I found myself overthinking the plot. The story turns out to be a lot simpler - and more simplistic - than I'd imagined.The novel was adapted into a BBC miniseries in 1979. I have not seen this miniseries, which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley, but I have to imagine that because it was shown in seven parts, more time was devoted to fleshing out the characters and their motivations. It's a little easier to provide subtle details in a longer format, after all, and this big-screen version skimps on the subtleties and leaves us with dull, somnolent machinations, some of which are obvious red herrings.Oldman, of course, makes a great George Smiley, and it's interesting how much he looks like a younger John Hurt, who here plays his superior. I don't think of Oldman as, pardon the pun, an old man, and he is only 52 years old. But he adapts a quaint, stooped mannerism to Smiley that evokes a man who's always thinking two steps ahead of his opponents.But it's not enough, not even with the capable supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. There's just not a lot to figure out, and when it's figured out, it's too tidy - especially the ending, which is so obvious that it can be view from outer space, as the saying goes. Side note, though: this version contains quite a bit more blood than you'd expect (even with so little action); the level of gore in those scenes approaches the overall tone of, say, Seven. So be warned - this ain't for the kiddies.Overall, the adaptation is a bit of a disappointment, given the source and the talent. It manages to take a spy thriller and remove the thriller part. Less thrilling doesn't taste great.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Exquisitely directed, beautifully executed with an all star cast. Genius","Gary Oldman has recently become a fascination of mine, the character of George Smiley is one of the finest pieces of acting I have seen. Oldman plays the reserved spy perfectly, to add another dimension of mystery to the sophisticated yet thrilling master recreation of Le Carre's novel.Along side an all star cast, Oldman captures the drama and the panic of 1970's cold war Britain perfectly. Oldman always looks in control of his character, allowing him to work perfectly in harmony with Firth and Hardy to create a British masterpiece.It is hard to put into words how the film has effected my outlook on Oldman. Having not seen much of his works until seeing this film, I am now transformed into a huge Oldman fan as I can appreciate his genius in the character and the man himself, who makes one feel like they are watching the real George Smiley himself, and not just Oldman acting in the mannerisms described by Le Carre.No film is completed by one character. Hardy plays the troubled spy brilliantly to unveil more of the plot to the reader. Hardy and Oldman work brilliantly together in the scene in his home to demonstrate to the viewer the tension of the situation with Moscow. Colin Firth is also a credit to British cinema with his acting in the film. Ever impressive, he captures the role perfectly and with the other characters in the circus keeps the viewer guessing until the end.There are several highlights of the film, one being the film in its entirety, however Oldman's monologue/Shakespearian style soliloquy, where he stares into the camera to replay a conversation he had with the mysterious 'Karla' has to be one of the finest bits of acting I have seen to date, which is almost worthy of an award in itself.Worth the watch 100%,and having seen it twice myself, worth a second watch more-so than watching first time, especially if one comes out scratching their head after a first viewing.Guaranteed awards, guaranteed enjoyment. 100% attention is required throughout, so watch after a good night's sleep!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Thriller for the intelligent mind,"I guess its safe to say that, we have somewhat lost a sense of reality after years of being fed by flashy, unreal, over the top spy/ counter-intelligence movies -- that when something so cerebral and real like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy comes along, a lot of people find it hard to comprehend or just plain understand.For others, I say this is a gem of a movie.Serene, cerebral, high on technical brilliance, high on a wonderful script--filled with subtle peeks into the character's make-up as a person and the thrilling story in itself.It helps that the movie has employed some of the best British talents in Firth, Strong, Hurt, Oldman, Hinds etc.There is a sense of assured authority in their acting and almost everyone does their parts brilliantly.Personally I was pleased to see Hardy and Cumberbatch. Especially the later, me being a Sherlock fan.This movie asks you to think.Think not just about who will be that eventual mole, but why and how he did it.And whether the whole concept was as simple as that.The movie requires your undiluted attention and concentration.It might move at a slow pace, for some, but if you make the effort you will be rewarded.One of the best movies to come out for a long time and Oldman can be proud with his interpretation of Smiley which is almost as good as Alec Guinness's.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Utterly absorbing and entirely classy.,"Gary Oldman delivers the most masterful performance of his career in 2012's first five star film. With a body of work that has centred around loud, extroverted and often vicious characters – Sid and Nancy, The Firm, State of Grace, True Romance, Leon the Professional, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – Oldman goes against type with his portrayal of old-school spy George Smiley; he's all subtle looks and measured body language, barely raising his voice and getting a hair out of place. Although undeniably his show, Oldman is not alone; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds and John Hurt round out the cast to die for, each and every one of them filling their roles with intrigue and complexity. Behind the camera, Swede Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) brings his meticulous eye for detail and slow-burning shooting style to the proceedings, lending this espionage tale immense gravitas. To cap it all off, and ensure the movie's place in the highest echelon of cinema, the score by Alberto Iglesias is fantastically atmospheric and the soft-lensed cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is outstanding. Tinker Tailor is utterly absorbing and entirely classy – for those who enjoy intelligent thrillers it's near-on perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"absolutely excellent, wish I could live inside this time and setting for ever","Really an excellent film, especially if you grew up in the 70s or 80, or perhaps lived through them, every detail places that film in the period and its pace and feel exudes delicious realism that is so far from the crowd of 'hollywood supermarket' type film- making, set, setting, coupled with some good actors, performances with intriguing and modern cinematography and editing. very nice film, if a little depressing on leaving the cinema at what France and Germany has done to europe today. Actually I have watched it several times as the style is so different one misses the odd bit of dialog or a momentary glance or look in the eyes which actually builds a myriad of little pieces which joins up to make the film a whole. In fact the seemingly straight forward twist in the plot actually takes hold at various points in the film, so it is easy to not understand it completely, begging a second, or fifth, viewing; snaking around ideas of double and triple agents whilst reminding us of the deeper Britain.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Incoherent Plot, Ugly Production Design, Sluggish Pace -- Three Strikes and You're Out","Egads, what a terrible movie!Fifteen minutes in, I was lost, and never again found my way. The basic plot involves the efforts of the British intelligence trying to root out a Russian spy in their midst, but this film is so preposterously hard to follow, not to mention glacially paced, that I found myself gazing at the decor for nearly the entire running time. Unfortunately, since the film is set in the drab Soviet world of the 1970s, the decor is mostly brown, gray and murky, much like the cinematography.I can't even tell you whether Gary Oldman, who received an Oscar nomination for his performance, is any good, not to mention any of the other recognizable actors (Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, John Hurt) who make up the rest of the cast. To know whether or not an actor is doing a good job, you have to understand the character he is playing and where that character fits in with the other characters and the general plot. This movie is like watching a bunch of random scenes strung together with no relation to one another.Here's a tip: if you're going to make a completely plot-driven movie, you better damn well make sure that plot can be followed by someone who hasn't read the book first.Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"We waited a long time to see this movie and were sorely disappointed. It drags on and on and there is little character development of the protagonist, the starring introverted Mr. Smiley. I would skip it.As spy stories go, this one was the slowest, dullest. Even the scenes meant to evoke tension broke down because of a lack of cohesion in the movie. The film flips back and forth without really connecting the earlier events to the later events. There is even a screw-up where a character is shown in a chronologically earlier time in the movie that would not have been possible. The portrayal of the office of British Intelligence was anything but, it was more akin to a shipping business or perhaps a retail chain of sometype. There are some actors, when the story line is interesting, who can command a acene with a look or facial expression: Steve McQueen, Alec Guiness, Clint Eastwood to name a few. Mr. Smiley's character can't pull that off.",,Anonymous,Mystery
You should definitely give it a view,"Great cast, nice cinematography and a fascinating plot.'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is very much a slow burn but it's worth it at the end, even if I wouldn't describe the premise as unpredictable - it isn't predictable per se, I just can't say I was majorly surprised at what occurs that's all.It's not as complicated as the film suggests I feel, that's not a criticism but I'm just saying if I wrote down what I thought was going to happen at the start and checked it at the end, I'd be mostly right - at least with an outline. That's not me being big headed, I just feel it throws a lot of false curve balls to go around the houses a tad. The only part, to be honest, I didn't fully get while watching was the Polyakov bits.All the cast give excellent performances, with Gary Oldman (Smiley) and Colin Firth (Haydon) standing out most. You've also got Tom Hardy (Tarr), Mark Strong (Prideaux), Benedict Cumberbatch (Guillam), Stephen Graham (Westerby) and Toby Jones (Alleline) all there too.

Complete disappointment,"The film is EXTREMELY slow, with a single very short action scene. It is difficult to express how underwhelmed me and my party were with this film. Both in pace and in storyline, the film is lacking. Perhaps most disappointing was that both reviewer and viewers ranked it highly. The only possible explanations are either that all of these people read the book,or, that there is some type of strange conspiracy going on here. During the film I left the theater to buy popcorn and was longing for an exciting film. My friend went to see this film and witnessed several people leave during the movie.

Great Cast. Dull Film.,"Call me unappreciative of greatness. Call me simple minded. Call me whatever...I just don't know what all the hype is about.I'd thoroughly enjoyed ""The Night Manger"" and ""Our Kind of Traitor"", both of which whet my appetite for more Jean Le Carre suspense, intrigue and action, so I paid to rent this from Amazon one evening, based on the fact that at least one website rates it the best of all the Le Carre based films. I made a big mistake.Fell asleep multiple times trying to stay with the impossibly complicated and slow moving plot, which is replete with needless flashbacks, and a seemingly endless stream of new and poorly developed characters.All of this stretched my tired and confused brain, and I simply could not connect to the ever so elusive suspense others appear to have found here. Had to go to bed.Picked it up again the next day, but alas the monotony continued, and the drab, dull color palette made my boredom complete. Fell asleep in broad daylight.

Tinker Tailor,"'Lingering close-up shots of seemingly insignificant objects and shallow focus shots constantly evoke the nature of mystery and intrigue which surrounds such clandestine organisations'... said by another reviewer with absolute truth.I cannot agree that this was a stunning film and I would really have liked to as I was looking forward to it. The atmosphere of seedy grey rooms and streets, suitable to the genre and era, was perfectly realised. What it lacked and caused its downfall was the absence of passion. Each character has a different passion and the film entirely failed to show this; the bond between Prideaux and Hayden was barely even hinted at. Smiley's Anne was a shadowy figure with nothing to explain the emotions and betrayal surrounding her which are key themes of the story.As I was watching all I could think was that, despite good performances from Strong, Cumberbatch, Hurt and Hardy, the TV series was so much better. Oldman is without doubt a talented and chameleon actor who, perhaps due to the director, delivered an Alec Guinness impersonation instead of making the role his own. Colin Firth was bland, uncharismatic and miscast. All in all, despite a stellar cast list and story, this film misses by a mile and I'll be buying the Alec Guiness DVD.Tomas Alfredson has a lot to learn.",,Anonymous,Mystery

For instance, the opening scene in the book isn't shown till about 20-25 min into the movie. Also, there are minor changes in the dialog.Of course I wish they would have given more character development to the other characters, other than that I have no complaints.

"Powerful and thought provoking, yet scary","Let's get one thing clear right from the start- This is neither a James Bond movie nor a Jason Bourne movie. There are no fancy cars or high-tech gadgets, no cheesy introductions or unstirred martinis. In essence, this is a true espionage thriller and feels very authentic right from the plot down to very minute details.Adapted from the book by John le Carré, a fictional novel that spawned a seven part mini-series in 1979, this 2011 theatrical release chronicles the hunt for a Soviet mole within the highest ranks of MI6, a division of British Intelligence. Set during the cold-war era, the head of the British Secret Service, Control (John Hurt), sends agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to Budapest to buy information on a sleeper agent implanted in MI6 by the KGB (Russian Intelligence). The mission is a disaster and repercussions forces Control into retirement. When allegations of the existence of a mole persist, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is brought back from retirement. Smiley has always been suspicious of standing chief Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) peddling bogus Soviet intelligence files to the Americans in exchange for important US intelligence; or project 'Witchcraft' as it is called. Now onboard with three high ranking agents, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), Smiley can trust no one and must follow the trail when he learns that Witchcraft is also being sold to a Soviet diplomat.Watching this movie, cinema goers will be split into two very distinct groups ― one section of the audience will love this movie in its entirety. The other will see the movie in bits and pieces of a fragmented plot, and may walk away before the story begins to unfold. Yes, the story here is complex and may require a second viewing for some. However, watching it unfold is a reward in itself. With a little attention to detail (and there is a lot of detail), a vast majority of the audience should have no difficulty in following its narration.This is the first English film by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson but one that is soon to be his golden ticket into mainstream Hollywood. There are so many ways in which this film excels that I don't know where to begin. What I find most compelling is for a dialogue dependent movie, there are very few scenes of character interaction that are extensive in verbal exchange. All other scenes with dialogue are short and sweet while giving away vital information in bits and pieces. This brings me to Alfredson's best moments in the film ― the use of silence. You learn more about what's happening when characters don't speak; their eyes do a lot of the talking as does their body language. These scenes are so perfect that you can almost read their thoughts or hear the phantom conversation between two intentionally mute characters or tells you something is about to happen without anyone actually saying anything. Another technical aspect is the camera work, which I find an uncanny aid to the plot. There is a lot of zooming and panning, and stationary close-ups of certain objects like the still of a drop of sweat when everyone is wearing warm clothing. It is scenes like these that put you in perspective of what it must be like to be a spy ― to put your finger on something odd, to trust your instinct and sometimes why it is important to trust no one. Characterization is another area of excellence with solid portrayals from everyone. Oldman does not have many lines in the movie but his eyes do a lot of the talking. From judging and probing to emotions of fear and sadness, he conveys a lot without actually saying anything at all. Except for Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", Oldman has hardly ever played a leading role; neither has he ever been nominated for an Oscar. If seeing is believing, then I think he has a good chance for at least a nomination, come Oscar season 2012. Supporting roles are also flawless from a huge lineup including John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and of course Colin Firth― 2011 Oscar winner for Best Actor.I have not read any of John le Carré's novels, but in comparison to Ian Fleming's super spy, Alfredson's rendition of Le Carré's world is very convincing. I always assumed that a spy would have to be a lonely person living a desolate life. This is so true in the movie with many characters looking over their shoulder while living in vast emptiness. Even so, it brings to light that these individuals have chosen to give up a 'normal' way of life so that you and I don't have to.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Realistic espionage thriller,"I believe the relative underrating (average 7.1) is owing to the complexity of the plot and lack of gratuitous action. Looking at some of the reviews, it is clear how many people are indoctrinated by the usual vacuous action films that occupy the mainstream of this genre.Those with a brain will rate this higher! The cast is top tier, the plot realistic to the max - clearly inspired by the uncovering of real traitors that took place around this time. The music is moody, atmospheric, appropriate and delicious. It may seem tortuous to the average viewer, but that is the price of realism. And if realism is what you crave then there could be no other way to make this film.The cold war was certainly the most intriguing in espionage history and this must be the best rendition of that period.Although Gary Oldman and Colin Firth take the top billing, there are also excellent performances from others, including John Hurt and Benedict Cumberbatch.A unique achievement!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Beautifully Dull.,"To anyone who hasn't seen this: The spoiler in my review is extremely minimal and doesn't really concern you since you should really, really not watch this movie.Ladies and gentlemen, the point I will set out to make with this review is quite simple: style does not make up for substance. Or in this case, a lack thereof.To put it simply, this is easily the most boring film I have ever sat through. That may seem like a generalization and probably even a bit immature, but I am sorry to say it is entirely true, and if you subject yourself to it I am sure you will agree (that or pretentiously tout it as a masterpiece). The actual film itself is beautiful--the direction and cinematography are top-notch, and the costumes and scenery really set the stage for an intriguing look inside the world of international espionage.But the rest of the film does not deliver.Now, before I go on, I should mention a few things. I am not a critic. I am a huge fan of movies and I am not cynical about them; I went into the theatre expecting a good time. I like Gary Oldman and I was genuinely excited to see this movie, but I was sadly disappointed.To begin, the plot is almost non-existent. The only ""story"" I could derive from the random semblance of endless, plodding scenes was that there was a spy at the top of a British intelligence agency, and then they eventually caught him. And Gary Oldman got his job back, I think. Seriously, that's pretty much it.The pacing is the real problem though: Constant flashbacks with no indication that it's the past (It may be pandering to show a calendar or some blurry outlines, but you have to tip the audience off somehow), excruciatingly long scenes of dialogue, and pointless cuts to images and shots that the audience has no reason to care about. Why did a poorly rendered, flaming CG owl fly out of the fireplace and get clubbed by a schoolteacher? What point does a scene like that serve? The few jokes and quick shots of gore that are meant to liven up the experience only seem out of place next to long, drawn out scenes of two men staring at each other uncomfortably. There really is nothing interesting going on in this movie. And that is its biggest fault.Overall I came away feeling very cheated. The acting was good, the direction beautiful and the music was very well done. Really, all the separate parts of this movie are good. Unfortunately a good film really is the sum of its parts and, in this case, it leaves quite a bit to be desired.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Stinker, Staler, Colder  & Why","I'm a huge Le Carre fan, but had read mostly his post-Smiley novels. When I heard that Tinker...was being remade I thought it a good time to read the novel first. Familiar with the extraordinary success and reputation of the original Alec Guiness presentation, but having never seen it, I was impressed with the initial reviews given the film. Boy, am I glad I read the book first! The book was incredible, clearly a masterpiece and a paradigm of the genre. The characters were multi-layered and their complexity was in clear contrast to those in other familiar spy novels. However upon seeing the film my disappointment was palpable and profound. Although any film must make compromises due to the limitations of time, here it appeared the director was banking on the belief that the audience had read the book first. In my humble opinion, there was no way one could have have followed the storyline haven't not had some prior knowledge of the book. After reading Ebert's review, it' s clear he also appears to have similar reservation, stating he had his own problems following the narrative ( little wonder considering the lack of scaffolding in the script )of the film. Now I'm not a director or screenwriter, but in a book which draws on innumerable flashbacks, would it not have been advantageous to have more flashbacks with narrative voice-overs ( a device well adapted in the film ""Spy Games"" ). Instead we're given meaningless looks at the past with no guidance to their significance,in indistinguishable,drab location in order to create a vision or atmosphere the director surmised as artistic. Humbug!!! I also found that despite its preeminent cast, some of Britian's A-listers, they're given little in the way of a script. So we find sketchy,facile characters in lieu of vivid and memorable ones. Take Ciaran Hinds, an extraordinary character actor,whose films include ""Munich"" and the highly touted HBO series "" Rome"", in which he brilliantly portrayed the savvy Julius Caesar, he barely speaks a line in the film. Unfortunately, we are given what amounts to smirks or frowns at the camera and we, the audience, are to glean from these facial expressions their individual traits and personalities. In summation, this movie was over-hyped and never really got the essence of the story and the complexity that make it such a timeless treasure. I look forward to seeing the serialized BBC version which must have understood, at the outset, the draw-backs of making this novel into a feature film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So what did I think of it? It is all in the title of my review. I did feel all of those emotions. Boring - only the first few minutes. It engrossed me for most of the movie and puzzled me too. All round I found it excellent.It took it's time to tell the story and gave very little away. The actors all gave good value and Gary Oldman as the main character was good but underplayed incredibly. I enjoyed Tom Hardy's contribution and Benedict Cumberbatch was as good as he always is. I liked the way it did not spoon feed the viewer with information but allowed the plot to unfold slowly but surely. A pity Kathy Burke was not in it more as she is an incredible actress.

One of the most overrated films of 2011,"The film is based on the 1974 British spy novel by John le Carré, and is a condensed version of the 1979 seven-part BBC series of the same name.The film's largest flaw is that it fails to inspire the requisite emotional investment needed to care about the characters. It's hard to fit this sort of investment into a two-hour film considering the complexity of the plot. However, with this disconnect from the characters it becomes nearly impossible to care when someone is killed off. It also doesn't help that the film's low suspense level is like heating up a pot of water that never makes it to a full boil.The stage is set for a great espionage spy movie including a fantastic cast, but it just fails to leave any kind of lasting impact. This is far from your Jason Bourne hollywoodized type of spy films, and favorably takes a realistic approach. However, this red-herring story needs to up the ante by increasing the tension giving the viewer the sensation of suspenseful anxiety mixed with paranoia.This has to be one of the most overrated films of 2011.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Watching grass grow,"I'm a bit amazed to see that so many people seem to really like this movie. To me it is just a more-than-pretentious, rather pompous fake and fails completely on nearly every level.Now, I am fully aware that le Carré novels tend to be far more realistic and, thus, slow-paced than, say, James Bond movies. Nevertheless, the pacing of this film was so abominably slow that I had the feeling I was watching grass grow until it finally came to an end after long, long,...VERY LONG two hours plus. What really annoyed me all the time, though, was the filmmakers' meticulous obsession with the retro-style look of the whole film. They should have really paid a bit more attention to the on-screen story-telling (preventing the audience from falling asleep) than just celebrating the 70's look of every scene (starting from the hairdressing to clothing, dull 70's housing and cars, etc.).In one scene you witness an insect flying in the back of a stylish Citroen DS (why?), in another - key - scene an aircraft is landing in the background and menacingly approaching the characters in the foreground (why??); in one of the (luckily deleted) scenes featured on the DVD you can watch Gary Oldman preparing and enjoying a fried egg for (I guess) some two minutes (why???).This is, as I mentioned above, extremely pretentious, artsy movie-making. If it weren't for some of the good actors, some of the nice camera work and Alberto Iglesias's decent score, I would say: Simply forget it and READ le Carré instead.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The thinking man's Bond,"Welcome to the Circus! There are no acrobats here, no clowns, no happy children. Just a bunch of dreary and boring bureaucrats juggling nothing less than the fate of the earth. It probably takes a film like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand how much our view of the world – and the work – of intelligence services has been contaminated by the glamorous universe of James Bond or his modern, more disillusioned but even more heroic, counterpart Jason Bourne. So we've come to expect a world of action and heroism, of right versus wrong, of shady backroom dealings and deadly plots which are opposed by a few brave and righteous men. The are backrooms and intrigue, there is plenty of violence and a few righteous men here, too. But there is no glamour, no heroism, no glory. This is not a game, this is dead serious and reminds us how, just a few years ago – and in many ways still today – this was where the frontline ran in a relentless though largely invisible war, a war fought in the place of a ""real"" one which nobody wanted to fight because it could not be won. This was never about heroics, this was all about survival.Director Tomas Alfredson creates – or recreates – a world paralysed by fear, a world which might explode at any moment, in which laughable chess players clumsily try to avoid what seems inevitable. The film takes place in the 1960s, at a time when common sense had it that this earth was doomed, that there would be a nuclear war which would extinguish the world we have come to know. This pale, grey, claustrophobic world seems already dead, almost devoid of color, covered in a sickly greenish grey that has sucked all life from it.This world's James Bond is called George Smiley, but smile he hardly ever does. He is a grey-haired, stone-faced middle-aged man whose life is over, having lost his top job at MI6 as well as his wife. He is yesterday's man, a relic from a time in which integrity counted for something. Now it is all a game, a struggle for power in which the frontlines are hardly visible and ever shifting. Gary Oldman is Smiley and he gives one of the most memorable performances of his career. There is hardly any discernible movement in his stern face, reading it is like reading between lines and yet all the film happens right there, in those minuscule movements, the slight clouding and unclouding of those unforgiving features. A hard man in hard times for which he is much better equipped than the arrogant narcissists which regard themselves as modern.Smiley was forcefully retired but is brought back to lead a secret operation aimed at discovering a mole at the highest level of the ""Circus"". Instead of embarking on an action-filled hunt, Smiley hides in a seedy hotel room, studying mountains of documents. This is a bureaucrats' war and it can only be won by a master bureaucrat. And it is won by talking, investigating, thinking, drawing conclusions – and, most importantly, by listening and observing. There is very little movement in this film which mostly takes place in narrow, suffocating rooms, whether it is Smiley's dusty makeshift headquarters, the dreary grey corridors of the ""Circus"" or the antiseptic chilliness of the board room. The film opens with an operation going horribly wrong in Budapest but this war is fought in backrooms. So it is fitting that it's final, completely nonviolent and mostly silent showdown takes place in a dark empty house.This is the ultimate Anti-Bond: serious, honest, unglamorous, unheroic. For this war is very real and it is not glamorous at all. The methods employed by the two sides are the same and vary only in their level of professionalism. But there is more: Incredulously, Smiley tells the story of once meeting the Soviet Union's top spy who chose to return home expecting to be executing in Stalin's reign of terror rather than defect to the West. Smiley cannot understand this ideological fanaticism which he regards as the Russian's only weakness. He is a pragmatist, for him it is not about ideology but sheer survival. There is no room for grand ideas when you're balancing the edge of an abyss. It takes no hero not to fall, it takes a bureaucrat.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a masterpiece of a spy thriller, full of suspense in which the violence is always dirty, never heroic or glorified. It is a claustrophobic, bloodless world it depicts which has no place for heroism, a world in which no games are played and where right and wrong are no moral categories, although it does not deny the value of decency. The political field on which these shadow armies move is no colorful background, it is deadly reality. In the very end, there is a slight smile on Smiley's face, a brief sign of triumph which cannot hide the fact that nothing is over because it never is. Time to go to work.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This style of shooting may have contributed to lack of continuity, there simple wasn't enough context shots to lend a sense of place and time.

Hugely disappointing,"I read ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel ""The Honourable Schoolboy""). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this about the only good thing that I can say about this movie.First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.Fourth, the movie is virtually impossible to understand if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated with kids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There is a mole right at the top of the circus!!!,"Brilliant rendition of the equally brilliant book by the executive producer John le Carré..If one ever would like to take a feel of the espionage world during the Cold War this is the book and the movie for them. No brawn,no action scenes,no Jason Bourne heroics but boy this movie's weight is in tones. Exquisite acting,immaculate atmosphere and musical score,perfectly balanced screenplay. The portrayal of London daily life in the early 70's is excellent.In my humble opinion Oldman's superb acting is even better than when he played Churchill.Highly recommended,preferably in the nighttime with a cup of chamomile!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A superb retelling of a Cold War Classic,"This is a retelling of the novel of the same name. It is NOT a remake of the 1979 film starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley. The 1979 film was not actually a film; rather it was a mini series with over 12 hours of material (the UK version was, in fact, slightly longer!). Hence the reason why I consider this is a retelling; not a remake, as it is much different than the original screen adaptation.The 1979 version was filmed during the cold war; when actual Russian actors were not available for use in Russian roles. Remember the 1965 movie ""Dr. Zhivago""? A true classic, set entirely in Russia, yet none of the actors were Russian - heck, the title role was acted by an Egyptian!! Same problem existed in 1979; when even the filming for the East European location of Czechoslovakia was actually done in Glasgow, Scotland! Nowadays, Eastern European locations can be filmed where set and the Russian roles can and are portrayed by native Russians, and this version (2011) has done precisely that. This adds a considerable amount of authenticity to this film. Also, the London shown in this film, is shown as the grimy, still somewhat war dirtied, place that is still was in 1973. It was quite an achievement to show it as that in the film as the London of today is actually a very clean and modern city that has been restored to its height of empire glory.If you want a ""James Bond"" type spy movie-this is NOT it. This is a spy movie based on actual events (the Kim Philby scandal). The actors do a good job of portraying fear and nervousness as anybody involved in these types of actual events would be in a not inconsiderable state of anxiety until everything was resolved. A mole has been detected, but not identified, in the highest realms of British Intelligence. Or, is there actually one?? And, if there is one, how could one possibly find this mole? To find out, watch the movie. Don' trust me or anybody else, see the movie yourself to find out!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent thriller,"What a superb film. The feel of the 'time' was captured wonderfully, so much so you could smell the cigarette smoke. This is a film which requires a large degree of investment from the viewer as you cannot miss a scene, do so and you will be lost. You need to be tuned in to the fact that this was the end of the Cold War and all the protagonists were looking towards a very unsure future, all of which adds to the underlying paranoia. But the clear winner for me was the outstanding performance of Gary Oldman - measured, understated sheer brilliance. It's not just what he says its what he doesn't say that is marks his performance: its the gestures, the glances and the silence, yes the silence which at times is deafening. It is amazing to me that this is his first Oscar nomination for best actor. Compare this performance with LEON and particularly STATE OF GRACE which are totally different but serve to emphasize the versatility of his acting talent. Good luck Gary for the Oscars. Go and see this film but be prepared to 'pay attention'!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not at all gripping or thrilling,"If you haven't read the book, don't bother watching. I haven't, and based on my experience and the reviews here, I think it's clear one cannot follow this movie if they haven't read the book first. Spent 98% of this movie having no flipping idea what was happening. Nearly impossible to tell when you were in a flashback or back to current. So many characters, often zero context as to who they are until too late, and rapid flipping through what each was up to. Couldn't keep track of anything. And yet the pace was somehow still a crawl. The only ""gripping"" thrill was in the first few minutes of the movie. In the end, you discover who the mole was, so those 10 minutes were satisfying. Maybe I'll have to try the book and then watch this again so I have some idea what's happening.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tinker Tailor,"Rewatching this after having just read the novel last month - I was able to follow the intricacies a lot better. This is a sharp and smart adaptation. It carefully prunes where needed and simplifies a few things - but keeps a lot of what makes the book work.Visually this movie looks great with excellent period costumes, cars, and sets. The photography is a lot of telephoto lens giving it a sense of spying on the characters, and even some fun 70s style zooms. The score is understated but helps maintain tension and keep the pace going.The cast is absolutely stacked and there are great performances all around. Most especially Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, and Colin Firth. But Gary Oldman is especially perfect as George Smiley. The politeness, the social discomfort, the calmness. And underneath that a cagey and relentless watchfulness. Even the way he moves and adjusts his glasses just gives a lot of life and tells you a lot about the character.It can be a bit slow, but it's cross cutting to flashbacks creates a pretty engaging pace and the conclusion is tense and exciting.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No emotional investment,"I like to invest with the characters I see in films. I like to experiencing what they're feeling, go with them on a journey, feel like I'm living their life as it plays out on screen. I like to laugh with them, cry with them, go psycho with them. Even the Japanese stone-face films of Beat Takeshi figure out clever ways to show the hidden emotions, the ones lurking behind the featureless faces.Sadly, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a film that offers absolutely zero emotional investment on the part of any of its characters. You simply don't care about any of them - in particular the lead, George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman. You know, I remember the days when Oldman used to fire up Hollywood with his blazing performances in the likes of LEON. These days, on the strength of this and his turns in the BATMAN films, he's simply a bore.The story is s-l-o-w and drawn out unnecessarily to no great end. It's also overly complex, and the script takes great delight in tricking the viewer with one unbelievable plot twist after another. I wasn't expecting another Bourne or Bond, but I was expecting characters I cared about in dramatic situations. I got neither. Tomas Alfredson, of the excellent LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (a film where, you know, I cared about what happened to the people in it) directs a film of an admitted icy beauty, but I can look at the ice formations in my freezer if I want to see that.Yes, the cast is good. Yes, it's a film that takes a more original approach to the spy genre than most as of late. But is it a good film? Not by a long shot. By the end, I was so uninvolved that I didn't even take note of who the real spy was - by that stage I was long past caring...",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Two-pace movie,"I can understand why people have difficulties with this movie: it has dual-pacing. There are sequences in which important plot points are covered and gone in less than five seconds (what happens to Control, the vital knock on Smiley's door etc), which means that if you're not paying attention, you lose your grip on the story and are unlikely to retrieve it. But then there are long, languid scenes which convey the dreary essence of day-to-day espionage. These are the sequences which, I suspect, lead some in the audience to think that the movie itself is slow and boring. Keeping track of the blink-and-its-gone stuff and coping with the long, soporific stretches mean that Tinker, Tailor demands a lot of work from the audience to get the best out of it. Not everyone is prepared to work that hard, I guess. Should they have to? Your call. One major relief is that it isn't a film filled with explosions and car chases, tailored to the tastes of 14-year-old boys, who generally can't tell the difference between a good movie and an empty movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A thoroughly satisfying spy thriller !!,"I have been dying to watch this movie for such a long time. I had read so many rave reviews about it that when I got my hands on the Blue ray, i was jumping with excitement. Leading an ensemble British star cast, Gary Oldman delivers a brilliant performance that can easily land him an Oscar nod this year. The star cast also includes Benedict Cumberbatch(Sherlock, War Horse, The Hobbit), Colin Firth, Tom Hardy (Inception, Warriors & The dark knight rises), Stephen Graham (Public Enemies, Boardwalk Empire), Ciaran Hinds (The Debt, In Bruges, Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life), John Hurt, Toby Jones, Mark Strong (Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood). Already nominated for 3 Oscars for (Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay & Best Original Score) & 11 BAFTA's, this has garnered positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The movie is based on a novel by John Le Carre, which talk about the spy trade craft between the British and Soviet Intelligence during the early 1970's. The story follows the hunt for a Soviet double agent who is sitting at the top of the British Intelligence. The story kicks in a languid pace in the start but very soon it grabs your attention as you enter the world of George Smiley (Oldman) and how he maneuvers the chess board, piece by piece, until he strips it down to the intended target. The era of early 1970 is brilliantly recreated with authentic sets, costumes and a haunting score which add to the mood of the entire experience. Tomas Alfredson directs with a steady hand, never letting it slack, and allows Oldman to breathe the character of Smiley. Give the movie the attention it deserves for the first 15 minutes and I promise you, you would want to see it to the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The essence of spying,"The movie will disappoint, if you expect Bond/Bourne. It is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"".In general, you could say it is a sort of spy-as-a-profession piece, much closer to what it actually means to work in the intelligence than any of the spy-action movies: lots of talking, office work, reading, thinking... and as a result people die, and sometimes wars get started.As the one who has read the book, I could follow the plot. I suspect that if one hasn't seen it, it could be hard sometimes. A lot of background detail from the book is omitted or only sketched, leading to some of the things appearing to have no reason.I appreciated the slow burn of the movie and subdued violence hanging in the background.What I did dislike was that the climax and last part of the movie seemed to be too rushed, lacking the necessary exposure/preparation. I got the feeling that the movie should have been about 15-20 minutes longer to explain/show more of the actual preparation for the finale and fill in background.The biggest disappointment for me was that the trailer music never appeared in the movie. The film's music is good, but since it is as low key as the movie itself, it subtracts from the suspense, while the trailer music would have added to it and sort of helped to tie the plot together.Despite all that, yes, 9/10 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unforgivingly Confusing,"I like a variety of film genres, including spy films, but this one just stole over two hours of my time that I can never get back. The transitions between the ""present"" and flashbacks"" were not in any way delineated, so the viewer is left off-balance throughout. This is an acceptable tool to use in the beginning of a movie, but there has to be a point at which you allow the viewer to gain some equilibrium. That just never happens in this film.The characters are never developed properly, so the viewer doesn't really care about any of them. There is so much sitting around and excessive smoking, that one remembers little else.Skip this one and spend your time and money on almost any other spy movie out there.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I found this very difficult to watch in the cinema. It was so still you could hear a pin drop (or people rustling, scratching, sniffing and god knows what else, not to mention the booms from other screens next door...).

An Underwhelming Masterpiece,"It's hard to criticize much about this film-except that it's simply boring. Visually, the film is impressive; the cinematography is flawless, the locations are beautiful, and the aesthetic perfectly captures the bleak atmosphere of the era. However, despite these strengths, the film fails to engage the viewer and draw them in. It remains oddly distant, lacking an emotional pull. The characters seem flat, as if they were mere side roles in their own story.

Don't give up on this slow starter,"Oddly enough, this film reminds me a lot of ""The Deer Hunter"". The reason I say this is because there were many times throughout ""The Deer Hunter"" that I wanted to give up on the film. The beginning of the film is dreadfully drawn out and slow. While watching ""Tinker"", I found myself agitated with the slow beginning. I nearly gave up and turned it off. Much like ""The Deer Hunter"", I watched the film because of quality reviews and recommendations from friends. That is the only reason I stuck it out. I thought that there must be something to this film if it was getting such good reviews and so many of my friends were telling me to watch it. By the time the film was over, I was very pleased with the quality of the story and the deliberate means of the directing and cinematography. Don't give up on this film. Hunker down and fight your way through the treacherous slow start and I think you will end the film with a smile on your face. This is a film that must be absorbed and paid attention to closely. This is a tremendous film and after it was over I felt like rising to my feet and clapping as if I had just witnessed a masterful Broadway performance. The acting is top-notch and Gary Oldman is spectacular. This is the same feeling I had after fighting through ""The Deer Hunter"", and that is where I draw the similarities from. Some may find this an odd comparison, but I find the films to be eerily similar in style and quality. If you are looking for non-stop action and special effects, pass this one up. If you appreciate detailed story-telling and refined acting, you will love this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fair Comparison?,"Comparing this film version to the 1979 TV series with Sir Alec Guiness as George Smiley may not be appropriate but it is inevitable for anyone who has seen the earlier rendition of John Le Carre's classic spy novel. Unfortunately for the movie, it isn't playing in the same league with the series. Gary Oldman is quite good as George Smiley; Alec Guiness was superb. The film, being far shorter than the series, covers the complicated story in a much more compressed fashion. Le Carre is well known for concealing outcomes as the plot develops and for creating characters with morally ambiguous motivations. In compressing the plot, the movie is occasionally confusing and the confusion is amplified by dark lighting in many scenes, leaving the viewer wondering at times what's happening and to which characters. By all means, anyone who loves Le Carre's novels needs to view the series.Having said this, the movie is nonetheless pretty good. Oldman can't touch Guiness but he's more than competent as Smiley. Colin Firth as Bill Haydon competes quite well with Ian Richardson who played that part in the series. John Hurt, with his lined visage, inhabits the role of Control and Ciaran Hinds, Toby Jones, David Dencek, Kathy Burke, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch all acquit themselves quite well. Despite occasional confusion, the story line comes through and tension is nicely maintained even if you already know the identity of the mole the Soviets have planted at the top of the Circus. Too bad there isn't enough room for more thorough character development, but the medium in this case conceals the message.I gave the series 10/10 and the movie 8/10 which is still a strong ranking.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece,"I have watched this movie two times. Once when I had no idea of the world of the Circus and indeed no idea what was happening in the film. The second time was immediately after reading the Le Carré novel. When watched with a knowledge of the plot, this film is a masterpiece. It's atmospheric, it shows without ever telling and the acting is sublime. It is so light in exposition that it can be hard to follow and appreciate if you haven't read the book but is nonetheless incredible. The entire cast is brilliant but highlights are from Gary Oldman and John Hurt. The portrayal of Smiley is so incredibly dialled, especially with the initial lack of dialogue from him.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Oh no- they're raping Smiley,"I've just watched the film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and having watched the wonderful 1979 TV series and read the wonderful book, I can honestly say that watching said film reminded me very much of the South Park episode where having watched Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull they are forced to watch Indie being repeatedly raped using famous harrowing film rape scenes.I don't want to put everyone off seeing the film if they haven't previously seen the TV series or read the book, but I would say not to bother if you have because you will only be in for a severe disappointment.It's been a while since I spent £3 in a worse way. Benedict Cumberbatch was embarrassing and Colin Firth could not hold a candle to Ian Richardson's farts as Bill Haydon; gone is the charm and is replaced by a horrid public school bully. You learn so little about any of the mole suspects that you really couldn't care less which one of them it is. Although, surprisingly, Mark Strong, usually seen in poor quality programmes for ITV is not bad as Prideaux.More importantly, Le Carre without trade craft is not really Le Carre and I found the spies' Christmas do particularly ludicrous in this respect; according to previous versions Control is so-called because his cover is so deep no one (apart from Smiley, Maybe) knows his name.

Almost perfect George Smiley book-to-film transition. But who is waiting for another Cold War spying story??,"This was the opening film of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. I saw it on the 2nd night, luckily without photo shoots around celebrities walking over the inevitable red carpet. The venue (378 seats) was completely sold out, after promising announcements and positive local TV reports after the 1st night.The story is based on one of the famous George Smiley books by John le Carré, hence is all about spies in times of the Cold War. The announcement listed a star ensemble of actors. What can go wrong given these prerequisites?? Aforementioned TV reports talking with 1st night attendees had some warning signs already, due to the word ""complex"" that I heard too many times. I ignored those red flags, however, deeming them no experienced readers of detectives and thrillers like myself. How wrong I was! Throughout the 127 minutes we were bombarded with new characters, appearing out of the blue, most without getting introduced who he was and his role in the story. And while the story unfolded with several unexpected turns of events, we did not get any nearer to some solution or purpose.Further, with the Cold War over for many years, we cannot feel ourselves involved in spy stories like these. It all seems so silly to us nowadays, knowing how we presently go along with those same countries. We also observe a formidable waste of resources in the form of protocols to restrict knowledge on a ""need to know"" basis, to protect field workers from exposure. These same protocols were circumvented a few times without many problems, as we saw demonstrated in the film. A little bit of modern surveillance equipment would have obsoleted most of these precautions anyway.I'm wondering who is waiting for the umpteenth version of Cold War spy stories, without any modernization attempt that transfers them into the changed world of today. The universal concept of a ""mole"" hidden in your own ranks, is not time bound and offers ample opportunities for such a transition in time, while still keeping the core ingredients of the original story. Outweighing everyone's acting performance with all the missed chances to create a modern version, I gave an ""average"" mark (3 out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Tinker Taylor Solidier Spy Review,"This film is without doubt a credit to British cinema, the fact that it had superb competition in the form of the king's speech, proves to me that this film has lived up to its potential.This film truly brings out the concept that film-making is truly an art, films that been released recently, (and I'm talking since 2000-2011), have destroyed the true meaning of a film, pointing a camera at things they consider good, where as tinker taylor soldier spy is packed with beautiful shots with terrifying realism that, without exaggeration, make you seem like you are part of the movie.The kings speech without a doubt was going to be hard to top, mainly because of the unusually thrilling performance from Colin Firth and the possible career high performance from Geoffrey Rush, and obviously I cannot fault the consistent and more than acceptable performance from Helena Bonan Carter, But there is no doubt in my mind that the acting in tinker taylor soldier spy has a spectacular performance from Benedict Cumberbatch of sherlock who hasn't yet kicked his movie career off. Gary Oldman peaked with his acting in this film, his performance is so vivid and believable, he plays a character who is strong in his skills but as a person very unsure with who he can trust. Throughout the majority of the film his tone of voice is very calm and reassuring and in a way lures you into a false sense of insecurity when he starts to show he means business later on in the film. There is only one scene in the film were he raises his voice and when I witnessed this scene, I for the first time in my life shivered at the tremendous execution of the line.Another asset that this film brought to my attention was the way the villains were portrayed, they were shown as the slimy parasites that they were built up to be, despite not knowing there motives you truly hate these characters with a passion which again enforced the realistic vibe of the film.Without doubt this film has made me proud to be British and I would without hesitation recommend this film to anybody that is considering viewing this film, it truly is in my personally opinion, revolutionising cinema.Britain 1, America 0.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disappointing, very disappointing..","I desperately wanted to be moved by this film. This is one of the most important pieces of literature in the genre and deserved to be introduced to a newer and younger audience. I was expecting something with shark-like bite, but sat through pickled herring instead. Sadly, it was a colossal failure and in no way measures up to the depth and nuance of the book.Several key ""actors"" were completely missing from the film; namely WW2, Cold War, Vietnam. The backdrop of the film was completely missing. Without somehow acquainting the audience with the wartime experiences of the characters, they appeared to be drawn from the cast of Glengarry Glenross. These were supposed to have been men and women who had a close acquaintance with death, both through the war and on into the Cold War. Where was the gripping tension of the East West nuclear scrum? Why wasn't the spectre of Vietnam even alluded to? Unfortunately, Gary Oldham is completely miscast here. Smiley is an intellectual turned loose in the fields of war, not a social studies teacher. He trained and ran agents, got shot at, killed people, played the great game, charmed a debutante. The Smiley we got was so retiring that he retired from view.The biggest shame was not using flash backs to fill in the blanks. So much of this story is understated, with the expectation that the audience is acquainted with Eritish school boy life, the British caste system, military life, de-colonialization, Cold War politics, Cambridge life in the 30's. Somehow those missing pieces had to be brought out. Also, the long and bleak intro just did not make any sense. The frequent cutaways to the trainyard with voice over was completely pointless. Yes, there were trains in 60's London, just as there are today. So what.I can understand the author's keenness to be involved in the project in order to acquaint a new audience with one of his masterworks. I am sure, deep in his secret heart, Alec Guinness prowls the streets of London with a copy of Grimmelshausen tucked under his arm, his umbrella at the ready as he ruminates on the perils of a Secret Service which couldn't keep it's secrets. Please rent or watch the BBC series to really get a sense of the true depth of this masterwork.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
HK Auteur Review - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"I cannot fault you for not liking Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It demands that you keep up with it wholeheartedly with 100% undivided attention. Once you put in all the work the film is demanding and fully immerse into its hypersensitive world of subtleties, it becomes a rewarding experience. A blink feels like a gunshot. A facial tick becomes a car chase. Everybody is looking behind their backs.Director Tomas Alfredson does nothing to make it easy either. Let's list the things: 1) The story has a non-linear plot structure that the audience needs to piece together. 2) There is no explanation for the spy lingo. 3) The audience must play detective along with George Smiley, tracking who said what to whom, matching it to what was said in a previous scene to deduce if they are lying. Lying is an art form in itself. Are they lying entirely? Or just omitting a detail? What motivates a lie?The film completely functions on a thematic level. Gary Oldman said in an BBC5 interview that director Tomas Alfredson doesn't even think he made a spy thriller, which confirms my point. This is not a story about espionage at all. No, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about mistrust. It's about these men confined in tight spaces perpetually spying on each other and how it alienates them apart. Humanity is a weakness and compromises their survival as spies. Every character in the film battles with their own humanity to survive. There is a great scene where Gary Oldman's George Smiley lies to another character with a perfect poker face. The bleak coldness that he exudes is intense and shocking. The subplot with Smiley's wife artfully gives insight to the Smiley character. We never get a good look at the wife because she exists as an idea - she is the deal he has to make with the devil. Home is where Smiley is at his most vulnerable and we see the consequences of Smiley's commitment to his cold-hearted profession.Since I'm a Sherlock fan, I loved seeing Benedict Cumberbatch rise through the ranks into films now. He's great as Gary Oldman's younger sidekick who is still wet behind the ears. I look forward to seeing him in the next Star Trek movie. Please don't make him play Khan. It would be a waste. Toby Jones' face screams red herring. Alfredson films Jones in a way that makes him look like an evil leprechaun, similar to how Sergio Leone's penchant for filming faces as if they were landscapes.Speaking of which, this film has great cinematography in that it tells the story. The film is about discovering truth amongst a cloud of lies and the cinematography really serves that idea visually. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema has managed to find layers of shadow in places that I didn't know exist, like the backseat of a car. The camera moves, like the pan shots, really give a sense of place that constructs the moody, smoky, morally ambiguous atmosphere. With the long lenses, the audience is looking into the lives of these spies seated in tight spaces, as if we are watching them suffocate.Something really noteworthy is how they utilized is Gary Oldman's glasses as a plot device. Yes, Hint! Notice George Smiley's glasses in every scene. It's used like Maggie Cheung's dresses in In The Mood For Love. What's genius about is it forces you to look at Gary Oldman's eyes, which both guides your eyes to his performance and immerses you along with his investigation of what's going on as he interviews each suspect.Hands down, Gary Oldman should win the Oscar. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. How does an actor underplay a role to this degree and still manage to be this engaging? Due to the Academy's usual taste of rewarding showy loud performances, it seems unlikely Oldman will win the gold statuette. It's a subtle performance completely constructed around what he's not showing and what he is not saying. But at least the Academy recognized the brilliance of his performance. It's a step, right?For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting and atmospheric,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one of the most cautiously filmed films of 2011. It is tightly woven together, with some incredible editing, cinematography, and set design. It plunges you into the atmosphere of the Cold War days, and has a screenplay worth discussing and really digging into. It's also one of the most interesting films of the year, if only because it has such a carefully-plotted story that requires multiple viewings. I was never once bored by the film, but I didn't really get lost into everything that was happening. I was sort of watching it from a distance, and feel that a rewatch is in order, for very soon as well. But this also makes it stand apart from many other films I have seen this year. The entire cast is great, and Oldman is a strong lead with his carefully-moving eyes and meaningful face expressions. I honestly don't feel as if I can say any more. This is definitely worth watching, but for those wanting to have an easy viewing for once will be disappointed. It's one of those films you respect more than you love, but I think there's plenty worth digging here.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A marvellously English cold war thriller,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is without any doubt a wonderfully crafted film set in a recreated 1970s London that exudes a certain eerie realism, from the bare light bulbs to chain smoking it creates the perfect atmosphere for the retelling of John le Carré's classic novel.Tinker tailor soldier spy is in essence a cold war thriller but gone are the explosions and gun shots and heroics, this is a film of internal war. It tells the story of a mole inside the British intelligence service, nicknamed quite aptly 'The Circus', leaking secrets to the Russians and the quest of one old retired spy to find the truth whilst remaining unknown to the upper echelons of the circus. With a quintessentially English feel, from dinner at the wimpy to the disgust that darts across Oldman's face at the slightest sign of unbecoming activity which goes a long way in adding to the Oxbridge old boys characters in the film.One thing that you notice as you watch the film is the fantastic casting for which we have Tom Alfredson and co to thank as it truly elevates the film to a level that could not have been achieved by other actors and strikes a real chord with le Carré's novel. Not simply is this laid at the feet of Gary Oldman (George Smiley) who is in reverence to the book, a man of few words but inspiring presence. Oldman plays Smiley with a majestic manner in which he, much akin to an Oxford old boy and a gentleman, does most of the talking with his unflappable demeanour and patience which for any actor would be a challenge to put forward so much by saying so little but Oldman plays it quite masterfully and reveals Smiley's insecurities with a marvellous intimacy that truly brings Smiley to life from the pages. This film is acted wonderfully throughout, from the ever dapper Collin Firth (Bill Haydon) with his confidence and authority to the gruff military manner of John Hurt (Control) that to any reader of the book will see a near perfect portrayal and anyone who watches the film will see an extraordinary performance.Further note should be given to screen writers Bridget O'Connor and , Peter Straughan who do an excellent service in taking le Carre's mass of characters, plot lines and at times circumlocutory manner and streamlining it into a film of only 2 hours whilst retaining the bulk of the plot and emotion in the book. This is however where to a fan of the book the film falls down as the relationships are all hashed into one scene of a circus party where all the emotional interaction between characters is forced into one room. Which leaves the complex nature of the way Bill is thought of by every character in the book sadly underexposed so too is the character of Jim Prideaux who loses a lot of his depth as a character.Overall however, this is a wonderful film with very little to say against it other than no lover of a book is ever completely happy with its translation to film but in this case it is a damn near perfect job and well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting...,"TTSS received an extraordinary mixture of reviews from those who positively eulogised over it to those who hated it with a vengeance. I read through most of them, trying to sort out categories.The whole thing's a bit of an enigma really. Different kinds of people liked or hated it for different reasons but it's certainly a film which produced extreme reactions. It's a love-it or hate-it film. And there are also those who hated it initially and then came over to its side.I saw it twice at the cinema and the second time around I found it more interesting. I think this is because, having already seen it before, I was ready for the reworking of the story, the location shifts, the 70's decor, and the different characterisation.I've been around le Carre's novels for many years and know them intimately. The BBC TV version with Alec Guinness was very true to the book and were several other versions including the recent Radio 4 one in its Smiley series.If one likes this sort of genre those versions imprint themselves on the mind if not the heart. One felt as though one knew Smiley, Guillam, Connie Sachs, and all the rest of the people.All those previous versions tended to echo one another in their portrayal of the characters so to come to this one, which is in many ways so different, took some adjustment. Much of the original Le Carre dialogue is intact which made the adjustment even trickier. Because I came prepared to the second showing the mind was more free to concentrate, not on the differences, but on the story, the acting, and the essence of the film itself.On that level it was, as Le Carre himself has said, fairly masterful. The plot is not lost by the time reduction; on the contrary, it's very clear, if one knows it, and the acting was good, as one might expect from that cast.Oldman dominated the action with surprising presence and power. Not once was he upstaged by any of the others nor by the direction, as sometimes happens. However, I have to say I wasn't convinced. He's not Oxford (he admitted having trouble with the voice) nor an academic, probably the very essence of Smiley who was based on Vivien Green.For die-hards and connoisseurs like myself one had to accept it was a new version and not a rehash. It is unquestionably different. At times it has an art-house feel which some might think would conflict with the subject of the Cold War. Personally I don't think it did because the mood and tension is largely underlying and psychological, the very stuff of some art-house movies.Anyhow, as I said, it definitely took some rethinking because I was so steeped in previous versions and the lore of the Smiley novels. The new writers haven't betrayed that lore, they've reformatted it, if that's the right word. It might not sit well with Le Carre purists but it sort of works on its own level. And, as quite a few reviewers have pointed out, they should probably follow it with Smiley's People.But, to be honest, I can't say I liked it. Le Carre supported and praised it liberally but I happen to know he thinks the Guinness version was the quintessential one. It's possible he was supporting it because there was nothing else to be done.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
like a migraine except a migraine ends eventually,"i saw Tinker Tailor, i was hoping for a great thriller but it was a convoluted non starter that ended abruptly and make absolutely no sense. It didn't engage or have any tensity it was very disappointing. It left me with may unanswered questions and the ones i did get answers for only raised more questions. The performances are excellent, i think, i don't know because i don't know what was happening, Cumberbatch is dapper, i cant give a decent review as the film was poor and difficult to watch, at some points i was actually falling asleep as nothing was happening and when it was it made no sense. I didn't like this film at all, sorry but the cream of British cinema, whats the point of using them when the film makes no sense at all?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
