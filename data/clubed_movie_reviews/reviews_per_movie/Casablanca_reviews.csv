One of the greatest,"Personally The Third Man is the best film ever, but this is up there. As innovative as Citizen Kane was, I'm gonna put this one ahead of it.But in one way this film beats all others - the dialogue. Yes, the cinematography is great, the acting is second to none, but how many eternal lines of dialogue came from this? 'Here's looking at you, kid,' 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,' 'We'll always have Paris,' 'Round up the usual suspects,' 'The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world,' 'I'm shocked to find out that gambling is going on,' 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.As much as I prefer a happy ending, I'm gonna go ahead and say the ending felt perfect. It had to go that way. I think I'll end by saying Humphrey Bogart just might be the most watchable actor in cinematic history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I think this is a start of a great friendship...,"I think Casablanca will start a great friendship between me and the classic movies!!!
Casablanca, an amazing story on friendship love and patriotism is one of the best movies I've seen. Magnificent as always , Humphrey Bogart played Rick a saloon owner in Casablanca , an unoccupied region in France during the WW2. His ex lover Ilsa now wife to Victor Lazlo an escaped prisoner of the Nazis come to the saloon owned by Rick in fortuity. With no other choice but to seek help from her ex lover Ilsa tries to persuade Rick to help Victor escape the german to America.
I was infatuated by the performance of Ingrid Bergman who plays Ilsa. She was an absolute peach with her amazing yet painful dialogues.
Casablanca will always be a monumental work in the history of the cinemas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE,"There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch.""  Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Now I finally know why this one is one of the best,"Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A masterwork for all time...,"There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover.As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on.Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him.This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Fundamental Things Apply...,"""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
We'll Always Have Casablanca,"Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Of all the gin joints, in all the world...","Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio's death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir's idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman's heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.But then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.Meanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption 'a typical Jew' so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. 'Entree des artistes', a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio's scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.After a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in 'Hold Back the Dawn', a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.In early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.Shooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.They produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to 'Casablanca'.It is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. 'We'll always have Paris', 'I was misinformed', 'Here's looking at you, kid', ' I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!', 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', 'Oh he's just like any other man, only more so', 'I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one', 'Round up the usual suspects', and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, 'Play it again, Sam'.Madeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.And when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, 'I'm shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!' the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, 'Your winnings, sir.' It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.I have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.Alas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.Late in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply 'old man in whore house', in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what 'grand themes' may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Is it good? Yes. Is it overrated? Also yes.,"I was extremely skeptical when I put the video tape into the cassette player but I was pleasantly surprised by both my focus and the film. The picture was sharper than expected and luckily the film was not very long.But quite honestly, I don't see what's so special about the movie. Not really my taste, but still! There are probably quite a few details that I didn't notice, but I don't think you should have to google ""why is Casablanca great"" to understand the hype surrounding the film.Do not misunderstand me. It was good. It was actually very good from time to time. Stylish environments and lovely vibes. However, I think that the explanations for why the film is good are rather reasons why the film is even better than what you already thought. Should a film really require so much analysis and thought? Yes, a movie like this might need it.I tried to see the film with an extra critical and objective eye. The plot is good, the characters are nuanced and many good questions are asked. The main character has had his heart broken and his ideologies have changed. It's an interesting premise. It's all good on paper and I imagine the film was a great when it came out during WWII. Can you imagine that? 80 years ago. There are people in this who were born in the 19th century. That is certainly interesting.In conclusion, I was surprised that it was quite good, but I didn't really like it. It's undeniably a pretty good movie, but is it overrated? In my eyes? Yes, I would say so. Is it just because of the outdated technology? No, the plot wasn't very complex and the moral dilemma the whole thing was about is nowhere near groundbreaking today. Maybe it was 80 years ago but how do I know.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A story that will never get tired, incredible film.","American in Casablanca, Rick Blaine holds the fate of his former lover Ilsa Lund and her husband, who's trying to flee The Nazis.I've just watched this film for the very first time, and I plan to watch it again on Christmas morning, before the events of the day start.What an enchanting, magical experience this couple of hours of viewing was, true screen greats bringing to life a magical story.Casablanca is not what I was expecting, it's a war film with a twist, a story seen through the eyes of people fortunate to escape Europe, it's a love story, with a difference.The characters are captivating, they all feel very real, a mix of hope and fear etched over their faces, a harsh reality to all of them, none of them are syrupy sweet or sentimental, you feel a true sense of desperation.Ingrid Bergman's finest hour, a gracious beauty, her presence is quite enchanting, Bogart delivers a superb performance, the presence of the pair is quite something, the whole cast are terrific.Amazing to think that this was made in the middle of The Second World War, indeed I believe several of The German characters, were German Jews who had fled The Nazis.Watching this was quite an experience, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Meh. It was alright.,"I'll open up with my unpopular opinion. I wasn't a fan of Casablanca. It's was over the top, it was pompous and most importantly I just didn't enjoy it. Most of this has to due with context. I had some trouble on the first go around grasping everything that was going on, but I'm not holding any of that against the film.The credit I will give to Casablanca is the dialog is engaging and the cinematography is excellent. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. It's at this point I even have to ask myself, why didn't I like it? I don't know, I just didn't. It didn't speak to me in the way that lesser films have. It's quite possible that in repeat viewings I'll pick up a detail I missed the first time around and have a renewed appreciation for the film, but as it stands now I respect Casablanca for everything that it is, but I didn't enjoy it and in my eyes that's the most important part of a film, no matter how important it may be historically.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Sixth Greatest Film Of All Time ????????,"First off, I'm going to say this once and make it very clear. If you liked ""Casablanca"" and though it was a work of ""sheer brilliance"" than that's fine. Hence the old saying ""each to his own"". If you didn't like it, then I agree with you.Now before you snobs critically abuse, hear me out. I saw nothing in it that was deserving of the title ""epic"". Now I am not one of those ignorami who hate movies made before 1970. Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.Sure, you ""Cinematic Elite"" may like it, but is ""Casablanca"" really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema. I wanted to like the film (I really did), but I'm not going to pretend I liked it just because all of you fellow critics admired it.

Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman,"Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""It seems destiny has taken a hand.""","This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's ""King Kong"". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.It's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.All the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.One cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen ""Casablanca"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Wartime Themes,"Love and sacrifice during WWII underlie the story about a café owner named Rick (Humphrey Bogart), and his link to two intellectual refugees from Nazi occupied France. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and, like other European refugees, gravitate to Rick's upscale café, near the city's airport, with its revolving searchlight.Rick is a middle-aged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism, especially for people in need, like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's café, an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons, from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's café that renders this film so appealing, with a variety of interesting accents, clothes, and uniforms. And, of course, there's Sam, the piano player, who plays all the favorites, including ""As Time Goes By"".All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script, with its colorful characters, like the debonair Captain Renault (Claude Rains); and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), the articulate and portly ""leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca"". And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's (Corinna Mura), whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.The film's dialogue, though substantial, is clever and lively, like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar: ""How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that; some day they may be scarce"".High-contrast B&W lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning; it evokes a feeling of far-off adventure.""Casablanca"" differs from traditional noir films, mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism, an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"The writing, the character actors, the lighting, and then, for dessert, some romance, too. Oh, and America goes to war at last.","Casablanca (1942)When Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), ""If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"" he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.Need and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.The romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.These great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the café as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect.There isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights. It's not a great film by accident, and it doesn't hide why it's great. There are better films, I suppose, of course there are, depending who you ask and on what day. But not many.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
".....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die,  the world will always welcome lovers,  As Time Goes By.""","It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century.Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment.So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A perfect film.,"Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I've loved this film for thirty years.,"Casablanca is a film about the personal tragedy of occupation and war.  It speaks to the oppression of the one side - and the heroism and self-deprecation of the other.  From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy.  Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love. Leading actors to please any appetite.  Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it.  It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are ""real to you.""  It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story.  Through this film, Casablanca will always live in my heart and I will think of its characters as family.Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
More average than I thought it would be.,"The movie had a decently compelling story and good scenes, and the actress who played Ilsa had definite talent. I liked the ending too, however I found it annoying that Humphrey Bogart said his famous line more times than necessary in my opinion. He should've said it twice instead of like 3-4 times which I started to roll my eyes at. Aside from a couple of pacing issues too, it was not bad! Slightly overrated though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.""","The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's  man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words.

"Of all the classics in all the films in all the world, this is the best!","This is a film that MUST belong in every video collection in the U.S. is not in the world. The stories about it's making are legendary from the constant rewrites to the apocrypha of casting stories.What is amazing to me, and the reason I believe it holds audiences almost spellbound in successive viewings, is the connection with the horrors of World War II was almost every single cast member.  Sidney Greenstreet had lost a son in combat, and a number of the cast members fled Europe to escape the ravages of a Hitler regime.  Even the evil Nazi character Major Strasser (played with relish by Conrad Veidt) had left Nazi Germany to escape  almost sure internment and possible death in a concentration camp. Here was a man who was a legend in German film history as the murdering somnambulist (a possible warning about the Nazi soldiers to come?) and because of the vicious anti-Semitism and racism of the Germany of the '30s and '40s, we in America and in Hollywood were given a great gift.Everyone in this film is fabulous, but it is the chemistry of Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) been truly holds the film together.  When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s, I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine's character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart.  There is a reason why he was named the actor of the century.While every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.I must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can't watch it with me anymore.The line that sticks out the most for me, and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater.  It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table, ""There are parts of New York I wouldn't advise you to invade.""  And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script.  That movie was ""All Through The Night."" I love this movie too, and I'm not even a New Yorker.There have been many attempts to revisit ""Casablanca,"" but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through ""The Good War"" in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.Even  though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.If you've never seen this movie before, shame on you and see it immediately. If you only seen it once, I believe you will come back to it more than once. This is just about the most perfect film ever made and it is a miracle that that is so considering that there were so many hands in the pie.  (Excuse me for my mixing my metaphors.

A Perfect Film But Let's Clear Up A Few Rumors,"In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. ""Rick's Café Américain"" attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of ""letters of transit"" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about ""Casablanca"" but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying ""The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting"". That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for ""things to change"" while a film was in production. ""Casablanca was no exception!Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only ""thought of"" but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast!Rumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days.Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered.

Rightfully one of cinema's finest stories ever told.,"""Casablanca"" is a timely and timeless classic about a politically neutral saloon owner Rick in unoccupied France at a crossroads of destiny, conviction, and courage in his life. ""Casablanca"" is on the top of every film class's watchlist to study for just about every aspect of filmmaking imaginable.While the film's plot is air-shut tight and the characterization feels authentic over 70 years later, the main focus of ""Casablanca"" is idea focused. During a time of political neutrality, America was entering the war as was Rick, our hard-on-the-edges protagonist. This can be considered an ""enlist"" film to anyone on the fence. Because of it's conviction-driven focus on ideas and philosophy, and how grounded those struggles feel, ""Casablanca"" remains one of the most well regarded classics of all time. The struggles of Rick are applicable to anyone who watches the film, drawing on universal themes like conviction, courage, compassion, and love.The character of Rick is a fascinating one on an individual basis. We're set up to a character who's meticulous and thoughtful in the way he does things, paralleled by the chess game he has with no one. At the same time, we know of his loneliness without a partner to play with. We understand the respect he commands with patrons of the saloon yet the deep friendship he experiences with Sam. And while his corrupt inner shell shared with the chief is off-putting like a villain, we know he's ""...at heart, a sentimentalist"" when we learn of his passionate love for Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa.""Casablanca"" also features some of cinema's most iconic and beautifully crafted cinematography by the great Arthur Edeson and of course the director, Michael Curtiz's masterful control of capturing the romantic moment. Not only on a story-telling, narrative perspective, ""Casablanca"" is worth studying for it's remarkable technical quality.While the film may be as close to perfect as one can get, some of the third act moments can feel unnatural and forced which could disorient some modern viewers. Nitpicking aside, ""Casablanca"" remains one of cinema's finest pieces of celluloid to date.

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped.

The Band Wagon Effect,"I'm a fan of almost everyone who appears in Casablanca, at least in every other movie they were ever in. Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and so on. But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's ""greatness"", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give ""African Queen"" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the ""perfect film"", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one.

"Great characters, classic dialogue, teary-eyed romance...","Humphrey Bogart in his preeminent role, that of the marvelously tough nightclub owner Rick Blaine, living in Algiers and sheltering refugee ex-girlfriend Ingrid Bergman and her new husband from the invading Nazis. Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good?

A Classic Worth Remembering,"While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention.  By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly.  Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast.  Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments.  It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films.  It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly.  (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else.  Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything.  While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"""Who's got trouble? We got trouble.""","For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.Everybody knows about Casablanca – even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme ""As Time Goes By"", but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the ""Knock on Wood"" number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is ""a special friend of Rick's"". This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.Then there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this – crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.But of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type – perhaps his archetypal role – and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.On that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads – not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca – whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to.

Almost the Perfect Film,"Any film with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman would be worthwhile watching.  However this film keeps one's attention from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end.

Hollywood at its most significant,"Casablanca is a Hollywood movie made in the peak of Hollywood filmmaking. A powerful romance so well-acted by a superb cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The writing is excellent with a pitch-perfect running time and many lines that have become classic. All of these elements are expertly brought together by director Curtiz in his best film. It stands alongside Citizen Kane and Gone with the wind for the best movie ever made. It certainly features Hollywood at the peak of its form an engaging acting at the top of its form.

A good movie,"If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.In the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Dull & way overrated,"I'm not going to slate the film any more than that, as millions still love it now, so it must be me that's in the wrong, but it was such a hard film to watch.The acting was faultless. But that's it really. The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.The 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today.But the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable.Good cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.There was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly ""here's looking at you kid"" don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.A 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.Though this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it.But then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"As time goes by, it's still one of the all-time greats...","While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film:""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.""And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!!  As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar!Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders.

"""... human life is cheap.""","Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather').

Claude reigns,"Ah, Casablanca...everyone's second favorite movie!  On the recent DVD commentary, Ebert remarks that he's never heard a bad review of this film. I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white.  So, we can disregard their opinions then!  Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.I consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting.  The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).My favorite thing about Casablanca?  Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie!  Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever.  Greenstreet and Lorre (or, as I prefer to call them, the Fat Man and the Bug) have more personality than most of today's ""stars"" combined, and they're just two of the many highlights here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Craftsmanship is the name of the game, and with every line, look, and movement contributing to its story, not a moment of what you see on screen is wasted. Fully realized locations, legendary performers at the top of their game, and a story that sneaks up on you with how powerful it suddenly becomes -- yes, ""Casablanca"" deserves the place it has made itself at the top of all-time lists.

A timeless classic,"""Casablanca"" remains one of the most iconic films in cinematic history, with its timeless story of love, sacrifice, and intrigue set against the backdrop of World War II. Starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the film weaves a compelling narrative filled with memorable dialogue and unforgettable moments.Bogart's portrayal of Rick, a jaded nightclub owner in Vichy-controlled Casablanca, is both nuanced and magnetic. His chemistry with Bergman's Ilsa, a woman from his past who unexpectedly reappears, is electric and forms the emotional core of the movie. Their reunion sparks a series of events that highlight themes of loyalty, duty, and moral ambiguity.The supporting cast, including Claude Rains as the charming yet shrewd Captain Renault, adds depth and color to the story. The film's direction by Michael Curtiz is masterful, creating a rich, atmospheric setting that enhances the narrative's tension and romance.Despite being released in 1942, ""Casablanca"" remains relevant and poignant, demonstrating the enduring power of well-crafted storytelling and character development. While some might find its pace reflective of its era, ""Casablanca"" is a cinematic treasure that continues to captivate audiences with its timeless appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Start of a beautiful friendship,"Humphrey Bogart (Rick) and Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) each own a café/bar in Casablanca which is frequented by those wishing to make an exit to Lisbon and a new found freedom. Casablanca is on French soil and Claude Rains (Renault) is the Captain in charge who must co-operate with Nazi Conrad Veidt (Strasser). The two cafes are riddled with black market shenanigans and into this town wanders Resistance leader Paul Henreid (Victor Lazlo) and Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa). In order to make it to freedom, an exit visa is required and this is what Henreid and Bergman are after.An entertaining film with a good cast and very amusing dialogue. Bogart rattles off some classic lines but it's Claude Rains whose delivery tops the charts. One moment that I found funny is when a grateful couple approach him and enthusiastically let him know that they will be at his office at 6:00am to collect their visas. ""I'll be there at 10:00"" is his reply. The moral of that is don't be so keen, it gets you nowhere. A good lesson for anyone starting a new job.""Here's looking at you"" gets a bit clichéd but it doesn't matter. I never cared for Humphrey Bogart and his man who stands alone image. It always struck me as cold and unpleasant. However, I'm starting to really like him these days.One daft thing about the film is how the Nazis didn't find the visas.

"Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.","I do not like Casablanca.  Wait!  Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out.  One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains.  It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie.  But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level.  Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine.  He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience.  ""I stick my neck out for no one"", ""Rick never drinks with anyone"", etc., etc.   These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out.  Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back.  I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions.  It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine.  The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song ""As Time Goes By"".  But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time.  Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison.  Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened.  It could have been a great and profound film.  Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.**/*****",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The most famed for many and one of the greatest movie ever realized,"Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .Casablanca is homaged with fascination as in ¨One from the heart¨ (by Francis Ford Coppola) or from irony as ¨Play it again Sam¨(Herbert Ross). The movie has immortal images with memorable quotes and the best scenes ever written , such as the exciting final when Bogart bids Bergman farewell at the airport with ¨Here's looking at you kid¨still has audiences choking back a tear. All film originates unforgotten characters as makes with Wilson, the piano player to whom Ingrid Bergman says : ¨play it Sam¨. Bergman is enticing and wonderful , stunningly photographed by Arthur Edeson , she was fortunate to have Orry Kelly an hugely talented designer costume to dress her. His shone as radiantly as Bergman's luminous beauty who never looked lovelier. Along with a fabulous plethora of secondaries such as : Claude Rains , Paul Henreid , Conrad Veidt , Peter Lorre , S.Z.Sakal, Madeleine Lebeau , John Qualen , Dooley Wilson , among others . And a large number of extras , as in the famous scene where the ""Marseillaise"" is sung over the German song ""Watch on the Rhine"", many of them had real tears in their eyes ; they were actual refugees and Jews who had escaped from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out .

"Casablanca (1942-43) - Here's Looking at You, Kid!","Claimed as one of the greatest romances of all time, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman star in ""Casablanca"", a romance set in Nazi-occupied Africa, about the affection and heartbreak of love. The movie starts with Rick Blaine, portrayed brilliantly by Bogart, who owns a night club called ""Rick's Cafe American"", during December 1941 in the city of Casablanca. Set years after a devastating separation between he and a long-lost loved one, that particular woman, portrayed beautifully by Ingrid Bergman, who shined on screen, returns with a new husband who is on the run for the law, but she also faces serious love connections with a heartbroken Rick. Beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz, and written brilliantly by three or four separate screenwriters, ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie has more relative humor, strong heart, and memorable characters than the technological success of ""Citizen Kane"". These characters like Rick, Ilsa, Victor, Cpt.

Also, there are so many memorable lines that can be spoken a thousand times, like my two favorites: ""Here's looking at you, kid!"" and ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", both quoted beautifully by Humphrey Bogart.

I watched it three times, and the more I watch the less I like it.The characters are as empty as sea-shells. Bogart (whom I never found a bit attractive anyway) mumbles through the story, as a one-dimensional ""cynical with a big heart"" (my god, what a novelty!!), Bergman cries a lot, but as a compliant female does what she's told and follows her husband: Rick is a man, he knows what's best for her, and her husband needs her support, he's a war hero!!

It's simply ---- GREAT,"This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of ""cool"" and ""authoritative,"" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a ""no"" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside.The arrogant big-shot shouts, ""What!? Do you know who I am!?"" Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, ""I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!""Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the ""Letters of Transit"" which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story.But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, ""You despise me, don't you?"" To which Bogie replies, ""Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.""It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.Regarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.If someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, ""continental"" characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in ""Now Voyager."" In ""Casablanca"" we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to ""lower the key"" a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing 'A Classic'!...,"This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.7/10.IMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Timeless - a Hollywood classic!,"This was yet another classic film to which I've been a ""Johnny-come-lately."" Still, I can see why it has attained its status as one of the Hollywood greats. Put simply, it deals with timeless themes in a matter-of-fact way, enhanced by the excellent performances, flawless and elegant cinematography and an emotionally stirring soundtrack and score. There's not a single minute wasted, and its impossible not to get caught up in the story of love, longing and triumph over adversity.

The Greatest,"What makes Casablanca the greatest?The detail. After Ugate is arrested Rick moves forward and picks up a small glass that has fallen over.When Sam is playing 'As Time Goes by' and Rick is drinking to forget (the famous scene) he involuntarily moans from within. He shows the man's heartbreak - the reactions of emotion running through a body broken by booze and sorrow.This is acting and film making at it's very finest.The inner decency of Rick is moving as is Ingrid Bergmann's tear filled eyes - but the throat catcher is the singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's impassioned 'Vive La France!'This was war time, and the film makes us remember what it was all for. Hollywood should look at the script - how simply it is constructed - and learn - there is a public worldwide that wants scripts of this quality about real people.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless Classic (Bogart is a cinematic icon),"A true masterpiece that will never get old.

This movie was not made with the expectancy of being an amazing watch, however this Warner Bros' A-List became one of the all-time greats and will wow you with its famous lines and beautiful scenes.

WHY ???,"Why is everybody crazy about this film?  I just find it a decent romance film (ah, it is very conventional and safe). I laughed out loud when I saw Casablanca listed #2 Greatest films of all time by the American Film Institute ( hey, how about Fight Club, American beauty, Mulholland Drive ? ). The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. ""Play it again, Sam"" for instance, what the hell? The line "" You jump I jump remember? "" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song ""As time goes by"". It is excellent.Anyway, Casablanca is not too bad, quite enjoyable. I give it 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The thing is...,"Not as great as everyone says it is. But it's still pretty good. Bogart and Bergman ere nice. The writing is OK.

People talk so much much about those movies and praise it to such a degree that anyone ho hasn't seen them gets these expectations to see one of the greatest movie of all time. I wouldn't call it one of the greatest, but I will say that it is required viewing for anyone who is interested in cinema. Just one of those movies that you need to watch, but no guarantee that you'll like. That kinda goes for every movie ever made. But hat can I say?",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Sam, the Coupier, the bartender, the waiter, and of course Louie, generate the same electricity, heart, soul, in this one magical blend as we have seen in long running sitcoms like 'Taxi', 'Mash', and especially 'Cheers'.

Ten Stars Says it all,"This film started life as just another Warner pot boiler. No one involved thought of it as even potentially great. The script writing often progressed from day-to-day and the actors were bit players or not well known character actors. Many of the actors were recently arrived war refugees. Bogart was known for his gangster films where most of the time he dies ignominiously. Ingrid Bergman was largely unknown outside of Sweden and her beauty alone makes the picture worth a view. Today, most critics rank this film as the greatest ever made and I've no doubt they're correct. Much of its dialog has become iconic and has beome part of popular culture. The ending is breathtaking in it's simplicity and it is honestly without equal with one possible exception. I've seen this movie so many times that I've memorized the dialog and it always effects me in a way no other film does. Younger audiences complain about the black and white filmography, often overly dramatic 1940s acting style, and lack sex, violence, car crashes, and explosions. This film, thankfully, is guilty of all these points. Look past the typical triteness of modern cinema and see a film that's almost in a class by itself and has come to define a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,"""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""""We'll always have Paris.""""Here's looking at you, kid.""""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""And many, many, many other iconic lines were featured in the brilliant 1942 all-time Classic CASABLANCA. Listed as ""Warner Brothers Project #410"", this film was supposed to be ""just another film"", but it turned out to be something more.Starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, CASABLANCA tells the story of refugees trying to flee Nazi controlled France (via Casablanca) in WWII. Amongst the denizens of Casablanca, there is Rick Blain, proprieter of Rick's Cafe American - a place where one can buy documents needed to escape, as well as escape - through a bottle.Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast as the jaded, ""I stick my neck out for no one"", Rick. He is cynical, corrupt, selfish...but he also has a heart of gold underneath it all. Bogie plays all of these layers - richly - at once, and was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. He would lose to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE - a film I haven't seen, so can't judge as to the merits of his win. But...based on Bogart's performance...I'd say he was robbed.Rick's ""partner in crime' is Capt. Louis Renault of the Casablanca police. He is cheerfully and unapologetic-ally played by Claude Rains, who also was nominated (but didn't win) for his performance. These two play off each other brilliantly and the chemistry between these two is evident and I would have LOVED to see another film featuring these two fine performers. I'd say the chemistry between these two actors is a high point in this film, if it weren't for...Ingrid Bergman as Ilse Lund - a past romance of Rick's. When Ilse and her husband, Viktor Laszlo enters Rick's seeking transit papers to flee the Nazi's, the instant spark and chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is palatable. You can feel the heat between the two of them through the screen and the longing and regret for ""what could have been"" is heartbreaking. If you were to show an example of ""screen chemistry"" the scenes between Bogart in Bergman in this film would be ""Exhibit A"".Credit for all of this - and for keeping the plot machinations moving forward - is Warner Brothers ""contract director"" Michael Curtiz - one of the greatest Directors of ""old Hollywood."" His credits include the Errol Flynn ROBIN HOOD, James Cagney's Oscar turn as George M. Cohan in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, CASABLANCA, the Bing Crosby/Danny Kaye WHITE CHRISTMAS and John Wayne in THE COMMANCHERO'S - all big budget, big expectations films that delivered the goods. Curtiz won the Oscar for his work in this film.Assisting him are the two men who wrote so many memorable lines...twin brothers Julius and Phillip Epstein. They (deservedly) won an Oscar for their screenplay - the only set of Twins to win the Oscar.The supporting cast - including Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre - are exceptional as well, as are great scene after great scene - including the ""Marseilles"" scene and, of course, the fog covered airport scene at the end.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have NEVER seen it, I envy you the experience of seeing this wonderful black and white film for the first time. It is consistently listed as one of the top 5 films of all time - and earns that ranking.

Ageless classics,"The film ""Casablanca"", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II.Acting in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity.The picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not.Despite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, ""Casablanca"" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this.In conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that ""Casablanca"" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Here's Looking At You Kids!!!,"Generation after generation will continue to love this splendid film, just as many previous generations have enjoyed this movie in the past!! (The principle reason for me bastardizing one of this movie's famous quotes) ""Casablanca"" has, undeniably, withstood the test of time!! This film evokes a romantic humanism into the thick of World War II!!! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are magnificent as the tormented love interest duo who do not seem to be able to piece everything together, they just know they love each other, and more importantly, something clicks!!! Originally, Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheriden were cast for the roles of Rick and Ilsa, as it turns out, you cannot imagine any two other people besides Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman for the roles!! These two performers exude more of a continental flair!! The American fascination for this flick is thoroughly justified!! Winning the academy award for best picture in 1943, ""Casablanca"" was just one of the many movies in the late 1930's and early 1940's which epitomized an era for excellent movies!! Based on the book ""Everybody Comes To Ricks"", Hal B. Wallis produces this film with a flawless orchestration!! The place, Casablanca, becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people, yet for Rick and Ilsa, (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman) the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!! Max Steiner encompasses a necessary nostalgia with the music in this film. ""As Time Goes By"" (made in 1931) became enormously popular with this movie!! The whole scene is set up whereby Paris becomes a venue for unprecedented and wondrous romanticism!! ""Casablanca"" is, without question, one of the greatest movies ever made!! You must remember this, a movie is just a movie!! Unless!! It is the movie of all time; ""Casablanca""!! I will see ""Casablanca"" over and over and over again and never be tired of it!! EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!! I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!!! This film has 6 of the top 100 famous quotes in the history of all American film making!! Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando may lay claim to the most quotes from this list. Many colloquialisms from ""Casablanca"" have fallen within the realm of popular modern day jargon!! This website ranks ""Casablanca"" 11th best picture out of the top 250. AFI (American Film Institue) ranks ""Casablanca"" the second best American film ever made. I feel this is very impressive!!

"A good film, although I struggle to understand why it's regarded quite so highly","This wartime romance is one that seems to consistently be referred to as a classic and one of the best Hollywood films ever. Whenever I watch it though, I can never really work out why. It's a good film, no doubt, but I can never truly get to grips with why it is so beloved. Whereas, the previous year's Citizen Kane is one whose excellence is very obvious, Casablanca seems more like a very well made yet conventional bit of cinema. Not that this is a bad thing of course.It does have a pretty impressive cast though, that is one thing for sure. Humphrey Bogart as the cynical Rick and Ingrid Bergman as the woman, Ilsa, who changes him make for a memorable screen couple; while the support cast is even better, with Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt all at the top of their games in this one. The North African setting provides a nice exotic feel, while the World War II backdrop ensures that there is a definite menace underpinning everything. But this film is probably most famous for its romance, with a final few scenes that have become incredibly famous, with lines of dialogue that have been repeated and misquoted ever since.A good film but I still don't really get the unadulterated love.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Overrated, formulaic romance","Why is this film considered so brilliant? How can it be a classic? It is just another shallow, formulaic, cliche-laden Hollywood love-story, typical of pre-war Hollywood. For me this film is almost undistinguishable from that other 'great' romance of the time, the nauseating 'Gone With the Wind'. At least Casablanca doesn't go on for several hours.The usual plot of old lovers reunited after many years, once again in some Hollywood interpretation of a gratuitous exotic location. Bogart looks depressed, Bergman looks pretty. And that's about all there is to it. No depth of thought or character. Flat, commercial acting from the leads, even flatter and more commercial direction and script. If you like old movies from the 40s, why not watch Citizen Kane? There's considerably more thought and originality there.And I've never understood why people think the lines ""Here's looking at you kid"" or ""Play it again, Sam"" are *so* quotably witty.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of our most quotable movies,"Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing ""The World Belongs to Me."" See this if you never have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tough To Beat This Movie,"I am not getting into the ""The greatest picture of all-time"" debate. It's too subjective but if I forced to cast a vote, I would give this the most serious consideration. I mean, what aspect of this film isn't top-notch?The dialog is superb, one of the best ever put on film. The acting is great, cinematography first-rate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama, action, romance, music...you name it. This film has everything but color, which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film- making doesn't get much better than ""Casablanca.""All of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of all-time. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very, very enjoyable and the latest 2-disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, of course, are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar, essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are good-hearted people.The ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman, despite being married, was willing to run off with Bogart, claiming she ""doesn't know"" what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well, judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years, maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway, other than that, this is a great movie with many, many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier, albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups, and Bogey was never more, well, Bogey, than in here. Add Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow, what a cast!An added bonus is hearing ""As Time Goes By"" throughout the film, a haunting song. Actually, there are several songs played, mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson, and they're all fun to hear. As I said, one could go on and on about this movie.

Rick Makes the Heroic Choice: One of the Best Hollywood Films of All Time,"Many a-great film or theatrical play is about a character (or characters) making a monumental choice. The results of that choice may be tragic, such as Oedipus' decision to pursue the mystery of his parentage, MacBeth's resolve to assassinate his sovereign, or even when Gene decides to cause Finneas' accident in ""A Separate Peace"". The choice can also be selfless, heroic, even transcendent. Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" agrees to defend a black man that prompts ridicule by his white peers. The passengers of the doomed cargo plane in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" determine not to lay down and die in the desert but rebuild something from the wreckage that could save them. And Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart in his most memorable role, also makes an heroic choice in the ageless and timeless American film ""Casablanca"".The film is set against the potent backdrop of World War II at a small town in Morrocco, Casablanca, and the majority of the action takes place in a restaurant-bar-casino owned by Rick Blaine. Many different personages of differing background cross the threshold into Rick's: French police, German officers, Nazis, and even members of the French Resistance.Rick at first appears to be a selfish loner. He even says that he ""sticks his neck out for nobody"". At yet there are hints, even at the beginning, that there is something inside of him that has concern for others. The film appears to be about how Rick sets the nobler part of himself free from the cynical veneer that he wears. In the first scenes, Rick rarely smiles. He is quick to lose his temper, doesn't expose his emotions, and appears only interested in the profitability of his restaurant-casino. A scene early on exposes the selfless part of Rick briefly, but he brushes it off and quickly re-dons his cynical persona like a worn overcoat. Victor Laszlo also begins to suspect there is more to Rick when he says that he is ""a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.""The episode that begins to bring that part of Rick back to himself is a former lover, played with magnetic emotionalism by Ingrid Bergman, who enters Rick's place after a long absence, escorting an important leader of the Resistance against the Nazis. I believe this portrayal may be the best romantic performance by an actress in a leading role I have ever seen. While at once feminine and gentle, Bergman is also highly resolved and dedicated to her cause. She is no wall-flower by any stretch. At first Rick appears tormented by her reappearance and a flashback to their love affair in Paris cut short by German occupation affirms the reasons behind Rick's attitude toward her return. (For a movie made during the war in 1942 to adequately depict how the German regime changed peoples' lives is one of several miracles that permeate throughout Casablanca.)Twists and turns throughout the story do not necessarily foreshadow the final choice that Rick Blaine makes in the end. And we find that Rick was always a hero, and every male in the world aspires to his heroism. This is one of the best reasons why, I think, Casablanca has become not only a classic but a cinematic masterpiece. We all want to make the transcendent choice that may not be best for ourselves, but best for others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""A Brief Encounter in Casablanca?""","The classic second world-war film of love, separation, missed opportunity and uncertainty in a world whose order is collapsing with each day.

"A classic, in romance, in story, in cast and everything else","Rick (Humphrey Bogart) once lived in Paris, before World War II broke out. An ex-pat American, he now runs a cafe, named after him, in Casablanca, Morocco. Its 1942 and many folks who want to escape Hitler arrive in Morocco to look for a visa to go to the United States. Not very many are successful. So, Rick sees desperate people every day at his establishment. Most of the time he is unmoved, as for some reason, Rick is a jaded fellow. However, he does come across a pair of valuable visas when someone trusts him to hid them in his piano player Sam's instrument. Not long after, ""THE WOMAN"", Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) comes into the place, asking Sam to play a song Rick has forbidden him to play. When he comes rushing to chastise him, he meets Ilsa. Flashing back, we learn that Ilsa had a grand love with Rick in Paris, just as the Nazis were getting closer and closer. Yet, when they made plans to escape on a train, Rick was jilted on the platform. No Ilsa arrived. Now, will Rick learn why this happened? Yes! Ilsa had a huge secret which comes spilling out, only to make Rick hurt all over again. In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard. It's a fine romance, with grand passion indeed. The story is a heart grabber and the cast is superlative. Made before anyone knew how long Hitler would remain in power, and at a time when he was winning the war, one sees how all of Europe wanted to escape his clutches. If you have never taken the time to watch Casablanca, don't delay. Almost every movie fan agrees that it is a top ten listing every time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Eyes Have It,"To get straight to the point as to why I don't give this special praise: it's obsolete. Not the plot - I mean the whole manner of storytelling. It's passé, where something like ""Citizen Kane"" still speaks to us.The center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.That said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. ""Here's looking at you"", indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.And how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous ""As time goes by"" and ""La Marseillaise"" are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.Worth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"visually stunning, a legacy of film","CasablancaEvery time I watch this film every other film makes so much more sense. Over the years Casablanca has been referenced in more films then I can count, everything from the Muppets and film to the Simpson's and television.I thought it was interesting that the entire film was shot in studio except the one scene at the start when Major Strasser arrives. This probably has something to do with the director Michael Curtiz who filmed primarily in the studio throughout his carrier, as well this was the common way movies were made in the early times of film. Michael Curtiz, a renowned Hungarian filmmaker, began his carrier in Hungary and Austria making silent films He later immigrated to America in 1926 and began a lavish carrier in Hollywood were he directed over 100 films including; Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Sea Wolf (1941), Mildred Pierce (1945), White Christmas (1954), and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) to list a few. He has directed ever genre imaginable and is consistently one of the greatest directors of the 20th century.The story Casablanca originated from the play ""everybody comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett & Joan Alison. It was later revised by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein, who added more elements of comedy to the story. Later Howard Koch began writing for the film in conjunction with the Epstein twins, Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements of the story. As well the unaccredited Casey Robinson added some important scenes. I felt that because so many people worked and contributed to the script it formed a balance of genres it mixed comedy, romance, drama, and politics. Each writer wanted to do something different with the script and when they all collaborated together we sort of got the best of what everyone had to offer.The director of photography on Casablanca was Arthur Edeson, who is well known as one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers. He is known for his work in film such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), and Frankenstein. Edeson is considered a pioneer of film and was one of the first to film a major wide-screen feature, The Big Trail (1930). Edeson enjoyed experimenting with light and different techniques. The dark film noir and expressionist lighting is evident in several scenes throughout Casablanca, particularly towards the end. When I watch the film the way the whole thing is lit and shot is fantastic the precision to details especially, for example in some shots throughout the film bars of shadows fall across the background and characters faces. This likely indicates their imprisonment, and emotional turmoil. It's details like this that makes Edeson one of the greatest DoP's in the 20th century, and makes Casablanca a masterpiece.One of my favorite parts of the film is were the Germans start singing ""Die Wacht Am Rhein"" and the French begin the sing Marseillaise I felt that was the most powerful scene in the film. I thought it was amazing because it combined music and visuals perfectly, as well the French Marseillaise was played by an entire orchestra not just a small band like in Rich's café the powerful music combined with the great camera work really captures and emphasizes the first time the Germans get defeated by Laszlo possibly foreshadowing the end of the film. Music is always an important part in film you can take a great film but with the wrong music it just doesn't work I felt the score in Casablanca, by max Steiner, fit perfectly.The casting for this film was excellent I could not imagine anyone else as the main roles in this film. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for this role; the chemistry between him and the lead actress Ingrid Bergman makes this story come to life. I find that dramas are always tricky to do you can have all the best filmmakers in the world but without good actors you can't have a good drama. Casablanca combined good actors with superb filmmakers to create an everlasting classic.Casablanca is a part of film-making and that's the truth you can hate the movie or love it, but it will always be one of the greatest films of the 20th century. I would recommend this film to every filmmaker because even if you don't like the story, the film itself is such an important part of film history that it is a necessity to watch. I think this is a great film more for the technical aspects of the film then the actual story, which I find a little dry and uninteresting. Overall I enjoy this film every time I watch it, and I am sure I will watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A lucky classic - ""When Corn works..""","Personally, aside from the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, not much left an impression. As Romance is a tad bland, and as a Political movie it's a bit dull. If it wasn't because of Claude Rains (as Captain Louis Renault), it would have fallen flat for me. I could elaborate, but it is completely subjective. Still, I can certainly see why, with the interesting structure and progress from a 40s script, it would be so memorable even with today's standards. And I did enjoy the relayed experience and information of a situation from so long ago. The lightning during the entire movie is probably the single best thing about it, specially for a black and white movie. The pacing is also impressive, which makes it watchable still today.It did entertain for the allotted time, but I'll soon forget it, I must admit (probably unwillingly).

Seen through a compatriots eyes,"One of my all-time favourite movies, I've now seen it over 20 times with no loss of admiration.For all the ""making it up as they went along"" hokum it's an ABC of Hollywood film-making, everything is perfect and perfectly in place - all you need to know to make a movie in fact. Although no imitators of course could hope to come close.The acting, the script, the witty dialogue, the music, the atmosphere, all come together into a marvellous blend, albeit with faults - what hasn't got faults? Maybe too much corn and the fast speed at which Rick's patriotism suddenly rears its head, but these are minor considerations. Everything can be forgiven at Rick's.It was dated the first time I saw 30 odd years ago, I think it is one of the few films ever made to have passed beyond that state, into a timeless world where all that is shown and all that happens on that screen is utterly believable - like a filmic fairy tale in fact!

Classic,"Seeing this movie for the first time, it is easy to understand why it is a much loved classic. The mise-en-scène is superb as is the acting and lighting and camera work. Even though, as with virtually all movies, the drama factor is a bit heightened by the compression of time (story vs. movie), it flows very well. The quality of the acting makes the characters are very believable and enduring. The way Bogart was lit during his close-ups to show the lines of his face, really conveyed his emotional state and Bergman always appeared to be on the verge of tears (no doubt thanks to a special lens or camera effect).While I knew the movie had been released before the end of World War 2, it didn't occur to me that actually meant the movie was in a position to predict the outcome (or to at least postulate a much hoped for conclusion).

The best film I have ever seen,"There is nothing I can say about Michael Curtiz's masterwork Casablanca(1942)that hasn't already been said by thousands, perhaps millions, of cinema lovers over the past 70 years. There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.,"This film is one of the best classic pictures I have ever seen. An interesting story line and compelling performances are what I found so attractive about this movie. Kudos to Curtiz. The set was nearly perfect and was very convincing. I felt the heat of the Moroccan town as the camera swept through the markets in the streets. I was amazed to hear that this was shot almost entirely in a Hollywood studio. I wouldn't have noticed unless I was told otherwise. The song ""As Time Goes By"" was moving even to a former punk/grunge rocker like myself which says something for its power.The topic is very interesting in that it deals with the mystery and intrigue of WWII and the efforts to defeat Nazi tyranny. A beautiful love story was also mixed in with the political refugee plot which held my interest for the entire length of the film. The dialogue was excellent, the best I've seen from the era. This picture was so well written and directed that it would have been great without big name actors and actresses but it was because of the big name cast that it has become the timeless classic that it is.Humphrey Bogart as ""Rick"" was stellar in his performance. I believed the character to be a heart-broken man embittered and buried in self-pity all hidden under the mask of congeniality. This mask is rudely removed by a bottle of liquor. ""You played it for her you can play it for me!"" is only one memorable and dynamic line from this movie that launched the Bogart cult and mystique.Ingrid Bergman as ""Ilsa"" was adorable. I could easily see why two men would both share a common love for her. I was enamored by her delivery and found myself sympathizing with both Rick and Lazlo for losing or almost losing her. This movie has sparked in me an interest for the work of Ingrid Bergman.This was a film I would recommend for anyone who loves the cinema. It has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Am I missing something?,"So I finally got around to watching Casablanca, one of the greatest movies ever made, or so I've always heard. Does it live up to its hype? In a word, no. It was maudlin and melodramatic; Ingrid Bergman was homely, no matter how many softening effects were used in the close-ups of her face (did a rodent gnaw off the sides of her nose? To say nothing of that masculine jawbone and those underdeveloped lips...); Humphrey Bogart was about as slick and charismatic as the Hunchback of Notre-Dame; and the story was undisguised war propaganda. One would have to have the mental age of 5 to think this movie was in any way great. Watchable, yes, but not great, and certainly not deserving of being on the IMDb top 250.The movie was fast-paced, which was both good and bad: good because it would've been unbearable to watch otherwise, and bad because it didn't give the viewer time to get attached to any of the characters (which is just as well, since as I've said, it was war propaganda and so the less effective, the better).Apart from a few good one-liners and patches of clever dialog, the only other positive thing I can say about it is that it was technically well made, in particular the lighting and the dynamic camera work (though I'm not personally a fan of this style of camera work, as I find it detracts from story and atmosphere). It was, however, irritating how the lighting would change whenever there was a close-up on somebody's face. What was the purpose of this? To try to mesmerize the viewer? Talk about corny.If you've never seen Casablanca before, don't feel you have to, because you ain't missing much, ""kid."" It's about as overrated as it gets.1 out of 10 stars, to offset the deranged ""I'm giving it 10 stars but I wish I could give it more"" reviews this cinematic mediocrity has been getting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Curtiz's Magnum Opus,"A film that is regarded as a classic from most but does it hold up for me? Definitely. Michael Curtiz is the director of Casablanca, who has done a mountain full of films including The Adventures of Robin Hood and Mildred Pierce. I came into this with high expectations, even in my subsequent viewings, as it has an established cast, a well known composer, a prominent director and an experienced cinematographer. The film is definitely excellent but some elements, due to nitpicking, sinks this film a little.The screenplay is developed by the Epstein brothers who had a reputation at their time, and with this project they seem to be in the top of their game. The film's story is packed, exploring a love story, a rebellion and the life of a citizens or immigrants in Casablanca. The film is generally well known for its love story but that wasn't the area that hooked me as I felt it was dragged by it's melodrama. The shifty and uneasy life in this desert city is what kept me hook and it dominates the first half of the film. It is from the start that the film establishes the importance of the city as a character along with the leading actors. The first and start of the second act is dominated with humor as a break from the main storyline which held my interest. I do not hate the love story but I just feel it doesn't hold up with me as compared to the more later love stories in Hollywood, Annie Hall, Vertigo and Beauty and the Beast. Then again, this is a product of its time and I can't frown upon it too much just because of that.This is the only film I have seen of Curtiz's work but it isn't the only one I am aware of. He is an underrated director and one of the hardest working. With Casablanca, he just got hold of a fantastic script which got the general public to really notice him. Curtiz wanted this film to move quickly but also giving key moments in exploring the relationship between Bogart and Bergman's characters.The year before Casablanca, Arthur Edeson did the cinematography for The Maltese Falcon and in that film, Edeson used shadows well and using lighting to create the mood of the scene. He brings it back here but more. This film is dark, for the most part as most of the intimate scenes took place indoors and at night. Shadow casts on scenes with Bogart and Bergman but at the same time not overshadowing the actors, especially Bergman's beautiful face as her beauty and vulnerability expressed by her face as both are important components of Ilsa. Edeson and Curtiz always have the camera moving, whether it is inside Rick's club or outside in the streets of Casablanca. It keeps the film at a pace that doesn't feel stationary and gives us a sense of exploration of the setting. This pace is also supported by great editing. In intimate moments, Curtiz really wants Edeson to have the camera get close on the actor's faces to not only have us focus on it but to create that sense of intimacy and closeness. Casablanca still has great photography, even in this day and age, and is an important piece in making it an iconic film.Max Steiner was nominated in 1939 for his iconic work in Gone With The Wind and he was also nominated a few years later for score in Casablanca. His work here in Casablanca is definitely something to be remembered by fan when remembering this film. This should have been an area where it definitely should have won the academy award but sadly it lost to The Song of Bernadette.For a film focused on the love story and is this intimate requires actors that bring that chemistry in order to create a memorable performance. Bogart and Bergman definitely work well together but I felt that Bogart is a little too old for Bergman. I would rather have the age of Bergman's character be nearly level with Bogart's and replace her with an older actress, but would the film still be regarded as a classic if the casting choices were different? I think so and I am only nitpicking. Both Bogart and Bergman bring it their all, even if the script is a little melodramatic they make it work for the most part. I definitely enjoyed Bogart's embodiment as this stoic and tortured character who distances himself from letting people in. Bergman has the more overly dramatic lines but she still delivers by showing emotion and care for Bogart's character. As soon as she was introduced in the film and meets Sam (Dooley Wilson), you can see that pain and sorrow rising to the surface. The supporting cast are fine and are either used for plot tools or comedic relief. The actors giving comic relief, especially Claude Reins, had me smiling every time they say something witty.A film that definitely still holds a strong place in this day and age and is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a fascinating story of a love story and an interesting take on the life of Casablanca during the second world war. It has its flaws but it's overshadowed by its strengths. Casablanca is definitely worth your time and demands repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca Review,"""We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night."" - Rick BlaineBefore, I wasn't really a huge fan of the romance genre. I don't know if it has something to do with the predictable storyline that always had a happy ending, dramatic moments that seem way too dramatic, or rehashing the same concept of love; it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, there was one film that made me change my views and to fully appreciate romance films, and that film was none other than Casablanca. It seems to have the same typical tropes that you would find in any other romance, but one thing that it did had that sets it apart from most romance films, and that is pure quality. What it ended up being is a beautiful looking and well-told story that has since became legendary.Set during World War II, the story centers around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate and former freedom fighter who now runs a successful nightclub and gambling den in the city of Casablanca. His seemingly peaceful life is then interrupted when his former lover Ilsa arrives in town with her husband, a resistance movement leader who's on the run from the Nazis, and asks for Rick's help to escape to Lisbon, so they can flee to America to continue their cause. Rick is reluctant at first, due to his bitter nature and cynical views on the world caused by his and Ilsa's past relationship falling apart, but now must make a choice between his former lover and a chance for hope as the fate of the war hangs in balance.For 1942, this was considered a landmark achievement in cinema history. The elegant black and white cinematography gives it a timeless feel, the story moves at a steady pace, and it's all accompanied by a beautiful and heartwarming musical score. Also, so many memorable lines that has become iconic.""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""The performances are all top notch, namely Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. However, it's the film's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, who really shines here. Bogart plays it with charm and has such a hypnotizing screen presence you just can't take your eyes off him. Rick, at first, may seem bitter and wants nothing to do with the world's problems, but you soon start to warm up to him when you know a bit more about him and how he once had a happy and peaceful life with the love of his life until it was taken away from him, leaving him cold and heartbroken. You can feel the same for Bergman's Ilsa; how she seemingly lost her husband, but met Rick and both lived a happy life, only to find out her husband is alive and, in haste, left Rick without explanation. You start to actually care about these two when you find out more about them.Overall, Casablanca still remains as a high-water mark of the genre that gets better with ever viewing. After over 70 years, this timeless love story still stands the test of time, and I do believe I have a newfound respect for the genre.""Here's looking at you kid.""Final Verdict: 10/10 with.... eh screw it, the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Classic in every sense of the word,"""Of all the gin joints in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine.""If there was only 1 movie that could be shown to show off ""classic"", old time Hollywood of the 1930's, '40's and early '50s, look no further than Michael Curtiz' 1942 classic CASABLANCA. While well known for the performances of the leads, the multiple quoted lines, Sam singing AS TIME GOES BY and the iconic ending, this film also is a time capsule to a Hollywood of another year - one that just doesn't exist today.Starring the great Humphrey Bogart in an Academy Award nominated performance (inexplicably, losing to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE), CASABLANCA tells the tale of Rick Blaine the owner/operator of ""Rick's Place"" a bar in Casablanca, Morocco in the early days of WWII. He is world-weary, beaten and cynical and is well known as someone who can get things done (for a price) but also one who will not stick his neck out for anyone. When a couple on the run from the Nazi's (Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman) enter's Rick's Place, Blaine (for reasons that are revealed in the film) decides to help.""Here's looking at your kid.""Bogart is marvelous as Blaine, you can see every inch of his world-weariness on his well-worn, craggy face. He is perfectly cast as Rick and his mannerisms and vocal patterns depict a heaviness within. Bogart is often criticized for his lack of acting talent - nothing could be further from the truth here. He is perfectly paired with Bergman as Ilse - a former love of Rick's, who is now the wife of Freedom Fighter Victor Laszlo (Henreid). There is real chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film and you can tell that they are former lovers that still has a flame burning inside.""We'll always have Paris.""But it's not just the leads who are terrific in this, it's the ""who's who"" of character actors that make up the Supporting Cast that really brings this film to life. From Peter Lorre to Sydney Greenstreet to Conrad Veidt to S.Z. Sakall to Dooley Wilson as Sam (who plays and sings AS TIME GOES BY), all bring interesting faces and characters to Casablanca (and Rick's Place) but the standout is Claude Rains (nominated for Best Supporting Actor - losing, inexplicably, to Charles Coburn in THE MORE THE MERRIER) as Louis, the corrupt Police Captain of Casablanca who becomes an uneasy ally of Rick's. Did I say that Bogart and Bergman had good chemistry? Check out the chemistry between Bogart and Rains, there was talk of a sequel to Casablance featuring these two - I, for one, would love to have seen that buddy flick.Director Michael Curtiz won an Oscar for his work - and it is richly deserved. Nary a shot is wasted on this film, each picture a rich black and white portrait. It is interesting to note that this entire film was shot in California (not Casablanca), mostly on the Warner Brothers lot, but Curtiz was able to give the look and (more importantly) the feel of the place through the sets, costumes, lighting and atmosphere.But it's the words that these characters got to say that really brought home the feel and atmosphere of the time, so credit needs to go to Screenwriters Julius and Phillip Epstein as well as Howard Koch who won Oscars for their work here. This is a masterful, classic work. One that stands up to this day. If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out - you'll be glad you did.""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Letter Grade: A+A rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Casablah...,"I found this movie mildly engaging, and that may be a gross overstatement. The characters are cliché, with very little depth. There is nothing I could see particularly insightful or original in this movie. It was as bland as a baked potato with no garnishings, not even some salt. Perhaps this is the type of movie that people who don't like to have to think to much, like. The plot is not so bad, it had potential, but seemed to be left to wither in the hands of a weak script and somewhat inept acting. Who is Bogart supposed to be, James Bond with a broken heart? Trying to put this ultra cool James Bond character into the ""real"" world, just doesn't work for me. I never really find Bogart's character believable, so I never really connect with the character. The catch phrase lines, like ""Here's lookin' at you kid."" are as profound as Schwatzenager's ""I'll be back"". If this was an action type adventure story like Raider's of the Lost ark, I could overlook some of these things. But this movie seems to be first and foremost a love story. And in that sense, I think it fails. I could go on with much more criticism of this movie, but I don't want to beet it to death. It is not an awful movie, more of a very light cute little thing.

Does a perfect job in blending the political scenario of that time (World War 2) and the ever pervasive love matters. Just 102 minutes movie but each second is entertaining. The clever-stylish dialogues keep it alive throughout. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman from their very 1st shot together, looks very natural. I wonder why they don't make such well developed movies today. Before watching the movie I did some other viewer comments saying it is all so boring but one thing they might be missing is that these were the movies from which directors used stuff again and again and that is why they look boring to us. But I guess we should at least respect them for this. A keeper, 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Great, but not flawless","I understand why everybody loves this movie and i do too, but there's some things i don't like about it.The biggest flaw is that they introduce some characters for five minutes or more and the characters almost never returns.I think the pacing is a bit slow.Humphrey Bogart was great as Rick Blain and Ingrid Bergman was great as Ilsa Lund.Back egen it was released it was one of the best movies of all time and it still is.It's greatly written, it's directed well and the cast is great.The screenplay is great.Overall it's an all time Classic and you should watch at least once in your life, or more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
one of those pictures that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it,"Roger Ebert once said that his definition of a classic is a film which one cannot bear the thought of never being able to see again. The film he was referring to at that moment in time was ""Casablanca"", the movie that has become so loved and cherished over the past sixty-some years that its affectionately labeled ""everybody's second-favorite movie."" And isn't it ironic that when the movie was made in 1942, nobody on the set even so much as dreamt that they were making anything special. Certainly they didn't believe their film would go on to become one of the most beloved in cinema history.""Casablanca"" is one of those movies that holds up so well because it has appeal to a broad variety of audience members. The movie's basic plot is a love triangle set in French Morocco in World War II. But it's so much more than that. It's a story about patriotism, about the defiance of Nazism, about the struggle of humankind's search for glory and freedom, it's a satirical and witty drama, its packed with characters so fleshed-out and strong that you couldn't forget them if you wanted to forget them.I think you get the picture. And this is not a review coming from someone who just wants to jump on the bandwagon and praise what people like to call one of the greatest movies of all time. Because I don't have to pretend. ""Casablanca"" really *is* that good. From start to finish, the whole picture of full of instantly memorable moments, lines of dialogue such as ""Round up the usual suspects!"" and ""Here's looking at you, kid."" that just lingers in your conscious for the rest of your days.But here's the ultimate reason why ""Casablanca"" has succeeded so well. This is one of those pictures that you can watch over and over again and never become tired of. Even after you know the entire story and have the entire movie practically memorized as I have, it's impossible to become sick of. Even after so many decades of existence, the movie has aged tremendously well and it's just as wonderful and enduring as it was when it was first released.Usually in my reviews I like to describe the power of certain moments of certain films, but I will abstain in this case because I don't want to give away the movie for those who have never had the privilege to see ""Casablanca."" But I will say this. Roger Ebert's definition of a classic is the quintessential way to describe ""Casablanca"" for it's also for me a film I couldn't bear the idea of never seeing again.""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the worldshe walks into mine.""

Casablanca,"In my opinion, it is a good old movie.Now I understand why I don't like current movies.Whether it is the main character or the side characters (i.e. Men), they are far from masculine and
perceive everything as a joke, they do not take everything seriously, etc.But I noticed that I saw at least 2-3 masculine men.If we take into account the old movies and this movie (Rick Blaine, Victor Laszlo and Captain Louis Renault, etc.),
we see that they all act with intelligence. But nowadays in movies they are all emotionally sensitive men.I liked this movie, I gave it 7 points because I like old movies.

Overwrought Wartime Romance,"Am I the only person not to like this film, or just the only one (almost) to say so? At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers. But this is not a serious film, whatever Woody Allen may think.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An unforgettable romance drama that has stood the test of time.,"Casablanca is cinematic perfection in every way conceivable. The dialogue, the plot, the acting, and the music are just a few reasons why Casablanca is a masterpiece. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical bar owner who is in love with a beautiful woman named Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, but the relationship is put in a difficult position when a love triangle forms. Rick separates himself from Ilsa, being reminded of the song Ilsa loved: ""As Time goes by"".I don't know even where to start! This movie has everthing! It has action, comedy, romance, war, and drama, all packed finely into one masterpiece that will not be forgotten! The script is fantastic as one can see because of the innumerable quotable lines in the film. The acting is superb as one can tell through the numerous stars in it, for example Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. With a cast like that, it is almost certain that there will be fine acting. The music, particularly 'As Time Goes By' is phenomenal.The movie of course has received critical acclaim. The movie has a 99% Rotten Tomatoes approval rating, and 100% Metascore, all of which I believe are suitable ratings for it. Despite some negativity in the reviews here at IMDb, this is a movie that must be watched at least once in your life. Any film buff, if it has not been seen, must see it. I am one myself, and I thus decided to watch it. It has been one of my favorites ever since. God bless all who read this and bye!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Iconic,"It's a movie so good that it's really impossible to review adequately. Everything is pitch perfect. It's a timeless classic for all the reasons. For the period, all the production values were top shelf. The acting transcends all generations.With the same actors, the same script, and all else the same except to film in high definition color, the movie could be released for the first time tomorrow and it would wind up a sweeper of the Academy Awards.The emotion of the period heightened the power of the movie. It was 1942. When the movie was first in production, America was not yet at war, but everyone knew it was coming, then it did, and so the scenes were as poignant for Americans as for the rest of the world still able to see the film at the time.For those who could not, their survival to see it later must have represented an epiphany as much as a catharsis.Some movies become engulfed by their legend.

War-time Romance,"Casablanca cannot be fully appreciated until its audiences realize just how much it relates to history. Being one of this movie's audience members of today robs me of exactly what the feelings of society were when this movie came out. During my cinema history class, we discussed the significance of this film which served great importance. Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdlesincluding facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II. Overall, this wartime romance and adventure is worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"As time goes by, the film will still suck!","WARNIG! Don't watch Casablanca because you will regret it, ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.""The biggest travesty and atrocity a kid could ever be inflected with, is when you're given the crushing blow that Santa is not real. Well take that dreadful feeling and then multiply it by a thousand, and you might just be able understand the heart wrenching pain that I felt after so many years of eager anticipation to watch supposedly one of the greatest films of all time, only to find out the hard way upon watching Casablanca, that the film doesn't live up to anywhere close to all the hype surrounding it. Trust me finding that Rudolf, the elves and Santa workshop didn't exist was a walk in the park compared to this!1941 was in the grips of a deadly second world war, but while the rest of Europe was going up in flames, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) was living it up in the sun, sea and sand of Morocco where he remained entirely neutral whilst cozying it up in a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. But trouble is at foot as the Germans come looking for a famous Czech Resistance fugitive leader by the name of Victor Lazio. But then to shovel another tone onto Ricks plate; ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" The love of his life Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) that once broke his heart returns to cause trouble again.Okay so what's wrong with it, gosh there is so much to point out, I'm going dizzy just thinking about it. Now I'm sat down, let me make it easier for myself, what's good about it...umm well? I'm stumped, I've literally scratched my head so much, I think I've left myself with a bald patch. The first blatant criticism is the rotten acting that leaves a wretched smell in the air and horrible unsavoury taste in the mouth. Like come on if I wanted to see such wooden performance I would go to a Shakespeare in the park where all the character are played by actual trees! Imagine how many times in the entire film did Rick ever show even a flicker of emotion in the film, the answer is (drum roll please) zero, cero and null. But this ain't an episode of who wants to be a millionaire and I'm not Terry Crews, so don't be expecting any cash prizes. Instead from Rick all you get is one long continuous monotone delivery of each and every line, which unfortunately to my ears sounds similar to a heart monitor flat lining. But don't think for a moment that Ilsa will resuscitate the morbid desolation that becomes of Casablanca at the hands of Rick. Because Ilsa has the habit of always turning smiles upside down, her character has no backbone and merely sways back and forth between both Lazio (Husband) and Rick like she were a hula skirt in the wind anytime she sees fit. In the entire film I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a single thought in the film that doesn't involve either one of the two men.However on a good note, while the acting was crummy, the words coming from their mouths were surprisingly rather good. I've used quite a few quotes from the film in my review because the dialogue in Casablanca was clever, witty and enjoyable to hear and thus quite right the scriptwriter pair of the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch received Oscar recognition for their exploits. Also what I do applaud is the way Michael Curtiz weaves into the film the ethos of always having the courage to resist and triumphing against whatever evil the world may try to put in your way. Anytime you see inside of Rick's bar it is constantly brimming with joy and happiness, which is a refreshing sight to witness when you consider that above all their heads is suffocating Nazi shaped black cloud. The best illustration of this is in the scene where Victor he spurs the customers in Rick's cafe to a deifying yet beautiful rendition of Marseillaise, effectively drowning out the chorus of Nazis singing. But don't confuse my compliments with me softening up to Casablanca, the film still sucks!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A good film, but not the best.","'Casablanca' is considered by some to be one of the best films ever made. I personally do not agree that it is the best film ever made. It is certainly a classic with the memorable lines and the dramatic ending and the relationship between the characters, plus good 'photography' and shot composition. Certainly, the soundtrack is brilliant, and it probably is among the top films in soundtrack alone.As a story and a film overall, my personal opinion is that this film is over-rated. Perhaps in the time it was made, it was among the best films. I think the majority of people would find the film tedious to sit through nowadays. (So, if you're in for a lot of action, you probably will not like the film at all.

Great cinematography,"This was a very good movie that highlighted an important part in history. There were many French citizens attempting to flee to America during World War II and in this film many were forced to stay in Casablanca waiting for a plane to take them there. During this period in time it was uncertain as to who would win the war. The photography in this film was awesome; there were many great lighting details and there was never a point where it was too dark where it covered actors and actresses faces. I noticed that shadows were especially never cast on female actresses faces and it was always shooting at the main actress, Ingrid Bergman, from the left side. This was great because her eyes were always glistening when the light was hitting her from that side. Even in Ricks cafe the lighting seemed natural as if you were sitting right in that very room watching everything take place.

"""We'll Always Have (Casablanca)""","A terrific and landmark piece in the history of film making. This movie is classic golden age Hollywood. Brilliant performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. Paul Heinreid does an okay job as Victor Laszlow. Serviceable. Probably the weakest performance in the movie, but he's more of a side character mostly. Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, is the true heart and soul of this movie. Torn apart between his cynicism over a lost love of the past, and his inability to guarantee anybody his loyalty, and his staunch neutrality towards all interpersonal matters, are what drive his character arc and growth in the film, and this is what makes ""Casablanca"" top notch as a romantic drama and a character driven plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overwhelming Perfection,"The widespread popular reverence for Casablanca is rooted not in innovation, but rather in perfection. One would be hard-pressed to discern anything particularly radical about the film's primary components. Though captivating in their own way, the story, the characters and the direction are modest and unassuming. Yet it is a modesty tightly wrapped in excellence and precision. Simply put, this is as good as conventional cinematic storytelling ever gets.During the height of World War II, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the impervious American owner of a Casablancan nightclub, serving as the epicenter of social unease in what is still unoccupied France. The unexpected arrival of Czechoslovakian resistance organizer Viktor Lazslo (Paul Henreid) and his dazzling wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) forces Rick to revisit his painful past and take sides in a war he had previously tried to ignore.The alluring, cosmopolitan backdrop of colonial North Africa compliments a remarkable cast of three-dimensional characters, who exhaust and renew their humanity amidst war's cataclysmic turmoil. Negative elements, including the unfortunate absence of native characters, as well as the demeaning treatment of the nightclub's black entertainer (Dooley Wilson, condescendingly referred to as ""the boy"" despite his advanced age), are not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming intensity of a truly exceptional film.

The movie that sort of saved my life,"The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.I hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work.Considering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation—well reasoned and timely— her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc.Michael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind.There's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue:We'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."" Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism.But just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this—according to the movie, crazy—world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day.

And of course, Bogart is massive in his screen presence. So, I was quite pleased to lose my 'Casablanca virginity', to put it fittingly!But I found it to have problems shaking the fact that it's a filmed stage play, which makes it move a tad too slow for its own good, therefore the dramatic elements feel very controlled, contained and lose vital impact.

Incredibly Dull,"What an incredibly dull film ...I've watched 100's of classic film over the past 30+ years, and the closest films this maps to are ""Key Largo"" (yes, a ripoff) and the ""Maltese Falcon"" (similar cast).Here's my breakdown:STORY:
Aside from this being a war-time propaganda film, the story has about as much imagination as a saloon: booze, arrogant men, and women being treated like meat.By contrast, the ""Maltese Falcon"" (1941), written and directed by John Huston, is a far superior film. As is so often the case, the poorer film gets a better rating.ACTING:
Humphrey Bogart had practically zero character range, and actual zero emotional range. The only film he broke from his useless tough-guy stance was ""The Caine Mutiny.""Ingrid Bergman's acting talents are wasted here, and Claude Rains (though I like him) always plays the same persona (like Bogart). Shame.TEMPO:
Slow, tedious, dull,CINEMATOGRAPHY:
It's a tour of drinking bars. Hooray.DIRECTING / WRITING:
The director had a massive list of film directing, but nothing I've seen or nothing that stands out. He started in silent film, and well, his talkies didn't seem to improve much.The writers weren't much more adept with a lot of war films, though Epstein's ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" was fun.Is it a very good film? No.Should you watch this once? Maybe, if you just want to say you watched it.Rating: 6.5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Awesome classic,"While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film: ""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment. It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried.

Interesting how many 0-to-1 stars this movie has...,"I love Casablanca as it is for me a flawless movie!Then I looked at the one-star reviews. Or better to say, people who really, really hated this film. It's interesting. Lots of reviewers hated the fact that the characters smoked so much. Hello, back then everybody did.Some hated it, because it wasn't shot in color. (haha)I learned, most of the reviewers don't seem to have any attention span whatsoever. They perceived the movie as too long. (102 minutes btw)
Anyways, the film is great, as it basically is about two plots.The ill-fated love between Ilsa and Rick. And the refugee subject matter everybody is in. So what has changed after some 60+ years? Try to watch it, if you haven't seen it. Casablanca is a delight. Fresh. Honest. Exciting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A comforting and reassuring delight,"Living in chaotic Britain in 2019, on the verge of a great societal transition, Casablanca re-instilled some faith in my bleak outlook on the near-future. It's been enlightening to finally watch this timeless film and realise how many times it is referenced across cinema. I find the audio in Casablanca very consoling because the hubbub of background noises are muffled, so my attention is solely taken in the soundscape of the current scene. And yes that may sound peculiar, but it makes me very relaxed!Looking at the other reviews, there is not much more to add besides the wondrous tingling sensation I felt when the café stands to sing Le Marseillaise to drown out the singing of the German soldiers, and the slightly comic repetition of Signor Ferrari swatting insects at the end of each scene in which he appears.To any people of Generation Z put-off by black and white films (or anyone at all for that matter) give up on the Netflix pulp and spend your time watching awe-inspiring films like this!PS: We'll ALWAYS have Paris.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Highly Recommended,"​'CASABLANCA' - 1942Directed by Michael CurtizStarring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul HenreidPlot Overview: ​Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, discovers his old flame Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) is in town with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a famed rebel, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country.I know, I know. It's quite frankly atrocious that it has took me so long to see this film. I say that because Casablanca is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I genuinely don't think I could name a flaw with this gem of a movie. It is a masterpiece and well and truly deserves its spot on the Film Hall of Fame. If you haven't seen it, then I highly suggest you do.So what do I like about it? The story was fascinating and interesting and intriguing in all senses of the world. And don't even get me started on that ending. That ending, which I of course won't spoil, is easily one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It is a testament to the magic a GOOD writer can make.Humphrey Bogart was exceptional as Rick Blaine. I absolutely adore this performance and the character is also truly amazing. Words cannot describe the authenticity and skill that Bogart projects onto Blaine. It is a performance that deserves A LOT more recognition by the average movie goer.Ingrid Bergman was, also, excellent as Ilsa. She didn't quite outdo Bogart in her performance but I would be lying if I didn't say she came pretty close. She manages to project so much emotion and trauma onto the audience in such a fascinating and spectacular manner.As far as the supporting cast goes, they were also exceptional. Paul Henreid was excellent as Victor Laszlo and added a very interesting and intriguing character to the already riveting narrative. Claude Rains was excellent as Captain Renault and provided an excellent humorous backbone for the movie. He wasn't necessarily essential to the plot but he was essential to the tone and final product. Dooley Wilson was also excellent in his unfortunately short run as Sam. Truly amazing performances from each and every single member of the stellar cast.For 1942, this movie is a technical wizard. The cinematography and editing were both incredible. The lighting is visually stunning and worked exceptionally well in the black&white environment. The music and sound effects were also excellent and the visual effects were truly admirable, especially considering the time at which they were created.As a whole, 'Casablanca' is a masterpiece of a film and I can HIGHLY recommend it. As for flaws, I can not name a single one. It is a work of art and should be commemorated for its massive contribution to film and the art form. Please, if you have not, see this film; I assure you that it is worth your time. I'll rate 'Casablanca' 10 'Half a Thoughts' out 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
cool baby cool,"Casablanca, does it reflect society or does society reflect this little hole in the wall resort? When watching the movie, one can't help but notice all the lines that just seem so cliché and yet fit so well into the story; is it because the coolest cat of them all (Humphrey Bogart) is delivering them? Is it because this movie is completely satirical in nature so it just adds humor to the plot? Or is it because the clichés we hear everyday have come from this movie all 10 + of them.Maybe not so much reason number 2 but definitely reason 3 and perhaps a little of number 1. Humphrey Bogart is THE definition of 'cool'; literally, look it up in the dictionary and his picture will be there. So when this swanky, hip guy says 'Here's lookin' at you kid' for the umpteenth time, it's acceptable because it's Bogey, and what Bogey does is cool, never overdone.This movie is set during WWII and is about a leader from the underground movement (Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid), his wife (Ilsa Lund Laszlo played by Ingrid Bergman) and the owner of a little café, (Rick Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart). It is about when they have a chance meeting in Morocco, some for a first introduction and others for a surprise reunion. Of course, there is a lovely flashback set to the lovers' song and the story of what happened years ago and how things have ended up the way they are becomes clear. As a 15 year-old freshmen this movie wasn't enjoyable, but 3 years later this movie is absolutely adorable and very much recommended as a 'must-see'. Berlin and Bogart has such chemistry and the story has such an interesting twist, it's hard to accept but at the same time that's how things must be. It leaves you with a sense of completion but at the same time uneasy because there are other possibilities that will never be fulfilled. 3 weeks later, the lost dreams are still irritating to this reviewer.American society is defiantly portrayed in this film, Humphrey plays a café owner that, 9 times out of 10, is doing something for his own benefit, but then he does something to help someone else and it just seems to completely mask the 'bad' things he may have done. For example, there is gambling going on in Rick's Café; there is a roulette wheel, in fact, a fixed one. This wheel is fixed so that Rick is getting more returns back and it isn't a fair game of chance. But then a woman in a desperate situation with a genuine need for money to save herself, her husband, and their marriage comes along and Rick gets soft. He then discreetly tells the woman's husband the winning slot number and color so that he can win money and they can get on to a better place. Rick saved that woman from a huge burden and it completely makes up for his owning a fixed wheel.This is much in the same way reflective of American society. As a country we are constantly doing what we need to get ahead in life, even if for some people it requires cheating or lying; much the same way we have tremendous powers over other countries we didn't get it just by sweet-talking. But other people will come along once in a while and hit a soft spot in your heart and there is an urge to do the right thing and help them out, much like a country will be in need and we'll help them out, hopefully in the best way possible.This movie is really a great one; it has love, danger, and politics, an interesting mixture of topics to keep every person interested in some way. Rated highly among movies it definitely has earned a top spot on this reviewers list. And if anything, it reminds us to help other around us make the best possible decisions for their lives, we need to follow Rick's example a little more often even if he does do a lot of dirty business he truly does care for those around him if they are good people.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Ignorance in Reviews,"I would like to say first that this movie is not super realistic or would I consider it the best of all time, but it is a very very good movie, despite some unrealistic factors, and I find it so ridiculous reading some of these comments from people who rate it with 1 star or something of the like who write about it as if they have never seen it. I read things such as ""Ilsa is seen almost jumping out of the plane to get to Rick"".. and i think ""did you actually watch the movie? or did you want to just say you didn't like it because everyone else does?"" You should really watch it before you write down comments about that make you seem like a child. Sure, some people don't like it because of the accents, the black and white, or for their reasons, but a lot of people do and you sound stupid talking about things that never happened in the movie. Black and white is okay in movies, there are a lot of good black and white movies, and a lot were made when colour was around but they wanted the effect of black and white. Directors and producers have their reasons, and the Casablanca would look stupid in colour anyways. Think before you talk because the people who like this movie, don't appreciate your useless aspects of a movie that you seem to know nothing about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hilarious,"I'm always baffled by the way that this film is held in such high esteem. Is this because it's old? Maybe it's because it's in black and white? Whatever the reason, it's certainly not because it's a great film. In fact this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Wooden acting by wooden actors on wooden sets, (what about that ridiculous cardboard aeroplane? LOL). Forget what people say about this movie. Ignore the romantic gushing. Why? Because it's just plain rubbish. It's not even good enough to be labelled a 'B' movie. Quite possibly it's a 'C' movie, if there is such a thing. Nope, they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"What a joy to watch those faces, those beautifully photographed faces! I just keep clicking the pause button, only to admire that magnificent angelic face of Ingrid Bergman.","The story? Humphrey Bogart had a short affair with Ingrid Bergman. The 2 lovers parted abruptly and never saw each other again, untill they accidentally meet again in Casablanca during World War II. Will love blossom again?Wanna see a real black and white classic romantic picture? Look no further than ""Casablanca"". I dont usually get easily excited about romantic movies, but ""Casablanca"" is definitely something else and then some! What a powerful alluring romantic story, photographed in a way that is just breathtaking. I mean I just dont know the equal of it. Ingrid Bergman just looks so magnificently innocent and angelic, that I just keep on hitting the pause button almost every other 10 minutes when there is another still shot of her face to be admired. All the characters though are photographed in a way that is just to die for. What a terrific still shots. Heavenly!BEWARE: All considered, there is not a lot of romance to be seen in this movie to be honest. I am not kiddin. This may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but ""Casablanca"" starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. NO romantic scenes whatsoever at the beginning. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength only at the very end. But at the end, oooooh, waves of passion can be enjoyed!Highly recommended. You got to at least give this classic a try, BUT BEWARE: you must be patient, because ""Casablanca"" starts out quite slow, so dont expect fireworks from the beginning, but it only gets better and more dramatic and romantic near the end.

the problems of two little people ...,"Everyone remembers 'As Time Goes By' (the song that only stayed in the film, so popular culture has it, because Bergman had cut her hair for 'Joan of Arc', and couldn't retake scenes using another tune) but there is much more to this world-weary romance.Bogart, of course, was hardly the usual romantic movie hero.  Which is possibly what makes him so perfect for Rick, in his Casablanca nightspot, on nobody's side.  He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) and Sidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contempt for Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives Conrad Veidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employees Dooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.Through all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the love of his life).  It is their story, but not the story you might expect.  This is the secret, I think, of 'Casablanca' and its lasting success.  From the moment we see the map and the film title to the 'beautiful friendship' line at the end, we're hooked.   Every performance is a lasting joy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I'm A Cynic So What I Say Doesn't Matter,"Once in a while you find yourself stumbling upon a film whose reputation precedes it . It doesn't matter what anyone on this site or out in the wider world says about it . CASABLANCA is a case in point . Anything I or anyone else writers here is entirely superfluous because any insight has already been said and anyone saying anything negative is instantly considered a contrition merely for the sake of it . CASABLANCA is cinematic legend . End of . It should be noted however that despite being broadcast on a relatively regular basis in the 1970s on British television it hasn't appeared very often in recent years . It might be wrong to point out that it was a mainstay in the top ten of the IMDb top 250 but nowadays it's sliding down the list as more people are exposed to it and perhaps think its legendary status isn't as deserved as it could have been . Perhaps I too belong to that campThe reputation means so many people have actually forgotten what the film is about . Slightly patriotic flag waver where the forces of democracy get one over on the vile Nazis , slightly romantic pot boiler , and very much redemption plot it's a film that does have a feelgood factor . The story revolves around Rick , an embittered cynic who is only interested in profiting from the war and as events turn out he's about to discover that there's somethings far more important than money . Everything could have been done a little bit better especially when you consider Michael Curtiz is very much a contender for best film director of the 20th Century who made a lot of differing genre films and was always very good at what he did . His problem was that his films weren't marketed for a bitterly cynical audience in the 21st Century and seem a little bit too old fashioned when seen today . That said the up side is you enjoy classic Hollywood with its emphasis on stardom , dialogue and feel good factor there's a lot to admire in CASABLANCA but you have go in to it with the certain knowledge that it's not quite the masterwork its legendary reputation suggests it isThat is the main problem with Michael Curtiz in general and CASABLANCA in particular . A film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES doesn't contain one single scene or line of dialogue that can be classed as realistic in anyway and a film like that which has lines such as "" Okay fellas let's say a prayer for a kid who couldn't run as fast as me "" would see pop corn and drinks thrown at the screen in 2014 . You have to meet these classic Hollywood movies on there own terms and sometimes cynicism gets in the way",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The best hollywood movie of all-time,"When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, I just say ""Casablanca"". It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as ""An Affair to Remember"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and even the most recent animated ""Sinbad"" movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or anti-hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Quality and popularity do not mean the same thing.,"People still come back for 'Casablanca' because it is familiar not because it is a film of quality. Everything feels so artificial and unnatural. The story itself is dramatic, but directing and acting make the movie overdramatic and melodramatic, no room for 'audience' to feel the emotion. Additionally, Louis who exploits women's desperation for sexual pleasure abruptly turns into a good guy without enough justification... that's bizarre and weak. Not impressive enough to be iconic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
a classic that's known to people long before they actually see the movie,"For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.And the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Casablanca gets better and better as time goes by!,"Saw this classic in DVD format the other night. I must confess that it looks just as good as I remembered it. Michael Curtiz's film is a curious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when it originally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered the picture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come will also be charmed by it.The story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will be something to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40s was a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, but perhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that era and the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party.In a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would be politically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell that Michael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablanca among the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into their conversations and the different schemes going on.Humphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsome male stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It would be hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. Ingrid Bergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Her chemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since they made it believable.The rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cuts quite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to this suave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault. Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K. Sakall, and above all Dooley Wilson, as Sam, made a magnificent contribution to the film in small roles.Casablanca gets better and better, as time goes by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It really does a great job of setting up the movie, allowing you to see what the atmosphere is like, what is the source of the event that sets everything in motion. Then, it just never stops beautifully showing us everything just as we need to know it. It reveals to us Rick's backstory slowly, but all in perfect timing. Honestly, it might be a perfectly paced movie. The dialogue is some of the best in any movie, period. Some of the most iconic movie quotes of all-time come from this film, such as ""Here's looking at you kid."" It's an amazing movie all around that will keep your eyes glued to the screen wondering what happens next.

Casablanca- A classic movie that must be seen,"Casablanca is included on the list of the top ten movies that everyone should see in their lifetime. This is a classic movie that is loved by many. The plot and genre is very appealing to many people and I believe that Casablanca is definitely worth seeing.The plot of Casablanca is a classic love story and focuses on a women torn between two men. This plot has been demonstrated in many other movies and books, but it is presented especially well in this film. Even for people who do not enjoy a good love story, this movie is still appealing. It takes place in Africa during World War II and can appeal to audiences who enjoy films in this setting. The plot depicts the trouble that people went through to come to America and be free during this time. Overall, Casablanca is attractive to all audiences and is accepted as a classic movie.To enhance the excellent plot of the film, director Michael Curtiz used many filming techniques to make the movie more appealing. The cast was carefully chosen and the actors and actresses did a very good job in depicting the characters that they played. While the film is older and there are not many special effects, Casablanca is still appealing to younger audiences today due to the plot, cast, and other techniques.Many other filming techniques used in Casablanca that help to enhance the movie include the use of sets, scenes, shots, and lighting. All of these characteristics must be present to make a good film and all are apparent in Casablanca. The lighting in the movie is especially well done to enhance the mood of each scene. Without even listening to the dialogue, a movie viewer is able to decide the mood being conveyed through the lighting of the set.Flashbacks are also an important part of this film. Instead of starting the plot in France when Ilsa and Rick first met, the writers began it when the lovers met a second time in Casablanca. Effective flashbacks were used to show the past and make the movie more interesting. Through the use of fading from one time to another, the film has more excitement and keeps a readers attention.Overall, Casablanca is an excellent film that should definitely be seen. The movie uses many good techniques to appeal to viewers and is a classic love story and war video.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Celebrated Wartime Romance Classic with some Serious Flaws,"I realize it's swimming against the cinematic tide to avoid gushing over this classic film. After all, its dialog, music and warehouse of awards, including 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (Best Picture, Director & Screenplay) single it out as one of the best films of all time. While it is certainly still enjoyable and contains a heart-rending love story, there are some aspects of Casablanca that relegate it to a less lofty pedestal in my opinion.Before considering my specific criticisms, bear with me while I go over some historical context. America had avoided entry into World War II in 1939 while Europe was overrun by the Nazi menace. By June 1940, Hitler had occupied Paris. In December 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the US declared war on them as well as their German allies. The day after the Japanese attack, production began on Casablanca. It was intended to be a patriotic gesture at its release in 1942. No surprise then that the Academy so enthusiastically handed out its top Oscars to this film. It was the right film at the right time.The first third of the movie is the most problematic from my perspective. These are mostly the establishing shots that are intended to give the moviegoer a feel for Casablanca and Rick's Café Americain. I found the dialog, acting and photography below par in this segment. Presented as a series of brief tableaux, the dialog is stilted and unrealistic, betraying its origins as an unproduced stage play. The photography in this portion and in some other segments (e.g., the Marseillaise vs. Nazi song battle) were clearly posed to capture a ""perfect"" moment. I found it jarring - other films of the era had abandoned this sort of interlude decades earlier. The model airplane used in several scenes instead of a real one was laughably bad.After the introduction, Casablanca picks up steam and moves to a satisfying conclusion. Odd because neither of them really wanted to be in it, the extraordinary onscreen chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is undeniable. So much so that Bogart's wife accused him of having an on set affair with his co-star. There are also many brilliant performances by other classic actors. But the unrequited love story is of course the true heart of the film. If you don't at least mist up in the final scene, you'd better see a cardiologist. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The most overrated film of all time,"Style?  What style?  This had no style, and the script was one cheesy line after the other.  It is the perfect soap opera, it fooled people to believe it is more than what it is.  And aside from Bogart and Bergman, the cast was overacting to an extreme. It all feels Disneyesque, with a touch of musical wannabe.  Also, I can't help but laugh at the special effects involved in this film, and the bad editing at times.  Talk about hurrying a film's production...Don't get me wrong.  I've enjoyed ""The Godfather"", the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""A Bridge on the River Kwai"", anything by Stanley Kubrick, and many others that are on the alleged ""classics"" list.

An extraordinary film from start to finish,"What I found most extraordinary about this film is the way it manages to engage right from the start. Within ten minutes, the plot had me enthralled, the characters had me emotionally committed and I was fascinated by the moral questions.How will Viktor Lazlo escape the Nazis? How complete is Rick's moral degradation? Is there any limit to the depravity of the Vichy regime's representative in Morocco? What happened in Paris between Rick and Ilsa? These questions are all addressed simultaneously as the action unfolds with hypnotic acting by both Bogart and Bergman and brilliantly tight plotting.Some of the other actors are not quite up to the standard of the leads, but I think this is the way films were made at the time, with broader acting by minor parts than we usually see in films today.So much of this film is now cliche, but that's because it defined modern Hollywood cinema and thus had a tremendous impact on Western culture. With some essential cultural artefacts, this ubiquity can make them seem a bit tired or over the top, but Casablanca is so perfectly pitched and moves along at such a wonderful pace that it transcends its own transcendence to be what Hollywood has always aspired to - pure entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Beginning of The Golden Age of Hollywood,"The sets, costumes and designs were absolutely gorgeous. Each shot in each scene was carefully composed and mathematically balanced, there was a symmetry to shapes and buildings and the way in which they were captured. The lighting was incredibly clean and succinct, objects were so smooth and defined I couldn't believe my eyes. I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday.

Why Does It Work?,"This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman is cold, confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives of the mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the much sought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - ""Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?"" Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome.

One of the greatest American movies ... ever.,"A true classic! Anyone who is a fan of movies must see this film. Simply one of the best movies of all time. Bogart at his absolute best. Great casting (reuniting Bogart, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, who played together so well in ' Tha Maltese Falcon', was brilliant). Absolutely one of my favorites. One of Bogart's most sympathetic characters, in one of the most quoted (and misquoted) movies of all-time. Simply fantastic movie-making from a great era in American cinema. This movie, and Bogart's character of 'Rick' most notably, are reminiscent of other great genres of American cinema of the time, like film noir and the hard-boiled detective story (of which Bogart was a mainstay at the time). Anyone who considers his or herself a fan of love stories, drama, or American cinema (or nostalgia) must see this movie. It is the quintessential 40's American movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Nobody makes films like that anymore!"" - Nobody makes such films because no one would watch them","I have a problem with all those hit movies of the last century. We were made to believe that we should adore these films, consider them masterpieces, but we don't really know why. In my opinion, most of these films are so adored because less was made in the past and every ""good movie"" was an instant hit. This love for these films has survived the years passed down from generation to generation, but nowadays it is impossible to watch these films.""Casablanca"" is just such a film. This film is an idealized greeting card for America during World War II, which was the country of the ""last hope"". There is some shallow romance, some intrigues, but it is all pointless. It is a bit pitiful to watch.What I can praise is the phenomenal-looking visuals. Each set is properly lit, the costumes are very nice, and the backgrounds are extremely atmospheric. Music also does the job. As a picture of those times, this film is phenomenal. However, watching it without any sentiment ""inherited from grandparents"" is a real challenge.I know that with such confessions I condemn myself to lynching, but it's difficult. Old movies are mostly mediocre.The progress in cinema that has been made over the last decades is enormous. Nowadays, films like ""Casablanca"" are not made, because no one would want to watch it of their own free will.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"If you haven't watched Casablanca, you are not born yet....","Casablanca is a movie which shows love in all together a different dimension.I have watched it more than 10 times and yet I can't even find a single scene which looks boring or repetitive for me.The movie is the best example of Love which really sacrifices.Thought this theme has been followed by many movies in last 70 years but its the story telling of Casablanca which makes it a movie which after age of 66 years still is best romantic movie of all time.In terms of acting, from A to Z it is a BOGART-BERGMAN movie, a tour De force of screen chemistry which hasn't been matched again.Yet during the filming I have read that the actors hardly spoke off screen.How professional,these days every screen couple becomes a scandal or most of time its a publicity stunt.Certainly Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman didn't need it because their acting speaks for itself.If I could mark more than 10, I would give it.Casablanca is not just a movie, its an experience.No one should miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Outstanding...,"Casablanca is the sort of film that suffers from its reputation. People walk into it expecting to see the greatest film of all time and are disappointed when it doesn't measure up to their own pet faves. But if it doesn't have the depth of some masterpieces, it is certainly among the most entertaining, with a brilliantly witty script, a superb cast and one of the most stirring scenes in all cinema, the so-called Battle Of The Anthems when Laszlo incites Rick's patrons in a recital of La Marseillaise. It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again. If you haven't yet, give it a try; it could be the start of a beautiful friendship.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The ultimate classic,"I believe it was Mark Twain that once lamented about his works being called classics, because in his opinion a classic is something that everyone respects but no one ever reads. Or watches, in the case of movies. To a certain extent I agree, because who other than English majors reads The Waste Lands or Heart of Darkness or Hard Times? And who really watches Citizen Kane or The Third Man or Casablanca for the entertainment value?Well, maybe more people than I think. The Third Man is a hell of a movie. For me, the first half or so of Casablanca was remarkably uninteresting, although the atmosphere created by the war taking place off screen is incredibly well done. I just hope I'm not becoming spoiled by modern film, that's one of my biggest fears.Casablanca is the last hope for people who can't get to Lisbon to escape from Europe as it descends into war, and because all of the dregs of European society (the people who can't afford to buy their way out) make their way by hook or by crook there, it becomes a sort of a prison where people wait for years for their chance to escape to America.The movie is so famous and such an enduring classic that it's almost impossible to write a review of it without mentioning some of the memorable lines, which are so famous that they have become a part of modern lore, like ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" and of course, ""Of all the gin joints in the world""It's hard to imagine the movie-making world in which the movie was made, but equally fascinating to learn that the people making the movie had no idea that they were making what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. It was a big movie, of course, but it was made on a relatively tight budget, which is something that I wish modern filmmakers would remember. Money has never been what makes great movies. Few people know that anymore.There is an intensely romantic story in the movie, what must be the best love story in a war film ever made, and it is remarkable how convincing and unpredictable it is. During the first half of the movie, it's easy to think that you can see exactly where it's going, which is most likely the reason I found parts of the first half slow and uninteresting.But soon there comes a point where you realize that you can't predict the ending. Specifically, this happens when we learn that Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) ""new"" love, the man for whom her romance with Rick (Humphrey Bogart  one of the biggest giants in film history) has to end, is really a good man.It's a strange love triangle between the three characters, one that many people may find morally repellent, but moving nonetheless. These are real people, not movie characters, and it seems that their amazing level of realism comes across on the screen so smoothly that it's almost by accident.Ultimately Casablanca is a story about painful sacrifice for the greater good, softened by the assertion that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. It's fascinating to consider the reality of that statement as we hurtle through the cosmos suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But as we try to find all the answers, it's nice to be able to look back to one of the most tumultuous times in modern history and see three people who know they have to suffer but know the reason why. So often we aren't afforded that luxury in real life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A magical movie for a magical night in Phnom Penh,"What could have been another piece of dreary American propaganda for WWII, turned out- by a strange piece of magic- to be a cinematic masterpiece, and ultimately a legend. Was it the director, Michael Curtiz? Was it the black and White photography, was it Dooley Wilson's haunting voice. Was it the superb casting? Who knows? but to think of anyone else playing the roles would have been insanity. Another Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Bogart or Bergman. Impossible.About four years ago I was travelling around south-east Asia and in Phnom Penh (in Cambodia) and one night I went to the Foreign Correspondants club. It was my birthday and I was on my own so I stayed for a few drinks. I then found out that the club was showing THE ORIGINAL Casablanca. The benches the audience sat on were wooden. There were geckos running around the ceiling, no air conditioning, and it was heaven. The visa pronounced vezay, the gloved hand holding the 'aeroplane' Sydney Greenstreet swatting flies.

Time Hasn't Gone By This Classic!,"I saw this movie in college 20 years ago with over seventy 18-23 year old fellow students. And the audience reaction was like the movie just came out yesterday. Here's a movie that assumes that the average audience has intelligence. And the tons of laughs were all in the right places for the right reasons. Twenty years later, I can still hear the laughter and applause...and the cheers; especially for that now classic closing line.If more black and white classics were given this kind of DVD treatment (the recent 2 disc release), then I'd own more black and white classics. Bogart's brilliant portrayal was ahead of its time and no one else but Bergman could of been Elsa. Same for Rains, Henreid, Sakall, Veidt and EVERYONE else. Perfect cast, perfect acting.It's a shame most people will never see this with an audience because this is a crowd pleaser if ever there was one.

This one film has more great 'one liners' than some hundred movies put together. And it still seems as fresh today as when...well; when I saw it the 1st time.It's not that ""they don't make em like this anymore"" applies to 'Casablanca' because most movies, for every year, in every era (since the 1920's); aren't very good. It's always the very few that rise above the heap, every year; especially when you take into account that over 100 movies are made every year.

Very Good Film With Unforgettable Dialogue,"'Casablanca' exceeded all my expectations, when I watched it this morning! I mean before I didn't think I would like it at all, but I know it's revolutionised cinema, and I can now see exactly why. I watched this film in my Film Studies Lecture at Kingston University with about 200 other people. I haven't seen many films that are that old, but I now appreciate that these films were for another generation, and used all the technology available at the time to it's fullest, and if it wouldn't of been for these films, we wouldn't see the sort of films we love today. I thought Humphrey Bogart was extremely good in this film - he came across as a very cool character, and by the end I wanted to emulate his unforgettable lines such as: 'Here's Looking At You Kid', and of course the very final line in the film.

You Must Remember This!,"CASABLANCA is a movie about love and virtue, heart and mind.As time passes this movie gained the name of one of the biggest Hollywood movies of all time. Overall, I wonder what's so special. Average war drama characteristic of that period on the one hand and the perfection of the relationship of film segments from the other side. When all gather and take away, I find myself thinking that the Casablanca is damn good movie. Heartbreaking, great war drama thanks to its spirit of moderation and memorable roles. Great film about humanity and cynicism in the war-torn North Africa. The average movie, but probably remarkable human story. Here and there, there is a certain lack of logic and a lack of cohesion, but the action is smooth, clear and fast so it's almost impossible to notice. The plot, or the outcome at the end of the film is simply magical. It's risky, sad or politically unacceptable. So many tears and emotion, and yet the end is relaxing happy. I think the film would be even better if he had not had to deal with censorship. Music and cinematography are really impressive.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is bitter, cynical American expatriate. Features are there for a reason. Compassion, romance and sentimentality come with a story The focus is on Bogart's character, but that does not diminish the fact that it is a great performance.Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund at its best and the strongest role. She is the mistress and faithful wife at the same time. Her appearance in the film is captivating. Tearful eyes while she accepts the voice of reason and at the same time resisting his heart is impossible to forget.The chemistry between the main actors is incredible. Although the stage lights shining Bogart and Bergman, a whole range of supporting characters is simply extraordinary, and among them leading Claude Rains in the role of the charming, corrupt French captain.Casablanca is a great blend of melodrama, intrigue and humor.

The Most Beautiful Movie of the Cinema History Ever,"In 1942, in World War II, Casablanca is the escape route to America for a few wealthy or influential people and limbo for many others that wait for a chance to raise money and get a visa. The expatriated American and former idealistic rebel Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns the Rick's Cafe Americain, the most famous nightclub and casino in the French Morocco's town. Rick is a bitter and cynical man that neither drinks with costumers nor involves with women, and does not stick his neck out for anyone, keeping a neutral political position in times of war. Rick has a good relationship with the corrupt French Chief of Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who is bribed to cover the existence of Rick's casino and protect the place. When two German messengers are killed and the valuable letters of transit in their possession are stolen, the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) arrives in Casablanca seeking the document and the Czechoslovakian leader of the European resistance Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The Germans believe Viktor will try to buy the letters of transit and escape to America. Meanwhile Rick's acquaintance Ugarte (Peter Lorre) asks him to keep the letters of transit for a couple of hours, but is captured and killed by the police and the Germans. Later Victor arrives in the Rick's Cafe with his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and when she sees the piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), she asks him to play and sing ""As Time Goes By"". When the upset Rick complains with Sam for playing the forbidden song, he sees Ilsa and recalls their romantic moments in Paris and the wound in his heart when Ilsa does not leave the town with him without any explanation.""Casablanca"" is the most beautiful movie of the cinema history ever and the number one of my preference. I do not know how many times I have watched ""Casablanca"", but since the first time I have fallen in love for Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart and they became my favorite actress and actor. Further, I feel myself emotionally affected every time that I see this film, maybe expecting Rick to stay with Ilsa in the end. But Rick's sacrifice for love is certainly one of the reasons that made ""Casablanca"" an unforgettable masterpiece, maybe the most romantic film ever made. The sequence in Rick's Cafe with the French costumers singing La Marseillaise causes goose flesh on me  imagine in French people! The wonderful romance is disclosed through a magnificent screenplay, with memorable and witty dialogs, perfect development of the characters and the geopolitical situation of Casablanca in 1942 in a dramatic environment of war and a stunning chemistry of the leading couple. The direction of Michael Curtiz is amazing, using closes, shadows and exploring the talent of the cast at their best with the support of an awesome black and white cinematography. The music-theme is among the most well-known in the world. In the end, ""Casablanca"" is the perfect movie, and Rick and Ilsa will live forever together in my heart.

Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character.

"Here's looking at cinema-perfection, kid","Out of all the films that are considered classic milestones in cinemahow many fully deserve that status?? Not that many, let me tell youbut Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first timeyou'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be deniedCasablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retiredthis film will move you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Here's lookin' at you, film.","Overall, ""Casablanca"" went a little overboard on being pro-American, but certain traits make it worthwhile. The plot of course has American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owning a Cafe Americain in WWII-era Casablanca and meeting ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).Much of the film's strength lies in its dialogue. Rick says ""I don't stick my neck out for nobody."" Alone, this helps the audience understand what kind of a person he is, but the movie also shows his other side. When Ilsa comes to the café, Sam (Dooley Wilson) tells her ""A lot of water been under the bridge."" This alone is enough to describe not only Rick and Ilsa's life, but also the events that had come to dominate the world during the past few years.As for the other characters, Paul Henreid plays Ilsa's husband Victor Laszlo. Even though he has been fighting the Nazis, one wonders how much value he has in life. Capt. Renault (Claude Rains) is amoral but we grow to respect him.

Good. That is all.,"Casablanca is a difficult movie to review because there is nothing particularly wrong with it, but also nothing particularly excellent. It is more about whether or not you like its style.Its style is very misty-eyed. The insisting violin vibrato in the high register tries to cut into your heart, as the main hero talks harshly to the damsel, but inside we all know that he really loves her. This film is a lady who sighs as she holds her wrist against her forehead in a gesture of fainting.The film deals with the events of a refugee crisis and anti-Nazi resistance, but the movie is really about the relationship and conversations between the main characters, and to its credit those interactions are good. The film explores the sacrifice and internal turmoil of the two leads in the situation they found themselves in.The movie is the set for 2 heavyweights of their time: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. If you know that guy, then there is nothing for me to say, as you already know what his performance will be like, but if this is your first introduction to the guy, Bogart is the poster child for over-stylised acting that was so persistent in the first part of the 20th century, though this is probably one of his best roles, requiring the tortured-poet attitude, with a dash of cynicism and vulnerability, which no one can deliver better than him. But it's like the creators wrote the main character to be Humphrey Bogart. An actor should bend himself to become the character and not the other way around. Bergman is far more interesting. Her facial expressions speak volumes, and her method is much more subtle. A camera hangs on her face for almost a minute straight and she is able to fill that time with life. The most interesting performance is probably by Claude Rains, who plays an opportunistic French officer.Some of the dialogue can be witty. I am not sure I understand why certain lines became famous. ""Here's looking at you"" seems witless and artificial. It's like when a teenager trries to make a catch phrase stick. When the writing is not sappy and not trying to be cool, that is when it is at its best.The fog and shadows provide a moody atmosphere. Framing is used to show distance between characters, until those barriers are broken down. It is of course an excellently shot film.Casablanca is competently made but there is nothing that strikes as particularly special about this film. There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching a good quality film, but all the hype that makes this movie out to be the best ever is really unnecessary, and if you dislike the overacting of the 40's, this may be a difficult watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A temporary panacea against passivity and a delightful victory of hope and love told through a genius film,"I've heard about this movie countless times before but I've only decided to see it while reading the analysis of a scene from it in Robert McKee's ''Story''.

"Great, Classic Movie.","My dad loves this movie. He truly loves it. He has tried to get me to watch it with him many times, although, I'll admit, I have been resistant. He even says that it is his favorite movie of all time, despite having it come out more than a decade before he was born. I did like it. As always, I tried to pay attention to as many details as possible, and also, as always, I found it easy to find my favorite characters (Both of them more minor, in this case). I was not particularly fond of the topic, mainly because I at first did not see much conflict in the movie, but I understood it further as I went on. I did admire some of the shadow work throughout the film and Humphrey Bogart gave a great performance. I personally greatly enjoyed Sam, the Piano Player, and I thought that the romance that occurred between Rick and Ilsa was a nice touch. In conclusion, I say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and that it is a classic movie for good reason, I also greatly enjoyed the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"This is a fun movie, but it is not art.","Who can't help but to like this film? It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say ""better than"" not ""that I like more,"" nor ""that you like more""). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than ""I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!"" Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.For a better, deeper critique of what is wrong with this film, I suggest reading Umberto Eco's essay on it. It is (I think), found in How to Travel with a Salmon or Travels in Hyperreality.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
21 year old male opinion,"I saw this film for the first time when I was 17 years old and I rented it because I felt it was something I should have seen already.  I liked it and was surprised by how much of the film I had already seen in various forms of homage and mimicry (probably more lines have been immortalized in Casablanca than any other film).  But that was about it.  I saw it again when I was 19 years old and this time it blew me away.  The performances, the writing, the cinematography, the direction, and the music all seemed perfect.  I watched one more time a little later to confirm that this might be one of the best films ever, and I liked it even more.  I can't necessarily give specifics, but maybe it's the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, or maybe it's the outstanding supporting cast.

An Absolute Masterpiece,"Casablanca is without a doubt a masterpiece, in every sense of the word. It is extremely well known with many, many people having seen it and even more having heard of it. Throughout the years many films have been called a ""masterpiece"" and have stood against time and retained their popularity. However very few films, Casablanca included, have not only survived throughout the years but have thrived. This film accurately depicts the stress and anxiety of those trying to survive the Nazi's during World War 2.

The greatest movie ever made.,Regardless of Bogart only receiving one Oscar in his lifetime for The African Queen this to me is the quintissential Bogart movie and every actor in it probably did his/her best work including Claude Raines as Capt.

"Layered, vibrant and sometimes quite dark; a charming and charismatic classic film-noir.","There are some undertones of male dominance to the romance that don't necessarily work, especially considering that there's only one proper character involved, but the rest of the picture is a layered, vibrant and sometimes quite dark portrayal of a unique setting that's heightened when you remember that the flick itself was made long before it was clear that the Nazis it portrays weren't going to win the war. 'Casablanca (1942)' is a cynical but well-drawn piece with a gruff lead who's callously charismatic and charming in that straight-talking kind of way. It manages to make you care for quite a small story while highlighting that, no matter how insignificant it may actually be in the grand scheme of things, it means the world to the characters caught in the middle of it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"truly great, truly satisfying","Ingrid Bergman & Humprey Bogart co-star in this drama of early WW-II intrigue that was nominated for 8 Oscars (& won 3: best picture, screenplay, actor). Its supporting cast was magnificent and huge (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, Dooley Wilson). ""Casablanca,"" at this moment, ranks #16 of IMDb's All Time Best 250 films and it's also on Roger Ebert's list of Great Movies.It's a tale pitting those who are (or have been) active in resistance to the Nazis mixing with those who are just trying to survive by hook or crook AND officials of Nazi Germany as well as those French officials with mixed loyalties to occupied vs. unoccupied France.Rick (Bogart) was active in the French resistance to the Nazis during which time he met and fell in love with Ilsa (Bergman). Hurriedly fleeing the Nazi occupation of Paris but feeling unexpectedly deserted by Ilsa's failure to accompany him, Rick's moved into a 'survivalist' mode in French Morocco.Ilsa has a husband (Henreid) with whom she's reunited after believing him to be dead; the couple show up unintentionally, unexpectedly, in Rick's café, searching for passage to a safer place.Claude Rains' performance, in his role as the head of French military/ security forces in Casblanca, gives THE most pivotal of all performances in elevating this film into its stellar level in the opinion of some (see comments to this effect in the Message Board for this film). After reading and reflecting on this, I fully agree.IMO, Ebert's review is VERY worthwhile & helpful (see IMDb's ""External Reviews"" of this film, then click on Chicago Sun-Times/Ebert's). In that, among other things, we learn the narrative/dialog wasn't written until they filmed it so Bergman (& others) didn't know the outcome until it was actually shot.Also, IMDb's Bio on Dooley Wilson (""Sam, the piano player""--see IMDb's ""Cast""/""bio"") shows us that his career took off after this movie.Sam's music in the café was seamlessly integrated into the narrative and becomes, essentially, a great, additional, supporting cast member.I don't recall Bergman ever being so lovely--but how in the world did women of that time pack and travel with those hats?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"I'm not quite sure why so many people like this movie.  It must be from decades of being told by the media that it's a great movie.  But it's very hard to ""enjoy"" it.  I could not connect on an emotional level to any of the characters.  I got the feeling the director was trying to create sympathy for Bogart's ""Rick"" but it's hard to feel anything for a self-abusive, chauvinist, murdering, adulturer who never sees the error in his ways.Every character except Peter Lorre's ""Ugarte"" is a cliche and overacted. Hollywood could only have gotten away with this in 1942.  If anything this silly was produced today, it would be laughed right out of the theatre and onto video in a just a few weeks for being so unbelievable and ridiculous.And what does ""Here's looking at you, kid."" even mean?  It's just another stupid, catch-phrase that has no real meaning.Maybe this movie's popularity was related to the anti-Nazism of the time.  I don't know.  I wasn't around then.

A classic of classics,"Well, after sitting on my shelf for years, I finally watched Casablanca. As a young movie viewer, I have little experience with black-and-white films, so I was a little unprepared for what would happen next.Casablanca is a Rom-dram set in Africa during World War II. It was also made during World War II, during a period of heavy fighting. Nowadays, it's like a time capsule from the most violent period in modern history. But enough with the history, and on with the film.The first half hour was very faced paced, plot wise. Lots happened quickly, demanding your full attention. A viewer has to pay very close attention to figure out what's happening. However, it does slow down into a more gently paced movie. I'm not sure if that happens with all old movies, but very rarely nowadays will so much happen at the beginning of a film.The acting is great. Rick's presence on screen is felt by all, Humphrey Bogart did an unrepeatable job as the stern yet sentimental hero. Everyone else plays their roles well, but it was hard for me to really tell what is and isn't good because acting has changed over the years. It seems that old movies have very dialogue-based acting, whereas new movies have action-based acting.Speaking of dialogue, it becomes very apparent that Casablanca's is special. There's a reason it has the most number of famous lines on AFI's 100 lines list. But that's all I can say about that.Lastly, the plot. *No spoilers* After the first 25 minutes, the plot becomes coherent and the story is very enjoyable. The pacing is very good, so the film never drags. The ending is very nice, and the buildup to it has several twists, some you will see coming, others you won't.Ultimately, Casablanca is a classic film any cinema aficionado should see. 8.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, ""Play it again, Sam"". The line is in the movie itself.","To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, ""Play it again, Sam"". The line is in the movie itself.This movie is revered by many and indeed comes out as a great love story, but in fact apart from few minutes of a montage or a flashback, it never really revealed how they did fall in love, they here is the hero and the heroine. The protagonist, is apparently not a human here but they are the transit papers that drive the whole story and to get hold of them will be each character's will. Played extremely well by all the characters involved, the acting is a text book for many aspiring actors even today and shall be there forever. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund just paints the screen with her eyes, so well captured those eyes are that they made me desire for them and to have a faint touch of those to wipe those tears. This movie shall always be a tribute to her. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine has done well and what I learnt from him was how to be expressionless and to derive an expressionless face also needs an extremely tough expression.The writing is pretty accurate but the reasoning's are minimal, why a certain character behaves in a way is not completely revealed in the film. It is highly unconventional a love story for 1942 coz, Ilsa is seen kissing Rick many a time as he is the one she loves but is not by Victor Laszlo, the man whom she is married to and the man who loves Ilsa the most. That is an irony and brings an uncertainty to the way characters act. One scene where Ilsa and Rick are in Paris, embracing each other breaks up where they have to part and another scene turns up that Ilsa is manipulating Rick later to escape the country and even then she says that she loves Rick only. That is an inconsistency I observed but nevertheless, the story she reveals to Rick as to whom she was and what has actually happened to her makes up for it. But for today's viewers most scenes may seem like to have been cooked up and not so fluid and even I felt the same, the climax escape which Rick sets up is a bit truly altruistic and actually not very much appreciated by me. If I love a woman, she comes back I would rather stick with her then let her go again. My love is of prime importance to me but here, Rick has other plans so I did not like the climax much had it been the other way portraying a selfish human being as protagonist, surely the movie may not have received this much appreciation.The music is excellent and the one song As Time Goes By is poignant and relevant to the movie narrative and even for normal reference. That is a high point apart from the acting of the film. The cinematography was simple and so are the settings which are mostly shot within studio.So thus, I would say, this movie accounts as a great one by many and is loved by many more and I would love Ingrid play the role again and again too. But writing should have been tight and the characters should have been driven by selfishness rather than selflessness.My Rating 3/5. A good one to watch for sure but not the greatest for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Amazing directing, script, acting","It's been a few years since I last watched Casablanca, but it is as good as I remember. Curtiz's direction is remarkable. The beginning scenes set the movie up beautifully, and everything moves at an almost breathless pace. It is a movie that moves fast yet never exhausts, always able to slow down for a moment and let the audience breath.The script is one of the most quotable in Hollywood history, full of memorable lines and sharp, witty dialog. The plot is engaging, constantly moving and turning.The acting is uniformly excellent. Bogart is the center of the movie, offering that classic jaded white knight Bogie. Bergman gives one of her best performances as well. Even small roles are beautifully done; Peter Lorre makes every second of his time on screen count. As for Claude Raines, he is so utterly perfect that he would have stolen the movie entirely if he hadn't been up against Bogie.All that being said, I love some parts of Casablanca more than others. The early scenes are incredible, the finale is genius, but the Paris scenes, while necessary, feel a little slack, and Paul Henreid is a little bland for a charismatic resistance fighter.But those are minor quibbles. This is still one of the greatest movies of a great decade for movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good movie,"Having often heard this title thrown around for years it does live up to its hype. This takes place in the south of France during WWII. The main character is an American who has chosen to start up a club in the city of Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart plays Rich, the American as he is split between choosing the love of his life or saving her and her husband who is a resistance fighter against the Nazi's. The movie was a little controversial because it was released to the general public after the attack on Pearl Harbor and after we entered the war against the axis powers; but before we knew that we were going to win the war.This is reflected in the movie and shows our hopefulness as by the end of the film Rich chooses to step up and fight against the Nazi's as he once did before opening his club.I believe this was a reflection of the WWII era as his actions reflect the action the USA took during the years prior to Pearl Harbor. What I mean by this is during the early years we would sell guns and supply the allied powers with aid but when the war came to our doorstep we stepped up and did what was right. I think movie goers at the time really enjoyed this movie for that reason. Overall I would have to say this was a very good film for the earlier 1940's era of film making. The use of light in the film was done brilliantly as an almost precursor to the Film Noir genera which would come later in that decade. By this I mean the use of light to set the mood of the scene as either a dark gloomy feel with very little light and the use of shadows to open shots with much light to show a lighter more comical side of Rich.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

When movies were movies.,"Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets.

Iconic masterpiece.,"Out of all the black and white classics that i've seen, Casablanca was one of the best (close with Psycho, It's a wonderful life,
Citizen Kane and To kill a mockingbird). The fact that this movie is from 1942 blows my mind, it's one of the roughest years ever, due to the war and the pearl harbor attack. So it's so impressive a movie of this caliber was released in the same year. It's extremely well made and every scene is so detailed and well thougt out, brilliant cinematography.The cast is amazing and they all deliver excellent performances, especially Humphrey Bogart who proves why he's called one of the greatest ever. I have to mention that some of the cast are real nazi refugees and the fact that they were able to create a masterpiece is mindblowing because it's literally a movie created during the war, about the war and it's made with people from the war, stunning stuff.The screenplay is where this movie truly stands out, Casablanca's got some of greatest dialogue in cinema history and it's probably THE most quottable movie ever made.Casablanca is a simple but brilliant story of a man who is willing to sacrifice the thing he loves most for ""The greater good"".It's is a true icon for all of film industry and a must watch for all film lovers because it's not just the best and most infuential romance ever, it's one of the greatest and most admirable movies ever made.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
As Time Goes By... Casablanca Refuses To Age.,"A couple of years ago, romance used to be my least favoured genre for every film I'd seen until then had a predictable storyline, over-the-top melodrama, the same repeated idea of love & nothing much happened in them plot-wise throughout the runtime. The exceptions were too few but they were so because of reasons which had nothing to do with romance.Not much has changed in the past two years but having come across some extraordinary films in that time, including 2013 releases like Richard Linklater's Before Midnight, Spike Jonze's Her & the Palme d'Or winner Blue Is the Warmest Color which made me see this genre with an entirely new perspective, I do have a new-found respect & appreciation for romantic movies.Now Casablanca is a defined, engraved & universally embraced masterpiece. In my opinion, it too has a predictable storyline & some melodrama but then, it also has something that typical examples of its genre lack... and that's quality. Whether it's direction, writing, score, camera-work, cast, performances or narration, Casablanca writes a new chapter in each one of these departments.Set in the titular city during World War II, the story of Casablanca concerns an American expatriate & former freedom fighter who now runs the most popular nightclub & gambling den in the city. Things are set in motion when his old flame arrives in town with her husband who's a renowned Czech Resistance leader wanted by the Nazi & asks for his help but he's got plans of his own.Directed by Michael Curtiz, this one film engraved his name in the annals of cinema for it is expertly crafted from start to finish, is filled with memorable lines, introduces its characters wonderfully, is crisply photographed in black n white which provides a timeless sense to the story, is steadily paced throughout its 102 minutes of runtime & features a heartwarming, mesmerising & evocative score.Coming to the performances, Casablanca has a pretty huge supporting cast but it's the top-billing of Humphrey Bogart & Ingrid Bergman who deliver the film's strongest performances. Bogart plays his role with effortless charm & has an infectious screen presence while the ever so beautiful Bergman leaves a lasting impression with a sensational work that's also the most memorable & finest work of her career.On an overall scale, over 70 years have passed since this love story made its debut on the silver screen & yet, Casablanca has neither found an equal nor aged a day. Just like a good old wine, this timeless classic is only getting better & more profound as time goes by, continues to inspire & influence various works of romance even today, and it looks like it is going to remain a benchmark for its genre for a foreseeable future, if not eternity.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible luck or Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic,"Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the play ""Everybody Comes to Rick"" by playwrights Murray Barnett and Joan Alison. Happy May Day, comrades! It's time to go outside and clean up some of your own home. Is not it? So I think so. And since May has come, this month I traditionally watch military films, and then I decided to get to this cult classic, which occupies the highest lines in the lists of the best paintings, and is not inferior in popularity to the most modern megablockbusters. And although I have already pricked myself several times because of this, nevertheless I cast aside doubts and looked at this picture - and I was not disappointed, in large part. And here's my brief opinion - Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic. Despite the fact that I liked the picture, I will consider both its advantages and disadvantages, which I could not do without. At this point, let me finish with the introduction and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the action of the picture takes place in Casablanca - the port city of French Morocco at the end of 1941, which is ruled by the dictatorial regime of Vichy (after the defeat of France in 1940). Casablanca serves as a transit city between refugees from Europe and the New World, where all these unfortunates are trying to get, using money and power. Of course, there are also cunning businessmen in the city who make fortunes out of these people. Corrupt police. And here the cafe ""At Rick's"" is comfortably located, which is popular with all this public, since its owner does not meddle in politics, and does not attract unnecessary attention to himself, on a short leg with the prefect of police. But the war pushes both opposing sides together in his institution, and then forgotten love lights up with renewed vigor. How should Riku proceed now? Which side to choose? What will his heart decide? What will be the ending? There is drama here, but not much, since the script focuses on the romantic line of the characters, and everything else is just a background for the development of events. The script is simple, but attractive in its simplicity. And although the ending is obvious almost from the very beginning, you are still interested in watching the picture. There were no shoals and logical holes. I am already silent about dialogues and cult phrases. Therefore, to while away the evening is definitely suitable.2. The romantic line is definitely good. Yes, a reflection on the lost love, yes a love triangle, yes cliches, yes predictability - but the dialogues, ""spark"", and the great acting performance of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman did not let you get bored when watching. Moreover, lovers here are completely different people with their own view of things, who have excellent memories of the past, which even now look good.3. Atmosphere - the feeling of a blazing Second World War, which in 1942 was still in full swing, is present from the first to the last frame. It is especially bright in Casablanca, where many people and forces clashed, eager to destroy each other. This is especially evident in the example of the police prefect - a corrupt official, a French patriot, who is forced to submit to a German officer who has arrived from Europe, since the prefect - in the service of the Vichy government - is essentially a collaborationist. And not only him, because there are many minor characters, by the way about them.4. Vivid minor characters - from the Russian bartender (thanks to Leonid Kinski for such a charismatic hero) and ending with dishonest merchants. Frenchmen, policemen, ""slippery"" types, German officers, Italians. All of them are of interest, and the picture perfectly shows their real relationships, ranging from the Germans, who consider Italians weaklings and cowards, and ending with the French, although they lost the war, but did not accept this fact, and therefore are ready to go after General de Gaulle ... Well, and cynics who simply cash in on human grief, without a hint of feelings.5. Music - of which I can only mention songs performed by Sam, played by the negro Dooley Wilson - who was an actor and singer in his life, and very popular. It is he who is remembered most of all. What about the rest of the music? It will do.Well, thank you very much for the stage of the performance of La Marseillaise! Sang along in unison!So the cons:
1. Globe at the beginning of the picture - more precisely, the western borders of the Soviet Union and Poland. Maybe this is a cant of the picture, or maybe the creators just took this globe from another picture. Unknown. We will consider this an inaccuracy.2. Cult status - here the picture was just lucky, because it came out just during Operation Torch - the landing of allied forces in North Africa, including in Casablanca (which is partly why it was renamed shortly before the film's release). And after that they were often shown on American TV. Although, judging impartially and objectively - ""Casablanca"" is a good, but a passing picture, which is perfect for a romantic evening, but to call it ""the best picture"" or ""the greatest picture of all times and peoples"" would be very dishonest and even selfish. Just ""Casablanca"" was lucky to get out at the right time and in the right place, that's all!A little about the main characters:
1. Rick Blaine performed by Humphrey Bogart is a cynical restaurant owner who has to sort out his feelings, decide on a side in a raging war, and decide in love, where can we go without it. Despite the protruding cynicism, both in words and in deeds, at heart he is a romantic, capable of performing a strong and noble deed for the sake of justice. I saw Humphrey before only in the melodrama ""Sabrina"" with Audrey Hepburn, where he perfectly played a similar character, and here he obviously learned to be such a convincing romantic on the screen. Bravo Humphrey!2. Ilsa Lund performed by Ingrid Bergman - Rick's beloved and the wife of Victor Laszlo, one of the leaders of the Resistance movement, who wants to take advantage of meeting Rick in order to leave Casablanca as soon as possible. Shown as a romantic and purposeful girl who rushes between two men. I liked Ingrid here. Clever girl! You believe her heroine.3. Victor Laszlo performed by Paul Henrade is an ardent anti-fascist who arrived in Casablanca in order to find a way to get to the New World, because the Nazis are looking for him for his active work, but there is no reason for arrest, because Casablanca is the territory of France, where there are subtleties. An ardent fighter, who piously believes in victory, whom Rick partly admires. Paul perfectly managed to convey the inner world and ideals of his hero, thanks in part to which Germany was eventually defeated four years later.You know, despite the fact that seventy-nine years have passed since the picture was released, it is still good, and deserves your attention (just do not over praise it), and worth watching.As a result, we have a good melodrama, with a simple and interesting script, bright memorable characters, great atmosphere, pleasant romance and great acting, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Classic, beautiful, light hearted - how does a ""all time classic really feel like""?","In regards to user ""JAYMAY"" and the wonderful review ""HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE"": Thank you, kiddo.It came over me some months ago... like ""damn, I have never seen it. Just have a vague idea what it is REALLY about... but so what. Is it romance or a war movie? Dunno. I'm going to watch it now. Let's dive.""
And that was the best decision on how to approach that movie - without expectations. Yes, it is a super hyped classical Hollywood block buster. Yes, it is a great love story, so great, it sounds so unreal when you read about it. It is replayed over and over in TV at peak times (like Christmas?). Yes, it is over 60 years old, black and white and uses different cinematic styles than modern cinema.What compelled me in this movie is how truly timeless it is. The usage of lenses, blurry fuzzy filters (to make it look more glorious and romantic at times, esp. Bergmanns face), the play of light and shadow, camera movement bring out the pure emotions of the actors so, so well... I wouldn't have expected that!Timeless is, when the characters and the story feels real and 'possible' no matter the age or the black-white-colors or the different era. The dialogue is thoughtful, deep (and deserves a rewatch to truly appreciate it!) and the characters have these subtle, gentle movements and expressions that are salt and pepper to the story. The true intensity is written in their faces, like they were sitting across from us at a dinner table at candle light, re-telling their deepest, heart-felt memories.I was IN love with Richard (Bogart) when the camera zooms in on Ilsa (Bergmann) with the warm, fuzzy light and her glowing eyes - and I fell for Richard when he expressed his sometimes truly life-affirming, sometimes cynical ideas. It is melancholic, sentimental and yet full of life.Sure, it isn't a movie of 'our time', but it shows human nature and life, that is lived for centuries, no matter if it is in the 40s or today. It was a great journey into the past and ends with the present.I truly appreciate this movie, even if it is not my favorite movie of all times. That's ok. It is timeless - and THAT is the true mastery here for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I Don't Get It,"I'm 42, I like film, I worked at a major animation studio where I heard lectures about film study from people who've made iconic films. I appreciate Citizen Cain for what it is. I'm going through the AFI top 100, and this is #3, so I expected to have my socks knocked off. Instead we have some dude sitting at a bar next to a piano for an hour and a half with different people who don't like him passing through but not really doing much about it. I must be missing a lot of subtext, because this movie is like John Wick, but if John Wick just hung out at the bar waiting for something to happen without a bounty on his head, so people would walk in and be like, ""Hey John, still evil?"", but he'd be like, ""No, I might be in love, not sure though"", and the other guy would say, ""That war was sure tough, see you later!"" Idk if that's a spoiler, but that's pretty much the whole movie.Super over-rated imho, and it's #3, so I'm probably missing something that makes it amazing.

Well worthy of being a classic film,"Casablanca is easily one of the most famous movies of all time, so I had high expectations while watching it. As I expected, it did not disappoint in the slightest. The characters were great, the sets and accompanying visual elements were stellar, and it even gave me feelings of stress and fear concerning the Nazis. The storyline sucks you right in and stays that way until the famous end scene. The portrayal of the stress and fear that was overtaking Europe at this time was spot on and the personification of American neutrality in the main character, Rick Blaine, while everyone else needs his help is absolutely perfect.

This movie is a must see for anyone who loves an amazing movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Towering masterpiece of American cinema,"Quite possibly the greatest, if not most entertaining, motion picture ever made, Casablanca shines like platinum.  Perhaps it is Bogart's indelible Rick Blaine: cynic on the outside, humanist on the inside.  Perhaps it is the writing: unforgettable from ""Here's looking at you, kid"" to ""We'll always have Paris"" to ""This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""  Perhaps it was just the serendipitous combination of assembled personnel once cameras began to roll on the Warner Brothers lot during WWII. Rick's internal conflict, so simply presented in the movie, conceals an existential dilemma that stands at the heart of Casablanca's enduring legacy: the difficulty of taking the morally responsible action even (or rather, especially) when it is at the expense of personal desires.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca,"I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Hey guys, this is a classic film, the only reason to watch it!",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Can a movie be PERFECT?,"Little can be said about this masterpiece that has not been said. Every superlative applies. The people involved in the making of Casablanca were convinced they were making just another movie meant to inspire patriotism in an America teetering on the brink of war. Indeed, in many ways, this is precisely how the movie was planned. But somewhere between then and now, Casablanca emerged as the most iconic movie of all time.The story takes place shortly before America's entry into WWII. Casablanca, while unoccupied, was controlled by Vichy and was a dangerous place for enemies of the Reich. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a café where everyone comes, and where shady transactions are conducted by the French Resistance. Rick maintains a delicate neutrality, with duplicitous cooperation from the local police captain, Louis Renault (Claude Rains).Then the Czechoslovakian resistance leader arrives with a woman in tow, but not just any woman. She is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), his wife, although we discover she had a passionate affair in Paris with Rick some time ago.The rest of the story revolves around what Orson Welles called a McGuffin – the letters of transit. That no such papers could have existed is immaterial. The McGuffin helps the central characters discover their true nature and make decisions that will change them forever.But the story is in the experience of it. As you are drawn into Casablanca, its intrigue, love, betrayal and redemption, you are transformed by it utterly. Long before postmodern deconstructionism made it de rigueur to send up treasured metaphors only to bring them crashing down, Casablanca wove them into a story that fills you with nostalgia only experienced in the collective memory of our culture, as if each event happened directly to you.Embarrassingly rich with talent, the film's gravitational center is the bristling energy that radiates from Bogart and Bergman. They are luminous beings whose monochromatic images will haunt your memory forever. Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo, like his portrayal of Jerry Durrance the same year in Now, Voyager, in a lesser movie would have been legendary. The fact that Casablanca engulfs him, as well as Claude Raines, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, is a yardstick against which Casablanca must be measured.The cast of Casablanca, in fact, is its true treasure. Humphrey Bogart appears in his first romantic lead, yet maintains the toughness and cynicism of the thug image Hollywood manufactured for him. His shell of cynicism notwithstanding, Bogart's character reveals himself to be a wounded, vulnerable man, consumed by bitterness and regret. Yet he manages, from within despair, to reinhabit his former self, rising to an epic heroism which, the film suggests, is within each of us.Bergman's astonishing beauty illuminates her character. Who could gaze into those vast, glistening eyes and not be moved? Although, apropos of the time, she is portrayed as a possession to be won or lost, she transcends that image with each glance. Her immense beauty is an almost desperate counterpoint to the struggles taking place before her.Paul Henreid has been roundly criticized for not being the thespian equal of his costars. But he plays his role perfectly as the self-righteous prig who represents Ilsa's tragic alternative to the man she truly loves. Had he been otherwise, Ilsa's choice would have been easy and the story would not have worked. Henreid, like every aspect of this masterpiece, is an archetype without which the story could not take place.The second tier actors were equally amazing. Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre were stars in their own rights. In fact, Veidt was the highest paid actor in the film. They are delightfully complex, and yet necessarily abstract, providing still more archetypes around which to anchor the story. Rains, as the servile Vichy toady, provides delicious moments of comic irony. Much has also been made of the repressed homosexual overtones of Renault's relationship with Rick, and Rick's relationship with Sam. Whether intentional or not, this aspect merely deepens the humanity of the characters.Even the supporting cast was extraordinary, many of them actual refugees from Europe, lending the story an aching realism. The famous ""Battle of the Anthems"" scene plays so real because the extras were truly moved by it, each recalling his own real-life exodus from the war.If director Michael Curtiz was not a peer with contemporary auteur directors, his signature is nonetheless present in Casablanca's taut, scintillating structure. The numerous screenwriters each provided something unique. Even the cinematography was inspired, masterfully playing with images of captivity and conflict produced by shadows precisely placed for effect.In the end, everything flows seamlessly, the very definition of synergy. It would be criminal, though, after considering the details of perhaps the greatest film of all time, not to come back to the personal, visceral experience of it. No matter how many times I watch Casablanca, it never fails to move me. Far from diminishing over time, the full experience matures and deepens with each viewing. I still hold my breath as each iconic moment unfolds. I still gasp when I look into Ilsa's eyes the first time.But the true measure of Casablanca is the enduring respect it garners from film buffs the world over. Delicately dancing around the easy epic of World War II, the film shows us instead how great events can conspire to make even the most reprobate existence monumental.This is, in my mind, the closest thing to cinematic perfection we are ever likely to see. Unfortunately, the rich cultural references will seem somewhat abstruse for viewers not familiar with history leaving the full appreciation of Casablanca beyond reach. But if you are equipped with both a brain and a heart, this movie will move you and thrill you like few can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Best Movie Ever Made,"It's hard not to repeat others when commenting on the movie that many people consider to be the best of all times. The Film Institute ranks it number two behind Citizen Kane. I like Citizen Kane very much, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as Casablanca. It is simply the finest blend of script, sets, characters, casting, music and photography that Hollywood has ever produced. Who can forget the shadow of the dancing woman on the wall? Has there ever been a funnier straight man than Claude Raines? Or an oilier villain than Peter Lorre? The scene where Paul Heinried leads the audience in the Marseillaise is rightfully one of the most touching in the history of the cinema. But what impressed me is how the French National Anthem blended with the German song the Nazis were singing, so well that it sounded like a round. As much as I liked the movie itself, I never appreciated it as much until I bought the VHS version showing the making of the movie. How many viewers realize that the writers didn't know which of the lead characters Ilse would go off with until literally the end of the movie? How many know that three different directors worked on various parts of the movie? Or that it was one of the most brilliant success stories of a movie put together by committee? Not too many years ago, the favorite trivia ""factoid"" was that Bogart never said ""Play it again, Sam."" He actually said, ""Play it, Sam."" I still get misty-eyed every time I hear As Time Goes By. It's very unusual that I remember the theme from a modern movie by the time I leave the theatre. Only the Ring Trilogy has come close to matching Casablanca in so many different ways.

Everything That Makes a True Classic is Here,"To have lasting appeal in the past, present, and future, that defines a classic. As for my humble opinion, I believe there are two things which enable a filmmaker to create a classic that people hold dear: identifiable elements that are not so far-fetched from our own world and a profound message that continues to inspire and strengthen us with age. Bearing this in mind, it's understandable why the acclaimed Casablanca is a beloved work of cinema and counted among the great classic films. A romantic, patriotic, and idealistic movie that continues to stand the test of time and enchant present generations.Derived from an unpublished play that surprisingly went nowhere, Casablanca is as beautifully photographed as it is narrated. The central focus is a timeless relationship between two characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, without whom there's no doubt the movie wouldn't be as memorable or appealing. A loving relationship between Rick Blaine (Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Bergman) in Paris tragically ends because of the outbreak of the War and leaves Rick a heartbroken and apathetic man. It drives him into hiding away from the world's problems in his café in far off Casablanca. But the fires of a lost passion are rekindled upon Ilsa's unanticipated reentry into his life, their fates forever entwined. Ilsa explains to Rick that something greater than the both of them had begun to unfold in her relationship with Victor Laszlo, the hero of the Resistance. She appeals to the sentimental heart and the patriotic spirit that rests within Rick's cynical exterior. His former self revived, Rick grants his lover and her husband passage to America in one of cinema's most memorable finales, as they say farewell outside of a plane, all for the sake of the cause they fight for. The rest is cinematic history!I find it hard to believe that no one expected anything grand to come from Casablanca during the course of its development. The film is handled with great care, having a strong script and outstanding performances. Humphrey Bogart brilliantly portrays a hero, ranging from a broken man with little to lose to a redeemed figure who is changed for the better in the end. As Ilsa, Ingrid Bergman conveys a very warm and tender nature. And of course, the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is top-notch and deeply moving.Countless are all the classic moments and dialogue that even those who have never seen the movie can recognize. One of my favorite scenes takes place during the second meeting between Rick and Ilsa. Upon entering the café, Ilsa seems bathed by an almost heavenly light, symbolic of Rick's salvation. Another sequence that lingers within me is when the crowd singing La Marseillaise drowns the Nazi anthem out. Both scenes illustrate the crux themes of the movie, of how much hope a loving relationship can provide and how justice will prevail over evil if we all stand united.Casablanca is not a movie that's to be marveled for technological achievements, but something infinitely more meaningful. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Casablanca is a movie that encourages viewers to follow their hearts and to take a stand for the many. No matter how insignificant you may seem, making a difference is never impossible. Those who have thought that Casablanca would never go far, let alone be hailed as a timeless classic, could not have been more wrong. I expect I'll be asking Sam to play it again soon!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

100 stars movie,"As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on.Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him.This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.631 out of 712 found this helpfulslokes16 January 2005

The Fundamental Things Apply...
""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world.383 out of 441 found this helpfulRWiggum29 March 2004

We'll Always Have Casablanca
Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Gr.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Timeless,"I saw this movie for the first time 56 years after it was first made and it could still move me with intensity.  There's something simple and pure about the way it evokes its emotional power, somehow never losing that power over time.  Also, I must say that Humphrey Bogart suddenly became the single man I wanted to be like after watching this film, more than Sean Connery, more than James Dean.  He has this coolness which remains the pinnacle.  True, this style and character is much better shown in The Maltese Falcon.  In Casablanca Bogart is exposed; his coldness came from a broken heart, and he still has some of that compassion left within him. But I still look up to him, and deeply feel for him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
top 5,"I didn't see Casablanca all the way through until I was in my late 20's, and I'm glad. I wouldn't have appreciated the truth behind the actions and relationships of the characters at an earlier age. This is one of the world's great films.I remember one television viewing especially. I had returned home from seeing a movie which was so poor that I have no recollection as to what film it was. I got home just as Casablanca was starting, and -- in spite of, or maybe beCAUSE of having already seen a movie that day -- sat mesmerized through the entire film. When it was over I looked at my wife and said ""Do you think the guy who made that piece of crap we saw earlier has ever even SEEN a good movie?"" I suspect that some young film makers have not. Casablanca has, besides one of the great casts in film history: sharp, smartly paced dialogue; layers of true- to-life stories; superb black-and-white photography. Anyone who has ever lost at love will ache as the characters wrestle with life-affecting decisions which wrench the heart. This is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Casablanca, a spiritual experience!","Lauren Bacall was wonderful as Ilsa...in a parallel universe. Too bad it was Ingrid Bergman who ended up with the role, I just couldn't buy the Bogie'n Bergman love story and would have loved to see Lauren instead! So I gave this movie a 4, as soon as I was done watching. Because Bergman failed to convince me and I cringed at their Paris scenes. I mean Bogie, romantic?! Are you kiddin' me?! (I was even more shocked to see Bogie smile!) I was bored through the story, the men's thick black eyeliner looked like an ethnic joke, their white eyeliner was a little less distracting, but I've seen worse, so I decided what the heck, I'm 1/4th through this movie might as well keep going since it's not like it's starring *insert your most insipid actress and buffoon of an actor here* And OK, since I'm well-endowed in the ""suspend disbelief"" department, I'll pretend I'll buy Ingmar Bergman or whatever as the love interest.Since some of the dialog was amazing, I thought I'd actually give this a 7. For effort. Plus the ""last night was so long ago/tonight? I don't plan that far ahead"" exchange was awesome. (I'm gonna have to memorize these lines, I'm sure to use them sometime!) And the music was not bad. So what the heck, it doesn't deserve a 7 but I'm not in a bad mood tonight and it's Christmas, right?! But what the **** happened to ""Play it again, Sam!""? I never once heard it and I felt ripped off throughout the movie! I heard ""Play it, Sam"" Who misquotes a movie, really? OUTRAGEOUS!!! Just for that, I felt like I needed a refund, and let me tell you, that 7 was quickly turning into a 5. Plus I'd seen the final scene, the Bogie/Bergman exchange, final scene, it says so on You Tube. Right? So who cares, I already know how it ends.Well...Wrong!!!It wasn't the final scene after all! WTH??! After years of believing that's how it ended, now they ripoff the ending too by adding some insipid action? Couldn't they have been done at that scene since it's *supposed* to be the only end anyone cares about? (After all, it's the only one ""they"" ever show!! What else could there be, really?!) Well, in the end--and sorry to put it this way if you kinda like this film--but what do you think I could possibly give this sorry little B&W film maker's menial effort of a wanna-be movie? Well, if you should know I only gave it a mere TEN! That's right! Was I glad I stuck with it till the end! It got better and better until it became one of the best movies ever! I didn't expect the surprise ending, that's for sure! Blown away!This one is definitely worth a re-watch sometime soon, minus my ""Dancing-with-the-Stars-judge-raising-score-on-a-panel-every-5-secs"" attitude. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where I went from ""who gives a c^^p about you?"" to absolutely blown away by the characters and their turn of events. In a sense I went from caring about Rick just about as little as Rick himself did to making a 180 degree turnabout. Sort of like Rick did at the end! Amazing!! And Ingrid Bergman was indeed good, certainly not my first choice for Ilsa--still would have loved to see Bacall--but she held her own. Here's looking at you, Kid! It's like after the movie was over, I came to the realization that I had been a Rick of sorts throughout. And the movie took me through my own 180.Does everyone feel like this when watching this movie? Is it supposed to turn us all into Ricks and then flip-flop us around leaving us utterly dazed and not knowing what hit us there for a second? Or is it just me? It almost felt like a spiritual experience! Almost! It was simply amazing! 10/10. Come what may, I'll always have Casablanca in my DVD collection!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca is cinematic perfection in every way conceivable.,"The dialogue, the plot, the acting, and the music are just a few reasons why Casablanca is a masterpiece. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical bar owner who is in love with a beautiful woman named Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, but the relationship is put in a difficult position when a love triangle forms. Rick separates himself from Ilsa, being reminded of the song Ilsa loved: ""As Time goes by"".I don't know even where to start! This movie has everthing! It has action, comedy, romance, war, and drama, all packed finely into one masterpiece that will not be forgotten! The script is fantastic as one can see because of the innumerable quotable lines in the film. The acting is superb as one can tell through the numerous stars in it, for example Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. With a cast like that, it is almost certain that there will be fine acting. The music, particularly 'As Time Goes By' is phenomenal.The movie of course has received critical acclaim. The movie has a 99% Rotten Tomatoes approval rating, and 100% Metascore, all of which I believe are suitable ratings for it. Despite some negativity in the reviews here at IMDb, this is a movie that must be watched at least once in your life. Any film buff, if it has not been seen, must see it. I am one myself, and I thus decided to watch it. It has been one of my favorites ever since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
CSUN Student Review of Casablanca (1942),"I have seen Casablanca a couple of times, and while I'm sure a lot of people think this is the greatest film of all time, I don't. While this film is definitely iconic and is very culturally significant, I always find it hard to watch because I find it a tad boring. Maybe I'm just not getting the significance of the story. I do think that the cultural significance of the film is one of the most. Since this film came out during World War II, the people viewing it wouldn't necessarily have gotten an escape from their own real life realities. Films are supposed to give a sense of escapism. Even so, this film does have elements of resistance, which could help boost the moral of the people watching the film. I will say that the film had good cinematography. I also like the fact that the film took place in one location, as it felt like that made the story a little easier to follow. Even though I didn't like the film very much, I would still recommend that people watch it so they can form their own opinions on this definitely very iconic film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This film has badly aged,"This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the ""tough guy with tender heart"", helpless woman who ""suffers"" because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I think the demographic breakdown of the vote on Casablanca explain in part the basis for the enthusiasm: most positive have been old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca is one of the all time great movies,"I could write a huge essay about how great a movie Casablanca is. I could go in to the World War II context because I'm such a history nut. Humphrey Bogart was probably the greatest American actor of the 1940s. Ingrid Bergman is my all time favorite actress (as of now, 2023). This movie has so many quotable lines of dialogue that have entered the popular lexicon.I think one thing that makes this movie so interesting is, its setting is at a time when the USA had not yet entered World War II. You might think an American World War II movie would be more like Patton or Saving Private Ryan. But none of that had happened as of 1941. The USA was still neutral. So the American Bogart as Rick is neutral and serving all customers.Those customers include the bad guys - the Germans, who just really act like Germans in this movie, not so much as Nazis. The good guys - the French, who were at this time under attack by the Germans. But Rick's cafe is neutral ground, so all customers are welcome and there are tense moments when the French and Germans interact with each other.Then there is the romance between Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman), one of the all time greatest movie romances ever. It's epic, spanning different years and different places, and has a powerful ending in this movie. If you're familiar with the story then you know what happens, but if you're watching it for the first time you really won't know what the outcome will be until the final few scenes. Anyways this is one classic movie you definitely want to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
We'll always have Casablanca,"If you examine most lists of the greatest films of all time you'll find Casablanca near the top usually accompanied by The Godfather and Citizen Kane. Rightfully so, I can't think of any better and it's hard to believe two of them were released just a year apart of one another,Kane in 1941 and in 1942 Casablanca.In many ways Casablanca is the no-name masterpiece. The majority of slightly cinema conscious people have seen or at least heard of Casablanca yet only true film enthusiasts know who directed or wrote it-despite it winning the Oscar in both categories. Unlike say Francis Ford Coppola or Orson Welles,Michael Curtiz is never fully recognized for his achievement;perhaps because the film doesn't have the artisticness of the other two. But an unnoticed director is a deft director.
However,what excels most in Casablanca is the script-only three were listed for the Academy Award but roughly six or seven deserve some credit.
The story is borderline legendary because it is inspiring,poignant and pragmatic. The characters are equally exceptional and fascinating each with a different personality and ideas and none without flaws,except perhaps for Victor Laszlo. While all others around him have at some point submitted to their circumstances and feel regret,Laszlo doesn't. For the entire duration he remains as an immovable,paragon of resistance and strength-resembling more of something than someone. That's not to say all characters must be flawed and change,take Elsa for instance. She doesn't have any emotional or mental barrier to break like Rick but still she doesn't constantly live under one note the way Laszlo does. She has her own conflict,torn between both men and forced to choose a side and maybe at times even behaves in a lamentable fashion. Laszlo,however, never falters from his single direction and is never forced to react or change anything. He is not just static he's flat. On quite the contrary is Rick Blaine.
He's the reluctant anti-hero to end all others. At first he's a patriot or a 'sentimentalist' energized to fight for his beliefs then after he's devastated by Elsa leaving him,he becomes a self centered cynic. But with Elsa's return into his life,he must decide whether he'll become the Rick of past or the Rick of present. Bogart's performance is one of the best ever in his own natural style, fueled by the finest dialogue written for film. Witty,amusing and piercing Casablanca's dialouge is unsurpassed (if I listed my favorite lines I'd probably write half the script.)
Even the minorest characters have there moments in the film (though for many of them its based on what they do rather than say) but the best are unquestionably from Rick. The only other with close to as many quips as Mr Blaine is Louis. He too has many great lines and moments in the film,such as when he tells Rick that he is shocked there is gambling going on before being handed his own winnings by a policeman. Louis is unabashedly a man devoid of scruples...or so he seems. Though he acts as if he simply serves himself,like Rick,he is at heart a sentimentalist and believer just like the latter.Casablanca is nearly perfect in every way, the reason why it is such an endearing classic that remains popular seventy-eight years after its release.Because of films like it, I can overlook the innumerable amount of terrible movies in constant production knowing that we'll always Casablanca.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Don't make a remake!,"There's a saying: ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it."" This saying is especially applicable to this movie. This movie is a timeless classic, which stands alone and cannot be replicated. I know that countless words have been written about this movie, so anything I say will probably be nothing new, but I'll say it anyway. This movie could have easily become some kind of corny and phony contrivance about some ex-patriot loser who is wallowing in self-pity because some woman led him on and then gave him the old ""heave-ho."" This movie could have easily become little more than just another World War Two movie, with the good guys vs the bad guys, with the latter getting everything they deserve. But this movie goes way beyond that, and is a work of art. Now this may sound like a cliché, but it isn't. This movie actually conveys a story that is both complex and compelling and contains some really great acting which transforms the script into something that the audience can actually listen to and follow without trying to figure out what's going on. Many of the characters in this movie are intrinsically unattractive and unlikable, but when mixed together, they emerge as some of the most memorable characters in the history of American cinema. I won't rehash this movie because anyone who knows cinema has undoubtedly already seen it. But suffice it to say, this movie is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as such.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Pretty great,"There are advantages to taking a film class after all. Today I finally watched Casablanca, and it was a matter of sooner or later. Being the film buff that I am, I would probably have ended up seeing this no matter what. We went a little bit into the further historical context of the film, and all of the different historical backgrounds that would make us appreciate the film, and see it the way people back in the day saw it. That helps I guess, but it isn't necessary to know if a film is good or not. I liked it, a lot. It started off pretty unspectacular, but it does sort of give you a spin and it does let you accommodate to the characters after a while. I thought the standout was Ingrid Bergman, and I am surprised to see she wasn't even nominated. Humphrey Bogart is also pretty great, and his less-than-usual looks for a leading romance man made it more fascinating.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Middling and overrated drama,"Perhaps I'm as cynical as Rick. In 1982, Chuck Ross submitted the screenplay of Casablanca under a different name to 217 agencies as an experiment to see whether they would pick up on it. There were a range of reactions. Some agencies recognised it, but many rejected the screenplay with negative feedback. They said the dialogue was unconvincing, it dragged on, the story was dull and so on. The whole experiment was supposed to be an exposé of the industry itself - clueless agents who would never recognise a famous Academy-award-winning screenplay for what it is. However, in my opinion, the naysayers were actually right. The film isn't terrible, but it does have the alleged flaws - it is dull, unconvincing, hokey, slow and trite. I don't see the appeal for others. Nothing blew me away, the character drama didn't inspire me and I don't feel the need to quote it weeks from now. As a historical drama, it is passable, but no masterpiece!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Can love really make it out of ultimate corruption?,"This film was extremely well done. The actors were great, you really could get into the plot as they shaped their characters. The sound effects were very good when it came to the airplanes and gun shots. The dialogue was loud enough to understand what they were saying which is a plus in this time period. The love story really sucked you into their relationship and past and makes you feel the hardships of corruption and economic struggles. The lighting was absolutely excellent. It really made the scenes bright and happy but could get really serious and dark with great face contouring and shadows. The camera did a lot of good shots involving Ilsa and Rick when they would argue, the fight scenes, and the plane taking off. It really emphasized the scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the greatest motion pictures of all time!,"When Michael Curtiz' film, Casablanca, left Warner Bros. studio and hit the silver screen in 1942, it was intended to be a well-received box-office success. It had a star-studded cast, a fine director, and very talented writers. What more does a film need to be successful? Needless to say, Casablanca more than surpassed all expectations. It won three Academy Awards (Best Director, Picture, and Screenplay) in 1943. That, in of itself, is impressive for a movie that was produced in much the same way as about fifty-one other pictures that were produced by Warner Bros. that year. Granted, this movie did have a lot going for it, but there was some confusion during the making of it, like, trying to decide on an ending, for example. The ending was a last-minute thought by the writers, and so Ingrid Bergman was likely just as surprised to hear it as her on-screen persona, Ilsa. The ending, like the entire film, has, of course gone down in movie history as being one of the more memorable endings of all time. In retrospect, all of the honors and success that Casablanca received was nothing in comparison to the impact that it has had ever since it came out.As for the movie itself, what can be said about Casablanca that hasn't already been said? It is an extraordinary film. It is entertaining and powerful. It won't dazzle you with ""avant-garde cinematic expression"" or Freudian references. It is simply a well-crafted movie. Plain and simple. Michael Curtiz oversaw the making of one of the highlights of American cinema. The writing was exceptional, with humor sprinkled in between drama, romance, action, suspense, etc. The performances in Casablanca, though, are a joy to behold. Humphrey Bogart's bitter, vulnerable Rick is easily one of his greatest achievements, while Ingrid Bergman was more beautiful than ever as Ilsa, Rick's love interest. Paul Henreid supplies Ilsa's husband, Victor, with a dignity that makes him as honorable as any screen hero I've ever seen. Claude Rains gives a typically wonderful performance as the corrupt Captain Renault, who respects Rick, but must answer to Major Strasser (played by Conrad Veidt at his most sinister), a Nazi sent to Casablanca to find Victor. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre contribute small, but equally important and memorable characters, as Ferrari and Ugarte, respectively. Last, but certainly not least, is Dooley Wilson, who brought a warm sincerity to this movie that was just as powerful as any other emotion on display during the film.It just doesn't get much better than this. I have recommended this film to everyone I have met who has missed out on this wonderful film. It has it all, and if you have not seen Casablanca, do yourself a favor, and see it now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Closest Thing To Perfection Possible At The Movies,"The first five minutes of Casablanca can be daunting to the viewer. So daunting that they may turn it off all together and go about their day. That's what happened to me my first time, trying to sit through Casablanca. I didn't walk away because I was bored by it, or uninterested in what laid ahead, it was the fear of something so beloved not holding up to its reputation or flying over my head completely. Thankfully, I returned to Casablanca and I'm forever thankful I did because it's one of the best films ever made.In film schools, I'm sure Casablanca is the number one film analyzed for those future filmmakers waiting to make their mark on the industry. If it's not, it ought be. Casablanca delivers on every level technically, it's flawlessly constructed. It was made in the old-school Hollywood period where making movies like working in a factory, each part of the movie was put together by a specific person performing a specific task. The care and exertion put in by the set designer, costume coordinator, sound technician are all seen painted on the black and white, cinematography, which is my favorite part of the movie. The best photography ever put on film, playing with different camera angles, lighting, and emotional involvement like no film before it.The direction is the other driving force behind Casablanca that makes it a movie that stood the test of time. Director, Michael Curtiz, juggles all the topics covered in the brilliant script making them feel effortlessly collected. He creates a swift, moving picture. Casablanca is the movie that defines great movie montages. The writing nails the contrast of love and war, which creates a finely tuned script. Humphrey Bogart and Ingird Bergman establish the precedent of war films being romantic and ""the"" movie couple of all-time.Casablanca depicts the wartime world better than any film you'll ever find. Its romance has sparks that still fly today and the political back dealings of World War II play like a new story we would watch at this present time. Casablanca is about sacrifice and studies the character of Humphrey Bogart, as if the man's heart was speaking to directly to the audience. Being produced in 1942 without the technological advances today, the quality of the mechanical areas involved stunned me. It's an exceptional story that breathes long after its expiration date.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Please don't assume that I don't like it just because it's an older film; most movies I have scene are older films, and a lot of them are far better than this one.

On my very short list of must sees,"Casablanca has every right to be considered amongst the best ever made because of its timelessness. As noted in another comment, Casablanca remains as complex, funny, romantic, and full of suspense as it did when it first graced the silver screen nearly 60 years ago. I recommend it often, and rarely do my friends not thoroughly enjoy the film, despite the fact that most of my friends and I were not born until 35 years after it was written. Those few that didn't like it simply don't like anything in black and white, which is their loss I suppose (the colorized version, to be frank, sucks). In short, if you enjoy movies and can stand B&W, then you should watch this film. Even if you don't like most B&W films you should watch it; odds are you'll like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Untouchable,"Casablanca is a prime example of classic Hollywood. With your stars like Bogie and Bergmann, along with great writing, directing, and unforgettable lines, it makes for a movie that none other can compare to. This movie does not need big money effects or action sequences. The acting along will make you fall in love with this classic. It's a story of fate and romance, with a classic ending to die for. I may have been born many many years after, but it's a film that any generation can relate to. If there was ever a list of the top 10 movies never to be considered for a remake, Casablance would be there.

A LOVESTORY FOR AGES,"""Casablanca"" (1942) is a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Set against the backdrop of World War II, it tells the compelling story of Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), whose paths cross once again in the titular city. The film is a perfect blend of romance, drama, and suspense, with unforgettable performances from the cast. Bogart's portrayal of the cynical yet heroic Rick and Bergman's luminous Ilsa are simply iconic. The screenplay is sharp, the dialogue memorable, and the theme of love and sacrifice resonates deeply. ""Casablanca"" is an enduring classic that everyone should experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You probably already know half the script to this movie,"""Here's looking at you, kid."" ""I'm shocked, shocked, to find that gambling is going on in this establishment."" ""Of all the gin joints in the world, you had to walk into mine."" ""If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. "" ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" ""Play it again, Sam.""Casablanca has taken such an elevated place in pop culture, its images and quotes (like the ones above) seeped into so many TV shows and movies to follow it, that when you actually get around to watching it it can seem a little underwhelming. Bogart and Bergman are Bogart and Bergman of course, and can charm the pants off anyone living or dead, but there's a lot of melodrama and a distinctly saggy middle. By the halfway point you might even be ready to write this off as one of those films that's important but not necessarily a great watch for a modern audience.And then comes in the third act, a powerful and blisteringly-paced series of climaxes, and all of your earlier skepticism was wiped away and you're rooting wholeheartedly for Rick and Ilsa and their doomed romance. Or at least I was. What sets Casablanca apart from so many of its contemporaries is its ambiguous morality -- not the universal cynicism of most noir movies but a mature perspective that can see good in evil as well as vice versa. Most importantly, it juxtaposes what we want as viewers and what's actually the right thing to do in a way few movies do.In short, even if you've received most of the plot and scenes through cultural osmosis, Casablanca is still worth watching, if only for that heart-wrenching climax.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Casablanca is really not much better that Gladiator (which was pretty bad).I wish people would stop believing that old movies are good. It's just something producers do to get you to buy movies.

Casablanca (1942),"Considered one of the greatest films of all-time this well-loved classic deserves to be here. It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that.This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time.

Bogie, Bergman, Paris, War, love, romance, adventure, this movie has it all. When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country. The metaphors are present if one looks: Bogie being US Bergman and husband being the allies..and of course the Nazi being the Nazi. Casablanca, translated from french, White House.

An experience you will never forget.,"'Casablanca' is one of those films that you may already know all about even if you haven't seen it. It is widely recognised from critics and movie lovers as being one of the greatest achievements made to date, and not without reason. Although I wouldn't name it as one of my favourite films of all time, there is no denying its brilliance, its mesmerising charm and influential impact it has had on cinema ever since.Last night I was lucky enough to actually catch a special Valentines Day screening of the film at my local cinema, for what was my second time seeing the masterpiece. I have to say, I enjoyed the experience far more than my first, not just because of the quality of the restored version or that wonderful cinematic atmosphere you get when watching old classics, but because I believe 'Casablanca' is a film that gets better every time you watch it; You already know the characters and you already know the plot, and so the whole experience feels like a distant and personal memory that you share with the characters, something that ties in with the nostalgic tone of the film itself.With its captivating photography, soundtrack and long segments of real-time shots, the film is one that engages the viewer and sucks them into its world. The whole experience to me was fantastically surreal; there were moments where I would be totally connected to the movie, where I actually felt like I was back in the 40's. Every now and then my attention would be broke by the usual toilet goers etc., and I would realise where I was and as I said; it was surreal. The reason I mention this however that is it is testament to how immersive 'Casablanca' really is.Undoubtedly the two things that make the film what it is lie in the performances from the whole cast, and the absolutely solid script that was based on the early play ""Everybody Come to Ricks"". First of all, if watching the film for the first time, you will undoubtedly feel like you've seen it before, and this is no coincidence for you've probably heard a lot of the dialogue quoted elsewhere. Many people have claimed 'Casablanca' as having one of the most influential and well-written scripts in film history, and I would be inclined to agree. Throughout you'll bear witness to some of the most famous lines to be shown on the big screen, and also be treated to perhaps the greatest ending monologue ever written for film, which is just as eloquently delivered by Bogart himself. Then there's the absolutely wonderful use of hard-bitten dialogue throughout, mixed with its very classy equivalent, which provides for some intense scenes whether evoking humour, pity, anger or pride; 'Casablanca' manages to achieve it all.I can't remember of the top of my head who once said this but whoever did was clearly getting at Michael Curtiz, under-appreciated director of 'Casablanca'. He said that the greatest directors blend into the fabric of their movies, never making their presence openly obvious; they make the rest of the crew look good. As time has gone on to prove, this is certainly the case here as Curtiz is a director who rarely gets mentioned when discussion on the movie is taking place. When watching the film for a second time however I kept this and mind, and noticed the superb amount of skill that did indeed go into making 'Casablanca' the masterpiece it is, and a lot of that comes down to Curtiz, who does a brilliant job bringing the entire production to life.The people whom he really brings out however are the cast, who unquestionably give some of their greatest performances here, creating characters that are fully dimensional and likable without being submissive to conventional 'hero' stereotypes of the time. Bogart plays 'Rick', the owner of a saloon in Casablanca, outcast from his homeland, and a man with a broken heart, unwilling to 'stick his neck out for nobody' as a consequence. Throughout, Bogart performs expertly, showing his brilliant screen presence that he has become known for, letting his character flow through naturally and with constant emotion. Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid play 'Ilsa Lund' and 'Victor Laszlo' respectively, delivering equally emotive and powerful performances that only go to compliment Bogart and the rest of the cast magnificently, creating chemistry that never lets down.I have deliberately avoided going into too much detail in this review merely on the basis that I feel I cannot and could not fully do this film justice by doing so. Instead I merely state what many others have done before me and advise that if you haven't done so already, be sure to watch 'Casablanca' as soon as you can; it's an experience you will never forget and you'll want to come back to again and again.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Splashes of timelessness,"A movie that failed to live up to it's historic praise for several reasons.Mainly, the chemistry between these two just does not feel as heart-tugging as one would expect. Actually it feels a little creepy at times, in a father/daughter sort of way.Bogart of course remains the picture-perfect image of an old Hollywood, jaded leading man, but ultimately feels like a subtle caricature as the one-liner's role on.The final scene, after hearing so much about it, left me wanting more, and not in a love-lingers-painfully kind of way either.Despite these imperfections, Casablanca still has numerous moments where you do see cinematic time stopping and the historical relevance of the work starting to make sense. It is simply a matter of differentiating what the public has made legendary and what actually works even today.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

There will never be another Casablanca.,"There will never be another Casablanca.Note to Hollywood, please don't do a remake.And to think Bogart wasn't the first choice for lead. I can't imagine this movie with any other actors. Everything about it is so well done. And not one deletive explitive in the entire movie. There are too many favorite scenes, in fact the whole movie is my favorite scene. This is the classic of classics.Hollywood has evolved over the years, some good and some very bad. This is from an era when the good people were good and the bad people were bad and you knew the difference. I have lost track of how many times I've watched this movie.One time my teen age daughter came in at the start of the movie (DVD), and asked what I was watching.

Everyone should watch this movie,"Here is a movie that has always found a way to remain in the top of the lists when it comes to the best movies ever done.Casablanca crosses the genre of drama and romance, the acting was top notch and the movie's screenplays were so well done, that you will be torn in two for Lily. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) was the perfect prince charming, and also a hero in all ways including love.Done in 1942 Casablanca is based on an unproduced play named ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison.The movies ending is one that I love and is something you can skip back to watch again, the dramatic scene, which showed sacrifice, love and suspense. The twist at the end is something the producers would have slipped in to catch the audience off guard, something I enjoyed.Casablanca's lines (""Here is looking at you kid"" and ""This Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"") have remained on the lips of many and it has fondly been repeated in more movies than I can bet the producers would have even dreamt.So what is this great movie about? Casablanca's plot is set during the early years of World War 2, In Casablanca (Morocco) the is a man named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who owns the most popular handout spot in Casablanca, he had everything under control and he even had influence on the police. Everything was fine till the past came knocking.Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) an old lover of Rick shows up at Rick's nightclub and sparks were sent flying in both ways, as they lost contact (Ilsa's fault) without any explanations.Ilsa is not alone, with her is her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henereid) who is a renowned fugitive Czech Resistance leader.The couple needs letters to escape to America, letters only Rick can give. So Rick is in a dilemma to help the woman he loves escape with her husband or keep her in Casablanca.Nominated for eight (8) Academy Awards, Casablanca went home with 3, Best Picture, Best director and Best writing screenplay, Casablanca is a commercial success and has a strong cult following, which has disturbed any plans for a sequel and also the colorization of the movie.The movie cinematography was done by the cinematographer of the movie Frankenstein (1931), who made sure that any time we get to see Bergman her eyes sparkled.Here is a movie, AFI has ranked the 3rd greatest of all time in their AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).

Thank heavens that the original casting fell through.

Everybody knows Casablanca but I didn't,"Everybody knows the title Casablanca - even I have mentioned it in some other review...despite the fact that I had no clue what kind of movie it actually is! I'm sorry about that. I had a vague idea that it's some kind of drama and that was correct. But I also expected something more fluffy and romantic like ""singing in the rain"" or something like that. There is romance too but the overall setting with war and nazis was more heavy and serious than I expected.So... is it good? Well, maybe not my top favorite but I also can't call it a bad film. It's a little bit too talkative for my taste. I get somehow exhausted when all the movie is just talking and not much else happens. In my favorite kind of dramas there also is something else, like...boxing, driving a car, quiet moments with instrumental music. There was some music here too but it was only in couple of scenes where a character sings or plays the piano. There was also some instrumental background music that was so quiet that at first I didn't notice it at all. Only towards the end I came up with an idea to put the volume really loud to notice there actually is some music. I'm such a music freak that I think I would have been blown a way by this movie has there been more emphasis on emotional music giving a backdrop for the beautiful images.Then we get to what was good. The visuals. Very stylish shot scenes with brilliant lighting, and the acting is good. My favorite was Ingrid Bergman. She's amazingly beautiful and her acting is so lively that I have rarely seen such radiance. Where have ladies like this disappeared from the movies? Are they extinct from the planet altogether?Humphrey Bogart is perhaps the most legendary name here. Even if you haven't seen his films you probably know he's the guy with the hat. Once in a hat store I tried on a hat and the saleswoman said that is the Bogart style hat. He doesn't wear that iconic hat of his very much in this movie but when he finally does he becomes a very cool guy.Ok, this is my random review of Casablanca. I wasn't blown away but it's one of those movies that seems better and better the more I think about it.

Classic Comfort Viewing,"I love this film, although I must stress that I find the relationship between Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) of far less interest than the one between Rick and Captain Renault (Raines).Raines was a great actor, and a scene stealer par excellence, as witnessed by his work in other films such as The Adventures Of Robin Hood and Notorious.His performance here playing the pragmatic and corrupt Police chief who has a soft underbelly is spot on. All his scenes are highly entertaining, right down to the final exchange with Bogart.This is not to suggest that Bogart and Bergman are anything but great as well. In fact the whole cast is terrific. The film is packed with notable support actors, including Bogart's former sparring partners from The Maltese Falcon - Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.The story is about a nightclub owner in Casablanca during WWII who runs into his old flame who abandoned him during the fall of Paris, and how he must decide whether to assist her and her husband to escape from the Nazis.The special effects are hokey and the whole thing is so obviously filmed on a stage set, however none of this detracts from the viewing pleasure, because all of the actors are so enjoyable, the musical interludes are so entertaining, and the script is so full of very quotable and famous lines.I have docked it a point for the Paris flashbacks which I consider just too corny and also unnecessary.I find watching old classic B&W films to be the equivalent of comfort food, and this is one of the greatest.

Despite its flaws, Casablanca is still worth watching for its historical significance and standout moments.However, if you're looking for a Bogart film with more excitement and sharper storytelling, To Have and Have Not might be a better choice.

I'll bet you saw Titanic more than twice in the theaters, too...)This is often called a war movie, but don't be fooled -- it's even less about war than Gone With the Wind, which is to say that there *is* a war happening, but it's largely irrelevant as a plot contrivance (which, incidentally, is entirely inaccurate from a historical prospective.  There was no such thing as a letter of transit).In essence, a glorified chick-flick which will hopefully fall away into nostalgic obscurity as my generation continually thrusts spectacular films by Kubrick (may he rest in peace), Fincher (well, Fight Club and Seven, anyway)and Ridley into the forefront.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You can't get better than this!,"If one film represents the studios of Warner Brothers, and if one film represents the 1940's - it's ""Casablanca.""

First-timer,"Seeing this movie for the first time in the 21st century, I asked myself, ""Well...was it as great as expected?"". I'd have to go with a yeah, sure! The movie was interesting. Was it the best movie I ever saw in my life? Uhh, not really. The main thing is that is kept me captivated (almost forgot I was watching it) and I was able to relate to parts of the film. When a movie is able to do that, create a relatable feeling for its audiences, then it's a winner. Casablanca was a real love story. Not this fluff that we see now a days that have the same concept and the same story line. I loved this films mise-en-scene. The props and effects used made the setting seem so real. There was great use of invisibility. Even though the scenes were not shot overseas, it kind of made you forget where they really were shooting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
a war time love story that has touched our hearts,"Casablanca is defined as one of the best love storys of all time and it in my opinion it is because it shows the difficulty of love and that sometimes you have to let go the one you love and it does this perfectly.
Humprey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are our two stars and these two have an amazing chemistry and you can tell that their charcters Rick and Illsa do love each other and they have a intimte relationship before the events of the war split them up and they only have the memories of Paris. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains,Conrad Veidt,Sydney Greenstreet,Peter Lorre.S.Z. Sakall,Madeleine Lebeau and Dooley Wilson this is a supporting cast that defines what it means to be a supporting actor while we don't see much of these characters when we do they really bring out there acting talent and it shines through. Casablanca is also one of those movies that extremely quoteable the iconic quotes are like ""Round up the usual suspects"" ""heres looking at you kid"" ""We'll Always have Paris"" ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world she had to walk into mine"" ""play it again sam"" and ""Louis I think this is the begining of a beatiful friendship"" these are cinemas best quotes and they all come from this great movie.
Overall i have to say that Casablanca remains hollywoods top romance movie and Humprey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman remain more and more amazing every time that you watch and this is one movie that will remain a constant turning point when perfecting romance in movies and it will be a movie that i will gladly play again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Stirring and Splendidly-Made Wartime Film; Very Well-Acted,"Julius Epstein, one of the writers of ""Casablanca's"" screenplay, has called his script bad names. On philosophical grounds, I must agree with some of his honest objections. However, the production values and general storyline are so beautifully done in this famous cinematic work of art that the film's sterling qualities easily outweigh its relatively minor defects. Of course, the film is somewhat overrated by most moviegoers; but, its scenes and human relationships rank with some of the finest achievements in Hollywood's history. And the acting is far above average, every last line of it. It is to this presentational aspect--and to the characters' motives within the film that perhaps viewers have always responded unusually favorably. The film was set in occupied North Africa during wartime. Between the Vichy French government and the Nazi occupiers, the criminal element and those desperate enough to be driven to commit crimes, the city was a deceptively-calm-appearing and yet a very-dangerous place to be living in those years. And, incidentally, it provided a fine milieu in which to set a dramatic film whose theme is how men ought to face their responsibilities in emergencies. The only way to escape from Casblanca's oasis of deceptive peacefulness was to have ""papers""--legal permission to persuade the authorities to permit such a departure. In fact, the storyline begins with visitors having such papers stolen, by a desperate man who is later killed. The remainder of the plot line can be summed up in two sentences. In the city, an expatriate named Rick runs a large nightspot to whom sooner or later, because he is neutral and accommodating, everybody comes. Enter Ilse, and Viktor Laszlo, she the woman who inexplicably left him in Paris and the man she left him to go back to, a man wanted by the Nazis everywhere as their chief opponent... What happens after this is the outcome of the sorts of people Rick, Ilse and Viktor are, and an enigmatic French police captain beautifully played by Claude Rains. As Rick, Humphrey Bogart is at his best, investing a neutral and too-much-unaccounted-for obvious ex-racketeer with intelligence, a sense of honor and melancholia for his lost love. Ingrid Bergman has little to do but look beautiful and say she is sorry, but she does both wonderfully, as always. Paul Henried as Laszlo is straightforward and capable Others in the very fine cast include Syndey Greenstreet as a rival nightclub owner, S.Z. Sakall the bartender, Leonid Kinskey a larcenous employee, Joy Page as a desperate refugee, Peter Lorre as the unfortunate thief, Dooley Wilson as Rick's segundo and piano player, and able Conrad Veidt as the Nazis' chief. Michael Curtiz's bravura direction controls the film's pace and draws very good performances from his cast. Every element of the film glows with intelligence; the lighting is extraordinary, and the costumes, sets, art direction by Carl Weyl, and Arthur Edeson's cinematography are textbook-class work. Mention should be made of Max Steiner's music and the song ""As Times G By"", first heard in this feature. Scenes such as the entry of Ilse into Rick's, the roulette wheel payoff, the rival singing of the Marseillaise to drown out the Nazis' song, the killing of the thief, the closing of Rick's and the justly-famous climax at the airport in the fog need no elaboration by me. What is questionable is the ending, in which Rick gives up Ilse, at least for now, because Viktor Laszlo needs her; the stronger ending would have been for Laszlo to give her up to Rick and say, ""Do you think so little of me as to imagine I'd let you do a 'sacrifice'? I need only my liberty, as every man does. I have my work--it's enough for me for now. Happiness such as yours and the freedom to enjoy it again is what I'm fighting for. What we're all fighting for! So, we go on together or not at all."" But this flaw is less important than the careful build in tension achieved within the film, less vital than the gradual awakening of righteous anger in men who had stayed out of the battle between brutality and justice too long already. The film has a great deal to say about what men should do in the face of evil; and much of the time, it says it very well indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"So precise and detailed, so nostalgic, so legendary. So good","For a long time I felt ashamed that I had never seen ""Casablanca"" which is among the most legendary movies ever made. Last night I finally had the chance to watch it and I was very surprised how good it actually was even this day when movies are so different. If you are going to watch this movie you honestly have to relate to the time when it was made, because if you're going to watch it like any other movie, you may be disappointed.It was breath taking to see how detailed this movie actually was. Everything's just so precise, from the dialog to every single item that you see on the screen, even if it was only in the background. You can't even compare the acting to acting these days, it just isn't anything near it, as it's a totally different art form of its own, so significant and so great. Every single word spoken by every character is so powerful and compelling, every word is precise and carefully chosen. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for the role, a bad ass American, Rick Blaine, who owns a night club at Casablanca during the World War II, but yet he is surprisingly soft-hearted. Then there's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty shines through the screen in her role of Ilsa Lund, the woman who was Rick's one time love when they met in Paris. The story between Rick and Ilsa is filled with passion like no other, making the whole movie one of the most passionate movies ever made.The screenplay's just excellent and it also compliments the whole directing of the movie. It progresses with scenes that are just so phenomenal, so legendary and so nostalgic. It includes one of the most legendary quotes in the history of motion pictures, for example; ""Play it once, Sam"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". Even when I had never seen the movie, I just immediately recognised those sentences and smiled, as they are among the sentences everybody knows even if they've never seen ""Casablanca"" before. The whole plot is also surprisingly exciting, comparing to the plots nowadays it would definitely work in any movie, as it is just so thrilling from the beginning till the end and you just can't know how it ends before the last minute of the movie. The final solution's just genius and it's actually so good that I had to start clapping my hands together when the movie ended. Superb.One of the best things now when I've seen the film is that I can finally be proud in saying ""I've seen Casablanca. And I love it"" Even after 65 years, ""Casablanca"" simply shines, making it enjoyable in every imaginable way. It's thrilling, it's passionate, it's flowing and it's just excellent. Throw away your thoughts of modernity and enjoy some real nostalgia with amazing role performances, superb directing and an excellent screenplay. A masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Blaine Makes A Decision Under Duress,"When Rick Blaine decides to put Victor and Ilsa on the Lisbon plane instead of going with Ilsa himself is problematic. That decision is the key piece of the film. Whatever happened before didn't matter and the outcome had not yet been revealed. The decision probably comes sometime after Ilsa confronts Richard with a variety of offers for the letters of transit alone in his apartment. The offers included appeals to patriotism and friendship, and when that failed, sex. Ilsa decided to stay with Rick. Ilsa's decision frees Lazlo to leave Morroco and the threat of German reprisal, capture, and execution. Ilsa is a confused woman and a human being in a hard situation. What would you do? Is Ilsa's decision right or moral? Her heart is a dark forest and I fear her wolves had gotten her down. I do not believe Ilsa could think straight in Blaine's arms which is where she ended up begging for the letters of transit. Just when Rick decided to cut his ties with Ilsa puzzles me. It happened some time during the night. The wonder of the film is how someone can make a smart and doubly painful decision in hurricane of emotions. Rick's decision will cut him off from Ilsa a second time. Rick predicted sorrow when Ilsa would begin regretting her decision to stay with Rick. To Rick's great credit, he could see just a little bit ahead despite the emotions Ilsa brought out in Rick. How and where does Blaine identify and come to such a decisive moment? The answer is in the film somewhere. I keep looking for it. Blaine will think about Ilso every day. He's traded one torture for another. But at least Ilsa will be safe. Blaine is my guy. How did you do it Rick? And I see you are still standing. I bet it hurts like hell. Here's looking at you.I've seen Blaine referred to as a soldier of fortune. That probably referenced the line that Blaine fought in the Spanish Civil War. Those Americans in that war were generally not soldier of fortune types, mercs. They were idealistic volunteers, thrown into the front lines. They died in droves. The Americans fought together in the 15th International Brigade in Spain. Them that got out would have become cynical, defeated, and convinced that they would not stick their necks out for someone.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Dated, pre-war drivel","First, the cast - full of those annoying ""comic-relief"" that studios stuck in every movie from the 30's. Yes, I said the 30's, because Casablanca is much more a product of that decade than the 40's, which would deliver some truly great films. Those ""funny"" characters make Casablanca more like a menagerie than something with an intelligent plan. Humphrey Bogart - a great actor in The Caine Mutiny, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and even Petrified Forest...but not here. Totally unbelievable and unconvincing as a romantic lead. He doesn't even deliver as an anti-hero in this worn-out, overrated piece of pre-WWII propaganda. Ingrid Bergman - a beautiful lady, and a hundred times better in everything else she did...but a cartoon here. Claude Rains - typical 30's supporting role...goofy, but with a big heart; goes ""straight"" in the end. 30's nonsense.The story - lame and predictable. Why did people love Casablanca? Because it stirred their patriotism at a time when Germany was threatening to bulldoze Great Britain and everywhere else. It never was a great, much less an exceptional film.Nowadays, Casablanca coasts along on its shaky reputation, held up as a ""masterpiece"", but smelling like the aged soaper that it is.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
True classic,"There's such a wonderful since of composition and lighting throughout the whole movie.

The characters all have such great depth and it makes you wonder how these people all ended up in Casablanca and whether they'll be able to escape the town. It has so many different great themes such as politics, romance and comedy. The chemistry between Rick and Isla is fantastic and believable. The movie has a few twists in it and even though it was a post code movie there are some little things that you get the hint of that might not necessarily appropriate for the code.

What is particularly important is the desperation of this moment in history. It is brilliantly boiled down into a tableau of detailed interwoven personal stories of greed, power and need, love and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal.The acting is flawless across the board with these iconic actors really shinning; the screenplay dialogue is smart, witty, with hardly an unnecessary word; the direction and cinematography are flawless, with each scene framed like a movie poster; and the musical numbers contribute the environment and the emotional gravitas without making the film be contrived.

A Cultural Touchstone and a Major Influence For Future Directors,"The most quoted film in the history of cinema saw a copy of the play it was based on, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's,' lying in the cluttered office of a Warner Brothers' story editor for months. When it was discovered, scripted, produced and released in November 1942, ""Casablanca"" emerged as one of the most popular movies during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Its influence touched an inordinate amount of future film directors as well as it created a cultural touchstone for millions.Going into ""Casablanca's"" production, studio executives felt the film, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, would be just another movie centered around recent World War Two events. Instead, the war-time romance set in Vichy French Morocco was the dark horse winner for the Academy Awards 1943 Best Picture, and Michael Curtiz the Best Director winner. ""Casablanca"" has consistently been listed in the top ten 'Best Movie' polls, named the second best by the American Film Institute.""With rich and smoky atmosphere, anti-Nazi propaganda, Max Steiner's superb musical score, suspense, unforgettable characters (supposedly 34 nationalities are included in its cast) and memorable lines of dialogue,"" writes film historian Tim Dirks, ""it is one of the most popular, magical (and flawless) films of all time - focused on the themes of lost love, honor and duty, self-sacrifice and romance within a chaotic world.""
The unproduced play, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's,' was sitting in studio East Coast editor Jack Wilk's office. An associate producer under Hal Wallis rummaged through Wilk's shelves soon after Pearl Harbor looking for ideas with a war message, and saw potential in its dust-covered pages. When Wallis read the play he realized it could make for a good movie, and he had brothers Philip and Julius Epstein write the script. Inspired by the Charles Boyer 1938 movie ""Algiers,"" they gave the embryonic movie the geographical name where it took place, ""Casablanca.""
This was Bogart and Bergman's only film together. Their relationship on the set was cordial, while off the set they got together just once to discuss the movie during lunch early in the filming. Actress Geraldine Fitzgerald remembers her and the two at the table. ""The whole subject at lunch was how they could get out of that movie,"" Fitzgerald remembered. ""They thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable. I knew Bogart very well, and I think he wanted to join forces with Bergman, to make sure they both said the same things."" Bogart told Orson Welles during its filming, ""I'm in the worst picture I've ever been in."" Bergman saw the part of Ilsa a pure fluff, especially compared to her next film, her dream role in an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" Even Paul Henreid, whose character was resistance fighter Victor Laszio, realized playing fourth fiddle in ""Casablanca"" after co-starring with Bette Davis in ""Now, Voyager"" was a demotion. Julius Epstein admitted the script had ""more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better.""
Bogart was more upset with his actress wife Mayo Methot than the script. Her extreme jealousy towards Bergman drove the actor crazy. Whenever Mayo knew Bogie was scheduled to be in a scene with Ingrid, she would storm into his dressing room accusing him of having an affair. Ironically, Bogart hated those love scenes with Bergman. ""I don't like them, maybe because I don't do them very well,"" he admitted. ""It isn't possible to shoot a love scene without having a hairy-chested group of grips standing four feet away from you, chewing tobacco."" Standing a few inches shorter than Bergman, Bogart had to wear three-inch wooden blocks tied to his shoes, and when on a couch he sat on extra cushions next to her.Filming the conclusion in ""Casablanca, the script still had loose ends. Leading up to the scenes at the foggy city airport, American Rick Blaine (Bogart) had purchased a bar/casino in Casablanca, Morocco, after the Germans overran Paris where he was living in 1940. He was stood up at his appointed date with his girlfriend Ilsa Lund (Bergman), who heard her thought-to-be dead husband Victor Laszio was alive and had escaped a concentration camp, seeking Ilsa's help. Rick possessed German letters of transit (in the real world this was pure fiction) which would allow the couple to book passage on an airplane to Lisbon. The play ended with Rick arrested by the Germans and sent to prison for killing a German office as the couple were flying off, an ending which was a downer in wartime America. On the way to the studio to film the final scene, the Epsteins figured out how to solve the sticky situation by seeing corrupt local police captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) having a change of heart, telling his police underlings, ""Round up the usual suspects"" instead of arresting Rick. In addition, the Epsteins wrote two separate lines to chose for the ending as Rick was walking away from the camera with Renault. The first was Rick saying, ""Louis, I might have known you'd mix your patriotism with a little larceny,"" while the second was, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Producer Wallis picked the second, and summoned Bogart back to the studio to voice over one of cinema's greatest concluding quotes.The play had Rick and Ilsa's favorite song ""As Time Goes By"" carried over to the film. Played by Rick's close friend Sam (Dooley Wilson), the tune was composed for the 1931 play 'Everybody's Welcome."" In ""Casablanca,"" Bergman actually asks Sam who's tickling the keys on his piano to ""Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake."" Later, Bogie insists to Sam ""you played it for her, you can play it for me!"" The song ""As Time Goes By"" didn't qualify for the Academy Awards Best Song since it was introduced in 1931.Warner Brothers wanted to capitalize on the Allied landings in Morocco and the North African coast known as Operation Torch in late 1942, and rushed ""Casablanca"" for its November release. The film also received a boost in publicity during its January nationwide release coinciding with the Casablanca Conference where Allied leaders President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met. Roosevelt requested a special showing of the picture as soon as he returned to Washington, D. C. Even though ""Casablanca"" premiered in New York City on November 26, 1942, the movie didn't qualify for the Academy Awards until its showing in Los Angeles and nationwide in January 1943, a rule which delayed its consideration until the 16th awards ceremonies in March 1944, winning the Best Picture Oscar along with Curtiz as Best Director and Best Screenplay. Bogart and Rains were nominated, while Arthur Edeson's Best Cinematography, Owen Marks' Best Film Editing and Max Steiner's Best Musical Score were all nominees. The American Film Institute ranks ""Casablanca"" the second best Movie Ever Made, first as the Most Passionate, 'As Time Goes By' as the 2nd Best Song heard in film, Rick Blaine as the 4th Best Hero, 32nd as the Most Cheerful, and 37th Most Thrilling. Six lines were voted by AFI as the Best Quotes in Film, the most by far for any movie (1939s ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" share second with three Best Quotes.). ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" ad libbed by Bogart (fifth Best), ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship"" (20th Best), ""Play it, Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'"" (28th), ""Round up the usual suspects"" (32nd), ""We'll always have Paris"" (43rd), and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" (67th).

"It's not a bad film by any means, but the hype surrounding it is ridiculous","In some ways Casablanca is a very difficult film for me to review as there isn't really much technically wrong with it; it's well-scripted, fairly well-acted and the musical score is excellent. It's probably best to analyse this film by highlighting the good and the bad points of this film;What I liked about Casablanca in the first instance is the story; refugees who have come from different parts of Europe to the neutral safe haven of Casablanca which is in unoccupied French Morocco. In the beginning. we see snippets of various people who are desperate to leave Casablanca and we see these people have conversations with various people who are prepared to take bribes in order to fulfil their dreams of leaving Casablanca. Although Casablanca is an unoccupied area, refugees are still at risk of being forced into concentration camps hence their desire to flee for proper safe havens such as the US for example. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate who has fled occupied France and now runs a successful café/bar in Casablanca - he's a popular member of the community, but he becomes even more popular and important when several parties learn that he has acquired two exit visas - 1 of which is for Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid) who the German Reich are very interested in and who are very keen on Lazlo staying in Casablanca. Blaine becomes pivotal to Lazlo's fate, but Lazlo's wife perhaps also proves pivotal to Blaine's fate as well. This creates a bit of a dilemma for Blaine which helps to increase the intrigue within the film. There was also the wonderful Dooley Wilson's portrayal as Sam - he only had a small role in the film, but I found him to be a warm and caring character and his voice was very soothing and I could listen to him sing 'As Time Goes By' all day - such a wonderful voice. So far, so good....What I didn't like about Casablanca was how contrived and far fetched the romance was between Blaine and Lund; they fall head over heels for each other in a few days so much so that even 2 years later Blaine can't look at another woman or develop any sort of a relationship with any woman whatsoever. Please? Give me a break!! Don't get me wrong. I know that romances like this do exist, but they're usually built up over a long period of time and will usually come through several years of life experiences. I found it hard to believe that they would love each other that much when they both admit that they barely know each other; think about it. Would you fall in love with someone who you barely know? Remember don't confuse 'love' with 'lust'. It also didn't help that the film was pretty much devoid of any sort of tension or conflict - considering it is billed as a Drama, I didn't see much on screen that could be classed as Dramatic. Factor all of this with three unlikeable leads and you've got yourself a very flawed film (note that I said 'flawed' rather than 'bad').Casablanca is a film that is worth watching, but you really need to ignore the hype and judge it on its own merits. If you're a sucker for a nice war time romance then this will do the trick. However, if you look at it a bit deeper, you will see the good, but somewhat 'flawed' classic that I watched.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Do yourself a favor, watch this ASAP!","This will be my first ever movie film review for the past 500 movies I have rated in IMDb. Casablanca has been on my Watchlist for quite a while. I really regret for not watching this movie earlier.Casablanca is one of the FINEST Drama/Romance movie I have seen thus far. The acting for both Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are impeccable! Especially Ingrid! I really like her performance! Also, the cinematography is undeniably top notch consider it was filmed in the 1940s! Additional bonus is the music chosen were GREAT! I can go on and on.. but cut the long stories short, you are definitely watching it for a treat!I rarely give 10/10 for a movie. My collection of a 10/10 movie might not be flawless. But to me I will re-watch it again and again. Casablanca definitely belongs to that league.After watching Casablanca, I shall shift my priority from contemporary Drama/Romance to classical Hollywood. Damn! This movie made the current Drame genre look like crap!P.S. This is the oldest movie I have watched in my life so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
G.O.A.T,"This film is the G. O. A. T. It's visual appeal is defined by its use of black-and-white cinematography, which creates a timeless, romantic atmosphere. The crisp contrast between light and shadow enhances the film's dramatic tension and contributes to its iconic aesthetic.The set design and costumes in Casablanca are meticulously crafted, reflecting the glamour and style of the 1940s. The lavish interiors of Rick's Café, with its Art Deco details and opulent decor, create an inviting yet somewhat enigmatic backdrop. The film's costumes, from Ingrid Bergman's elegant gowns to Humphrey Bogart's sharp suits, not only define the characters' personalities but also embody the sophistication and charm of the period.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
2. Casablanca (1942),"It is considered the second greatest American movie of all time and I can see why. Casablanca is a well-directed and acted adaptation of a play. Rick is a saloon owner in the city of Casablanca in Morocco, which was under the control of the French until the Nazi's came. A women who he fell in love with comes to Casablanca and enters his bar which has him feeling upset. She had ditched him in France and he end up traveling with Sam the Piano Player. The movie portrays the Nazi's and the people who work for them in an interesting way. Ilsa Lund Laszlo claims she loves Rick but she is devoted to the cause of her Husband Victor. The movie sort of becomes a story of star-crossed lovers. The movie is both stylish and brilliant. This is a classic that well be with us forever. I give this move 5/5. Rated PG.TagLineThey had a date with fate in Casablanca!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless,"I just watch this movie on TCM again. Ben Mankiewicz was dscussing some behind the scenes information. My favorite scene was the cafe scene where when the Germans and French were dueling over their songs. Many of the actors had fled the Nazi terror ad the tears in their eyes were genuine. Also you have a movie that placed ""Duty and Honour"" over true love. One hundred years from now this movie will capture the hearts of movie fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best film ever,"This is to film what Don Giovanni is to opera. This film is flawless, with more memorable quotes, just as Don G. has 10 or more top of the line arias. Virtually every scene is a classic, especially the scenes where Bogart allows Henreid to drown out the Nazis with the French anthem, and the last scene. Dooley Wilson as Sam is Bogart's conscience, sort of like Jiminy Cricket. Claude Rains is wonderful as usual. He should have won at least 10 Supporting Actor Oscars, but especially here, as the collaborator who becomes a patriot. Likewise, Madeline LeBeau is great in a small role as the girl spurned by Bogart, then she dallies with the Nazis, but when Henried leads the Marseillese, she remembers what it means to be French.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Still relevant,"Casablanca is a film where the sum of its parts feels greater than the whole, blending strong acting, timely political themes, and immersive world-building to create an iconic experience. Rick's Café isn't just a set-it feels like a real place, a wartime liminal space you'd oddly want to visit despite the looming danger. It's a remarkable achievement, balancing the tension of a WWII setting with the allure of this smoky, cosmopolitan hangout. I still find myself wondering how the film manages to make this space so appealing despite the constant sense of peril.One thing I've always found curious is how Casablanca has outgrown its director. Last year, a professor asked who directed the film, and the class went silent. Given the artistry involved, it's a shame Michael Curtiz's name doesn't come up more. I plan to explore his other films since Casablanca is such a monumental achievement, and I'm curious to see how his directorial signature plays out in different contexts.Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick is a key element-he's a quiet giant, always fighting on the right side but never flaunting it. Sam's character, portrayed by Dooley Wilson, is refreshingly three-dimensional for the time. In contrast to many films that would have exaggerated his role into a stereotype, Casablanca gives him depth and dignity. Peter Lorre's brief role is also a standout; I only wish he had more screen time.What's remarkable is how relevant the film remains. Made in the thick of WWII, it's a daring piece of art that continues to resonate, not just for its historical context but for its emotional and thematic weight. Casablanca deserves its place in the canon and holds up to countless re-watches.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What is it about this movie??????,"I found ""Casablanca"" to be pretty unentertaining, funny at moments(sometimes unintentionally), but not worthy of being called a movie classic. Hell no! It's just another movie where Bogart is trying to look like he's to cool for school, and Bergman isn't anything special either. The best moments come from Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault and the best acting is played out by Paul Henreid. However, the story's what really sucks here. If that's really how people used to live half a century ago, then thank god for the 60's and the 70's. And if I'm is supposed to believe that in real life the love triangle would unfold as it does on the big screen or that Bergman just goes along with Bogart's last minute decision that she's in love with Victor Lazslo after all, leaving Bogie, the love of her life behind, well, then I'm offended. If that young couple just needed money to buy their way out of Casablanca, then why the hell didn't Bogart do the same. He was loaded. We're supposed to believe his character's background of being so terribly in love, experiencing a loss of that love, an over acted performance of going through pain when he rediscovers that love, yet in the final scene he doesn't show any sign of true heart break or any kind of pain. He decides he's going to cling to the past and let the love of his life, the only woman he ever loved and will ever love fly away forever. Pretty cheesy. But with some good one liners.     7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It was just so well told and many very famous lines came from it. Definetly one of the most memorible films ever made, especialy to me.

An undeniable masterpiece!,"This is considered a masterpiece for a reason. A very anti-war film, it is entirely filmed and produced during the Second World War. It is filmed entirely in a studio and yet the story, the dialogue, the characters, everything is so well structured and so well defined that they make a very interesting and a very compelling movie. ""Casablanca"" is an anti-war movie but at its core it is a love story of an unrequited love. Two star-crossed lovers are the main protagonists of the movie and the fact that we get to see their story unfold is what grounds the themes of the film, making it feel universal and very personal while showcasing that nothing really matters when there is a greater cause to be fought and when the uncertainty of a war that just began hits your door. I'm actually now, at my second watch, realising the full scale of greatness that this movie reaches. ""Casablanca"" is an undeniable masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Bogart at his very best...,"When Hal Wallis and Michael Curtiz paired Humphrey Bogart with Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre...well, that combination in and of itself was sufficient to make the movie a ""box office"" smash. However, the year was 1942 and the subject matter and scenario in 'Casablanca' was quite the contemporary issue for that time. No one could know the events that would occur in the following years, as the world waged the brutal battles of World War II. Yet, out of the growing global chaos, Curtiz was able to direct a masterpiece that will continue to rank among the best films ever made. This is classic, quintessential ""Bogey"" at his very best. Starring as Rick Blaine, with his sharp, if not, brash style, Bogart gives such life to this character with incredible precision, that he's worthy to be remembered for the classic line ""Here's looking at you kid...""Matched with the stellar performances of the other cast members, this movie will always be an industry standard for it's brilliance and consuming style.

The best movie ever made,"I discovered this movie about 15 years ago. I'm 33-years-old and had never really been one to go back and watch old black-and-white movies. The first movie I ever really remember going to see at the theater was Raiders of the Lost Ark. I was in love with the movies from then on. Oh, sure, I'd gone to the drive-in in rural Alabama and had seen various movies. But I had been too young and immature to really appreciate them for what they were. But when my uncle took me to see Raiders, I was hooked. For years, I considered Spielberg's masterpiece to be the best movie ever made. But then I happened to get hold of a VHS copy of Casablanca and checked it out. WOW! Moviemaking had been redefined for me. This movie has it all. Bogart is such an incredible presence. I think Harrison Ford is our modern-day answer to Bogart. The story is so straight-forward and so cool ... the backstory about the romance in Paris is great, perfectly handled. The one-liners are unforgettable, and the songs are enchanting. This is the whole package, alright. Perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Thank you, Kyle","I first saw Casablanca as a senior in high school. I wish I could say that it touched me then. But I can't. I was a dumb teenager who saw it as only an assignment.

My youngest step-son, Kyle, was 11 at the time. He's was, and still is, a huge movie fan. He loves the classics, even at that young of an age. He was over for a weekend visit and he suggested that we go downtown to see Casablanca. I agreed and off we went. I can honestly say that night changed my life. I absolutely fell in love with this movie. Even though I had already seen it, it was like seeing it for the first time. I wasn't clouded with my teenage narrow mindedness. Casablanca is my all time favorite movie and I watch it about every other month, on a Friday or Saturday night, with the lights out.

So simple, yet so complex. Thats kind of what the whole movie is. Very simple, but yet at the same time somewhat complex. And i think what makes it complex is Bogart's character.

Surprisingly modern,"Watching 'Casablanca' for the first time one is struck by a number of things: the already-known dialogue (though of course, not including the exact line, ""Play it again, Sam"", which no-one actually says); the swanky nature of Rick's bar, the very un-African nature of Casablanca in general and the fact that Sam, although a minor character, is a black man presented as intelligent and even a friend of the Humphrey Bogart's hero, in a way that can't have been completely normal in 1942. I also like the way that Sam's music is integrated into the film, although in places the soundtrack overdoes the romantic notes. It's also interesting to think about the story-lines chosen by film-makers before the war was won, although the film isn't quite as detached from the allied cause as it first suggests. Overall, it's aged much better than most films of its era, probably because it's mainly a character study, albeit one supported by a heavy dose of wisecracking; and it's stateless characters, drifting through a world that has lost it's certainties, live beyond the bounds of conventional morality in a very matter-of-fact way. Of course it won Oscars, but a comparison with the modern day is telling; in how many contemporary blockbusters does the hero let his girl go?",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Even better than you think,"It's hard to think of Casablanca, perhaps the most well-known and well-regarded movie of all time, as underrated. The paradigm selfless romance, set against WWII, with boffo performances by its main stars and supporting cast, small and large acts of heroism, leading up to a winning ending - all would be enough to make the film meaningful, charming, and exciting. Yet, there is a darker side than the setting would indicate. The film is a refugee story. The narrator starts off with people being chased from all over the world trying to get to America. Watching the film in 2025, it's a stark reminder of how far America has fallen - once the idea of hope and now, well, something else. The decisions to act, or not, are not just a matter of individual choice. Taking place before America entered the war, the film acts as a metaphor for America's then isolationism. The film is also much more carefully constructed than it seems at first. The parallel stories between the Hungarian woman who would sell herself to free her and her husband, and Ingrid Bergman's willingness to sacrifice herself for her more famous husband, keep throwing moral dilemmas at the viewer amidst very human stories of desperation. One doesn't notice these subtleties because of the Hollywood winningness. One can see this as a flaw, but instead, I see it as a strength. A film of immense moral power is allowed to sneak up on the viewer in a way that wouldn't be possible with a more direct approach.As I watched the film in a crowded art house theatre days before Trump's second term began, I sat transfixed with tears in my eyes. I was not sure if I was more moved by the nobleness of the characters or how far we've come from that nobility.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Memorable Classic Movie!,"This movie is a big milestone from the seminal times of Hollywood. Excellent story revolving around romance, forlorn love, betrayal, intrigue, escape and murder, nightlife, upheaval and reunion. In this way, the scope and scale of Casablanca is really enviable for other movie makers of the time.But, above all, exists the towering, dashing, bold, upright and magnanimous figurehead presence of Humphery Bogart as Rick. Rick is the one single ingredient in the film, which is the pivot of all the riveting poignant drama that is superbly played by Bogart. Besides, the script and screen writing is marvelous for those early times of motion picture industry. I am really amazed by the thoughtful direction of Curtiz who majestically and effectively steered the intrigue laden drama from the many puzzling twists and turns into a most morally upright finale. A must see for all serious movie buffs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Wow,"Casablanca was a great movie out of the 1940's. Scratch that of all time. Humphrey Bogarts is an absolutely outstanding actor. He plays this part just amazing.

And every time there after for a matter of fact. I could watch this movie over and over again unlike most movies I have watched for my Cinema class, as I really enjoyed this film. I would recommend this movie to everyone not only because of how great a film it is but because it really is on of the best movies in all of American Cinema and thats not only my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You Must Remember This,"It's almost unfair to lavish praise on CASABLANCA, for such universal praise comes the expectation of the masterwork of an auteur such as Welles or Hitchcock. The result could not be farther from that expectation, and indeed it is difficult to describe just how and why CASABLANCA remains such a beloved film. Here is a film that nobody wanted to make (especially the stars, who only bonded when trying to get out of the film), that was saddled with production problems from day one due to the incomplete script, and somehow has turned into the most brilliant accidental masterpiece in American cinema.Humphrey Bogart stars as a cross between a Hemingway anti-hero and Jesus in a waiter's outfit. Richard Blaine, American, age 37 with questionably brown eyes and a sketchy past, runs a popular nightclub in Casablanca during the early days of WWII that attracts a rainbow of diverse characters from Italian thieves to bickering Frenchmen, from desperate refugees to German officers. Rick has all the right things to say (courtesy of the brilliant dialogue via the Epstein Twins, Howard Koch and Casey Robinson) but is deeply flawed, a cynical, selfish man with clearly no respect for himself or other people save the French officer Louis Renault and best friend, the piano-playing Sam. Just as the audience is wondering what made Rick such a complex character, the answer comes in the form of the beautiful Ilsa Lund (the ethereal Ingrid Bergman), who of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, walks into Rick's and turns his life upside down. As the woman he once loved and got away for unexplained reasons, it becomes clear that Rick still bears the scars of her leaving him--and that Ilsa still loves him. Now married to Czech resistance fighter Viktor Lazlo (Paul Henried), the couple try in vain to acquire exit visas and, believing that Rick has two letters of transit that would allow anyone to leave Casablanca without question, Ilsa and Viktor try to crack his outer crust, and Rick must choose between his love for Ilsa and his idealistic interior he only thinks he can hide.When one looks objectively at CASABLANCA, there isn't a lot to rave about, and yet everything comes together so seamlessly. Michael Curtiz's fine knowledge of how the camera told a story was put to excellent use here, from the sweeping shots that pass through imaginary walls to the delicacy of Ingrid Bergman's face. The script, written by at least four different screenwriters while shooting was taking place, should've collapsed under the weight of its own multiple genres and chaotic preparation, but the actors say their lines with a conviction and believability it's difficult to realize that nobody wanted to be there in the first place.Above all things, it's the characters and performances that make CASABLANCA what it is today. As Roger Ebert pointed out, all the characters are so good, and even the ones that are meant to be ambiguous (such as Renault) or crooks (such as Ugarte), they are so interesting and lively the audience feels compelled to follow them out of Rick's and see where fate takes them. At the center of all this is Rick and Ilsa's tortured love affair. Unlike almost all other love stories, the audience never knows how Rick and Ilsa first met. Unlike almost all other love stories, it doesn't matter; the audience doesn't need a meet-cute scene within the Paris flashback--we see it all in the way Bogart and Bergman look at each other with such love and understanding, and we feel their pain of witnessing their awkward encounter almost two years after Ilsa ran away from Rick. It is a testament to the actors yet again that makes a rather conventional love story so interesting and involving. The role of an anti-hero is one Humphrey Bogart could've sleepwalked through, but under Michael Curtiz's direction there's an understanding just beneath the surface that breaks through. And Ingrid Bergman more or less disowned the film that cemented her in film history (and objectively speaking Ilsa is a very underwritten character), but she was above all things a professional; she did her job and she did it so well she was never able to escape the praise that followed her to her death. Her most celebrated scene is perhaps when Curtiz lets the camera linger on her gorgeous face while Sam plays ""it,"" and memories of love and pain come rushing back. Any other actress would've overplayed it, but Bergman is almost doing what another famous Swedish import had done 9 years earlier, when Greta Garbo made a blank face and let the audience interpret the final close-up of QUEEN Christina, even though the audience *does* know what Ilsa's thinking, and it's all the more poignant for Bergman's performance.How CASABLANCA has survived for over 60 years is a miracle, and it'll continue to inspire for another 60 years, because it's still the same old story: a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die. All great literature and films are still relevant because of their universal themes; in this case, the world will always welcome a great love story, terrific acting and classic storytelling as time goes by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Humphrey Bogart is amazing, as well as the rest of the cast. This film is filled with drama, humor, and romance all rolled in to one.

A movie that could pick up the pace,"`Casablanca' is a very well known movie by people of all ages.   A lot of whom enjoy the movie quite a bit and some who maybe don't enjoy it as much. This reviewer liked the movie for the most part.  It has an interesting plot, but one that mainly people of an older age would understand.  It has romance (and that's always a good thing) and it may even teach it's viewers a little something about history that they might not already know.  One of the only problems with the movie is that it's slow moving.  It's a lot of talk and no action.  Movies don't have to be all about blowing things up and killing people to be good, but `Casablanca' involved maybe a little bit too much talking, at least at one time.  At one point in the movie one of the main characters was talking for so long that this reviewer found herself starting to drift off.  Movies should grab the audience's attention and keep it.  `Casablanca' is a good movie, just one that could maybe be improved a little by picking up its pace.All of the acting was very good.  Most of it was rather believable and didn't come across as too cheesy.  At the times when an actor/actress was supposed to be making a really long speech, they did so very well with a lot of the right emotion needed to convey what they were saying.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, is supposed to be a bad boy who deep down inside has a heart.  Bogart did a very good job of portraying this.  Throughout the film Rick just seems to be cool and self-confident.  It's like he's what every boy wants to be, especially since the ladies like him.  All of the acting done in `Casablanca' only helped to make the movie what it is today, a timeless classic.A big portion of the film is set in Rick's American Café, which is just about the only American thing in Casablanca.  Because of this almost all of the music is a piano playing in the background or someone singing.  There is music that has been added in, but a lot of it is music coming straight from something in the movie.  The whole idea of doing that gives the viewer more of a feel like they're there with the people on screen and not just watching them.  It should be used in more movies these days.`Casablanca' came out in the 40's and, of course, the special effects back then weren't as good as they are now.  There was one scene in particular where the movie was really lacking in this area.  Ilsa, played by Ingrid Berdmen, and Rick (Bogart) are driving in a car together only they're not really driving.  There is a fake background behind them and it seems like they're just jumping up and down in their seats and smiling.  This whole thing is in other old movies too.  It just shows how far Hollywood has come with their special effects.`Casablanca' is a good movie that could be improved a little.  There are a lot of movies out there that this reviewer would love to own and `Casablanca' just isn't one of them.  Yes, it is a classic and a great movie, but it's just not the type of movie that this reviewer enjoys.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the Five Best Movies Ever Made,A great movie from the first scene to the last. Bogart defines what it means to be a movie star. It is the strongest screenplay in the history of film. Required viewing for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of filmmaker. Watch it over and over and over until you know it by heart because this film will always be the formula for a successful Hollywood Picture. The pacing is fast. The scenes are short. The dialogue is crisp and non superfluous down to the syllable. The scenes build on each other and payoff in clusters seamlessly in the structure of a classic three act narrative. There is nothing fancy about Casablanca. It is simply the pinnacle of classic Hollywood craftsmanship and a monument to the artform. Bogart's performance in Casablanca will always be the standard by which all leading roles are measured against.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Here's to you, Kid.","In World War II Casablanca, Rick Blaine, exiled American and former freedom fighter, runs the most popular nightspot in town. The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault does what he can to please him, including detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa, Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan....During the first few scenes in Rick's nightclub, issues of World War II are shown through the mixed customers of Vichy French and Nazi officials, refugees, and thieves. On top of that, tensions between the Vichy French and French patriots are shown in one pivotal scene, where a group of Nazi officers, led by Strasser, sing a German patriotic song, while Laszlo and the rest of the crowd sing the French national anthem, eventually drowning out the Germans.Casablanca is a classic, with Citizen Kane and The Godfather. Everyone knows that. But if you know me, I usually find classics like these overrated, because I set high expectations for these films before watching the movies that, in the end, I am left disappointed. Casablanca is no different. No, the movie isn't bad by any means. In fact, I think the movie will grow on me after I watch it several times. However, right now, I don't seem to be getting the hype.I liked the performance by Humphrey Bogart, as the unemotional, bitter man. He plays it quite well. Ingrid Bergman plays decently alongside him, both having a good chemistry with each other. The others, including Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, are decent in here too. The score is pretty memorable but what I love most about this film is that each character seems to be well in the end because throughout the film, they all seem to be miserable people that have gone separate ways. These are good people and it's good for us, the audience, to know they aren't angry in the end because they each deserve their happiness.The film is also shot in black and white, even though the use of color was an option for the filmmakers. Sometimes, certain films are better to be told in black and white, while others are better told in color. No doubt, Casablanca works well being in black and white, although there is a colored version out there. The scenes are heightened with the use of shadows and key things being pointed out are the advantages of this filter.Overall, although I may find Casablanca to be overrated, I enjoyed it. I liked the love story and I was really satisfied in the end. If you have yet to see this film, see it. Although it may not be as good as its reputation holds, it's still a pretty great romance/film noir for any movie lovers to enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Looks like the story was written by a six year old,"The movie is predictable, the lines are predictable, Bogart chain smokes all the time. The ending is predictable. The acting is stiffed. People watching the plane flying over looks like they were acting.I went to comatose over 10 times. Rewatched it by hanging myself upside down with my pet bat and still couldn't feel anything for the movie. I was again forced fed to watch to understand why these monkey brained movie critics liked about the movie and I still couldn't stand it. It is obvious that Ingrid Bergman is running away, and why is it that Bogart don't get a bit suspicious? He could get suspicious and just still like the woman with a double feelings for her by reminiscing that incidence.Oh yeah bitter Bogart, and yeah cynical Bogart became idealistic in the end. And good friend the stupid cop also decides to become idealistic also, but what are the mathematical odds against this scenario? But isn't that stupid? Isn't the ending a bit messy for Bogart and the cop just for just silly women? I mean the ending is so predictable and I guessed the ending of the movie since the beginning of the romance, breakup and welcome back and another (I will not mention the ending)... but you could have guessed.Couldn't the ending be like this: Bogart doesn't even have to sell his entire business - he can just get a partnership and still retain the interests, and what happened to poor Sam the piano player - throw away an old pal and cop and Bogart become fugitive? No way! Even in real life, it would be fair to say that if I were Bogart, I would dump the woman anyway since she had a previous boyfriend. It just not credible. And what to do if Bogart shot the police who tries to inform the authorities? Simple just pay your local cop under the table and it's business as usual.Do you really need to sell the ownership of Cafe Americain? That would be a stupid idea. Even if Bogart was under house arrest, he can still escape and yet still maintain his control through his old pal the Piano player Sam and if that's not possible just get another partnership to run the show. He can also retain control by through his banks and his check signing, etc. without having to be physically present at Cafe Americain.Again poor choices of Bogart a cynical man should have some business shrewdness like him should have been a bit more practical in his business affair without having to sacrifice any idealism for love, romance or anything else that comes his way.Is there other ways to NOT SELL Bogart business? Yes there are other ways. You can lease the business on a 10 year basis with furniture, equipment, Sam the piano player etc. and once the lease is over, he can get the ownership back. Or how about another idea, franchising? Just franchise Cafe Americain to your competitors and collect royalties. I mean there are a lot of ways out here, but no one who watches the movie tries to imagine the best way out for these poor creatures (Bogart, cop and Sam).The cop in the end of the story is very unlikely to run away, but he can be just part of the cover-up. In fact there weren't any witness anyway. And why would he do the cover-up? Simple: he also gets the commissions from the Roulette wheel.Because of the messy ending and see-sawing of story, I can see clearly that the writers were a bit messy and undecided and therefore decide to put every trash into the movie and crossed their fingers, while making sure the main point of the ""fair ending"" is o.k. but did not clear all the loose ends.So much for a story that is poorly written! Get real. The story is not even close to realism!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Greatest Film on Earth,"Wow! The first time I watched Casablanca in school. But I didn't get to see all of it. So I rented it and watched it at least 5 times in one night. It's so great and I just love Ingrid Bergman playing Ilsa Lund. Her appearance and her lines. My favorite line of her: ""You know how much I loved you, how much I still love you"" But in general I think this movie just rocks the cinema. I have seen it once on the big screen and it was so different from watching it on TV. I bought that film in two versions (english+german) and I'm planning on buying it in italian, too. I can only say that it's the best movie I've ever seen and that it's my favorite one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bergman's the best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The world will always welcome lovers,"This is the romantic film that will still be here in 100 years. Bogart and Bergmann are at their peak, and Bergmann is beautiful. It is a movie which is believable and a joy to watch either alone or with company. I have seen it numerous times and I rarely notice it's not in colour. Many scenes are enthralling. The song ""As time goes by..."" always reminds me of this film and Bogart. Many phrases stick with me after each viewing, ""Play it Sam, you played it for her, play it for me."", ""it ain't worth a hill of beans"", ""we'll always have Paris."", ""It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory."" It's one of those films that you couldn't see it with other actors in the parts, all of them are perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
effortless,"The lasting attraction of this film must be its seemingly effortless use of the medium.  We know that Casablanca was at the time one of dozens of ""cardboard cutout"" features from Warner Brothers' World War Two domestic audience assembly line.  This film was not intended to be a classic.  What happened?  One can watch this movie without sound and marvel at the human struggle in northern Africa. Did Michael Curtiz perfect his directorial technique during the silent film era?  Obviously his silent film experience is evident.  Why watch Casablanca with the sound off?  One would miss the orchestration by Max Steiner and vocal by Arthur Dooley.  The dialogue is very rich, the plot compelling and acting perfect.  Someone will try to convince you that this whole effort was well planned.  My understanding is that it was not.  This film is an accident that happens only once every few generations and it is a joy to experience again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca-Greatest film of all time?,"There has been much written about Casablanca since it was released in 1942 and most of it is about the excellence of this classic film. You can't help but love this picture! You become mesmerized by the actors and the scenes they play. The story is interesting and the film in my opinion is flawless. After watching this picture your faith in humanity is once again restored. These people are the real superheroes, not the cartoon characters worshiped in today's films. 
Rick Blaine and Victor Lazlo where no Redford or Newman when it came to looks, but damn if they weren't sexier! Who knew after watching Bogie in so many 30's gangster flicks that he would be the epitome of love and romance in the 40's. And how can you not help but love and feel empathy for Ingrid Bergman as we watch her struggle with the love she feels for Rick and the pride and loyalty she feels for Victor? As always, Claude Rains, Perez Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, Leonid Kinskey and the remaining supporting cast are remarkable. 
If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor, grab a box of Kleenex, round up the usual suspects and watch this film. You won't be sorry.

The best ever,"Not much can be said about one of the most glorious accidental triumphs in movie history. The right stars, the right supporting cast, the right director and particularly the right script came together magically for the best movie in Hollywood history.I often say that this movie is like Stairway to Heaven - it has been ripped off so many times, that to watch it now for the first time can make it seem full of cliches - as long as you were aware that it was this creation that started all the cliches.Briefly, the plot concerns the coming together of half-a-dozen main players in Casablanca during the middle of the second World War. Humphrey Bogart is the archetypical softie with the hard, cynical shell, Paul Heinreid is a wonderfully noble leader of men, Ingrid Bergman truly makes you believe that a man could obsess about her for years.  Claude Rains is wonderfully devillish as the corrupt prefect of police, Sidney Greenstreet positively Machiavellian as a business rival and Peter Lorre incredible as a cheap hood.Watch this movie, and for the love of all that's holy, make sure it is in the original black and white!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Here's lookin at you, kid""","Look at the above summary, then question: ""What the heck kinda line is that?"" Well, despite the fact that that is exactly what I thought, no-one can deny that ""Casablanca"" is a timeless classic, and a deserved one, too. Anybody who appreciates films should see this immediately, considering how epic in scope it is, and how likable it still remains to be. Yes, Casablanca really is marvellous.But why? Well, the plot goes like this: Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a saloon, and a popular one, too. He's accompanied by Sam, his singer on the piano (one of the films main great features: the musical score) right at the start of the second world war. One day, his ex-lover walks in the door, accompanied with her husband. Rick sinks into oblivion, alcohol his only friend.A curiously simple set up, but a marvellous romance- you really can feel the passion and chemistry between the two stars, as events unfold and destiny takes its course.Funny and epic, the best of all time.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Romantic wartime classic, but not my favorite","Yes, it is classy and a classic but personally, though I adore World War II movies, Casablanca is simply not my favorite. I love both the stars, the unique and immortal Humphrey Bogart, also the perennially wonderful and sympathetic Ingrid Bergman. And they have tremendous chemistry together here. That's the problem, there's just not enough of the love story and too much indecipherable wartime intrigue that I could never really quite fathom.The plot revolves around a cynical, enigmatic American expatriate, Rick Blaine (Bogart) who runs a nightclub in Nazi occupied Casablanca. An old love, Ilsa (Bergman) arrives there with her husband, Victor Laszlo (leader of the European Resistance). Rick holds some bitterness toward Ilsa as she ran out on him years earlier in Paris. Meanwhile, there is assorted intrigue regarding some vital letters of transit that Rick has in his possession. He has the chance to turn his love's husband, Laszlo, over to the SS and be free to leave Casablanca with Ilsa. The question is...will he?As I mentioned, the intrigue befuddled (and bored) me. For me, this old black and white wartime classic is all about three things, the amazing song ""As Time Goes By"", the memorable and famous closing scene (which I won't give away) and the following...Much of the interaction between the characters occurs at Rick's nightclub, the Cafe Americain (the setting around which the film sort of revolves). There is one unforgettable scene there in which some drunken Nazi soldiers are singing the German national anthem. Resistance leader Laszlo orders the playing of the forbidden Marseillaise, the band starts up (with Rick's permission), Laszlo bursts into the French anthem, and the other club patrons gradually chime in, drowning out the Germans. It's fabulous! You can't help but cheer.It's a famous old classic which I really should watch again. Maybe now that I'm older (and smarter?), I can ferret out all that intrigue!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Another timeless classic???,"...what does that mean? A timeless classic. I am told that there are many of them out there in the world of film, and of course, this is all based upon opinion. I saw Casablanca many years ago before seeing the many films I have today, and it was OK. It made me think of Indiana Jones if he settled down and ran a club, but only because the film is based during the same era. Now that I have recently watched it again after multiple viewings of..let's say...Fanny and Alexanrda, Citizen Kane, The 400 Blows, Beauty and the Beast (1946), and even Gone With the Wind, I still don't get why this film is ranked higher than these other films by people.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of it, but I just think it's a bore, and that is my opinion. Humphrey Bogart has never really done anything for me, not even with the countless viewings of The African Queen I had to sit through every time they had it on TV while growing up. I feel that because of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman being in it automatically gives people the right to dub it a ""timeless classic"". When I think of a what that means, ""timeless classic"", I think of the re-play value that the film has. Of course the acting is good, and the cinematographry is wonderful, it's the mood and tone of the film that brings me down.So if you have not seen this, please do have a watch. You might fall in love with it and you might not. I'm sure I will see it again someday down the road, and maybe my attitude on it will have changed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Just Great,"What is really strange to me is that I was talking to a few people at work and most of the younger people said to me that ""I don't do black and white"". As if this was a strange and odd way to see a movie.  All I can say is maybe they don't know anything about American culture.  Does ""I don't do black and white"" mean that ""I am an idiot"".  I don't know.  But what I do know is that this movie is a true American work of art.  One of the best indications of what we as Americans have given to the rest of the world. When non-Americans say that we as a nation have nothing in the way of culture, let them see this movie and tell me that Americans don't have culture. What I am trying to say is that Casablanca is not only great entertainment but it shows that Americans can express the true human condition through film as well as anyone can through the written word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Genuinely deserving of the classic title,"This film is already, and deservedly, considered a classic. I hardly feel worthy or equipped to review it, since I doubt I have anything original to add to the praise it has already received. However, I'll try to add a few brief words to those of the plaudits. . .Casablanca is a black and white movie starring Humphrey Bogart (as bar owner Rick) and Ingrid Bergman (as love interest Ilsa) set in the troubled African port during the second world war. The port is a melting pot of Nazis, patriots, travellers and chancers, whose mixed agendas mix uneasily inside Rick's gin joint bar - the setting for the bulk of the movie.Rick is busy minding his own business - street wise survival - until the arrival back into his life of the woman he has tried to forget, Ilsa, and her resistance leader partner. Through no choice of his own, fate has disrupted his uneasy peace and he has to confront his past, present and future again.Bogart is simply perfect as Rick, and the chemistry between him and Bergman is a treat to watch. The supporting cast of characters are strong too, with Claude Rains portrayal of the manipulating Captain Renault (loyal only to himself) an important anchor to the story.The dialogue is intense, sharp and wonderful. The story is multi layered but accessible. The pace is perfect. The music adds to rather than distracts. It is a love story, a story of manipulation, deceit and desperation, a story of troubles, human instinct and survival.It is all of this, and yet it is an engrossing and effortless watch. One of those films that becomes more familiar and enjoyable as you watch it again, and pick up on the many subtle nuisances it has to offer.Worthy indeed of the title of 'classic'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
We'll always have Casablanca,"Casablanca is one of the greatest movies ever made, and I have always loved it.

"For me, it's not so special...","Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca' is a superb film of it's time, but regarding it as one of the greatest films of all-times is surely a little more than it is. I am not changing the fact of the stature named 'Casablanca', this is my personal opinion.Set during World War II, it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, love and virtue. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis. Curtiz's direction is the main-stay of the film. His work is awe-inspiring and undoubtedly amongst the best ever!In the acting department, Humphrey Bogart is incredible.

It still holds up!,"After the American Film Institute issued its list of the 100 greatest films of all-time, I started making regular trips to my local Hollywood Video to rent groups of three or four of them.  My summer ran out before I could round out the top twenty, but of the handful that I got around to seeing, ""Casablanca"" was my favorite.I'm currently enrolled in a Gangster Films class, where we screen and discuss classic films in the gangster genre.  Having seen films like the original ""Scarface,"" ""The Public Enemy,"" and others, it amazes me that, while these films are great, they feel extremely dated.The dialogue is clearly circa 1930, and the sets are all clearly just that, sets.But then, you see ""Casablanca.""  While the film is now 60 years old, it still holds up to modern cinema in every way.  The characters are believable and sympathetic.  Rick's unrequited love is painful (emotionally, not because it's awful, because it's not) to watch, not because Bogart is a great actor (though he is.  One of the best), but because it's written in such a way that all of us who have ever pined for ""the one who got away"" know exactly how he feels.I'll spare you a summary, because by now, you know the story.  You know the dialogue, you know the shots.  ""Casablanca"" is one of the most important films ever.

Boy... was I disappointed to the point of mad,"This movie, frankly, does not deserve its high ranking.The plot, such as it is, is that Rick is trying to run a cafe in Casablanca, refugee zone, where Victor Laslo and his spouse Ilsa, a former lover of Rick, show up during World War 2. Victor must get out, but Rick, who has accidentally gotten some papers of transit (which are widely known to be a nonsense concept in reality) Somehow, Victor's got to get those papers, and we're supposed to be entertained by a lot of people just standing around trying to be witty, and often (except Claude Rains a few times) falling flat on their face.This has got to be the worst possible way to approach a story about World War Two. It's about a LOVE STORy, and, of course, a Hollywood type where affairs are justified so long as the parties are attractive enough. No real explorations into what was going on at the time are made, and frankly, the ""All Nazis Are Bad, But We Allies Can't Help But Be Good."" stance frankly was old by then: it's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL reversed only not as well made. I mean, yes the Nazi Party was the most blatantly evil in existence (maybe the Japanese one was as bad if you study what happened in China) but that doesn't mean every nazi was ready to shoot at a moment's notice, and not every officer a more arrogant version of Colonel Klink.Wrapping up: This movie is obsolete trash not worthy of your time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Best of the Best,"I never get tired of this film - no matter how many times I've seen it. And every player in this film - from S.Z. Sakall and Dooley Wilson to Bogart, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman - is absolutely brilliant. More emotion you'll never see in a film - for my money. These actors are fully vested in this film and more complex and nuanced performances you'll never see. Every aspect of this film is genius - from the story to the cinematography (and...I'm not sure...but could one argue that this was the very first and very best example of the film noire genre - does this qualify? It certainly sets the standard.) The tension is palpable, the dialog crackles with wit and intensity...for my money this is impossible to top. And it stays taught right to the very end...and who could argue that the very last line isn't the very best and most memorable in film history (in a film replete with memorable lines)? It's a great romance, a great thriller, a great War movie...it succeeds on so many levels - most EVERY level. And it is so riveting! It thrills from start to finish. And these are characters that not only love people and truly love each other, which makes you care all the more about their fates. These are characters you fall in love with and come to admire deeply, for the heroism they display in the face of almost insurmountable odds. (Can anyone not be moved by Sam's devotion to his bristly boss, Rick? That relationship defines the word ""true friend."" I had a friend like that once - they do exist - but they are a rare breed...and how moving is it to see this kind of thing in action in Casablanca?!) These characters are examples for us all - and though imaginary, they are recreations of real heroes who existed at the time and defeated the forces of evil in World War II. Bogie fans, of course, will love this film (it is arguably his finest...which is saying a lot, since his performances in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo and many other films were brilliant too), as will Ingrid Bergman fans (her performance here rivals her performance in Notorious)...but you don't have to be a fan of any of them to recognize their greatness in Casablanca. (Peter Lorre deserves a mention too - his work here is memorable and noteworthy; it's a shame he wasted his great talent in too many lesser films afterward - except, of course, for The Maltese Falcon, his re-pairing with Bogie - which made for a wonderful chemistry.)

I am only speaking honestly though when I say that it wasn't that good. I mean I guess I could say I enjoyed it and all. But I just don't see what everybody is so crazy about.  It had some good moments and all but what else was so good? I didn't even think Bogart was that good. This is the first Bogart movie I've seen though so maybe he has better performances. I just recently became interested in movies and I am trying to watch many of the really old greats.  I recently watched The Third Man, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Comparing all of these to Casablanca, they are all better.

Timeless Romance,"In the days of my youth I merely thought CASABLANCA was a wonderful movie -- exciting, hopelessly romantic and very satisfying. Humphrey Bogart was the man who more than any other I wanted to be and who, in occasional fantasies, I imagined I was. Ingrid Bergman was the woman I wanted to love and protect from all dangers. At first, Paul Henreid did not really fit into my calculations. The idea of the noble sacrifice was quite new to me then, but I caught on quickly and, having toyed with the idea that Henreid instead of Bogart should have gone off to Brazzaville with Claude Rains, I realized that things had to work out as they did, and I felt better for accepting the fact.A half-century later, I love CASABLANCA not a whit less, probably even more because, like all the movies we loved in our youth, it now carries a rich frosting of personal associations and a sweet melancholy, born of the intimations of mortality -- the viewer's own, confirmed as it were by the passage of the film's wondrous stars.And, after a half-century, I can see CASABLANCA, at least a little more objectively, as the apotheosis of the Hollywood romantic melodrama, a kind of fearless and perfected make-believe that you probably couldn't get away with today. Singing the Marseillaise in the face of the snarling Gestapo men! As I am frequently told (as if it were somehow my fault), they don't make movies like that any more. It's true, they don't, and I explain sadly that it's because they don't make the world the way they used to, either. Romantic idealism doesn't come as easily as once it did. Information, and rather too much of it, has led us toward being, in Oscar Wilde's formulation, cynics who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. We can't play make-believe the way we used to, and the loss is ours. Out of wartime reality, Howard Koch and the Epstein brothers, Philip and Julius, constructed a beautiful, tragic, heroic dream and no small part of its appeal now is that it arose and reflected the world in which things seemed to be simpler and clearer. (Whether they were or not is irrelevant.)Thirty viewings later (at least), I still can't watch only a little of CASABLANCA; I have to stay aboard until Brazzaville. And I can't watch any of it without a tightening of the throat and a hint of moisture in the eyes, sighing for the kind of immortality the movies provide their stars and the savor they lend to our more transient lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Bogart's performance dates the whole film,"I know that Casablanca is almost sacred but it is now over 80 years old and some things don't stand up as well as they once did.Thankfully this is not a film that has dated badly and it still has plenty of elements for a modern audience to enjoy. The setting may be specific to WWII, but the idea of a group of untrustworthy characters seeking a ""Golden Ticket"" that will allow them to escape to a better life is timeless.And of course, in this case, one of the characters that turns up is the former lover of a bar owner who has been trying to put his past behind him. We are talking, of course, about Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa and Humphrey Bogart's Rick. Star-crossed lovers in a famous cinematic romance.But although Bergman still shines, Bogart's performance has dated. His language, attitude and style of delivery is old fashioned (the famous ""Here's looking at you kid"" line is repeated about 4 times). Is this because of over-familiarity, or is it because his style of masculinity has long since gone out of fashion? Either way, his hard-boiled delivery just doesn't work for me.However there is a lot to be enjoyed in the supporting cast. Peter Lorre's devious black marketeer, and Claude Rains' police captain are both scene-stealing creations.It remains a good film but no longer a great one. The effect of time cannot be ignored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Ehh...,"I've had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'd been working my way through all of the other movies surrounding it. I finally forced myself to watch it using the logic of ""it's ranked high on the IMDb Top 250, how bad could it be"".To clarify, I am not saying that Casablanca is a bad movie, I'm just not saying it's fantastic. I can see how it might be ""groundbreaking"" and ""innovative"" back when it was made in the 40's, but in todays world, it is not amazing. It's very difficult to compare a movie from the 40's to a movie from the 21st century, in fact the only way I know to compare movies is based on my afterthoughts.What qualifies a movie as 10 stars for me, is a movie that either gives me the chills at the needs because of how amazing the ending was, or if the movie keeps me thinking about it for days afterward. It's a movie that has an ending that is permanently engraved in me. Movies like The Shawshank Redmption, The Sixth Sense, The Intouchables, Memento, The Green Mile, Full Metal Jacket, etc...A 9 star movie is a movie that I find to be entertaining, but not quite as memorable as a 10 star. The 9 star category for me has a lot of good movies in the category, such as Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Fight Club, etc...However, Casablanca is not as memorable as any of those movies either. The movie is not, I just don't find myself challenged by the movie. The acting was okay, but nothing that blew my mind. I understand the message of the movie, and how powerful it was supposed to be. The movie was slow, too slow for me. It left me with the same problems as the Godfather; I think that the movie is building up to some dramatic ending, but then it just mellows out.This seems like the kind of movie that was regarded as the best of all time for many years, but, unfortunately for fans of this movie, there are many other movies that surpass this one. My opinion is that people tend to rate movies they consider ""classics"" higher than the new blockbusters, even if both eras are capable of producing movies that are equally as good as one another.Honestly, the only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating than it has (from me) is because there was never a part in the movie where I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but there were scenes where I began to fall asleep. Five minutes after the movie was over, I found myself thinking about my plans for the following day, and what I planned on having for dinner. When I watched higher rated movies, for example Into The Wild (10 stars), I found myself putting myself into the protagonists situation, and then i found myself running to the bookstore to get the book about the true story. This movie didn't have that lasting impression on me.Even though my opinion is most likely contrary to every other movie watcher on here, I think that i have a valid point by saying that this moving brings nothing ""revolutionary"" to the table, and by that I mean that there is no part of this movie that leaves me teary eyed, laughing hysterically, or piece together a complex mystery. The movie is just... ehh...",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My all time favourite,"This is far and away my favourite movie of all time. I first saw it on some TV Sunday matinée when I was a teenager, and instantly fell in love with Ingrid Bergman.The movie appears to be filled with clichés, BUT many of those clichés originated from this film. The dialogue is snappy, the characters are wonderfully scripted, and even the minor characters help make this a memorable experience. This was helped at the time by the casting of many refugee artists in minor roles, including the extras in the street scenes.There is no scene wasted, no unnecessary aspects to the story-telling. The lighting is atmospheric when it needs to be. And the ending ... well, I won't spoil it, but it became an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"I said, ""22""!","There's nothing like a Romantic Classic, and since the AFI recently named ""Casablanca"" as the Number One romance film of all time, here's yet another review for the Film That Has It All.  As the IMDB tagline says, ""They had a date with fate!""""Casablanca"" will take you away to a time and a place where good guys (Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, who runs ""Rick's Café Americain,"" an oasis with the best music in town) were good, though flawed, bad guys were nasty Nazis, and beautiful women were, well, in a word, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). The closeups of her alone are worth the price of admission.Based on a play, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's Place,"" the movie's dialogue is spectacular -- Rick and Louie's (Claude Rains) banter in particular is very funny, witty, and fast-paced, with no fat. The film's black-and-white texture and the exotic setting in Casablanca paint a picture of a time and a place where things fall into the grey areas in a world starkly divided between Axis and Allies.  The quirky market scenes and the opening narration (with the map, to show you exactly where Casablanca is located) set the stage for the events to follow.Claude Rains and Peter Lorre (who makes an early exit) complement Bogie perfectly, and the supporting cast -- Paul Henreid as Czech underground resistance leader (and Ilsa's husband) Victor Laszlo, the German couple trying to get to America, and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari, the city's black marketeer -- are nothing short of spectacular.  Every actor in this movie makes their characters 100 percent real.The entire plot -- based on Laszlo's mysterious entry into Casablanca and whether he will be able to get out to carry on his fight against the Germans -- is riveting.  Perhaps the most incredible thing about the movie is when it was made: 1942, in the heart of World War II, when the outcome was not assured.There are so many great and memorable lines in this movie that it's impossible to list them all.  It is worth noting that Rick never actually says ""Play it again, Sam"" -- he says, ""Play it, Sam!"" in a drunken stupor after Ilsa returns to his ""gin joint."" Louie's (Rains) line, ""I'm shocked, shocked, that there is gambling in this establishment!"" is almost a cliché today for things that are not really that surprising.  I love the roulette scene, where Rick sets up a win to help a Bulgarian émigré, and his line ""Have you tried 22? I said, 22!"" is also one of my personal favorites.And of course, there's The Song: ""As Time Goes By"" -- the one Ilsa, and Rick, wanted to hear again and again -- is one of the most memorable in the history of film.""Casablanca"" is about politics; it's got political intrigue, tons of hard drinking, a love triangle to end all love triangles, a few choice fight scenes (where the nasties get theirs good), and about the choices we make in hard, crucial situations in life.  But ""Casablanca"" is, more than anything else, a love story, and without giving away too much, ultimately about one of life's greatest lessons: Letting Go. The flashback scene to Rick and Ilsa's years in Paris is one of the most memorable in all of film. The airport ending is classic and will give you chills -- be sure to bring a hankie!Note:  Keep an eye out for ""Casablanca"" on the Big Screen in the summer -- it's a favorite for the outdoor free film fests and a perfect movie for a date or with family & friends!

The best there ever will be.,"Look up the word ""classic"" in the dictionary and Casablanca it there.  It is as perfect as a movie gets.

"In a word, timeless...","Let me preface this critique by saying, I am a 25 year old and though an avid movie lover, far more attracted to the movies of the last say 30 years, than before. That school of thought may have to change.Casablanca tells the story of the Morroccan city during the second world war, specifically during the German occupation of France. While the whole world seemed to be crumbling, the city provided a sanctuary from the madness and doubled as a way-station for refugees leaving one war torn part of the globe trying to make it to America. By every account however, the law in this place was a matter of opinion and could be bent or even broken for the right price.Traveling papers are like gold. With them, your safety is all but assured, without them, you cannot even leave the city and would most likely die there.Humphrey Bogart plays the ever so suave and cynical, Rick Blain, the connected proprietor of Ricks Cafe, arguable the best club in town. The story develops into a love triangle that involves a French leader in the resistance movie as well as someone from Rick's clandestine past.Filled with romantic scenes, pride and nationalism, wit, and intrigue, I must say that I was more than surprised to see how this movie affected me.Truly deserving of its Oscars and one of the best films to ever grace the silver screen.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
What a mess!,"The movie starts in a very exciting manner. The ambience in Casablanca and Rick's place is very cheerful. Situation of Casablanca is complicated such that it seems to have been stuck in between a Nazi army and the army of Vichy France. Many intriguing events take place one after another in Rick's place as if the outlaws in the city has no other place to go.What is disturbing for me is that there are too many plot holes and twists. Also a woman with two lovers is depicted as an angel just because she is beautiful. Morever, Rick abandons all the fortune he made out of his place in one night and decides to murder a Nazi major just to help the love of his life escape from Casablance with another man. How romantic! I wonder how many people bursted into tears for that. Considering its high rating, not to mention the French national anthem in the ending, this must be the best movie of all times for many viewers but definitely not for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Mythical Classic Defined by History and Time,"It's quite a burden for a man to start writing a review for ""Casablanca"" (1942), the film loved and seen by everyone, and of which everything seems to be said a thousand times. The over-used statement ""we must fight for this film so that the future generations can enjoy it"" just doesn't work for ""Casablanca"" since no fighting is necessary. It doesn't need our help. Generations after generations have embraced the film and begun a beautiful friendship with it. This process has become a fundamental element in our culture which remains as time goes by.A memorable line after another, stylistic noir-aesthetics and a bunch of amazing performances make ""Casablanca"" a true cult-classic in the word's most actual meaning. Everything is just right. Even the most die-hard supporter of the auteur theory must humble before this film and admit that it is a great piece of work without a distinct author. It is a sleeper whose success and popularity can only be explained by the equal input of the director, the many writers, the actors and the audience which cherishes it so.One uniting element, a force which glues everything together can, however, be found, and that is time. ""Casablanca"" is so luminously a child of its own time that to neglect this aspect seems blasphemous. A big part of its timeless charm is its original fashion to deal with a historical moment, the relationship between individuals and even the mental events of a person at the same time and in the same equal eye. Thus ""Casablanca"" moves fluently from the general to the particular and back. Best known example is of course the beginning: the camera drills down into the globe, to Europe, to Casablanca, to Rick's Cafe Americain and finally to the privacy of Rick's mind. A conflict of reality and consciousness at the stage of the world, the café. As said innumerable times, the café is the microcosm of the world, of Europe at war.""Casablanca"" was something that could only happen at one brief moment in the history of mankind. It is a work that was born from many factors which are forever admired such as Ingrid Bergman's natural beauty, Humphrey Bogart's powerful presence, his unique way of saying ""here's looking at you, kid,"" and an inimitable mood of solidarity. All this among many other things is veritably moving. The magical atmosphere and the mythical birth of ""Casablanca"" seem to capture the essence of an era, of a history. While it was being made there was no knowing who was going to win the war or how it all was going to end, but at least the many creators of this film had actual faith in a better tomorrow.So what else can be said? Something coherent, something persuasive, something original? Nothing, I guess. All words seem to make ""Casablanca"" sound like a banal work of sentimentality which it only transcends. Watch it -- over and over again, and again and again. And once more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Has not aged well,"When seen on a large screen, several of the scenes become comic, especially those in which Bogart is lighting cigarettes. This makes the drama of the love stories rather silly.

Pioneer in its time,"On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942.Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly.Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Two letters of Transit = Complete Entertainment,"This film has to be the most talked about movie ever, and yet when you look at it, there are so many holes in the story, but who really cares, when the entertainment contained in 100 minutes is so great.

The aforementioned stars, along with Humphrey Bogart entered into the mood from the start, and brought us one of the best movies ever.  The supporting cast, particularly Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt were spot on, and added so much to it. Michael Curtiz did a wonderful job as director, while the black and white photography added so much to it.   I still shudder when I think how Jack Warner was considering Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan for the main roles.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A tale of the burnt out idealist and the redemption of his soul.,"Casablanca is an enduring epic about the indomitability of the human spirit. Beside the obvious charisma and passion of the leading actors, Bogart and Bergman, it is also a glorious tale about the human condition. It is a tale about idealism, and idealism gone stale. It is a tale of greed, fear, resignation, smugness, indifference, and re-birth. In short, this is a monumental film about the vortex of human emotions that make up life as we know it, day in and day out.Bogart and Bergman elude an electricity and a tension that permeates the entire drama. But these brilliant performances are enhanced by the wonderful supporting cast of real, down to earth, ""just plain folks"" character actors of the day. In their stellar performances we see Everyman: the idealists; the hopeful and the hopeless; the greedy, the needy, the brutal sadists, and the tender hearted. It is ourselves we see in the craggy faces which surround Rick and Ilsa. Unfortunately, we no longer see such faces in today's cinema. For it was their genuine ""ordinariness"" which shone so brilliantly from the screen, that grabbed us so tightly and swept us up into the turmoil of the story. It was the plainness of these supporting characters that framed the swirling epic raging round them, so unlike today's performers, who seemed to have stepped out from the pages of Elle and GQ with their polished good looks and vacuous performances.Casablanca is also an epic tale of the burnt out idealist in all of us who have pulled against the grain, but who, like Rick, have lost once too often. It is the tale of the twentieth-century. It is about a man who has spent all he had to spend, whose spirit which once burned with the fiery idealism of youth, is now but a flicker, only to be re-ignited once again by a lost love. It is an idealism rekindled by memories of joy and heartache, of a love lost and now regained--for a brief moment. For Rick is like all of us, far from perfect. In the deepest recesses of his heart, there is a war raging, one which rocks him to the very depths. The better angels of his long suppressed idealism struggle with his cynicism, his burning desire and his passion to be reunited once more with Ilsa, his first and only love. The good of the many takes precedence over the good of the one. It was that spirit that characterized the times, times long past and long forgotten. But times, nevertheless, whose idealism and generosity of spirit are sorely missing from our world today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The musical score is magical.Casablanca is simply a fine example of classical Hollywood cinema.  I watched it with a degree of skepticism, not expecting the movie to live up to its hype, but I was pleasantly surprised when if far exceeded my expectations.

A Movie as beautiful as the Sunset,"Whenever I talk about movies with someone, I would refer to most older movies that I grew up watching. But for me, Casablanca is a movie that I grew older watching. Since many have commented on its plot and greatness, I will skip the obligated summary of Casablanca and go immediately into my review.Casablanca is a movie that has matured with me; the more life experiences I had, the more enjoyable it was. As an example, the scene where Ilsa listens to Sam play As Time Goes By seemed extraneous before I experienced my first heartbreak. Now, when I hear her tear up with the song in the background, I feel like I could cry with her.The movie was more enjoyable the more I watched it as well. For the first time, I thought it was all right. But on the subsequent viewings, I saw the small nuances and expressions in Rick and Ilsa's actions as they tried to stay casual despite having a tragic past; I recognized that all the dialogue was necessary to accumulate in an unforgettable ending; and as I mentioned above, I empathized with the characters more and more.Watching Casablanca is like watching the sunset.

What can you say about an American Classic that hasn't already been said?,"What can you say about an American film classic like Casablanca that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain – a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and ""sticks his neck out for no one."" The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to ""Play It Again Sam, Play It Again."" When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It'll never be equalled,"Simply put: the best American film of all time and I ain't kidding. I've seen it no less than one dozen times and each viewing has a bit more than the last.Simply impossible to believe that during the making of it,the original writers, the Epstein Brothers, walked out in disgust and in came Howard Koch, the author of the famous 1938 Mercury Theater Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds"" based on H.G.'s masterpiece. That's right-the Epsteins said the film was going nowhere-they took a hike and Bogey and Koch sat down and together completed the script. Even Ingrid Bergman, after shooting was done, said she never wanted to be associated with such garbage again. Oh heck, I could write a million words of praise about ""Casablanca"" but never could I impart the true greatness of the film. It's got to be seen to be believed. The whole darn thing is engrossing, enchanting, mesmerizing,tough,tender,stirring,nationalistic,anti-Nazi and that's only the beginning. ""As Time Goes By"" is not only one of America's greatest love songs but just about the one song most closely associated with any film. Dooley Wilson looks like he's playing it but the truth is that the man didn't know how to play the piano. But who cares,Miss Ilsa? Want to know how good is that picture?

Casablanca review,"Casablanca is said to be the most popular film. It is maybe the most quoted film as well. One of the film's well-known lines, ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" was not in the original draft but was actually added in as the result of Bogart and Bergman's poker playing between takes. So with that said, that line became famous and maybe probably quoted to this very day! The movie is one that I would recommend to others. Its scope is simply amazing and it plays an incredible melodrama. Casablanca is all about sacrifices and about the good that human beings can do. Some say it is a sappy love story but it really isn't, even though some of the notions in the film are relatively romantic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Great Film,"This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love.

This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished.

"If you want to get something out of this film, you have to pay attention!","Although this film is very famous for the time period and is still enjoyed and relevant today, there are aspects of the film that the viewers will not understand or appreciate unless they are truly paying attention, watch the film multiple times or a briefed on what to expect beforehand. On my second time watching the film, I picked up many subtly elements that truly improved the overall feel of the film that I did not see when I watched the film many years ago. The dialog that the characters use is also very realistic to the time period so is not necessarily easily understood by viewers from this century. The characters also speak very fast and can be quite often hard to understand. Despite these few caveats, Casablanca ultimately does not disappoint.

Why is this so famous?,"To most people, Casablanca represents one of the most famous and greatest love stories of all time. To me, Casablanca represents a B-picture so many movie stars thought would flop they turned it down. I've never liked this movie, but I probably would have liked it better had it been the original choices: Ronald Reagan and Hedy Lamarr. At least I would have gotten some good eye candy out of it! Neither Ingrid Bergman nor Paul Henreid wanted to be in the movie, and it shows. Ingrid and Humphrey Bogart look like they can't stand each other, and when Ingrid requests for him to kiss her for the last time, you can practically see him gritting his teeth. Maybe he resented having to stand on a box and sit on pillows because audiences wouldn't invest themselves in a romance where the woman was taller than the man.I've never understood why this movie was elevated so much. It's a simple love triangle with nothing extraordinary about Ingrid and Humph's romance to make the audience root for them. He's depressing, angry, and wasting away at the bar; why should she leave her wealthy, classy boyfriend to wallow away in the gutter? I realize I'm rehashing Meg Ryan's argument in When Harry Met Sally, and that some man reading this review is chuckling to himself thinking I obviously don't understand. However, if the audience was supposed to understand Ingrid's conflict, the studio should have either cast an irresistibly sexy actor or director Michael Curtiz should have given his actors lessons in chemistry. Curtiz had worked with Errol Flynn on a number of occasions; why wasn't he used instead? Then I'd understand!If you've never seen this oldie, it is worth watching at least once. In all honesty, I fell asleep during my first viewing. I tried to stay awake the next time, though, for the supporting cast. S. Z. Sakall, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, John Qualen, and of course Claude Rains. Claude is the only one who looks like he's having fun during the movie, probably because he gets to say the famous, ""Round up the usual suspects."" Yes, Humph gets to say, ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" and ""Of all the gin joints..."" ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon..."" and ""We'll always have Paris,"" but he doesn't seem to enjoy himself. Poor Ingrid doesn't really get anything memorable, except her hat and trench coat.If after you've seen it, you don't know what all the fuss is about, you can come over to my house and I'll show you some really romantic classics. Movies like Enchantment, Enchanted Cottage, Carrie, and Hold Your Man never get put on the top of any romantic list, although they deserve to. Perhaps this movie is so enduring because other movies keep paying homage to it. If Play It Again, Sam, A Little Romance, and When Harry Met Sally would have picked a different classic to honor, maybe everyone would have forgotten about Casablanca by now.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Beyond good,"While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention. By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly. Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast. Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments. It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films. It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly. (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else. Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything.

I also find it interesting that this was a play before, and many did not think it as effective as a play, but it worked so well as a movie.  The backdrop and the skills of film makers can add a lot (and the acting).  But although Ingrid Bergman fit in well here, I thought that the acting jobs by Bogart and others, purely in terms of being convincing, were better.  Excellent scenery, elegant French culture, so well scripted, and idealistic.  Yet altho Rick changed at the end, his person throughout the bulk of the movie allows a good outlet for people feeling life's frustrations.  But even for those, it is rousing to have the good ending, isn't it?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
So that's why everyone loves this movie!,"Until recently I've never seen ""Casablanca""(1942). The only thing I could tell you about it was that Humphrey Bogart was in it and there was a scene on a foggy airfield somewhere. Other than that I just thought it was some good classic film that simply got over hyped like so many others. Within 30 minutes of the movie I could clearly see I was mistaken. The story, acting, and sets were all fantastic but what really won me over was the amazing cinematography work by Arthur Edeson. Especially the scenes shot in ""Rick's Café Américain"". The use of lighting and shadows was fantastic and gave this film a sort of film noir precursor feel. This film knows exactly when to let information go at exactly the right time and when to add a little comic relief when things start to get tense; whither it be the delight wit and charm of Bogart or the antics of Szőke Szakáll. ""Casablanca""(1942) will keep you guessing with whats going to happen with the characters facing many moral dilemmas and you not knowing if their going to take the high or low road. This was one amazing film that lived up to its hype and for that I give it a 10-10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Everything that Hollywood should be,"I can't see what to write here, since so many people will be moved by this film and write something about their experience in seeing it, often time after time, ""As Time Goes By"". This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, with an array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning of World War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that will always be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that it is. Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie. It all has to do with time, place, and character. It's so easy to get embroiled in one or two of the character's performances that you'll miss half of the film. It's an amazing film to watch multiple times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
perfect,"Casablanca is the closest thing to a perfect movie that has ever been made. It's the perfect length to tell its story but not drag, and it has suspense, humor, drama, romance, music, and everything else you would want in a movie.

Casablanca,"Casablanca review: It was a clever picture released in 1942. It explored themes such as slavery, motives, the mind, friendship and the Second World War. The cinematography had it great expose lighting. The portraits of characters were strongly detailed. I loved staring at the costume and production designing. The costumes were appropriate for each character on set. It looked formal. I think the picture deserves a remake like the 1962 film Cape Fear. I felt like Humphrey Bogart had the same role like he does in other noir movies. Michael Curtiz captured the setting of Casablanca beautifully such as the palm trees, architecture and the Arab clothing. I enjoyed the other setting in the title, that was Paris. The French culture was shot in deep detail. You could acknowledge how the French citizens lived and how they suffered during the Second World War. Frequently the story-line is carried out through dialogue. I think you can treasure this movie with a passion. I give it an 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The best movie ever made,"For me, the 40s and the 70s are are my favorite movie periods. I should include the 30s also. It is the period of the greatest scripts, they are great even in our days, and also the period of the coolest actors ever to appear on screen. Humphrey Bogart is one of them, and Casablanca is the film that shined most in the 40s. Casablanca has the best script including legendary lines i think 6 of them are included in AFI top 100 lines. It' not just a love story, it's that love story that seems impossible, due to the time when the characters met, and the circumstances in witch they feel in love. Probably, the best scene in the movie is the one with ""la Marseillaise"". It has such deep signification, it's the French national anthem played in a French region in Africa under German occupation during WW II, played while the Germans sang a patriotic song. The scene is presented in great detail, from the beginning, where the band look to Bogart for his approval, to Victor Laszlo' hand gestures and Ilsa's heavy breathing suggesting that she is proud of Laszlo's intention, to the end when a a woman in the crowd with a visible tear shouts ""Vive La France"". The song starts in a shy matter for the French crowd, but it increases immediately and the German are forced to stop singing because they can not be heard anymore. It has the meaning of freedom, of liberty. When you watch this scene you feel good, you think of what the public though when it was first released; back then the war was still on; maybe they though that the war will be over that the good will eventually conquer evil. To conclude, watch this movie, you will love it, you will love the French anthem scene even if you are not French. You will not find a better script or better actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca - I've seen better,"Casablanca was released in 1942 and was directed by Michael Curtiz. Casablanca is known for being one of the best films of all time, but personally I found it very bland. The plot was good in theory, but the emotional connection and feeling was not there. I could not connect to the characters or their story. Rick, the main character was the most interesting out of the characters and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Captain Louis Renault more than any other part of the movie. Their relationship was the most dynamic and interesting part of the film. The cinematography of the film was decent enough. The cinematographer, Arthur Edeson, use of light and dark added to the films fluctuating mood and helped to portray it in an easy manner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Didn't care for it,"This movie is overrated in my opinion and I'm also not one of those teenagers who has a short attention span. A movie does not have to be loaded with sex or violence for me to enjoy it. Now to the movie. I guess I'm missing something here, I mean the first half of this movie took place in Rick's Bar with people talking and constantly asking for drinks. In fact I've never seen a movie with so many drinks ordered in my life, not that thats bad. After that, I was extremely bored. Surprisingly, I did enjoy Gone With the Wind.My Rating 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
THE Standard,"I can honestly say I know what makes a good movie because I have a standard by which to compare it:  CASABLANCA.  Adapted from a play entitled ""Everyone Comes to Rick's"", CASABLANCA tells the story of American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart in the role that made his legend), a cynical saloon owner. His motto:  ""I stick my neck out for nobody.  I'M the only cause worth fighting for.""  We learn that, in the past, Rick was once an idealistic man who would fight the good fight for just causes.  As his ""friend"" Louie (Claude Rains) reminds him as he ticks off the underdog causes that Rick has championed ""The winning side would have paid MUCH more.""  Just when we are convinced that Rick truly is an insular hard-case . . . into his life returns Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who killed the idealism in him.  She is on the arm of freedom fighter Victor Laslo (Paul Heinreid). The sight of Ilsa sparks a flashback that shows Rick, Ilsa and Rick's piano-playing friend Sam (Dooley Wilson) in Paris before the arrival of the Nazis.  As Rick and Sam wait for Ilsa, she sends him a note at the train station saying that she can never see him again.  That is, until their paths cross again in Casablanca.  To add to the stress, the Nazis, led by the pinch-faced Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), decide to march into Casablanca as well.  Their intent:  To capture Laslo and prevent him from stirring up strength against the Nazis on the other side of the world. CASABLANCA benefits greatly from a dynamite script, great directing and, for once, the perfect union of casting and character.  By now, most people know how the film ends.  This is even more impressive since the ending to the film was being written even as the cameras began rolling to shoot it.  Two endings had been written, but when the producers saw the ending that was shot (the one used in the film), they saw no need to shoot the other ending.  Needless to say, CASABLANCA is a part of my film library. If it's not in your's, you're only depriving yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
We'll always have Casablanca,"""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""This is another personal favorite of mine and perhaps one of the most quotable classic films of all time. Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca takes place during the early days of World War II in French Morocco where many European refugees were searching for a way to escape to the Americas and evade Nazi control. In Casablanca we are quickly introduced to the owner of a nightclub, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick is a bitter and cynical man who has decided to look out for himself and offer his clients a good time at his club. But when a man shows up and gives Rick a couple of transit letters that will allow the holder of these papers to travel freely through Europe in order to escape to the United States from Lisbon, they know they can make a lot of money by finding the right buyer. A married couple show up at Rick's bar to buy the letters and this is where we discover why Rick is so bitter. Victor's (Paul Henreid) wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), had met Rick in Paris a while back when she thought her husband, a resistance leader, had been killed during the War. The two had an affair, but when Ilsa discovered that Victor was alive and that he had escaped the Nazi concentration camp where he was held she leaves Rick without giving him any explanation. Rick has never been able to get over the betrayal and seeing her at his joint with her husband makes him even more bitter. And so the adventure begins as Rick must decide if he wants to help Victor and Ilsa escape from the Nazis or if he should simply look the other way. Claude Rains has a supporting role as a corrupt French official while Conrad Veldt plays a Nazi Major.Today we all praise the screenwriters for this film, but there was much skepticism during filming. Neither Bergman nor Bogart thought it was any good and some claim that they didn't want to work together. I don't think Michael Curtiz ever imagined this film would become such a beloved classic either, but somehow the film clicked in all cylinders and the story has stuck with audiences ever since. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is the main reason why the romance works so well and the scenes they ask Sam to play their song on his piano is memorable. It's the best romantic film of all time in my opinion because it has it all: romance, betrayal, and sacrificial love. There are so many beloved quotes in this film and it only gets better over time. The ending is also one of the best in any movie and one of the reasons why so many consider this such a revered classic, but I can point out several other emotional moments such as the scene where Sam is ordered to play a German patriotic song for the Nazi soldiers in the bar, only to have Victor respond by asking the band leader to play La Marseillaise and drown out the song from the Germans. Even the revelation scene where we get flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa's affair and discover how she never meets up with him at the train station and instead he's handed a farewell note from her, is quite emotionally engaging. The film offers plenty of thrilling scenes as well for those that aren't interested in the romance so there is no excuse for anyone not to see this classic. In case you forget how brilliant the screenplay is let me just remind you of some of the best quotes in this movie.""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" ""If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" ""We'll always have Paris."" ""Here's looking at you kid."" ""Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""" ""I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" ""Alright, I'll make it easier for you- Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor."" ""Round up the usual suspects."" ""Mostly I remember the last one. The wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out.""

Excellent,"After my first time seeing Casablanca, I can easily say it is one of my favorite films. Casablanca is so captivating, and while watching it, it is hard to not feel like you are a part of the romantic drama that you are watching. There are so many emotions packed into this film, and there is not one scene in the film that you feel like could be cut out. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is undeniable. The two act flawlessly together which really adds to how great it is. I'm still amazed at how well this was made for the lack of technology that was available at this time. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Ilsa tries to get the help from Ricky to help her and her husband, Victor, to help flee the country from the Germans that are on his tail from a crime that he committed.

Hollywood does owe a lot from this film and it is Boigie at his finest ahead of its time. if you are a movie lover or an inspiring director/writer this is a great way to make a film. this movie in my opoion was THE classic and started the meaning of the word. if you are into action movies of now a days then I don't recommend this but if you into seeing movies at there finest this is a must see.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
As Time Goes By......,"Well I was not a fan of that movie Casablanca........said no one (with good taste) ever. I would be lying if I said I didn't have high expectations going into this film. Just about everyone one I know who appreciates a good movie, that has seen Casablanca, has insisted I see Casablanca. I finally did and the love for this film is not wrongful, I too love this movie upon first viewing. There isn't enough I could say about this movie and the internet has done its best to say just about everything. Beautiful story, beautiful acting, beautiful cinematography, and a beautiful song. Humphrey Bogarts performance as Rick Blaine instantly made him one of my favorite characters across all cinema. Rick is the definition of ""Cool"" in Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman simply delivers in the role of Ilsa Lund. Passionate and elegant, she crafted a great character. I enjoyed the part of Captain Louis, played by Claude Rains, a sophisticated yet subtly amusing character. Rains is fantastic, as time goes by I watch myself becoming a bigger and bigger fan of his. Speaking of ""As Time Goes By"", this song captures the feel and emotion of Casablanca, not only the loss of a true love the loss of security. Casablanca allows the audience to feel the passion, heartbreak, paranoia, and pressure of war and its consequences. If you are a history buff you will appreciate the historical ramifications of Casablanca and the glimpse of the indirect impacts of WWII outside of Europe. This film really does live up to its established standards, I wouldn't call it the best film ever made, or my favorite, its just one of the good ones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Perhaps none more so than the uplifting finale, between Bogart and Berman in which personal sacrifices are made for an ever greater cause than the their love.

Casablanca Review,"This film had the classic love story and is probably on the list of top 5 films ever created. Personally this film did not really do much for me. The love story seemed kind of cheesy; although, I did really enjoy the main character and who he represented throughout the film. Humphrey Bogart, Richard, represented the Americans throughout the war, which represented isolationism. Richard shows isolation in the film by never drinking with anyone. My favorite line throughout the movie was ""I'll stick my neck out for nobody"" and then the General replied with ""Ah, a wise foreign policy."" I think that was totally great. Another great aspect of the movie was the lighting. I think it was great when the light reflected off the sides of their faces and off the tops and brims of their hats. Overall the movie wasn't that bad, but I was expecting something way more complex than it actually was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A cliche is appropriate - This is a timeless masterpiece,"Anybody that likes movies must know this story. What really makes this film stand out from so many others is the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. The ending is classic since Ilsa and Rick are separated even though Ilsa wants to be with Rick rather than war hero Victor. Nowadays, the films ending would probably change and even if it didn't a sequel a couple of years later would see them together. The great thing about Casablanca is that we never know what became of these three.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Incredible luck or Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic,"Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the play ""Everybody Comes to Rick"" by playwrights Murray Barnett and Joan Alison. Happy May Day, comrades! It's time to go outside and clean up some of your own home. Is not it? So I think so. And since May has come, this month I traditionally watch military films, and then I decided to get to this cult classic, which occupies the highest lines in the lists of the best paintings, and is not inferior in popularity to the most modern megablockbusters. And although I have already pricked myself several times because of this, nevertheless I cast aside my doubts and looked at this picture - and I was not disappointed, in large part. And here's my brief opinion - Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic. Despite the fact that I liked the picture, I will consider both its advantages and disadvantages, which I could not do without. At this point, let me finish with the introduction and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the action of the picture takes place in Casablanca - the port city of French Morocco at the end of 1941, which is ruled by the dictatorial regime of Vichy (after the defeat of France in 1940). Casablanca serves as a transit city between refugees from Europe and the New World, where all these unfortunates are trying to get, using money and power. Of course, there are also cunning businessmen in the city who make fortunes out of these people. Corrupt police. And here the cafe ""At Rick's"" is comfortably located, which is popular with all this public, since its owner does not meddle in politics, and does not attract unnecessary attention to himself, on a short leg with the prefect of police. But the war pushes both opposing sides together in his institution, and then forgotten love lights up with renewed vigor. How should Riku proceed now? Which side to choose? What will his heart decide? What will the ending be like? There is drama here, but not much, since the script focuses on the romantic line of the characters, and everything else is just a background for the development of events. The script is simple, but attractive in its simplicity. And although the ending is obvious almost from the very beginning, you are still interested in watching the picture. There were no shoals and logical holes. I am already silent about dialogues and cult phrases. Therefore, to while away the evening is definitely suitable.2. The romantic line is definitely good. Yes, a reflection on the lost love, yes a love triangle, yes cliches, yes predictability - but the dialogues, ""spark"", and the great acting performance of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman did not let you get bored when watching. Moreover, lovers here are completely different people with their own view of things, who have excellent memories of the past, which even now look good.3. Atmosphere - the feeling of a blazing Second World War, which in 1942 was still in full swing, is present from the first to the last frame. It is especially bright in Casablanca, where many people and forces clashed, eager to destroy each other. This is especially evident in the example of the police prefect - a corrupt official, a French patriot, who is forced to submit to a German officer who has arrived from Europe, since the prefect - in the service of the Vichy government - is essentially a collaborationist. And not only him, because there are many minor characters, by the way about them.4. Vivid secondary characters - from the Russian bartender (thanks to Leonid Kinski for such a charismatic hero) and ending with dishonest merchants. Frenchmen, policemen, ""slippery"" types, German officers, Italians. All of them are of interest, and the picture perfectly shows their real relationship, starting with the Germans, who consider Italians weaklings and cowards, and ending with the French, although they lost the war, but did not accept this fact, and therefore are ready to go after General de Gaulle ... Well, and cynics who simply cash in on human grief, without a hint of feelings.5. Music - of which I can only mention the songs performed by Sam, played by the negro Dooley Wilson - who in his life was an actor and singer, and very popular. It is he who is remembered most of all. What about the rest of the music? It will do.Well, thank you very much for the stage of the performance of La Marseillaise! Sang along in unison!So the cons:
1. Globe at the beginning of the picture - more precisely, the western borders of the Soviet Union and Poland. Maybe this is a cant of the picture, or maybe the creators just took this globe from another picture. Unknown. We will consider this an inaccuracy.2. Cult status - here the picture was just lucky, because it came out just during Operation Torch - the landing of the allied forces in North Africa, including in Casablanca (which is partly why it was renamed shortly before the film's release). And after that they were often shown on American TV. Although, judging impartially and objectively - ""Casablanca"" is a good, but a passing picture, which is perfect for a romantic evening, but to call it ""the best picture"" or ""the greatest picture of all times and peoples"" would be very dishonest and even selfish. Just ""Casablanca"" was lucky to come out at the right time and in the right place, that's all!A little about the main characters:
1. Rick Blaine performed by Humphrey Bogart is a cynical restaurant owner who has to sort out his feelings, decide on a side in a raging war, and decide in love, where can we go without it. Despite the protruding cynicism, both in words and in deeds, at heart he is a romantic, capable of performing a strong and noble deed for the sake of justice. I saw Humphrey before only in the melodrama ""Sabrina"" with Audrey Hepburn, where he perfectly played a similar character, and here he obviously learned to be such a convincing romantic on the screen. Bravo Humphrey!2. Ilsa Lund performed by Ingrid Bergman - Rick's beloved and the wife of Victor Laszlo, one of the leaders of the Resistance movement, who wants to take advantage of meeting Rick in order to leave Casablanca as soon as possible. Shown as a romantic and purposeful girl who rushes between two men. I liked Ingrid here. Clever girl! You believe her heroine.3. Victor Laszlo performed by Paul Henrade is an ardent anti-fascist who arrived in Casablanca in order to find a way to get to the New World, because the Nazis are looking for him for his active work, but there is no reason for arrest, because Casablanca is the territory of France, where there are subtleties. An ardent fighter, piously believing in victory, whom Rick partly admires. Paul perfectly managed to convey the inner world and ideals of his hero, thanks in part to which Germany was eventually defeated four years later.You know, despite the fact that seventy-nine years have passed since the release of the picture, it is still good, and deserves your attention (just do not over praise it), and worth watching.As a result, we have a good melodrama, with a simple and interesting script, bright memorable characters, great atmosphere, pleasant romance and great acting, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Shadow Puppet,"Noir: the word brings movies like this to mind, but where's the depth behind the fuss?  IMDB reviewers have this in the Top 10.  I suspect this has to do with a weepy end.  So much for thinking.If I recall correctly, they tried colorizing this in the 80s and failed entirely because 'Casablanca' exists totally in Black and White.  Others that cannot be duplicated in color include 'Schindler's List', 'THEM!', 'Third Man', and 'King Kong'.  When placed in color, the tone is lost. Speaking as a photographer, I can easily say ""I love B&W"".The lighting here is dynamic, even when Bogie is his bored with himself. Morgan Freeman has borrowed a lot from Bogie.  It's those shadows that make the film more than anything else.  There is competent editing here, but that doesn't help the simple script.Like 'Rambo', there is 'Casablanca' the movie and 'Casablanca' the phenomenon.

A film to treasure.,"An absolute classic of a film, the restoration work done has an amazing end product. Full of memorable lines and iconic images.The film manages to be immensely entertaining and captivating. It's a film of great strengths, you have patriotism as a theme, Rick so Masculine, Ingrid so feminine it's wonderfully cast. The story takes place in Morocco during WWII, the place were introduced to is a complex one, full of hustlers, spies, secrete police, tricksters, refugees and rumours swirling around. There's also a swell of different nationalities, Arabs, French, Americans, Germans, Czechs and Bulgarians. Rick is brilliant character, tough, sardonic, cynical, witty yet it's also suggested to us this might just be his body armour and underneath is a 'rank sentimentalist.' His life changes when an old flame he very much loved back in Paris walks into his bar in one of the most memorable scenes in cinema. As mentioned the film is so quotable, there's too many good lines to even list. The music is also superb in this film and the scene of the French National Anthem being sung might just be the best one in the film.I saw this film for the first time in 4K yesterday and it's just stunning. The level of clarity, depth and detail now in the picture is outstanding, it's like a new film made yesterday almost. It also gives you such a deep appreciation for the cinematography in the film, the use of smoke and shadow and light and contrast, the way light and shadow fall across a characters face, the gleam of their eyes, it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see I think. There's a reason this film is a classic, it's also superbly paced, I don't think there's one wasted scene in the movie, everything works, it's such a well oiled machine in terms of story construction.

But there is no getting around the fact that the role of Sam, the jazz pianist, is patronizingly written and the character is an unfortunate example of the Uncle Tom type of ""good black"" that so often crept into movies of that era.The character of the pianist/singer in Rick's Cafe Americain was initially conceived of as a part for a female jazz artist like Hazel Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, or Lena Horne. Perhaps the subliminal sexuality of having a young African American woman so close to Rick (Bogart) made the Warner Bros. execs nervous. MGM, where Lena Horne was under contract, never quite knew how to deal with her beauty or sexuality. She was seldom part of a storyline but rather often featured as a performer in a nightclub sequence that could be snipped out in prints of the film being exhibited in the Deep South, thus not offending racists but not messing with the continuity of the plot. The role of the pianist was switched to a male character possibly to sidestep all the issues of miscegenation between the singer and ""Mr. Rick."" Racial mixing was one of the last taboos to go during the 30 year reign and enforcement of the Production Code.Though the Bogart character is respectful of Sam and looks out for his best interests, making sure Sam is paid the same once he leaves Morocco, their relationship is not truly one of equals. Sam always refers to him as ""Mr. Rick"" and Bergman as ""Miss Ilsa."" Sam takes care of Rick and worries over his happiness and well-being. We know nothing of Sam's life or needs. All we know for sure is that Sam will do anything he can to keep these white folks happy.When Bergman first spots Sam in the nightclub she inquires, ""Who is that boy playing the piano?"" BOY? Born in 1886, Dooley Wilson was 56 years old. Use of the term ""boy"" to refer to the musician is an unfortunate indication of the prevailing practice of denigrating black men's sexuality and maturity. One was a ""boy"" until one was 70.Yet Warner Bros., more-so perhaps than the other big studios, was more liberated in terms of race and its depiction. The mere presence of Sam as a character indicated progress to many. But the role is definitely narrow and restrained, within the typical submissive image often delineated for blacks. At one point, and mercifully it's mostly cut, early in the film Sam begins to sing an old song called ""Shine."" (Shine was a racist term for an African American, like Coon or Jigaboo.) The number was a very racist tune of the early 20th Century---""Just because my hair is curly/ Just because my teeth are pearly..."" We are not subjected to the full song which is a catalog of stereotypic images---and then the song ends with the line ""That's why they call me Shine."" The full number is sung by dancer John Bubbles in MGM's ""Cabin in the Sky"" filmed that same year.Dooley Wilson, by the way, was paid $350 per week to appear in ""Casablanca."" Sidney Greenstreet was paid $3,750 per week.Dooley Wilson was one of the best jazz drummers of the era. It's ironic that he will always be remembered ""playing piano"" (and not a very good faking, at that) in ""Casablanca."" He did also sing well, and his performance is part of the stuff dreams were made of at Warner Bros.---preserved for posterity in this wonderful though clearly not perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Hollywood at its absolute best,"I just watched Casablanca last night, and it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. Everything about it is great. For one, it is one of the most gripping love stories ever to hit the screens, and its romantic drama has rarely been matched since it was made. Same goes for the acting, which is some of the finest in film history. All of this and more will put together one of the greatest movies you will ever see. Period.Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an ex-freedom fighter who now runs a nightclub in Casablanca, a place filled entirely with French refugees seeking unauthorized transit passes so they can escape to America. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is at the top of the Nazi most wanted list, comes to Casablanca with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), a former lover of Blaine who departed him when the Nazis overtook Paris. She wants her husband to escape, but her love for Rick re-ignites, and she wants to stay in Casablanca. However, things become more dangerous for the Laszlos, and despite their revived love for each other, Rick convinces Ilsa that she must leave with her husband. He then sees her off on a plane on a fog-enshrouded runway in one of the greatest movie conclusions of all time.There are so many moments, many of which will forever be unforgotten, in Casablanca that stand out even when compared to greater or bigger films. Every scene is gripping, like when Rick has a flashback to his romantic times with Ilsa in Paris while piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) plays ""As Time Goes By"", or when Rick walks out onto the runway and tells Capt. Renault (Claude Rains), ""Louis, I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship"". But these invincible moments obviously don't need retelling, for almost everyone knows of them. As for the timeless cast, Humphrey Bogart is simply stunning as the leading man. The class, drama, and brilliance in his performance are impossible to match, although there have been countless attempts to try to surpass it. Ingrid Bergman is simply gorgeous, and contributes a performance that's worth cheering for. In fact, all of the performances in this movie will have you cheering.This is the kind of film that many other Hollywood movies have followed the footsteps of, yet probably very few have rivaled or suprassed. In a nutshell, Casablanca is a sweeping classic that will leave you breathless. From Humphrey Bogart's classy acting to the great ending, there is not a flaw to speak of. In the battle of the ultimate classics, it's not as good as Citizen Kane (despite a higher star rating, but star ratings don't speak all of the volumes in my book). But it's still a fantastic movie. Watch it and enjoy it.`Here's looking at you kid!'***** out of *****",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You Must Remember This,"It doesn't get much better than this drama about war time intrigue and romance. Bogart gives the best performance of his storied career in the quintessential role of the tough, cynical loner with a soft heart. Bergman is simply luminous. Henried does well in a thankless role. Rains nearly steals the film as a crooked but lovable police inspector. The script has more memorable lines than any other, the cinematography is crisp, and nobody sings ""As Time Goes By"" like Wilson. Curtiz, an underrated director, deserves much of the credit for the iconic images of this unforgettable classic. Thankfully, to paraphrase a line from the film, we'll always have ""Casablanca.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Blanca,"This was the first time I have ever watched Casablanca, I thought it was alright. Yes, I know it's a classic, but I was really liked the plot a lot and the story line. I liked how it was places during World War 2. I thought that the directing and camera work was great. The picture was clear and the camera movement was steady. Also the acting was amazing, I especially enjoyed the most of the characters, I did like Humphrey which I guess a lot of people didn't. I thought the movie did go a little slow and could have been edited a little bit better in some places.

Bergman. Bogart. As Time Goes By. Word: Priceless,"Casablanca is want so many claim to be the best of all time. Whenever I listen to this movie and I hear ""As Time Goes By"", I start to blubber. The script, direction, and camera work is absolutely amazing. Bergman and Bogart were amazing also and looked like they were meant for their parts. I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang ""As Time Goes By""). Another great part of the movie was in Rick's bar club where Ilsa and Rick met again in Casablanca. But as far as the songs, plot and characters go, I thought the utmost part of the movie that made me think ""wow"" was without a doubt the ending. The ending was so action-packed and heart-pounding it almost took my breath away.Overall, Casablanca is a timeless classic that will never go by our minds.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Decades have gone by, but this one remains a classic!","I first became aware of this film's existence back when I was around nine years old, but never actually saw it. At the time, I highly doubt that was a great loss for me, as if I did see ""Casablanca"" when I was that young, there probably wouldn't have been many words for me to use to describe what I thought of it, other than ""boring."" However, I finally watched it for the first time about eleven years later, earlier this year, and was very impressed, even though I wouldn't have given it a 10/10 at the time. Since then, for me, it has improved with more viewings!The film is set during World War II in Casablanca, Morocco, where many European refugees, fleeing from the Nazis, had to come in order to have any hope of getting to Lisbon, then to America. Rick Blaine is an American in exile who runs a nightclub in the Moroccan city. He is very cynical and ""sticks his neck out for nobody."" After it is announced that two German couriers have been murdered, Ugarte, the murderer, comes to Rick's club and asks him to hold on to two letters of transit for a while. Shortly afterwards, Ugarte is arrested, so Rick is stuck with these letters. The nightclub owner is then informed that Victor Laszlo, the European Resistance leader, is coming to Casablanca, and Major Strasser of the Gestapo tells him to make sure Victor doesn't escape from the city. Victor comes to Casablanca with Ilsa Lund, Rick's former love who left him in Paris! At first, Rick is not pleased to see Ilsa again. Ilsa and Victor have come for the two letters, but convincing Rick to give them to the couple won't be easy!It has been 65 years since ""Casablanca"" was first shown to the public, and since then, many people from generation after generation have seen it and have been blown away! With its poignancy, suspense, strong dialogue, romance, etc., this 1942 motion picture is a work of genius, and there's nothing surprising about its wide appeal! So, if you want to see a stunning love story, set and made during WWII, and movies don't require a whole ton of action to impress you, I would say ""Casablanca"" is a must-see! If you don't love it right away, maybe you never will, or maybe it will grow on you with a second or third viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Not my favorite but definitely the most memorable film of all time...,"Some of this review was edited due to this site's word limit.Regarding ""Casablanca,"" Roger Ebert wrote in his Great Movies essay, ""If we can identify strongly with characters in some movies, then it is no mystery that 'Casablanca' is one of the most popular films of all time."" Add ""and one of the most memorable"" to that statement. Almost any list you happen to come across of great movies will contain ""Casablanca,"" as it has almost nestled itself firmly into our world's foundation. It is what one would call a memorable film. It may not be memorable for the audiences of today who find it boring, long, weary and tiresome, but it will always be remembered. That isn't something you can say for most movies. In one hundred years, do you think ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will really - really - be remembered?""Casablanca"" is a love story, just as so many other films released to this day, but upon a viewing two nights ago, I asked myself what sets it apart from the rest. Just what has made it what it is today? Is it the direction by Michael Cortiz, the chemistry between the actors, or the actors themselves? Is it the sly side of dark comedy, or just the nostalgia of the film that drives so many viewers? Or perhaps it is the cliffhanger finale (those filming the movie didn't even know what would happen at the end of the film due to constantly changing scripts and the 1940s Production Code permitting a married woman from leaving her husband for another man). Even if it isn't, the ending is superb, depressing and uplifting, one of the strangest, saddest, and happiest endings I have ever seen, in which Bogart mutters the famous last lines, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a chain smoker and heavy drinker living in Casablanca, French Morocco, during WWII. During WWII, European immigrants fled from their homeland down to Africa, in hopes of sailing off the coast to Portugal, and then to America, land of freedom. Because of this, Casablanca is inhabited by petty thieves, vicious murderers, and ruthless citizens. Every day a plane leaves from the local airport, carrying the precious few with Visa Passes to freedom. Those applying for a Visa Pass on the black market might come in contact with the crook Ugarte (Peter Torre).One night the thief Ugarte visits Rick's bar in Casablanca and asks him to hide two Visa Passes he has acquired by unrespectable means. Rick reluctantly agrees, only to watch Ugarte be taken away by French officials the same night, in his very bar. ""Rick, you have to help me!"" he screams as he is dragged away. Rick takes a puff on his cigarette and remains solid. A bystander says, ""Gee, Rick, I hope when they come to take me away you help me out a little bit more than that!"" Rick remains a statue and says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""We can sense Rick was a good guy at one time, but as Marilyn Monroe once said, he probably ""got the fuzzy end of the lollipop."" He is tired of fighting for the good cause. So he maintains his bar and tries not to care about anyone. His piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) knows the real Sam, and tries to evoke it, but Sam just sits in silence and drinks and smokes and lets himself stay drenched in misty smoke.That all remains until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks through his doors. It turns out that Ilsa left Sam and Rick waiting at a train station in the rain some time ago in Paris, France, during the German occupation. Rick never saw her since. That night she walks into his bar, he sits at a table in his joint, and in a mopy tone says, ""Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine."" This is a very effective line.Do delve into the plot any further is pointless. Not only will it spoil interesting tidbits, but it is just plain pointless to explain anymore. But I will say that every frame is handled with care and the extreme close-ups in this film are amazingly effective. Sergio Leone was known for his extreme close-ups, but those in ""Casablanca"" seem to capture an innocence of the characters that I have rarely seen equaled in other films.Bogart is at the top of his game in this film, only equaled in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Ingrid Bergman is superb, as well, but the supporting cast is equally impressive. Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Peter Henreid and Dooley Wilson all steal the show - well, maybe not Henreid, but that's because he's not really supposed to. This is the perfect example of a well-rounded cast. Too often nowadays attention is paid to the lead actors and not the supporters - this has both great leads and great supporters.People often ask me what my favorite film is. And to be frankly honest, it certainly isn't ""Casablanca."" To me, lists of favorites in ranking order are pointless and silly - who am I to declare my favorite film, when I have not even seen some of the greatest unknown films out there? If someone asks me to tell them my favorite film I have seen, I usually say I don't have one. I still think lists of favorite-ever films are silly. I have various favorites in various genres, but not an ""all-time-favorite.""Despite this, ""Casablanca"" is one of those films that has permeated our culture. It will never go away. I'm not sure if it's one of my top ten favorites, but if there is a difference between a favorite film and a most memorable film, ""Casablanca"" sure does disguise it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Classic Americana,"Casablanca was a fantastic romance film but I feel as if people put it on a pedestal it doesn't deserve. Sure, the acting is terrific, the story relates to many people, and Michael Curtiz did a legendary job directing but what exactly made this movie the timeless classic it has become? I did enjoy the lighting in many scenes because it makes the viewer focus more on the charters facial expressions and body language, especially the scene in which Rick is alone drinking at the bar and Sam comes down to check on him it was also clever how the cigarette smoke blurs the screen and goes into Rick's flash back. The composition of the film is really what I enjoyed, everything is crafted so beautifully. The plot is great but just not for me I guess and if it wasn't for each scene being so artistically graceful I would have definitely lost concentration on the story. Definitely a master piece of 1942 that will never be forgotten but I would not agree with most that Casablanca is ""the greatest film of all time"". Give it a watch though if for some reason you were living under rock like me, guaranteed any viewer will find something they enjoy about the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the best American films ever made,"Casablanca is certainly one of the best and admired American films ever made. A subtle yet enthralling adventure set against the backdrop of World War II in Morrocco, it simultaneously plays as a romance film, an exotic intrigue film, and a wartime drama. However, the sum of it's parts produce a film that eludes straightforward classification.Directed by the talented Hungarian director Michael Curtiz and shot almost entirely on studio sets, the film moves quickly through a surprisingly tightly constructed plot, in spite of the fact that the script was written each day as it was filmed and no one-not even the director-knew the ending. Curtiz debated up until the last day of filming who would use the two exit visas in order to escape. Apparently three weeks after the principal shooting ended, the producer Hal Wallis contributed the famous final line, and the last shot was taken on a fog-shrouded runway.Casablanca is such a flawless film and a testament to the fundamentals of film-making, cinematic narrative, acting, directing, and editing, it is inconceivable that it could ever be remade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Not bad.,"I have to say ""Casablanca"" is a bit overrated. While displaying technical genius on many levels, the film has not aged too well. Maybe it blends in with other films of the era. It was entertaining, but I'd say pales in comparison to other classics from the golden age like ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" and ""The Maltese Falcon."" Unlike those two, ""Casablanca"" fails to deliver any deep message. There is no moral and there is nothing terribly memorable about the film. Well actually, there is Bogart...Without him, I think ""Casablanca"" would have been pretty dull and forgettable. It just didn't grab the way I hoped it would.This all being said, the story is fun, the humor is ripe, and the acting is superb. Technically speaking, a nine. Entertainment-wise, I'd say a six.

Simply amazing.,"Possibly the most iconic picture in cinematic history. It's a film that doesn't rely on subtext and deep symbolism in order to impress the audience. This one is all about the story, and it's a magnificent one at that. Another picture that focuses on the lives of people who are indirectly involved in the war and how it changes them. Rick and Ilsa are two of the most complex and beautiful characters ever brought to film, in my opinion. Their romance is beautiful and the effect that leaving one another has on them is utterly tragic. Watching Rick brood while throwing back shot after shot the night after his first encounter with Ilsa in years is one of the most brutal and well acted scenes I've ever witnessed. He pours his heart and soul into the performance, as does Bergman, and everything about watching them is just sensational. You just know that you're watching magic.

While I usually feel that directors are responsible for the greatness of films, not actors, this is certainly a case to test that rule. The more than capable cast give, almost to a one, riveting performances; consider how, in a very few minutes of screen time, Peter Lorre, or Sydney Greenstreet, capture not only our attention, but the essence of the shady, disreputable characters they play. There is an ocean of sublime performance in Lorre's deliver of the ""You despise me, don't you?"" line; hams like Costner, Cruise and die Caprio should be forced to watch him over and over, until they get it right.Or consider Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser), who in life had fled from the Nazis, and despised them, but gave far more than a caricature or stock performance as an evil Prussian; watch how he probes Rick in the scene in the Café Americain and read the conflict in his eyes as he gives a truly nuanced read to lines that could have flopped in the hands of a lesser actor.And then there is S.Z. Sakall's performance as the head waiter, Carl; we sense that the actor had, in his mind, a full back story that is barely alluded to in the script, save for a single time when a waiter calls him ""Professor"". That is richness at a Tolkeinian level.Of course, a good deal of the strength of this movie, and the characters in it, derives from the excellent script; but this script changed and developed as the film shoot progressed (a very famous story), and as the writing team changed, and changed again. It is the actors fleshing out the roles that made the story and the brilliant ending. Not to say that Director Micahel Curitz was just along for the ride, but he managed to capture art by seeing what would work, and where to go next  an unusual kind of brilliance.And, what can be said about the depth of Humphrey Bogart's or Ingrid Bergman's acting? Thank the gods of film that the roles were not given to Ronald Regan or Ann Sheridan; what a hash they would have made of this.Competent camera work, lighting and set design show that it isn't a huge budget that makes a great picture; nor, at 102 minutes running time, can length be the key ingredient in a first class film. The self indulgent movie makers of today should take note  why insist of inflicting bloated budgets on the industry, and bloated 3 hour ordeals on the public when so much more can be done with so much less?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A great love triangle--Bogart, Bergman and ---Rains","After who knows how many viewings, the scenes with Claude Rains still are the most entertaining for me.  Rains would have stolen the movie, if the rest of the cast had not been so good.  He has many of the really good lines.  We have two love triangles in this film.  The classic Rick--Ilsa--Victor one and the more interesting Rick--Ilsa--Louis. The non-traditional ending is one of the most satisfying in films.  As Louie says, ""Who is Rick?  Why, if I were a woman, and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick"".   Just a beautiful friendship.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Obviously a classic, and for good reason","I could quote more lines from this movie than many others without having seen it because of its popularity and importance to popular culture. Yet having seen it a second time I was drawn in more and appreciated the acting and cinematography of the film. I was particularly taken with Humphrey Bogart and the nonchalant Rick, such an American as most of the world sees us! Rains' Renault was also a treat, not to mention Sam. The superimposition of maps was a nice touch, and the contrasting darkness of most of the action in Casablanca against the idyllic glimpse we are given of Paris makes their love despite the short time together convincing. I was told a back story about the time this was made and how it tied to the US involvement in the war before watching the film, and this made the anthems scene quite poignant. Needless to say, it's clear why this is a classic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A good and entertaining watch,"The story is nice and you would think it's predictable, but it has a very nice twist at the end.This movie also nicely depicts a story of events at certain place and time in history, which was refreshing.The only problem with it is it got a little bit slow at times, I had to push myself at times to finish it, and I'm glad I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Over-hyped & Over-rated,"After watching this film, the only thing I feel is dissapointment.The acting is superb, but when you watch the film, the only thing you can see is that this is a war propaganda film, trying to persuade mothers and wives to feel good about letting their sons/husbands go off to be killed for a 'noble' cause.The direction at times is too schmoltzy and the story is just too weak.Overall a fantastically made but pointless attempt at war propaganda.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Don't just watch it, Be a part of the Epic!","I have always watched and enjoyed movies produced all over the world but I feel its high time I put my thoughts on paper for the sake of records at least . Also, these will have the potential to create some nostalgic value later.Coincidentally, I watched Casablanca for the first time (emotionally) few days back. The movie which is largely known as one of the greatest love stories of all time is not one, its much more than a mere love story.It is a work of a man who at the time of making this piece seemed to have acquired such levels of skills in his art form that it is next to impossible to be able to find a flaw in this work even for the finest of the observers.How do I even start here? I should very well start with the image which has not left me ever since I have finished watching the movie. There is no doubt that Ingrid Bergman is one of the most naturally beautiful actresses Hollywood has seen in the last century, but in my opinion she is also one of the very few actors who could speak through their eyes exactly what was there in the heart of the character she was playing. This is a skill/gift which is found in a rare breed of actors. The scene where she looks at Rick (Humphrey Bogart) after all those years of separation is a perfect example of the role eyes ought to play to emote ones feelings without utterance of a single alphabet. Its hard to believe how she did not receive an Oscar nomination for this movie as she ended up receiving seven of them in a long glittering career. The prospect of watching all of those is a temptation that can not be defined.I haven't seen all of Bergman's fine performances but in the few that I have seen, one can easily conclude that she has the ability to give multiple layers to her character which is the case in Casablanca as well. The flair with which she has been able to shift between various moods of innocence, mystery and sheer passion is remarkable. Of course, credit must also go to Curtiz who orchestrated this mood dance.The character of Rick is like an iceberg which has been put in fire to melt and vanish and just before it starts to lose its identity it takes inspiration from itself and extinguishes the fire with the water it had lost. There could not have been a better choice for this role than Humphrey Bogart, every square inch of whose countenance reflects the state of mind he is in. Moreover, he is a true style icon in this movie and fits the part to the hilt which pops up the following question: was the role of Rick written for him or he was the best fit for the role!As is seems, the image of protagonists is at the top of my mind their role in the greatness of the movie is certainly not limited to being the faces of the movie. Having said that, below the surface its the work of a master who has engineered multiple components into a giant which overpowers most others in its proximity. This fine piece of work makes its entry straight into the list of Cinema Extraordinaire because of its universal appeal, unique treatment, essentially real yet whimsical script, gripping screenplay and stupendous display of ever changing human behavior.The range of emotions and situations this film has on offer at every stage of the movie makes it a sumptuous and delicious meal for audiences of varying taste. The movie reaches its climax in 95 minutes and it feels like that perfectly timed dessert which is an extremely rare delight.The manner in which any two characters have been linked in this movie is the most unique to say the least. There are many two way relationships which have been portrayed with considerable depth on screen in such a small time that you start wondering by the time movie reaches its final moments that how was it even possible to experience so much in such a short time.Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself.This is a must watch for anyone who has ever thought of himself as a movie fan. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
You must remember this...,"Are my eyes really brown?Casablanca is one of those films that needs no introduction - or in truth - any more in-depth dissection as to its worth. Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it's arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly ""A"" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film's of all time.I wouldn't mention Paris, it's poor salesmanship!So what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it's like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn't dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick's Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it's one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the Best Films Ever Made,"With the Nazis having already occupied France and conquered much of Eastern Europe, a stream of refugees desperately attempt to get to America by embarking on a tortuous path which includes getting to the small city of Casablanca in French Morocco and from there to Lisbon. However, as difficult as it is for these refugees to actually get to Casablanca, their travel is further complicated by the fact that nobody is allowed to take the daily flight from there to Lisbon without the written permission of the corrupt Vichy French police commander by the name of ""Captain Louis Renault"" (Claude Rains). So quite often these refugees have to wait for quite a long time and this-in and of itself-creates even more of a financial and logistical hardship upon them. So in an effort to find a solution to their problem or temporarily forget about their troubles, many of them flock to the most popular nightclub there known as ""Rick's Café Americain"" which is owned by a tough and worldly American expatriate named ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart). Yet, even though he is quite successful in Casablanca, he finds it hard to find any great happiness due to a previous romance which devastated him a year and a half earlier. However, things take a sudden turn for the worse when a famous anti-German activist named ""Victor Laszlo"" (Paul Henreid) walks into his nightclub-and with him is the woman who broke his heart that bleak and rainy day in Paris. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is not only my favorite movie of all time but is also considered to be one of the best films ever made with a number of movie stars possibly turning in the best performances of their careers. I especially liked the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (as ""Ilsa Lund"") along with the performance of Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal companion ""Sam"". Be that as it may, I believe that this is one of the very few films that each and every viewer ought to see at least once and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. A classic in every sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The best movie... EVER!,"Roger Ebert said this about ""Citizen Kane,"" ""If I were ever stranded on a desert island and could only watch one movie ""Citizen Kane"" would be the one."" I feel the same way about ""Casablanca."" I think it has a much better story line than ""Citizen Kane"" and it didn't need inovative camera shots to make it a truely unique movie experience. And, it has some of the best dialoge ever written in a movie. Ex. Strasser: Why did you come to Casablanca? Rick:      I came for the waters. Strasser: This is the desert!

Casablanca,"This film is very original and well done. The characters did a great job and the story was excellent. Casablanca is one of a kind and being such an old film it still brings in so many memories. The saying ""Play it again Sam"" is still used in this day and age. This film unleashes thrilling romance, humor, and a bit of suspense. At a time when the United States entered the second world war this film really hits the spot in the audiences minds filled with excitement and joy. Director Michael Curtiz really did a great job with the use of artistic and dramatic aspects as well as playing a key role in the use of visualization.

Why do Women Like This?,"I'll put aside my suspicion that so many people top their favorites list with this movie because it's the only Golden Age movie they've seen besides Christmas films and just ask, why, ladies?I can see why the men like to identify with Rick, he's cool and cynical and in the end he makes a big sacrifice, but Ilsa? Ilsa is one of the most passive characters to ever lead in a movie. She allows Rick to decide the rest of her life for her, I guess because he's a man and men know best.Her passivity comes across even more ridiculous because Bergman is several inches taller and a good forty pounds heavier than Bogie. With her wrestler's neck and broad shoulders, I kept expecting her to pick him up and toss him on the sofa for old times sake.Just an okay story, badly cast.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
More than a classic,"There's one aspect of Casablanca that is seldom if ever discussed. Every character in the movie has made choices out of necessity rather than desire and yet the entire movie centers around desire.Humphrey Bogart's, Rick, settles in Casablanca after being on the run with Sam, his piano man who has very little choice but to follow him. Bergman's, Ilsa, who is torn from Bogart in Paris, leaves him out of necessity when she learns her husband who she thought was dead is alive.Ilsa's husband played by Paul Henreid, is a non-reluctant political mercenary, taking refuge in Casablanca.In the background there is Louie, the French prefect, who also by necessity plays the aggressive supporter of Vichy France and yet has no love for his superiors.In the background is the oppressiveness of the German army in a town where every non-native is there out of necessity, trying to free themselves from the yoke of German viciousness.Thus is the backdrop where desire must heed to necessity against a menace out to crush both. A truly remarkable film with remarkable performances that have gone on to be more than a timeless classic but rather a thread in the fabric of every American. It carries messages that may seem lost on today's youth but still provides timeless lessons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca,"Writer and story consultant Robert McKee regards Casablanca as the perfect screenplay. Something he deconstructs in his famous 3 day film screenwriting seminars.In the late 1980s I saw McKee giving his insights on Casablanca on British television. He broke down the beats of a scene from Casablanca when Rick and Ilsa meet in the bazaar where she is looking at some lace. The dialogue is full of subtext and hidden meanings.McKee points out the costume both characters are wearing clothes that included stripes. The setting in the bazaar with some rods above the characters look like prison bars.It shows that both characters were soul mates, somehow bound together. The bars also implied that both of them were also destined to remain apart.It was the first time I realised that costumes and set design even in what initially looked like a mundane scene is not something random. The positioning of the actors on the screen to even shadows that fall on the characters can mean something.The weird thing about the screenplay for Casablanca was that the script was being rewritten as the movie was being made.I have seen Casablanca through the years. It has sizzling lines that are so quotable. it has been imitated so often and misquoted. It has been parodied for decades and the basic premise has been redone many times. Just look at Sydney Pollack's Havana from 1990 that shows what happens if you do not get the script or the chemistry between the actors right.I just watch movies for enjoyment purposes. In my latest viewing of Casablanca during the Covid pandemic of 2020. I found myself gaining more insights. At a time where some people were stranded abroad as flights suddenly got cancelled or had to quarantine and then look for ways to scramble back home. I sympathized with people in the movie who were stuck in Casablanca looking for exit visas to get to Lisbon and then onwards to America.As the film is set before the USA entered the second world war. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) the cynical, world weary bar owner and American ex pat is basically a metaphor for American isolationism. He cares for himself and his piano player Sam. Rick does not want to get involved with other people's problems. People can visit his bar, drink, gamble and conduct business but just do not ask him for any favours.Blaine gets possession of some stolen letters of transit. Soon two more people arrive in Casablanca looking for a way to escape Europe. Notorious underground resistance leader Victor Laszlo and his companion Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Ilsa was Rick's former love in Paris, the one that left him with a broken heart and his idealism in ruins.Rick has been warned by the local police chief Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) not to aid Laszlo to escape. Renault wants to stay sweet with the Nazi officer Strasser.The movie is really a bittersweet love story between Rick and Ilsa. In a way her reappearance sees a thawing of Rick's cold heart. He makes a choice to be noble and make sacrifices. In 1942 this amounts to the USA entering the second world war.Apart from the cracking dialogue the movie has memorable but shady characters and lots of humour. Renault is the standout, the corrupt police chief who moves where the wind blows but secretly as his own side. Then there are two members of the cast who followed Bogart from The Maltese Falcon. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.The film might now look cliched because it has been done so many times. Just imagine for over 40 years every major film studio has booked McKee to do his 3 day course and deconstruct Casablanca. You must remember this, the movie still stands the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

a movie classic: pure and simple,"There are movie classics and there are movie classics. And then there is ""Casablanca."" Shot in 1942, it is over sixty years old and more than holds its own against anything that one can throw up against it today. For Humphrey Bogart, this was a career defining moment that launched the Bogie mystique. Ingrid Bergman's performance is nothing less than scintillating. The cast of supporting actors and actresses is superlative. This is one of the rare movies that makes the viewer suspend disbelief. Almost everything in the movie is first rate. The editing was superb with no extraneous scenes. There is no fat. It is a movie in which extremes exist and yet there is no contradiction. It is the rarest kind of movie that can be watched a hundred times and yet, one never tires of it. ""Casablanca"" is pure cinema magic that few, if any, movies will ever match. Words cannot reach it. ""Casablanca"" is an experience that one simply has to experience and preferably, at least once, on a big screen. On a scale of one to ten with ten being best, it is an easy one hundred.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca is more than just a period film,"Casablanca is one of the most highly-regarded films of all time, by critics and viewers alike. There is something in it for everybody: action, suspense, humor, and romance. Though that may sound like a line ripped from a movie poster, Casablanca deftly balances its time between these varied roles to emerge as one of the most well-rounded films in all of cinema.The story is simple: Rick runs a café in Morocco, a haven for those oppressed by the Nazi regime in 1940's Europe. ""Rick's Café Americain"", as it is called, is a refuge for both Americans and those simply down on their luck. One day, Rick's old flame, Ilsa, arrive in Casablanca, her husband in tow. She is not exactly welcomed. As Rick puts it, ""of all the gin joints in all the world you had to walk into this one"".Above all, Casablanca is vivid. Though that may seem like an inaccuracy, given that the film is in black and white, there are other ways for vividness to manifest itself than through color.Monochrome though it may be, the contrast between blacks and whites, between sunlight and shadow in Casablanca is intense. Rick seems trapped in darkness as he stews after hours in his café. Ilsa seems nearly angelic in many scenes, her white face and clothes shining in soft focus.The film seems itself to sweat. Outdoor shots appear muggy, humid, and uncomfortably warm; many shots seem intentionally blurred, ever so slightly, to give the impression of heat in the air distorting the picture, or perhaps salty sweat obscuring the vision of the camera.The performances in Casablanca are top-notch. Talented character actors such as Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (both of ""Maltese Falcon"" fame) and Claude Rains create convincing and memorable characters, while leading stars such as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman shine as the main characters, Rick and Ilsa.Casablanca endures as a pop culture icon, many of its lines achieving catchphrase status. The never-uttered ""play it again Sam"", Rick's oft-repeated ""here's looking at you, kid"", and the movie-ending ""this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" are all well-known, and frequently referenced in other works. It endures because though the story may take place in a specific time, the idea of the film is timeless: to sacrifice what you want most for what you know is best. It is the ultimate human ideal, and just as that ideal is held high, so is Casablanca.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Pretty 'Damn' Good,This is an enjoyable movie that is packed with atmosphere. drama and a little romance!Its rimming with odd characters throughout the movie that add to the fantasy and mystery that is Casablanca.Bogart is an odd duck in this film and its his (to me anyway) slightly off beat and awkward performance that makes Casablanca noteworthy.A cool movie that deserves its place in movie history.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Bogie,"The American Film Institute lists Casablanca as the 2nd or 3rd greatest movie ever. While I will agree that it is a high quality piece of film I can't understand how it can rank that high. The movie is well acted, well directed, and the screenplay contains the more memorable quotes than any movie ever. That is an indicator of either of two things. Either the writing is the greatest ever or people just really cling to the old romance and intrigue story.I like Bogie's character. What a classic screen drunkard. Try watching this movie and keeping up with the drinking bogie does in it, you'll be face down in an ocean of your own vomit before the twelve minute mark. He is cold to the world and looks at things in a super rational way. Sam shoulda got his own movie. He could have been the 40's version of the Dolemite. Because the rest of the characters seem befuddled next to Bogie it gives the feel of watching a one man show. The story doesn't stand out that much, it's pretty standard Romance material.

Good ' entertainment. ',"I have seen this film several times in my life, and despite the fact that the acting and some of the dialogue is good, I have seen it now for the last time.

The story is so familiar I do not want to rehash it here but only to say that in my opinion the film looks often badly filmed, and the back projections are awful especially in the Paris scenes. In my opinion the film is ' fake ' through and through, and it leaves out one word and one important aspect of the film's subject matter.

Overlooked by Modern Americans,"I love this film. It isn't my favorite movie nor even in my top 100. It's beautiful but it isn't the sort of movie that I typically care for. It's primarily a love triangle that could essentially be straightened up by a single conversation. It's super nationalistic and earnest without a lot of the complicated characters that I tend to like.Yet, somehow it is a movie I don't just like but love. It is a film that is emblematic of several things that I enjoy looking back on.The first of these is the Hollywood studio system. Once it crashed in the 70s for the rise of auteurs and less polished clean films films produced in the style of Classic Hollywood went away forever. There were certainly a lot of things about Old Hollywood that needed to go: the way they controlled people, the racism, and the sexism; but there was also a sort of magical quality back when everyone was going to see the same couple of movies over and over again. A communal experience in film that is only likened to today in films such as ""Avengers: Endgame."" Here is a film that was worthy of being seen by everyone.It has the polish of masters of their trades working to achieve perfect shots, perfect performances with a crispness that only fails when it is intentionally dropped to give the old soft fuzzy look to Ingrid Bergman's close ups.Pointing to the film and trying to call out any one aspect of the film as special is difficult because every aspect of it is done so perfectly. Can you call out the acting and leave out the cinematography, or the direction, or the editing?Another thing this film does is remind me of a time when America was busy sacrificing individual comforts, preferences, freedoms, and even lives for the sake of something larger than themselves. These days that seems in short supply. It doesn't seem outlandish to think that if they remade this film (and don't you think for a second that they wouldn't if they thought it would make money) today it would end with Rick (Humphrey Bogart, ""The Maltese Falcon"") and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman, ""Notorious"") flying off together to a new life and romance.""Casablanca"" is a great example of something I believe is quite tragic about modern movie watchers, though it is probably inevitable. It's a film that is utterly beautiful and full of meaning and entertaining yet most people won't watch it because it is old. I am a fan of old things and one of those weirdos that are always talking about the things that we are forgetting from our past.There are many things about the past that we should grow beyond but ""Casablanca"" shouldn't be one of them. It may not have a crazy shootout at the end, snappy curse laced dialogue, or sizzling stars baring it all, but it has stood the test of time for a reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Casablanca,"Here is looking at you kid, these words are written by my current boss Bernhard Drumel in his skype. I never knew that they are from Casablanca, until I saw the movie.This is a love story during the world war second based in Casablanca, Morocco, North West Africa  a port where refugee Europeans came to depart for USA. Old time lovers - Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Lisa (Ingrid Bergman), meet after many years in Casablanca and remember their love in France. Lisa was and is wife of Victor (Paul Henreid) and the couple is planning to run away to America through Casablanca. Rick - now the owner of the most popular club in Casablanca is well connected among corrupt military and government machinery - sacrifices his love and helps the couple duo to go to America.It is the not the story in itself, but the way it is told that makes it a very interesting viewing. The pace is fast and engrossing. The story slowly unfolds and never lets the viewers guess the next till the very end. There is a sense of mystery and suspense. The backbone of the movie is a love story that has gone wrong. It connects with every audience. The misery and cynicism of Rick is so real that every man may feel a close resemblance to the feeling Rick is having. Though many, there are well itched characters that define the intent and purpose of their words and actions. The characters  mostly representing different European countries  and give an universal appeal to western audiences, and so I understand its relevance in people's mind and popularity.The character of Rick is brilliantly played by the chain smoking king Bogart. This was my first movie of Bogart and he impressed me the most. Like all olden days actors who  each one of them  had their unique style and so delight to watch; Bogart has his own. Ingrid looks and acts beautifully to say and hide her secrets with her eyes and body language. Paul Henreid was good, but not brilliant. Special mention of the local French Captain Renault, played by Claude Rains  who plays the most engrossing characters with black and white, shrewd and sober shades  a delight to watch him.Each and every dialogue of the movie is perfect and catchy. The lines are worth repeating even today and written with so conviction that they are ever-green. The one that I personally liked the most was when the German commander asks Rick which nationality he belongs to; and Rick with his usual cynicism replies  I am a drunkard. There are so many such quotable lines almost unforgettable in the movie.This was Director Martin Curtiz's 132 movie production as director. It took him almost 20 years of making movie to come out with this gem. Martin kept on making movies till the last year 1961; he died in 1962. Great music, fantastic choreography of people, and definite acting by most crew! The only thing I disliked about the movie was that most of it was shot indoors on the sets, and that in itself did not give the movie the epic proportions that normally one would expect from such classics.There are many hate reviews about this movie, and I read a few of them. I found this movie to be very good  made in 1942, it was much ahead of its time in terms of scripting, dialogue, pace and screenplay. Now a days we see so many movies  but to think of the rave Casablanca would have created during world war second times, would have been enormous.My salute to Martin Curtiz and Humphrey Bogart! Now I know and understand what does my boss mean when he writes and says  Here is looking at you kid! (Stars 8 out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Romance? Yes, But Men Will Like It, Too!","""Here's looking at you, kid.""""This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""""I don't stick my neck out for nobody.""""Round up the usual suspects.""""I'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find that gambling is going on in here!""""Did you abscond with the church funds?""""We'll always have Paris.""These are just some of the lines from this movie which have made their way into our lexicon. Of course, I did save the most famous one for last: ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""Welcome to ""Casablanca"", regarded as one of the most popular movies of all time. I know, I know, everybody says that, but it's true. When people criticize movies today, Casablanca is usually one of the ""go-to"" films they turn to when they say ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""And, they would be correct.Ask any woman to name her top-five most romantic movies, and ""Casablanca"" will likely show up on her list. And when it comes to movie romances, men's eyes usually glaze over at the mere mention of them. Well, I am here to tell you there is plenty to keep a man's attention in this film and, in the end, he may actually walk away in a non-catatonic state.First, you have Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner and proprietor of Rick's Café Americain in the city of Casablanca. An expatriated American, Rick is a cynic whose establishment is just this side of illegal, yet he manages to stay in business and make a good living at it. And besides, it's Bogey!Then there's Claude Rains as the local chief of police, Louis Renault. Captain Renault is slippery as an eel, especially when it comes to dealing with those in authority above him. He's also inquisitive, intelligent, and hypocritical.Up next are the Nazis. Morocco was French territory in 1941, and the Germans occupied France during that time. Here, they are presented as ambitious warmongers bent on world domination (and that would be correct). With the Nazis around, there is an inbred conflict from the get-go, as Casablanca is portrayed as a hub for the French Resistance during World War II. I should also point out that this is the earliest American film I know of that not only uses the term ""concentration camp"" by name, but it also suggests that people have died within them.Throw in a murder or two, and you have the makings of a good film-noir. Okay, so ""film-noir"" officially sprang up after World War II, but it still feels like one. The camera angles, shot composition, lighting, use of shadow, a brooding leading man (Bogart), and a tormented femme fatale (Ingrid Bergman) all add up toward the formula.All of this is capped off with sardonic wit and tight drama, signs of a well-written script (which, interestingly enough, was cobbled together right up to the very end of filming). Also, the timing of this movie is what made it such a hit. It ranks right up there with ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967), ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967), and ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978) in terms of topicality within the society of the day.So, you men out there, when your woman suggests watching ""Casablanca"", throw some popcorn in the microwave. Trust me, you'll be able to sit through this one!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
AS Time Goes By...,"As time goes by, this movie gets better and better. No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. The love story lasts a lifetime as well as the action and suspense. The chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is incomparable. Bogart's portrayal of Rick is one of the greatest acting roles I have ever witnessed. To see a character so stoic and unemotional and then to know that a single woman is able to break him down to nothing is so groundbreaking to the mind. Beside the amazing acting, my other favorite aspect of this movie is the lighting. The lighting on this set of this movie was so moving, that it was hard to tell that they were trying to tell the emotional and romantic story with just the lighting. For example, the brighter lighting was reserved for when we saw Rick and Isla in France when they were happy and in love. The darker lighting was reserved for when Rick is alone without Isla and especially when he was alone and drinking the night she came back into his life. The lighting also told Rick's mental state as well. Such an amazing movie and deserving of every award given to it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
So much better than Citizen Kane,"In terms of the greatest films of all time, Casablanca has it in spades. It is so much stronger than Citizen Kane. It is an absolute classic of the noir era, due to how strong it is stylistically and has given us some of the most memorable lines and moments in film history. It can be easily interpreted as a propaganda film made to encourage the Americans to join the war. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is brilliant as the reluctant hero. The film itself has become iconic as a tale of redemption. Unlike Citizen Kane, it has withstood the test of time. In fact I would go further and say that Casablanca is timeless.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/IQ9T6J",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Classic Film at Its Best,"In Casablanca, Morocco, during World War II, there is a place called Rock's run by an American where fugitives can meet safely and enjoy a refreshing drink and soothing music. Think of it as a 1940s Mos Eisley Cantina, if you will. And at the center of it all? Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart.It really goes without saying that this film is a classic, and probably one of the most famous and highly acclaimed films ever, as well as being Humphrey Bogart's biggest role. It is quotable, the scenes have been emulated or parodied scores of times... what more can I say that hasn't been said over the last sixty-odd years?So, I will say two things: one, this film loses nothing to time. Despite being a clear period piece (filmed during WWII and taking place as a war film, sort of) it resonates just as strongly today with audiences as it did the first day. And also, it exceeded my expectations. Surely I thought it would be good. But often when films (or anything, really) have something of a legendary status, the hype is difficult to match. ""Casablanca"" matched the hype and at times went above and beyond. From the opening scene with the spinning globe, I knew this was going to be the next step in film history -- perhaps ""Casablanca"" is the first modern film?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
7.0/10 - A Well Written Classic With Good Flow,"Casablanca is essentially THE classic Hollywood film in the eyes of many. Writers' Guild of America chose Casablanca as the greatest screenplay of all time, and you know, it's just generally really acclaimed. Despite its popularity, I went into this film nearly blind. I only knew that it's a love story before watching it, and that's it.Well, I'm glad to say I do like this film, though I fail to get into it as much as others who have praised it before.Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though. I'd summarize the plot like this, more or less: during WWII lots of European immigrants have tried to flee from Europe to the USA, but not many achieved that goal. Casablanca, the largest city in Morocco, is a place to which many immigrants went in order to get to America. Things are not that easy though, and our main characters suffer from even more complications in comparison to the average immigrant - they're haunted by their past, the corrupt local police and more.The strongest aspect of the film is, in my opinion, its flow and pacing. Things happen quite quickly and the film doesn't waste a moment in forced exposition or filler scenes - everything feels necessary and adds to the general experience of the film. This quality of Casablanca is evident both with the dialogue and with the general sense of pacing, I'd say.And yeah, I guess that everything here is pretty much solid. Many quotable moments (some quotes I didn't even know were from this film originate here), strong performances, cinematography that doesn't feel quite experimental but does work smoothly. Yeah. I enjoy this movie. Rick, the main character, is also well written. His development remains engaging throughout the film, and I would say I was emotionally invested enough so the film didn't feel pointless.And I mean, I can't be too rough on this film for most of the things it does, but I will say that it's pretty evident that the main female character here, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) doesn't have a lot of depth to her in comparison to the male characters. Her only trait is basically being torn apart between the male characters, and it's not that bad but I do think she could've been developed more so she does feel like a person and less like a trope. Probably one of the better depictions of that trope, as well written is it gets tbh, but still a little flat.I don't think I have anything else to add here - Casablanca is fun, well paced and well written. It has good flow and iconic cast, and though its main female character feels a little shallow it does manage to work well overall. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Vastly overrated,"It should be obvious that the only reason this movie is so highly rated is that it appeals to religious or left-wing sensibilities that admire people sacrificing for the ""common good"". Personally, if the Ingrid Bergman character was truly unhappy with her husband, then she should have left him for Bogart, but no, she has to commit to duty, to sacrifice, particularly in time of great distress. Much like ""Citizen Kane"", that's all this movie has to offer - a stale moral that we should not seek personal gain or happiness, if it potentially ""harms"" others; sacrifice is the order of the day. The Bergman character should stick with her dull marriage, so to please her husband in a time of war, and Charles Foster Kane should have given up his lofty position and go back to his simple, boyish days of sledding. He would have been a happier man for it and not alienated so many people. Other than this tired, old moral of the importance of sacrifice or resignation, both these films are snooze fests and not deserving of classic status.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This 81-year-old movie holds up better than movies made 81 days ago,"It's insane. Watching a 1942 movie nowadays in 2023 is like jumping into a completely different reality. People talk different. Men are men, women are women, different races exist without being enemies, just friends, and they all respect each other. Love is real, sentimentality is real, everything is real, not a product based on ticking a bunch of checkboxes and hitting a few predictable cliches, like any modern movie.I'm so glad I finally watched Casablanca. The music, the poetic dialogue, the characters, the visual style - I fell in love with them all. It's black and white, it's raining. There's a constant feeling of emotion and urgency, yet calmness. It's hard to describe.If you're a 90s kids (I'm afraid anyone beyond that is hopeless due to the world slowly turning into pure distilled cancer after about the 2010s, so what chance did they even have?) you should definitely watch this, because I reckon you'll be able to appreciate it.Grab a few beers, free yourself two hours one night, turn off the lights, turn up the sound, and jump into a better, yet infinitely tougher world. Because we're so comfortable now that everyone's a weakling. Back then - everyone was tough, yet with manners, respect, intelligence. Like I said, it's like watching a movie about completely different species of humans.Even if you don't like the romantic story, you'll probably appreciate this movie for the cultural time vessel of the 1940s that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Movie romanticism at its best,"Casablanca is a desperate place during WWII. Refugees escaping the Nazis travel a back route through Casablanca to Lisbon and then to the free world. Some can go no further than the French colony which is home to scoundrels, smugglers, double dealers, and freedom fighters. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a world wearied expat American who runs a popular nightspot Rick's. He sticks his neck out for nobody. Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) leads the local police. He's eager to catch the underground leader Victor Laszlo to please the Germans. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a sweaty people-smuggler who is selling 2 letters of transit stolen from 2 German couriers. He gives the valuable letters for Rick to hide. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with his old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman).It's hard to quantify everything that is so great about this movie. Bogie as the Rick is one of those movie icons that transcends even the movie world. The desperation is well projected. This is melodrama of the highest order and the best of the genre. Sometimes movies come along at the right time. This is a propaganda film at the perfect time where the theme of sacrifice hit hardest. This is the standard bearer for movie romanticism as much as Romeo and Juliet for plays. Some can complain about Paul Henreid's stiffness as Laszlo but that's the point of his character. Some others can complain about the effects but that's missing the point of the movie entirely. Some can complain about all the clichés, and I agree that this movie is one big cliché. So what? In the end, this is a movie that deserves every bit of its iconic status.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
It Took Me a While to Come Around to This One,"Ah, ""Casablanca.""  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is ""Casablanca"" a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Of all the films in all the world...,"... this must be the one where the romance of everything appeals to me the most. You have the passionate but doomed re-acquaintance, set against a time when to even look a day into the future was uncertain. Best of all, the guy I'm supposed to relate to from this couple is the boozing, sarcastic incarnation of Humphrey Bogart! Part of me feels like you haven't suffered unless you're someone who's destined for the gutter and bitter at how the world has turned out. An attitude that comes from reading too much pre-18th century poetry, no doubt... (Further insight may also be found in my review of ""The Libertine"".)Anyway, all of the most important details within the story seem to have been collected especially for my benefit, although I guess I'm not the only one, since the film continues to be popular right up to the present day. Truth is, this is a movie for anyone who inwardly looks upon themselves as a cynic with a heart of gold.The question I ask myself though is: Would I be brave and selfless enough to give up my one true love for the sake of humanity in general? I don't think so, although I still cling to memories of a faded love, I have no pretensions of being so noble about it. That is why we have indelible movie-stars and characters, though - Heroes who do the things we wish we could do, and are strong enough to take the consequences of the hardest choices. Rick Blaine and ""Casablanca"" are monuments to the notion of 'doing the decent thing', and it is this quality that makes the script and performances come alive. Watching it should be a magical experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
2nd Best Movie of all Time!,"Casablanca is both the definition of classic and 'cool' cinema. Humphrey Bogart just breezed through his lines like he was Rick himself. Every time he utters a word it comes out like silk and Ingrid Bergman is the best example of a true Hollywood actress no matter what time frame you're looking act. Peter Lorre is one of my favorites (especially after seeing him in this and ""M""), and his expressions in this, both verbal and facial were incredible. This is just a timeless masterpiece that is great to be able to watch on a nice relaxing day and see first hand that film can be one of the most beautiful forms of art when done correctly. It doesn't get much better than this, and even that's arguable to some I presume. I wish there were more movies like this but I'm sure that's easier said then done since it'd be next to impossible to pop out scripts like this. Oh well, one can wish right? If you haven't seen this yet then stop what you're doing immediately and rush out to the video store, it is of the utmost importance...I kid you not!!!Final 2 Cents:Movies : This must've been a gem on the screen.DVD Purchase : A necessity, now I just got to trade it in for the special edition.Rental : Absolutely imperative!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Greatest Film Ever Made,"A bold statement, especially considering I haven't seen every movie that's ever existed, but as far as the classics we all know and that latest new epic or new teen comedy is concerned, Casablanca is simply the greatest film of all time.It is honestly difficult to say this, especially when The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia are taken into account. Out of these three I'd say The Godfather is probably the most interchangeable with the greatest of all time, however The Godfather does lack the ""go out to the movies and take your mind away for a hour and a half"" aspect that is so necessary in films.When you go to something like 2 Fast 2 Furious you are going solely for escapism and entertainment. When you go see Darren Arnofsky's ""Pie"" (if you could have found it in a theater) you are seeing it solely for it's artistic value. Neither aspect of going to the movies is better than the other. There are those high-brow, art house people who watch nothing but Pie, Transpotting, and Fight Club who say 2 Fast 2 Furious or anything like it is utter crap and has no value. Then there are those teeny-bopper idiots who watch nothing but TRL, American Pie, and think black and white movies are boring and they are just as wrong.The best movies ever made are certainly not those starring Paul Walker or Sean William Scott and feature nothing but explosions and fart jokes. Nor do the best movies ever made have actors you've never heard of and deal with the deep, dark issues of the human mind or make as many jabs at pop culture, or any culture for that matter as they can. Such art house movies negate the purpose of movies, which shall always be at its core, escapism. However, escapism at its extreme negates the power and meaning movies can transmit.The best movies ever made are those that combine these two aspects. Art and Entertainment. People should never be extreme one way or the other with almost everything in life and movies are certainly one such thing.Casablanca does everything I've mentioned that makes a perfect film. Those who love Brittany Spears and American Pie probably have never heard of, nor will they ever appreciate this film because their parents have taught them black and white=boring. Those modern critics who look back at movies like Casablanca or filmmakers like Frank Capra and call his work meaningless, sensationalist tripe are just as wrong and closed-minded as the teeny boppers.Casablanca contains great performances from the greatest actors, wonderful cinematography, intelligent dialogue, and the greatest classical love story ever told on screen and the greatest, realistic ending of any film ever made as well. Just as the romantic comedy would not exist without Shakespeare, the modern romantic drama and film noire, would not exist without Casablanca.See it and many other films of the past.The greats of today would not exist without the greats of yesterday.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca,"The film Casablanca revolves around Nick, and exiled American who runs a small but powerful night club far from where he was from originally. Through the course of the film he runs into Ilsa, the woman he left in Paris years before, though she was upset with him she couldn't stay away therefore involving themselves with each other again.This film is deemed a classic but it definitely has to be watched more than once to understand the plot and the storyline, it's a well-filmed movie but it's very easy to get lost in the storyline itself. I felt myself getting lost and to be perfectly honest I probably wouldn't watch this film again, not that it was bad but because it wasn't of my interest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Play it again, Sam","One would be hard pressed to find a list of ""Best films ever made"" without Casablanca included on it - indeed, if any movie was to be singled out as the most laudable and classic picture of all time, there is no doubt that Casablanca would be right up there in the running, if not bestowed the title itself. But don't be scared off by thinking Casablanca has coasted by all these years on its hefty reputation - even now, more than 60 years down the road, this film stands the test of time as one of the most influential, inspiring, quotable and just plain well made creations Hollywood has ever come up with.But one could go on all day listing different adjectives detailing Casablanca's classic status, so I'll try to bite them back and give a bit more of an analysis of the film. Director Michael Curtiz brings the film together with a touch which is daring, yet steady as a rock, presenting a powerful yet entertaining portrait of the days of Nazi occupied France, a message of hope shining through and the tumultuous love affair which grew in the midst of them - in short, the perfect period piece.The cinematography is excellent for the time, sporting a simply beautiful, film noire sheen. The movie's high point (if one could be selected) is its wonderful screenplay, which is without a doubt, one of the single best of all time - both witty, bitingly political, classy, and filled with too many endlessly quoted lines to count. (""Here's looking at you kid"" ""I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine"" only being the tip of the iceberg) The endlessly referenced ending actually comes as surprising, but fits the tone of unrequited love perfectly, and shows how daring and unique this wonderful movie must have been in its time.Humphrey Bogart is at his stoically iconic best here, creating a touching portrait of an infinitely complex and flawed man with layer upon layer of exquisitely written characterisation (""what's your nationality?"" ""I'm a drunkard"") to peel away. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman also gives a timeless performance as Bogart's mysterious past lover, and Paul Henreid makes a wonderful addition to the most classic love triangle of all time. The movie also manages to include several incredibly entertaining character roles, including the superb Claude Rains as a sympathetic police officer, Sydney Greenstreet as a corrupt club owner, and the deliciously creepy Peter Lorre in a far too brief supporting role.Suffice to say, Casablanca is one of those films one can shamelessly say they have enjoyed time and time and time again - there are far too many subtle nuances to be caught and enjoyed in a single viewing, and the movie has a replay value next to none, making them easy to catch. Casablanca is billed as the most classic love story of all time, yes, but there is ultimately so much more to it than that. Safe to say, the term ""must see"" applies here if you have yet to do so, and if you are among those who have already experienced the classic, there's not the least bit of shame of wanting to play it again, and live the magic one more time.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I found it mediocre,"Set in the early 1940′s, when WW2 was ranging and the outcome of the conflict was still far from clear. Casablanca is the name of a town in the coast of North Africa that was a focal point in gathering people from all the countries involved in the war, from refugees from occupied France to Americans seeking to make out a living out of this growing consumer market generated by this focal point. The main character is an American that owns the most popular bar in the town, where ""the action happens"".I found this movie to be rather boring and mediocre, it's a typical love story movie. Nothing special and is a film full of clichés. True, it is from 1942, which may not have been cliché at the time, and in fact may have become clichéd due to this film massive influence over the next decades on the rest of Hollywood. However, I am not interested in originality and influence here, but on the pleasure that I derived from viewing the film. Regarded by many as among the greatest films ever made, I found it completely mediocre. Maybe it is this high degree of mediocrity that allows to be so highly regarded. As something that pleases everyone is something that cannot be really great to anyone.Anyway, I am not a great fan of very old films. I generally find them either clichéd and/or technically inferior to relatively more recent films (i.e. made in the 1960′s onwards). However, I found Citizen Kane, from 1941, to have been excellent. This, on the other hand, I found to be the definition of a mediocre cliché ridden film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca dances the war-driven night away with sweeping romanticism.,"Another classic that many critics and cinephiles believe to be one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever. And much like 'Citizen Kane', I unfortunately was not overly enamoured by it. That's not to say I didn't like it, in fact I thought it was a very classy romance amidst the prickly politics of World War II. The drama just lacked, well, drama. Rick, a nightclub owner, reacquaints himself with his former flame in Casablanca, to which her husband happens to be a famed rebel wanted by Nazi officials, leaving Rick with an ultimatum. Remain bitter and see these two lovers split due to the Nazi regime, or provide assistance in helping them escape but remain broken-hearted.Set almost primarily in the club, director Curtiz successfully balances a variety of suave characters during a time of chaos. Refugees are overpopulating the city as they try to flee Europe, officials of the Third Reich wander the streets and local businessmen are constantly bartering with foreigners. The club and its customers acts as microcosm for the war, with the French consistently attempting to overpower the Germans and vice versa. Two opposing sides having to coexist in one large hall, with Rick acting as an overseer. The succinct dialogue and memorable quotes (""Here's looking at you, kid"") is all thanks to an adapted screenplay that essentially carries the film. Sure, Bogart and Bergman's performances were good, but they would not have got any recognition if it weren't for that beautiful script. It's easy to list everything that Casablanca does right, I mean we all know it's supposed to be one of the greats (and it is). Gorgeous cinematography, inventive scene transitions and wonderful tracking shots.But at no point did I feel that the characters were in danger or even remotely having any engrossing drama between themselves. After all, it's set during a devastating war, and strangely that historic event is put aside for the romance. Yes, it's a mature love story, and the film succeeds in that sense. However much of the focus was set on Laszlo, to whom I believe was underdeveloped. It's only during the last twenty minutes that certain plot details are set into motion, consequently making the preceding hour watchable but inconsistently paced. Rick's nostalgic flashback in particular skews the pacing and unfortunately is drawn out, in an attempt to lay the foundations of his romance with Ilsa.There is no doubt that Casablanca is an important film. It was back in 1942 and still is today. Yet the curse of having the acclaim of ""one of the greatest films of all time"" results in expectations never being met. Technically a perfect film, but lacks that ""oomph"" to push it even further.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A great movie of its time that has aged very well - 8/10,"This review comes from a first-time watcher.For being an almost 80 year old movie, the story and the way it's driven through the acting along with the dialogue managed to come off pretty fresh. This movie wastes no time with establishing the stage on which they are set on, the characters and their personalities. The huge amount of dialogues and lines in this movie is what sets free the potential in this movie.I saw another reviewer referring to a particular scene as ""The Battle of the Anthems"". That particular scene left a lasting impression on me and was a great summary of the mood and the time that this movie is a product of.There is a lot of dialogue, and a lot of it is fast-paced. This is primarily where I saw the heart and spirit of this movie come from.As much as I enjoyed this movie, and as much as I now understand why this movie is considered an all-time classic, I don't think that this is a movie for everyone.A great movie of its time that has aged very well.

"A unique film that can't be repeated, perhaps the best film of all time","Among film critics, historians, and movie buffs, ""Casablanca"" is considered one of the best films ever made. Several aspects make it unique among films of all time. These include historical situations that won't ever be repeated and other aspects that aren't likely to occur again. Indeed, the very plot and screenplay, with multiple genres, sets it apart from the pack. It's a great wartime drama with intrigue and suspense in an historical setting. It's a deep love story and human drama of anger, corruption, fear, hurt, forgiveness, sacrifice and redemption. It's a picture of underground resistance and patriotism in the face of evil forces. And, throughout, it is sprinkled with light touches of humor in just the right places.Most film reviewers and fans comment on the plot and the performances of the actors. The cast is tremendous. Few films have such a large cast with so many roles that contribute to the meat of the story. And the matches of actors to roles is perfect, from Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid in the leads, to Greenstreet, Sakall, Veidt, Lorre and Wilson heading up a huge supporting cast.The most unique aspect of this film is the makeup of that huge cast. Only four of the main roles - less than 10 percent of the speaking parts, were actors born in the U. S. (Bogart, Wilson, Page and Qualen). A few of the cast were from elsewhere in the Americas, Asia and Africa. But the vast majority were European-born. Several were from U. K. countries in the war -- England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Canada. Yet, most of them were Jewish or other refugees who had fled to the U. S. or U. K. when the Nazis came to power. Some already had film careers in other countries, and many would have long film careers in the years ahead.These included Conrad Veidt, Curt Bois, and Trudy Erline from Germany; Paul Henreid from Austria; Peter Lorre and S. Z. Sakall from Hungary; Madeleine Lebeau from France; Leonid Kinskey from Russia; and Leon Belasco from present-day Ukraine. There were many actors in uncredited roles - again most from countries torn by the war. Several were from France, England, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Greece and Syria. Others were from Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, India, Algeria, Argentina, Mexico and elsewhere.""Casablanca"" is also unique historically, just for its time, place, setting and activity. Before WW II, Casablanca was an exotic place for tourists . It was the largest seaport in North Africa on the Atlantic Coast. After France's surrender to Germany in June 1940, it became a key link in the flow of people fleeing the Nazis, especially Jewish refugees. The German Afrika Korps had moved into the Mediterranean in January 1941. It was to bolster the Italian forces in North Africa, while the French Vichy ruled in French Morocco. Casablanca was a major seaport and air link to the Americas. Those who could afford it traveled by air through Lisbon, Portugal.The time of this movie was December 1941. Nazi agents were in the city. Allied spies were there. A French resistance underground flourished. So, while the plot and characters of the movie are fictional, this film portrays the real life of Casablanca at the time.The idea for the story that led to this movie came from an American high school teacher, Murray Burnett. He and his wife vacationed in Europe in 1938. They visited Jewish relatives in Vienna who were preparing to flee ahead of the Nazi takeover of their country. They dined one night on the Riviera where a mixed crowd of French, refugees and Nazi officers were entertained by a black piano player. Back in the States, Burnett and a friend, Joann Alison wrote a play in 1940, called ""Everybody Comes to Ricks."" It was never produced but Warner Brothers learned about it and in 1942 paid the astronomical fee of $20,000 for the movie rights.The movie was filmed at the Warner Brothers studios and locales in California and Arizona, from late May to early August. After the Allied invasion of North Africa in November, the movie was rushed into production. It premiered in New York in December and was released across the U. S. and U. K. in January 1943. So, when audiences saw the film, the U. S. Army had already captured Morocco from the Vichy French and freed Casablanca on Nov 13.One can't help but wonder why Hollywood was supposedly surprised at the success of ""Casablanca."" After all, the superb wartime drama, ""Mrs. Miniver"" had topped the box office in 1942, except for the animated ""Bambi."" ""Mrs. Miniver"" won six Oscars of twelve Academy Award nominations. The following year, ""Casablanca"" won three Oscars of eight nominations, including best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay.Many other films about World War II would win Oscars in the years ahead. Perhaps the interest in wartime movies is more for the human stories and history, than for the violence and destruction. Surely, ""Casablanca"" and many other great wartime films attest to that. This is one of the first films that the Library of Congress in 1989 picked to preserve in the National Film Registry.Here' are some favorite lines from ""Casablanca.""Rick Blaine, ""I'm no good at being noble. But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.""Signor Ferrari, ""It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles.""Rick, ""And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart."" Captain Renault, ""That is my least vulnerable spot.""Captain Renault, ""Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table - one close to the ladies."" Carl, ""I have already given him the best, knowing that he is German and would taka it anyway.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
My #10 favorite film of all time,"To see Casablanca's poetry on screen is like witnessing the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Like a fine bottle of perfectly aged wine, its complexities are seemingly endless. It only gets better with time. To quote Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, this truly is the ""stuff that dreams are made of."" Easily the greatest romance ever to be produced on celluloid. Casablanca blends the genres of musicals, drama, romance, war, film noir, suspense, a little comedy, and a touch of mystery so seamlessly it is easy to forget that at its very heart and soul is a romantic picture.It pacing is almost frantic from beginning to end. The use of shadows and lighting are so vivid and fascinating that it is probably the best looking beautiful B&W film ever made. The most memorable lines in movie history and the most amount of memorable lines in movie history.I don't expect people who dislike romances to like Casablanca. Its dialogue, characters and songs have been so familiar, it hardly even seems as fresh as it should be. But like witnessing the Sistine chapel for the first time, you know what its like. But its another thing to see it completely for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I love this movie,"Great movie, great music, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great everything. Humphrey Bogart brings his tough but cool persona, Ingrid Bergman brings an elegant but fragile charm, Claude Rains steals every scene he's in with his quick wit and impeccable comedic timing, Conrad Veidt plays the antagonist beautifully and menacingly, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre provide solid support in smaller roles that show off their shadier sides. The story is just perfect, its complicated so it requires constant attention but it moves by so fast and and never lets up that it is a real joy to watch. This film never has a dull moment, it will have you laughing in one scene and in the next it will have wrenched your heart out. Its shot in a romantic but noir type style that is impossible to take your eyes off of. The music is so moody and romantic it fits the music perfectly and it comes in at all the right moments, never taking away from a scene. The acting never goes over the top or anything, it just stays perfect. The person who I think sticks out the most and embodies the feel of this film would have to be Claude Rains. In one moment he can be so riotously funny and in the next he's as serious as he can be, just like the pace of the film. This really is the perfect movie and I strongly urge anyone who has not seen it to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The loser who calls his shots!,"I watched a series of Humphrey Bogart movies within a span of two days: To Have and Not Have, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, and, Dark Passage. While the first two movies have lots of similarities, I rate Casablanca to be better. (Of course, I'm totally fascinated by the face of Lauren Bacall; but yet the role of Ingrid Bergman was more firmly planted.). My main reason for liking Casablanca over To Have... is that, in Casablanca, Bogart is a defeated man, a man running away from himself, a man who would put his ""neck out for nobody"" (mainly because he's too scared to be hurt again; or in other words, his past experiences have left him synical.)...but yet he has full control over his faculties...to such an extent that when circumstances put everything at his feet, he can see through it and can decide that the victory that is waiting there to garland him won't be his triumph, but rather another, a greater defeat. And then he decides the most logical, rationale course of action that transforms him into the winner we all would like to be, and allows him to come to terms with himself.This movie deserves a place in the wish-list of every movie lover; and once it's watched, I'm sure, it would naturally be in the list of one's all-time favorite movies.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Absolute must-see!,"To my shame, I never saw Casablanca until a new print became available in London four or five years ago. I confessed this to my girl-friend (now wife) on the way out and she told me she had never seen it either. In all the cinemas in all the world .......! Casablanca always makes me recall the story of the guy who said he didn't rate Shakespeare ""because it's full of quotes"". So many of the lines have been used in subsequent novels, plays, films that they have passed into the language.

Review of Casablanca,"Casablanca is a persuasive pro-American film. It's fictional yet accurately portrays events that took place during world War II. The film has a large political influence, even Rick's character represents America's isolation from the war. The film is beautifully written and shot. Music plays a huge part in the film. It emphasizes the setting and feel of the film. As the mood of the characters change, so does the music. Even when the French sing their national anthem this adds so much to the film, and it becomes even more clear how passionate the French are about their country. The accents of the actors add to the mise-en scene, as well as the lighting in many of the scenes, such as the lighting in the restaurant, when everything is dim, the candles on the table are the only form of light, creating a certain mood. The movie is very fast paced, you can't look away for a moment or get out of your chair for a snack. There's always some new twist. Casablanca is a thrilling film to watch, and one that really lives up to it's expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Movie Review: Casablanca,"Casablanca's is an old WWll movie that puts forth an interesting premise and that forces our main character Rick to choose between two things, the women that he loves, or to help her and her husband escape the country because he is a famed rebel and wanted by the germans. With a plot like this it can really suck you into this story and really see how these characters interact with each and the world around them. The World War ll setting really gives this sense of urgency, that places our main characters on a time limit and they must figure out what they are going to do very quickly. And as someone who likes history I can really appreciate the World War ll setting and this movie, even though I am not a big fan of the romance aspect. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes history around the World War ll era, or even to people that like a drama filled romance movie with a gripping plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Simply the best,"""Here's looking at you, kid"", what can one say about a movie proclaimed to be the best ever? Of course, the film's cast is outstanding! Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, and John Qualen.This Best Picture Oscar winner actually should have competed with Mrs. Miniver in 1942 since it premiered in New York in November of that year. However, it didn't play in Los Angeles until its general release that January, so it competed in 1943.Michael Curtiz finally won a Best Director Oscar on his fifth try and was never nominated again despite directing many quality films over nineteen more years; the film also won an Oscar for Writing. The great scenes between Bogart and Rains also earned them Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations.Bogart is Rick, the nightclub owner in the titled town which served as the exit point for those fleeing Europe with the onset of World War II. He used to work as a gun runner but, after a failed love affair in Paris, is now somewhat detached from the world around him. That all changes when his former lover Ilsa (Bergman) arrives with husband (Henreid), who's the leader of the Resistance (Henreid). They need exit Visas, which Rick just happens to be holding for another (Lorre) that killed for them. He struggles with his emotions as he tries to decide whether to help them escape, which would mean outmaneuvering a German Major (Veidt) and the local French police captain (Rains). Greenstreet plays a rival cafe proprietor that wants to hire Rick's piano player (Dooley Wilson), who plays ""As Time Goes By"", which reminds Rick of Ilsa and Paris. Sakall plays a waiter in Rick's employ. The movie's classic ending features unforgettable dialogue!It was added to the National Film Registry in 1989. #1 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #2 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list; Bogart's Rick is AFI's #4 hero. #37 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list.

Best movie EVER,"This is simply the finest movie ever made. EVER. The plot is perfect. The cast is sublime. The ending is fantastic. The performances by Bogart and Bergman are their best work.

The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world. Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By. The evil German's are perfectly evil. The dueling national anthems are timeless. The corrupt French Captain is perfect in a corrupt nether world like war time Casablanca. The relationship between a young star struck Elsa in learning to love her underground hero husband. her pain at learning of his death. Her finding love in a new man - Bogey. And her distress at learning her husband was still alive and needed her. It all made up for the pain felt by Bogey at being left in the rain at the train station with her dear John letter dripping away.

The best - where are the rest?,"I must have seen this film twenty times; I guess I know the script by heart; every scene, every camera movement is anticipated with pleasure and never disappoints. What kind of magic was worked during this film can only be guessed at. Some unique synergy took place on that Hollywood lot that has never happened since. An ensemble cast that could never be reassembled; craft masters and artisans at the peak of their skill; a world situation of uncertainty and worry, infecting the set with its tension and clarities. Somehow it all gelled; Rick, the world weary warrior; Ilsa, the luminous and virtuous beauty; a cracking script, awesome cinematography, laser edge editing and direction, and That Song.How do you define the greatest film ever made? The ability to watch it again and again without ever becoming sated? The continued discovery of new things to enjoy? The comfort of knowing that what you are about to see is just as good as it gets? The fact that the gulf between films like this and most of the dross turned out today just gets wider? The perfect mise en scene? I don't know.

Play it Over & Over Again Warner Brothers ****,"""Casablanca,"" a memorable 1943 film,received the Oscar for best picture. In those years, the academy nominated 10 films. That practice would end the following year when only 5 films would receive nominations. While my favorite for 1943 was ""For Whom the Bell Tolls, I have to admit that ""Casablanca"" is a film classic which will survive throughout time to come.Humphrey Bogart was phenomenal in the role of Rick, the casino owner who finds his love Elsa, so well portrayed by Ingrid Bergman. Problem is that Elsa has married Paul Henreid, who gives another excellent performance in the tradition of ""Now, Voyager,"" which was the year before.Claude Rains is just great as the police official who knows that Rick is right in a setting with a pro-Nazi government.Who can forget the lines- PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, HERE'S TO YOU KID, LOUIE, IT'S THE START OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP, ROUND UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Made during World War 11, the film evoked much sympathy from its audiences. An oddity in the Oscar voting was while the picture and director won, Bogart and Claude Rains, the latter in a supporting role, both lost the coveted Oscar to Paul Lukas and Charles Coburn respectively. Bergman was not nominated here but did snag a nomination that year for ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""Casablanca has always been a sight for intrigue in motion pictures.

One of the greatest wartime love stories,"A ten score if there ever was one! It is difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said about this classic. Humphrey Bogart was in his early forties when CASABLANCA was made, but this kind of romance is ageless. Ingrid Bergman couldn't have been more attractive.No man could have been more love smitten than Rick, and he finds solace in the bottle and the ballad, AS TIME GOES BY. This movie and that song are inseparably intertwined to many viewers.Claude Rains heads a fine supporting cast. As Captain Renault, he walks a fine line between disrespect and reluctant obedience in dealing with the Nazis. His whimsy and humor are just a pleasure. Paul Henried is quite subdued in comparison.Many of the one liners are well known. One of my favorites is, "" He's like all men, only more so."" Figure that one out. At the very end, ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" leaves you with a warm, positive feeling.Oh, I have some trivial comments about CASABLANCA. Nobody is ever seen eating in the CAFE AMERICAINE. Perhaps all the action took place after 10 pm.There never was a more desolate airport in the final scene. Only one airplane and not a single person around. Neither do Rick and the captain seem in any particular hurry in leaving, after Strasser was shot. Surely the Nazis would soon be in hot pursuit.Do they make them like this anymore? I don't think so. This is one that no one should miss, young or old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Quite Excellent,"By the time I finally got around to watching Casablanca, only a few days before watching it again in one of my classes, I had already known so much about the movie, hearing it quoted millions of times, knowing the whole plot, and even what happens in the end, that I didn't even want to watch it anymore. But when it was on TV, I felt compelled to, and even though I was watching it a few days later, I am definitely glad that I did. The story is absolutely timeless, and it is something that could even happen nowadays. Bogart's Rick is still in love with Bergman's married Ilsa, who has come to Casablanca with her husband (Laszlo) so they they can escape to America, and away from the Nazi's who are after Laszlo. Throughout this time, Rick is torn between whether or not to help them escape, while wanting Ilsa all to himself. Bergman and Bogart both display such amazing acting skills, making the viewer really feel that they are in love. You can see Ilsa being torn between Laszlo and Rick and not knowing what to do as much as Rick doesn't know what to do. Aside from the story, the setting is really quite beautiful as well.

Rick is a character that exudes leadership and it shows by how much his staff at Rick's respect and love him so very much. They seem so genuine and that feeling of love rubs off on you and suddenly you find yourself loving and respecting Rick as well. It's these types of emotions that make this movie so powerful. The music is another element of the movie that stirs up your emotions from the scene at Rick's where Laszlo is singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's 'Vive La France!...just so very inspiring.

From the first entrance into Rick's café (expertly done through the use of a moving camera) you are drawn into a world of intrigue, love, lust for power, desperation and hope that was North Africa in the WWII era. The black & white photography allows the director to create and use shadows to set mood and tension.

Here's lookin' at you kid...,"With a classic that mirrors a time period as well as Casablanca does, it really sets a standard as to what a romance drama should be, as well as a pretty tough movie for others to follow.  The dramatic story line of two lovers torn between uncontrollable circumstances is a touching one indeed, but instead of focusing on the obvious attention grabber, the love story, director Michael Curtiz added other elements to this movie such as current events to make for a movie that the audience could relate to better, and get a better perspective for what was happening in the world around them.Set in a little town in Morocco during WW11, Casablanca was a town for refugees to flee to  while in search of  exit visas in order to gain a new life.  Even with the fictional story, the history is true, which is something that audiences could watch and learn more about during a time when so much  chaos was about.  Not only that, but audiences today can watch Casablanca and get an idea of what people went through only a few decades ago.Along with the history, the characters in this movie add a whole other element which makes it unforgettable.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are one dynamic duo.  The chemistry between them is so intense, that one could only guess that the two were actually together.  Also, Bogart's tough guy persona keeps the audience guessing, one never knows exactly how he'll react to the situations he faces throughout the movie because the whole time he is battling a decision to do what he wants, or to do what's right.All in all, this was an incredible movie.  From the history to the characters, everything was great.

But I didn't believe that this couple actually loved each other, or whatever it is they felt for each other. I realize that the reason that this movie seems so basic to me is because all other movies with this kind of plot have built upon this one, but usually being more fleshed out is a good thing. My mother, both my grandmothers, and my one great grandmother all expected me to cry watching this movie, but the tears didn't even threaten to spill over. I did enjoy this movie though, a lot. It looked amazing! With the lighting, the smoke, and the story overall were all really good!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Yeah, it actually is that good","I am usually skeptical of older films. Are they relevant, do they still feel fresh, will they connect with this 20-year-old generation-Y'er? Many, even ""the classics"" do not--""42nd Street,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" among others--feel dated, out of touch, irrelevant to my life. Yet ""Casablanca"" is different. There's something deeply human and personal about the story of Rick and Ilsa, and though even the most cynical viewer may be skeptical at first, one glance at Ingrid Bergman's downy and soulful eyes will dispel any doubts. Everything about this film is pretty much perfect--the script is THE Hollywood script, it is tightly paced and brilliantly plotted. Overall, a true classic that withstands the test of time. Also, makes a great drinking game--you take a shot every time they take one. You'll be on the floor, I swear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Simply special,"Casablanca is quite simply one of the most enjoyable films you are likely to see, for so many reasons. It is a film has just about everything you could want, with great romance, suspense and drama. The acting is superb from all those involved, though the absolute cool of Humphrey Bogart and the sheer beauty of Ingmar Bergman working together is probably a highlight.But more then anything, it is the incredible script that really needs to be mentioned. I have yet to see a film that can maintain the level of satisfaction from the barrage of instantly classic one-liners that's offered here, and there is such a wide variety of fantastic characters that make this such a gem.If you want to see a 40's film that really shows the quality of the work during that time, then Casablanca is the perfect place to start.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Is that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?""","Described by Andrew Sarris as ""the most decisive exception to the auteur theory"", I find 'Casablanca' enormously satisfying, Michael Curtiz's name having appearing on so many more timeless classics than any esteemed occupier of the Pantheon.The film even won Curtiz an Oscar, the Academy being most remiss in neglecting to bestow a statuette upon Claude Rains, who as usual gives the film's best performance.The presence in small parts of the stars of 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari', 'M' and 'La Regle du Jeu' demonstrates just how awash with talent Hollywood then was; while a special award should have gone to Adolf Hitler, whose unintended largesse made this all possible.Not all involved had English as their first language, but with images like a man gunned down in front of a poster of Marshal Petain who needs words?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the greatest,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It transcends time.  The script is just pure poetry.  Sure, some of the supporting actors are a little stiff but Bogart and Bergman have a chemistry that has never been captured on screen again.  The ending is the best 15 minutes of film ever. Anyway, can't say enough for this movie. Chris",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A women needs her ex lovers help to escape from Germany,"The movie was shot in black and white and mostly took place in a night club. The lighting made good use of shadows to make it actually look and feel like a crowded, smoky night club. The film's lead (Humphrey Bogart) does an incredible job of playing a kind of mysterious, hard to crack his shell, kind of protagonist. However, I feel the films hype may have lessened the impact of it for me. I liked it and enjoyed myself overall, however, I found myself bored at times as it was mostly the same location. Something about stagnancy of location makes the plot also feel stagnant to me as well. Though, like I said, still an awesome plot and great performances all around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A timeless classic and one of the great films of all time.,"Shot as just another film in the days when Hollywood was pumping out movies like an assembly line.  Indeed, the film is not shot as an epic with sweeping scenes of battles or with elaborate sets or special effects.  So why all the fuss?This film has grown in stature because of the brilliant acting of the two lead characters, the remarkably witty and clever dialogue, and the war-torn romance that is the heart of the picture.  In other words, it is an actor-driven film with a terrific script and a story about love, war, and politics, i.e., a formula for a masterpiece.Put simply, Ingrid Bergman is electric in this film.  She is stunningly beautiful and turns in a remarkable performance as the brave and sensual Ilsa.  Her facial expressions alone convey more than most actresses can do with monologues.  She convincingly plays a young women torn between her ideals and affection for her husband-mentor and her passion for Rick, the one true love of her life.Not to be outdone, Bogart's performance is probably the strongest of his career.  He simultaneously manages to play a self-absorbed sulking saloon keeper, passionate lover, and sentimental patriot.  Rick is a complex and deep character, deeply wounded by Ilsa's choice to leave him at a train station in Paris to tend to her once forsaken husband.On top of this passionate romance, the film is paced by its political subplot, which is all the more interesting since it was filmed during World War II.  The script deftly weaves jabs at the Nazis and packs political themes throughout.  Moreover, the superb script conveys complex character interactions and messages without hitting the viewer over the head with explanation or narration.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the underlying negotiating between Captain Renault and Rick on a variety of topics throughout the film.Bolstering the performances of Bogart and Bergman is the heady acting of Henreid and Rains.  Indeed, Rains' performance as Captain Renault is one of the great buddy-womanizer roles of all-time.  He is simultaneously charming and without conviction.  Henreid delivers a terrific performances as the political icon Victor Laszlo.  He is both dashing and courageous without ever trying to overshadow Bogart.This is a great film that gets better each time you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Here's Lookin' at You Kid,"I don't know that it's possible for a 19 year old kid to say anything new about this movie. Is it a classic? Ehhh, maybe but probably not since i'm going to have a hard time stretching this review out to 10 lines. Luckily, Bogart's performance gives me something to talk about because, as always, his acting is captivating. Without he and Bergman this film would fall flat. The romance is pretty cheesy and formulaic. Plug in any attractive blonde and she could play Ilsa and any big brute of a man could play Laszlo. Hell, the fact that Peter Lorre's character was more interesting than Laszlo speaks volumes to the nature of this film. It's a good movie without a doubt but i just don't get the common tag of greatest film of all time. The only thing really stopping me from giving this movie lower than a 7 is Bogart. He just draws you in as an actor and i can't remember the last bad film i watched with him in it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Mesmerising,"The true value of a movie is measured by its ability to overcome generation gaps, time, and trends and still remain a true winner.  Casablanca is one of the very few movies that have succeeded in doing so.  Why that is so is a great mystery.

All one can say is that watching this movie over and over again makes us feel good!!!  Need one say more?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Intoxicating, magical, exhilarating","It is difficult to describe how much I like and appreciate Michael Curtiz' Casablanca, one of my favorite films, and one of the greatest ever. Every single aspect of the film is great: story, dialogue, cinematography, acting, music. If you have not seen it, you must. Luckily, millions of people admire the movie as much as I do and have provided all kinds of insight into why we like it so much, so I will dare to add only a few brief thoughts. Casablanca touches hugely important themes (love, duty, freedom, sacrifice, war, the fate of nations) but through a few individuals dealing with simple and urgent needs. It was a medium-budget propaganda piece and ended up as the most subtle and effective movie ever in the propaganda genre. It started life as an ordinary film project, a great example of how a masterpiece can be created when no one expects it. And it is one of the very few films that I can re-watch frequently. The last viewing is as riveting and thrilling as was the first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Rick is the essence of cool,"Stars, story, emotion, one-liners, music, acting--it's all there. This is one of the best movies of all time and a must see.

simply great,"Casablanca, the `All-American' film.  Here is the story of two accidental lovers, a classic story line of any movie.  Thinking of a love story you think simple sappy love, yet Casablanca is no where near simple, nor sappy.Being made in 1942, this film isn't your everyday movie with sex, alcohol and more sex.  It actually contains a thing called (GASP!) dialogue to reveal how a character is feeling or to explain a situation. And yes, this does get quite long at times, causing any viewer to become quite confused and on the verge of sleeping.  Taking this into consideration, a younger viewer would not appreciate this movie as much as an older viewer would.Getting used to the ambiance of the movie is the hardest part.  After that, you may find yourself at the edge of your seat wanting to know more and more of what happened to this couple, Rick and Ilsa.  Rick, a `tough, New York American,' isn't the type of guy that would come off as sympathetic or capable of love.  Yet, as the movie progresses, you realize that he was once a lot happier and certain events have hardened his heart.  Ilsa happened to come into his life at the wrong time, causing her to choose between Rick and, we later find out, her husband.  The movie goes on and, once again, in Casablanca, Rick and Ilsa are reunited. 	Other than just a love story, people don't really realize that this was also about the political issues going on in 1942, causing people to be able to relate more to the movie then than anyone would be able to now.Being loved for the past 62 years, this movie is an amazing classic.  A great movie for anyone to enjoy and love.  I would give this a 9/10 because it is simply great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

a great classic film,"Love, passion, corruption, lies and murder are only a few things that are contained in Casablanca's story line. Made in 1942 it remains a great film that people still talk about today. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man bitter about love, and doesn't stick his neck out for no one. He lives in the city of Casablanca in Morocco and owns his own American café which is more like a saloon than a good place to sip coffee. A long love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) revisits Rick unexpectedly and leads to a lengthy flash back to better days in France.As the Germans are trying to take over the world during WWII people flee to Casablanca to try and get to America for a free and safe life. The plot speeds up as a customer of Rick's asks him to hold on to papers that will lead anyone out of Casablanca and into America with no questions asked. When the man gets killed by the corrupt police, Rick is stuck with something he doesn't want and does not know what to do with it.Casablanca is one of the most emotional movies the viewer will ever see, from love and lust to murder and deception you're always on the edge for your seat and wanting to know more.The actors could not have done better. Humphrey Bogart's detached emotion adds a lot of comedy to the film, but when he loosens up sentimentally you can't help but to cheer. Ingrid Bergman is a great actress who can love you one second then pretend to hate you the next. Claude Rains who plays Capt. Louis Renault is a man who gets what he wants when he wants it even if it costs other peoples lives, but some his cold heart unthaws.The dialog in the film is lengthy and somewhat confusing at points, but normal for those classic films that try to be sophisticated.Casablanca is a film to watch over and over again without it getting old or boring, and can still connect to its audience 60 years later. So here's looking at you kid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Classic Love story,"Not truly a fan of Love stories like these, very dramatic and for me that can get kind of annoying after a while, personally I felt like it dragged on for a little to long. Though I can see why so many people fell for i, trust me if I would have been more into romantic stories I would have fallen for this one and possibly even called a favorite, the story was really well written with a lovely twist at the end that would make any girl swoon.There was lovely use of Lighting, like really good, with showing both characters and their emotions by the darkness, the lightness, the different shapes the lights took on the characters, all of it was so well put together it definitely helped make the movie.

I believe the feelings of a woman in love are so wonderfully said in one sentence. Repeating all those statements will be boring here. The high voters will know them all.

Casablanca - 1942,"This is truly one of the greatest classics of film. The story is non-stop and keeps you intrigued up until they very iconic ending. The film itself has quite the unique atmosphere, where every character knows everybody else's business. Despite this, every major character is trying to figure out what the others are going to do. The chemistry of all the major characters is amazing, and the performances from Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart are incredible. I love that we don't truly know what Rick is going to do until the very end of the film, but you also kind of knew all along that he would do the right thing. This is truly a master class in story telling and I would recommend that everybody watches this film at least once, even if just for the ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
People Are Right,"I've heard Casablanca talked about as a classic for years, but hadn't gotten the opportunity to see it until now. Boy am I glad I did! Although I'm not one of those people that feels Casablanca is the best film ever made, it is enjoyable. The quality I liked most about this film was its ability to suck me in, although I must admit there where parts where I got lost a little bit.There's a lot going on this movie, World War 2, the running of his club, double crossing, and of course you cant forget the ultimate love story. for being a movie thats older, well not from my generation,i didn't find the dialog to be overly cheesy.The ending of this movie is pretty awesome.I like that you think you know whats going to happen but you don't, (at the airport situation, who gets blame etc).There's also some great cinematography in Casablanca. The use of lighting to set up shots for the camera is magnificent. They also tend to focus on a searchlight in the movie as well.The actors in Casablanca are just magnificent, they really add a certain well, realistic element, for lack of a better term. Humphrey Bogart is enjoyable as usual. I've only seen a few of his films, but this is my favorite by far. He does such a good job of keeping his character in line, invulnerable and cold at times, but heartfelt at others. now i can really understand the line ""of all the jin joints in all the world.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Masterpiece,"A great movie, perfect in its dialogue, staging, casting, performance, and scoring, with a well-structured script that veers deftly between sentiment and logic. To say that the Oscar-winning script is brilliant is to underestimate it. The dramatic camera movements of Michael Curtiz are never put to better use than they are here. I'm very concerned however by the remarks of Ben Mankiewicz and Eddie Muller, which may be heard by young people watching this movie on TCM in the future and which may color their appraisals: the Letters of Transit are important. Nazi Germany did not exist in a vacuum. As historian Richard Overy, among others, has pointed out, the outcome of the war was not a certainty when this picture was made. Germany had important allies (Italy and Japan) and friends (Rumania, Spain, Portugal, and official France). Certainly, Hitler violated major agreements with Chamberlain and Molotov, but Germany could not casually violate ALL agreements with ALL countries ALL the time. It would be more important to respect Vichy than to keep Victor Laszlo in Casablanca. (Throughout, Conrad Veidt turns to Claude Rains for affirmation.) Mankiewicz and Muller make a living by talking and seem inclined to give more credit to the oratory of Victor Laszlo than it deserves. Wars are not won by oratory, but by logistics. The war was not won by inspiring words from FDR and Churchill or by the Resistance; it was won by the lives of tens of millions of people, nearly all Soviets, whose sentiments may have been articulated by Laszlo, but whether or not he escapes Casablanca is not determinative of anything. ""Casablanca"" is a good example of realism in drama, but not necessarily in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
HISR American Cinema,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, not unlike the 95% of the population that has seen it and claimed it arguably one of the best films ever made (along with ""Citizen Kane"", of course, and maybe some others).

Yes, this movie is one of the best love stories ever filmed, along with some of the best actors doing their best acting, beautiful lighting, camera techniques and loaded with heavy moments and metaphor.I would have to say that every aspect of this movie reached my expectations. But the most enjoyable part for me was getting to observe all of the famous phrases, which I have heard many times throughout my life but not known their origin, in their correct context. On numerous occasions I have seen my grandfather raise his glass, after saying grace before dinner, and say, ""Here's to looking at you kid"" and then chuckle to himself. I never new what he was quoting (I never usually do) so it was so great to discover (after twenty years of hearing it) that it was Humphrey Bogart my papa was in fact quoting.

"""Everybody goes to Rick's""","I'd seen ""Casablanca"" many times before taking Robert McKee's ""Story Structure"" workshop several years ago. His artful dissection of the film--the centerpiece of his presentation--served only to increase my admiration for its many levels of significance. Its narrative design, its psychological subtlety, and its effectiveness as propaganda early in World War II make this a film that offers new insights with each new viewing. Like great literature, its richness remains superlative but never superfluous, and its economy of expression articulate, not taciturn. When I occasionally teach scenes from the film in theater and literature classes, students often note how even very minor characters with only a few lines achieve a presence that exceeds their roles.

People-driven masterclass.,"It's not easy to talk about 'Casablanca'. One of the most praised, critically acclaimed movies ever made has to be good. Most movies like this are good. But -and this is a big but, these 102 minutes were not just that.Michael Curtiz's magnum opus carries one the deepest and heaviest larger-than-life feelings of any movie. It is ominous, witty, compelling -even tragic. Everything is built atop people. No epic, no gargantuan task, just people.I don't think it ever was supposed to be this profound tale about human mistakes, and that freedom allowed it to be a somewhat unexpected dive into life, love and friendship.

Truly one of the more memorable romantic movies of all time.,"CasablancaCasablanca is one of the few remaining parts of an unoccupied France, still the german are around there. Casablanca is also one of the few places where it is possible to get free of charge to American, the free country during the war. Rick's Cafe is the coolest place in town. One day a known Czech underground leader arrives with his beautiful wife, Ilsa, to whom Rick once had a short but wonderful affair in Paris.Finally! Finally, i had the chance to view one of the most famous movies in the history, Casablanca. Some may say it's a mother to all future romantic movie, and there are indeed many things in the movie that have been copied one way or the other, but that is mainly because this movie seems to have written a small manual for how to make an interesting love drama. I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman. Ingrid Bergman played a fine role too, although i disliked her false tears, they didn't look very convincing to me.To sum it all up a bit. There is no doubt this one of the greatest romantic movies of the history, and it is the work of a perfectionist, every single detail seem to be thought through, and the movie works fantastically well and has very few flaws. The movie has aged perfectly, I think one of the main reasons to this is that there are barely any use of special effects in the movie, something that is very easy to spot now a days, but this movie can be watched without problems, even now a days. If i had to point a negative side out, which I have to do naturally, the movie didn't make me cry and really feel with my heart as I was hoping for, the movie is good no doubt, but i never really fell in love with the characters. Something that i think is necesarry for a romantic movie to succed to a top grade, but there is no doubt anyway, if i get the chance, then I will watch this movie again.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Classic Romance,"This movie, for it's time, is shot in a wonderfully way. The black and white of the movie I think adds to a classical effect. If the movie was in normal color, I don't believe that it would have had the effect that it did.The sound especially helped set the mood for the movie. The movie took place during the Occupation of Europe and during that time there was a lot music. Music is what kept people going.The music helped the emotions show through the characters. It was a story that many people could relate to if they were ever in a relationship.Overall I would recommend this because all the camera angles, transitions, sound, color, plot and characters made the movie interesting.

First off these people are wealthy refugees, it is hard to sympathize with these characters while millions of people are being killed in Nazi concentration camps. Secondly, there is no representation for the Moroccan people, the story takes place in Morocco, but everyone hates it there and they can't wait to leave. Not to mention the French colonialism overshadowing everything about Moroccan culture. Thirdly, a lot of sexism in the way Rick speaks to Elsa. Lastly, the portrayal of Sam as the ""minstrel show""-style piano playing is hard to watch.Many people will spend their time and energy to defend this film and dispute my review, but I stand by my words.

More than the sum of its parts...,"CASABLANCA of course needs no introduction, being hailed by many as one of the finest movies ever made, albeit accidentally. I have to say it's been many years since I watched it and I'd forgotten just how good it is. The dialogue is slick, witty and economical and has rightly, with allegedly a little rephrasing from Bogart, spawned some of the most quoted lines in movie history. I lost count of the number of frivolously double-edged and charmingly barbed lines delivered by Rains' Capt. Renault, to whom everyone is a target at the beginning of the movie, almost as if he were unsure of exactly whose side he was on, which is most likely the case as the script was constantly being re-doctored and changed during filming. Even Bergman, who was already preoccupied with the prospect of her next film, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, had to ask which guy she was meant to be in love with. With the typical ambiguity evident in the rest of the production, she was told to 'play it down the middle'. In fact none of the actors had any more idea of how the whole thing was going to end than the audience did on first viewing.Everything that makes CASABLANCA a great film seems to have been by happy accident. Originally cast in the three lead roles were Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan. Doesn't bear thinking about does it? Thankfully they were unavailable. The now classic 'As Time Goes By' was an established hit that was specified in the original play, but score composer Max Steiner (KING KONG, GONE WITH THE WIND) tried hard to have it replaced by one of his own compositions. Bergman however had by this time had her hair cropped for FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, which made it impossible to reshoot the necessary scenes (at least that's what they told Steiner). As it is, as the NFT said in 1974, 'the sum of all its many marvelous parts far exceeds the whole'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A kiss is still a kiss... a sigh may be just a sigh, but MUSIC MAKES THIS FILM A FILM THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY","For a film that is so highly spoken of I never really was too eager to see it. I suppose it's because of what some would term as ""hype"" others would term as ""overkill."" But some would term it as ""tribute."" Anyway, I didn't feel like it was a must-see. I THOUGHT I knew the story. I didn't. I THOUGHT I knew the lines, I did, I THOUGHT I knew the music, and I did, but only when I see this movie over and over do I begin to appreciate Bergman's acting, Bogie's finesse, and Steiner's music. Ever since I saw ""Carrotblanca,"" I remembered that I should really try to see this one. So at the first opportunity, I bought it, watched it that very night, and unlike Doctor Zhivago, this one actually kept me entertained and sympathized with the characters.

A Timeless Classic,"Casablanca is one of the best films ever made! No matter who you are, seeing this film won't let you down.

It still dwells: The romance of the century...,"Casablanca is a favorite movie for me and many other people for good reasons. It had been awarded numerous Oscar Academy Awards and nominations which bring up its value. It is a special love story that is rare in modern times, where love is ready to be sacrificed for greater things in a world that hasn't changed much - Where money still makes the laws. Love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles, you could really feel this tense atmosphere in the movie.The actors who made this film a success had tremendously superb screenplay, leaving us with some memorable and touching lines such as ""Round up the usual suspects"" and ""We'll always have Paris"", it made me feel sad with these words and the emotions on Ilsa and Rick's face.Another thing you must pay attention to is the movie song ""As time goes by"", I loved the way they used the song whenever they could throughout the whole movie, and when Sam played the song, the expressions on Ingrid Berman and Humphrey Bogart's faces showed the sadness and struggle of their memories together through that song. It was also so relieved to see that Rick's Cafe had so many connections and Rick was quite kind in some situations such as helping the young Bulgarian couple. The influence of people, money and the will of leaving Casablanca was so strongly demonstrated in the Cafe.I deeply ensure that this movie will last as time goes by for generations to view: We'll always have Casablanca...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Movies like Casablance pertain to what was going on in the world at the time. It is one thing to just entertain, but quality entertainment is the best. Casablanca had a great cast and Bogurt absolutely made the movie. He gave Americans a tough guy look back in the 40's when this was released. He had a good sense for what was authentic and what was phooey. He also did a good job portraying what heartbreak is like for men. The way he tricked everyone but in the end saved the say for everyone and made some characters realize what they should represent.

Mostly very good but the romance robs the intrigue...,"While the love story between Rick/Ilsa is rather well done I feel that the amount of space it takes up is too much. Specifically there are two scenes early on that allow Rick to get the letters of travel and Victor to know of their location. Both scenes have to hang a lantern on the character motivations to make them believable. Unfortunately in retrospect it is rather obvious what the screenwriters ended up doing to get the plot to work. It makes the entire film feel a bit off.Similarly, while the love story is engaging, and this might be a consequence of the film's influence, it is no where near as engaging as the political intrigue. The film is at its best when the political context is at the forefront, such as the dueling national songs scenes. I was far more interested in how Rick and Renault navigate the German demands. The spy stuff is just better polished.It could be because I think Renault is easily the best part of this film. Rains is a delightfully self-aware cynic and there is a dark joy to that character. I wish the screenplay spent more time on him.Nonetheless this is a fine film and a classic of Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Casablanca - World War Two through Hollywood's eyes,"In the 1940's, Hollywood didn't have it good. The war had already started, the Hays code was in full application, and something was needed to combine the two; a romance story without too many suggestive scenes that would emphasize the need to be patriotic in difficult times. There came ""Casablanca"" and did exactly that, to critical and commercial acclaim.As an avid cinephile, I had heard of this film before but had never decided to watch it. The reason I did rested solely on its reputation. And concerning this, I was not surprised. I understand why it found such success when it came out; it's an appealing story: The main protagonist, Rick, (Humphrey Bogart), an individualistic, cynical café owner, lives in Casablanca during the Second World War. He doesn't want to sacrifice himself for the greater good, and so always stays neutral in matters of politics. It is in this moment that his former lover (Ingrid Bergman) comes into his café, accompanied by her husband, a member of the Resistance. The two heroes now face a dilemma; risk their love in order to help Bergman's husband, or live their relationship while ignoring the morally correct choice of resisting to Naziism? For the American viewer of the time, this would have seemed a difficult choice to make. People also had families back then, loves, friendships. But the movie make its line clear: Rick leaves his lover go with her husband to America, so as to continue their fight against the evil enemy. His individualism is gone, replaced by patriotism. This is the moment where morality prevails over personal interest and everything comes into place. Or, so shows the film.The reason while ""Casablanca"" is regarded as a classic isn't only its plot, but also its performances. And these were convincing, but up to a point. Bogart was great as the cold, indifferent-to-everything Rick, while Bergman provided a good contrast as the sensitive and romantic heroine. Their romance still remains, along with Vivienne Leigh's and Clark Gable's one, the most famous one in the history of classic Hollywood cinema. It is, indeed, true, that they portrayed it with passion, but for me, it lacked spontaneity, the acting style of the time being too restrictive in order to allow for more emotion to be shown.The direction didn't leave any particular impression to me. Michael Curtis did a good job, but aesthetically, his shots were too long, and the way he showed his heroes'struggles seemed too artificial. Of course, this may just stem from the fact that I am neither accustomed to, nor passionate for classic cinema techniques.What was interesting to me in this movie was neither the performances, nor the direction. It was the context. At the time, as mentioned above, Americans were in need of films that exhibited the need for action against Germany, and later, Japan. Having been in a period of isolation from the rest of the world for almost two decades, the US were not ready to deal with the threat of world war, and they also didn't want, since they wanted to have no relation to to Europe's problems. When their turn came to take action, the cinema provided role models to ordinary citizens, who are expected to follow them, and exhibit the same sense of duty and bravery as they did. It is no wonder then, that Casablanca resonated so deeply with viewers of the time.Another film that did that was ""Mrs. Miniver"", starring Grere Garson, a movie about a woman who protects her family from the horrors of the war, hiding with her children on the Subway during bombings, motivating them, and generally giving some light to these dark times. This film, along with ""Casablanca"" is regarded as the one that galvanized Americans against the Nazis, and essentially won many citizens' support for America's entrance into the war.For all that, ""Casablanca"" remains for me a movie that was pleasing, but not as appealing as others have found it. While I recognize its significance for film history, and praise it for that, it would be dishonest of me not to write that I personally found it just fine aesthetically. Classic Hollywood surely has a lot to offer, but I will wait until I find the right movie, one that will resonate with me as much as Rick was moved by his lover's cause, and, ultimately, let her go, marking the end of a film like so many others, and at the same time, like no other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Movie that inspired Casablanca,"If you can deal with Sub-titles (sous titres in French) then but or rent Pepé le Moko. Algerian based movie that inspired Hollywood's Casablanca. Before the Germans took France, the French cinema was the best in the world according to some critics. Watch the 1937 Pepe le Moko and see the similarities with this 1942 film. They are both jewels! The plot of having French occupied, colonized French in Algiers, working against/with the underground, Mafia types is an interesting parallel.

Casablanca,"To the director Curtiz you did an amazing job on this film Casablanca. The story written is just unique and i absolutely enjoyed the film. i like all the turns in the film, have you thinking one thing and then before you know it something else happens that catches you off guard. i do a good job of seeing how films are going to turn out but with this one i couldn't. the storytelling was off the charts, the rising action and climax. the actors did a really good job as well, i just loved everything about this film. it was a true story that could really happen to anyone. i liked how you used the WWII with it too. this film relates to me in a way that i understand. its hard trusting people, you cant jump to conclusions. i learned that in this film, it really stood out to me because Rick had all the right in the world to feel what he felt about Ilsa. Ilsa had no excuse and i was agreeing with Rick. but after she told the story about what happened and why she wasn't on the train it made a lot of sense, and i understand why. man once again i just commend you on this film. you turned a negative into a positive, I'm sure people loved watching this to take their mind off the current situation that was going on. smart move. this was all about sacrifice and you will do dang near anything for the people you love. i really respect Rick for what he did, at first he was all about himself but at the end of the movie saved a lot of people. he was considerate of not only himself but of other people as well.

Best Romance ever,"Bogart and Bergman should be the standard by how all romances on film are judged.  Casablanca shows them at those heady early days of a romance, the tragic separation, the awkward second encounter, and the compelling story of how they resolve those feelings still inside.Henreid should not be forgotten.  His style sets up an interesting contrast to the more gruff Bogart.Rains gives a little comic relief to the film, and also contributes a great deal to the other side of this story: the onset of WWII.  His uncertainty of how much to follow Germany, and whether or not to go against the Nazis, was similar to how many Europeans at the time felt.  His ultimate decision at the end also makes this a great movie.The final ten minutes of this film is some of the best work ever done in any movie.

Also it offers a different look at the war environment, which through Morocco's Casablanca buffer state. which offer the condition where Nazi officials and resistance members can face one another without necessarily fearing an immediate shootout.

"Romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic","There's not really much one can add all of the comments about this film, a masterpiece that is truly deserving of being in the list of top movies of all time. The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost. Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.The cast is also outstanding – Bogart and Bergman of course, but also almost all of the supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Vichy French captain whose loyalties sway in the wind is my personal favorite. In a sweeping story that could have easily been cloying or corny, there is great realism in characters who are morally ambivalent (Rains, Lorre, and Bogart himself) put next to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a good cause, and those bent on taking over the world. There are many wonderful scenes, and not just those between Bogart and Bergman. Paul Henreid is great with Bergman too, and the scene where he leads the French ex-pats in singing 'La Marseillaise' to drown out the German officers singing their own patriotic is rousing. And let's not forget Dooley Wilson, who is so smooth, singing among other things the iconic ""As Time Goes By"".

A nice recollection,"Casablanca is this type of movies that do not make anybody indifferent, of those that were remaining in your recollection forever. A precious history in times of war. A former romance that it remains in the hearts of those who cannot forget. The one who has not loved ever and to the time it could not have continued with the promises that once he said? Since this way it is Casablanca, which happened was the better of our life, but the time happens and everything ends.
"" Always we will still have Paris "" says to him Rick (H. Bogart) to Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) this when it is going to divide towards America. A Paris that stays as this recollection that they have not forgotten throughout the years, a Paris that retains the love that was had and that there remained. Difficult what is ... truth? During the existence of the human this being it limits itself to promising things that in occasions it cannot fulfill, falls in love, looks for a reason by which to remain entertained until the sad end, that end that comes to all without differentiating any alive being of this planet, the death. "" Since the time happens "" he says the song that there touches Sam (D. Wilson) for Ilsa, it forms a of seeing that the facts of the present will transform in recollections of the future and when the death finally comes, it will be the recollection of us themselves what it will remain.
The presence on screen of H. Bogart is indisputable, becomes big in chamber and his action performs the better thing that transmits great classic this one, there is no way of resisting turn fascinated by his interpretation. His place is cozy and important in the plot. In fact, in this place it is where a scene takes place praises of great meaning. The German officials sing a military march and other clients of the bar remain quiet, listening until Lazslo (P. Henreid) sees what happens. It is admirable as Víctor, in this moment of supremacy Nazi, decides to intone the Of Marseilles one and the whole bar joins him, silencing to the German voices. An anthem for the freedom, the equality and the brotherhood.

"How did this BORING, UNROMANTIC movie become such a hit?","Hollywood clearly has no idea what romance is. 'Casablanca' proves my point.How times - and film making - have changed over the years. 'Casablanca' so obviously was shot in a studio - so much so that it might just as well have been a stage play, almost entirely set in a cafe/casino. Very theatrical, actually. The film features the famed actors Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, and the famous line ""Here's looking at you, kid."" But what was the film actually all about? They keep talking about ""letters of transit"", but does the general public actually know what this means? What were these letters for?The film revolves around several people trying to obtain these letters, with everyone coming and going to Rick's Cafe. There was a lot of talk, and talk, and talk, and talk... there were some funny moments as well, but in general this was rather boring. If this was intended to be romantic, I'm sorry I didn't get it. Ilsa (Bergman) was having an affair with Rick (Bogart) while her husband, Victor (Heinreid) was in a concentration camp for a year. This is infidelity, for goodness sake, and this is supposed to be romantic??? I also found the film terribly over-dramatic.How did this boring, forgettable film become such a hit? There honestly is nothing memorable here. Maybe back in 1942 there was nothing better to watch, and this was considered romantic, who knows? From a modern point of view, though, this was a yawn of a movie with too much talk and too little going on, and constant soft lighting whenever Bergman was on screen to make her look like a goddess.

"Heartwarming in all the right places, Casablanca deserves every ounce of its iconic status in the world of cinema","As a child, I fondly remember watching the a Looney Tunes short which was a homage/parody to Casablanca, named Carrotblanca. I didn't think much of it, but it greatly gave me an idea of how iconic Casablanca was and knowing of Humphrey Bogart. Fast-forward to adulthood and now I've finally watched it and seen what the fuss was about.Did it live up to the hype? I think so, but as I was watching it, I was starting to think I might not really like the movie by the time it ends. When things were getting too sentimental, my cynical side was cringing, but then once the story opened up more, I began to see that the story was addressing themes of love and virtue that we all can relate to as human beings. It's the two things that make a human being human and we as human beings know that those two things may require things of importance of us to be sacrificed and that can be either good or negative. It's a character study of one person's struggle with those two ideals.What I love about Casablanca is that it is not at all cynical, but at the same time it's not all sunshine and rainbows. What it does have, most importantly, is a lot of heart and it is a film that can remind us all of our humanity in that we're all susceptible to our vulnerabilities to the people we cherish the most and that could potentially destroy us, but Casablanca finds triumph in that and asks each and everyone of us to find triumph in our adversities for the sake of keeping our hearts pure. Any film that asks something like that is a film that is sure to be remembered and to remain in the hearts of not only people looking for entertainment in movies, but also heart.

In addition, it's great way to analyze movies evolution : so in the two movies, we have a frontier neutral town before liberty, bad guys and rebels, a saloon-keeper who doesn't take side, a police officer who is not very clean, a fat guy managing black market, two tickets for a plane and for sure an old love getting hot again ! With that, i would say that the most recent movie shows more but as it's silly contents (nakedness, violence), the effect to the movie is useless. Here, we just have the characters speaking and interacting in a civilized way, so the old movie is thousand more thrilling because it's only psychological ! So those old movies in black and white and using out-of-date technology are not finally boring but are rather more punchy than the actual ones because they cut to the essential : humans feelings and relationships ! Anyway, this old one has indeed a fabulous cast : as said by Lynch, it's true that Isabella looks like her mother, Bogart shows than less is more but for me, the magic lies with the black and white : it's so full, so complementary in costumes, the white saloon, the black night, the shadows that it was like seeing a color movie !

It was an absolutely fantastic 100 minutes that I am honestly grateful for.What was a bit surprising to me however, was that my son felt exactly the same way, and he is not a big fan of romantic movies.

One scene in particular stands out, in which a number of drunken German officers are singing a German anthem very loudly. People just stand and watch them, not daring to anything about it, but obviously not pleased. Then Victor Laszlo decides that he has had enough of this, and instructs the band to play Les Marseilles (please excuse my probably incorrect spelling), the French anthem. After a nod from Rick, the band starts up, and Victor begins singing it at the top of his voice. All the rest of the café joins in, and it swells to such a noise, that the Germans can no longer be heard, and they promptly sit down, looking angry. This (in my opinion) is one of the best scenes ever shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the best,"I had always heard that Casablanca was one of the greatest movies of all time. However, anytime I had seen a movie that had received such high praise, such as Citizen Kane, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations for Casablanca were lower because of that, or maybe because for some reason I always assumed it was nothing more than a girly film, but the movie far exceeded my expectations, and I must agree that it is one of the greatest films of all time.The movie is so much more than a love story. Elements of suspense and conflict between good and evil make this story work. Bogart's character is even a social commentary on American isolationism, and what good can be achieved when he opens his heart and sticks his neck out for someone.The dialog is not only brilliant, but masterfully delivered by Bogart and Rains. I think Rains performance is highly underrated, and my favorite in the film.This is a must see for everyone, especially for people like me who think it will be nothing but a romance movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Summary: The Greatest Love Story of Our Time,"If you are a patriotic person you will ""know"" that to win a war requires great sacrifices of your own desires, wants, and needs. Here, in Casablanca we have a simple story, of which the movie producers themselves didn't think would become such a classic, which has captured the hearts of all who see this movie.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is a man's man. He is courageous and fights a war on his terms with his own resources. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman portrays a woman (Ilsa Lund Laszlo) torn between her true love and her duty to her husband whom she once believed was killed in the war. The moral is that ""duty"" takes precedence over personal feelings.Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo the ""underground resistance leader"" plays his role straight with dedication to the cause of freedom and ""understanding"" when he learns of Ilsa and Rick's past affair in Paris, France. The most inspiring part was when Victor leads a song challenge with the French National Anthem in Rick's club against the boastful German Army. The emotion of this scene was so strong that it brings tears to the eyes of any true patriot.If you are a lover of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Claude Rains, you will find classic performances here! Conrad Veidt played the German Major Strasser to form. I understand that Madeleine LeBeau (Yvonne)is actually French and you can see the tears of patriotism on her face as she sings a most inspiring rendition of Le Marseillaise (French National Anthem).Dooley Wilson plays Rick's piano player in Casablanca. It is true that ""the world will always welcome lovers"" As Time Goes By! ""You played it for her - you can play it for me. Play it, Sam. Play it!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A True Classic,"What can I say, I have a soft spot for old black and white movies. I watched this movie with my Nana for the very first time when I was six.

"Exactly the classic it's made out to be, even though it wasn't made to be","It's hard to believe that ""Casablanca"" (1942) wasn't expected to be the classic that it's considered now. It's about loving and losing, rising above and sacrificing for the greater good, and becoming a better person.At the time of its release, people everywhere were reeling from the injustice that's captured in the film, which fueled its advancement. All films renouncing Nazi terrorism tend to be highly respected, but this one is especially so. The music, both diegetic and nondiegetic, is beautiful and touching. The lighting is soft and fitting, and all of the characters who should be are rounded out well. Ingrid Bergman is unbelievably gorgeous, which makes it a little hard to concentrate on the witty, fast-paced dialogue she's involved in, but it's worth it. Humphrey Bogart portrays his supposedly cynical lead character perfectly. There are so many factors that make this the classic it is, and I don't think I could put my finger on all of them.Overall, ""Casablanca"" is exactly what you would expect a film this reputable to be: beautiful and inspirational.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The Greatest?,"Leonard Maltin and his gang say that Casablanca represents the greatest achievement in the history of Hollywood movie making - the zenith of the Golden Age Dream Factory. Roger Ebert decided to make it the first in his series of reviews entitled The Great Movies. Lists of the ten best films of all time place it generally in the top-5. It even made the top ten best films on a list that places the Lord of the Rings trilogy higher than, oh, just about anything.Is Casablanca that great? Briefly, yes it is. Is it my favorite film or would I ever describe it as the greatest movie ever made? That is unlikely, but I will concede that they may be right to anyone who wants to argue that point. If you tell me it's the greatest movie of all time, I will say, you might be right. If you tell me the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, I will challenge you to a duel a la Zell Miller.Truth be told, Casablanca is my third favorite movie and I believe it is one of the greatest motion pictures ever created. It is one of the few true works of art the Hollywood system ever created. Like most great movies, though, it always begs the question - what's so special? Well, for starters, Michael Curtiz had, perhaps, the greatest cast of characters ever. You have the greatest male movie-star of all time playing the lead; you have a truly gifted and beautiful female lead; you have three of the greatest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Paul Henreid.Second, you have an epic story condensed into a two-hour run time. The story has everything - murder mystery, war time thriller, espionage tale, love story, etc. As Umberto Eco pointed out in an essay, Casablanca is a collage of story types and moods; it has something for everyone.Third, and most importantly, it has the greatest movie ending of all time. As Rick watches Illsa's plane taxi down the Casablancan runway and he spouts that memorable line, you are shot through with a feeling that you have just been privy to something that is so perfect and right and you are amazed because, really, that ending would never make it to the final cut of a Hollywood film today. The bittersweetness of that ending is exactly what the narrative to that point calls for. Rick needs to stay; Illsa needs to go. Anything else would be trite and contrived.(As an aside, I was once at a bar having drinks with these two girls, one of whom I found incredibly attractive. I contemplated making a move with her and then the conversation turned to movies. She said, ""Casablanca is my favorite movie. It's soooo wonderful. I would just change the ending, though, so Rick and Illsa stay together."" I gagged and discontinued any plans for romantic pursuits I had intended to embark upon with her.) Casablanca is as close to perfection as Golden Age Hollywood ever came. It's a perfect, timeless movie that, I believe, every one can and will enjoy. If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. It's wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Adventure, romance, ""internal problems""","First we have to consider the context. The idea of hate, love, fear. This movie shows it in a simple and beautiful way.

Casual Nazi,"I can't really say that the movie was as engaging as I somewhat believed. Who haven't heard all the memorable lines, the prices and of course the acting of Swedens no1 actor of all times Ingrid Bergman. Well, to be honest. I thought the movie was slow, some of the acting was good but more than just looking good don't I really think Bergman does that good of a job. To tackle the elephant in the yard. The third act is what makes this movie, everything else just feels boring, slow and overrated. Our main cast is ok, not good but ok. Some characters are memorable but where it all really breaks down is due to the Rick character. Don't get me wrong, hes introduction and persona is point on but everything else is to my taste not suiting. Hes character is always mad and I get this strange James Bond vibe out of it all, really uninteresting character that does not fit as an encouraging lead in an already slow plot line. What there is that saves this movie is the ending. Even though the reveal of the playing in love by Bergman comes to late in the movie is there still one of the best plot twists that ties the bag perfectly.

Nasty Propaganda Flick On Par With Jud Süß,"Have you ever noticed that Casablanca is not a French city, but a Moroccan one?Morocco was occupied by France since 1912. It was only the French defeat in World War Two which marked the end of the French colonial supremacy over the country.It takes a big load of brazenness to write a script which forces a Moroccan band in Morocco to play the French national anthem to give beaten French nationals a moment of patriotic salvation.This is bad taste even after the standards of that particular time.At the end, you get a propaganda flick that isn't worth the plot, but it's pitfalls to observe.

So overrated,"My expectations were higher about this movie due the high ratings and to the fact that to a lot people this is one of the best movies ever, but after watching I don't really now why. Before anything else let me clear that I'm not that stupid dude who can't watch nothing before 2000, Citizen Kane is one year older that this and I completely loved it and rated it 10/10 but this movie felt really... average.To me this is a romance that marked that time due the historical and political context and the subjects that the movie has in it but the story itself is just a lame and boring love story with a extreme level of predictability, it's so predictable that when I read the synopsis I already knew how this was going to end, I hoped that I was wrong but unfortunately I wasn't. Besides the predictability, the plot was boring, the acting was average, there is no character development so you don't get attached to any of them. I know this was a propaganda movie and this actually sell's well the ideia of patriotism and victory against Germany, but the fact that this was for propaganda purposes should say a lot about this, the movie was rushed and the expectations were low but by some miracle everyone came to think that this is a masterpiece.
To me this is an american (propaganda) popcorn movie and nothing more then that. It's also one of the most quoted movies but I found a lot of the dialogues to be boring and unnecessary to the story development.It was well made but it wasn't a cinematography masterpiece if you ask me, in the first minutes we have a scene where a guy gets shot and then there's no blood no bullet wound no nothing he just drops himself awfully on the floor and when the police go to him he has nothing but a little bit of blood in his mouth... now I know it was 1942 but they could've done it better.

How to judge a classic movie?,"Casablanca is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever, but at the same time, it's a movie that's 80 years old. Movie making has become much better in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to acting and over all cinematographic quality.As a 40+ years old man watching Casablanca for the first time in 2021, i honestly fail to understand what makes this movie so great. Is the acting good? For it's time maybe, but not today. The story is just another mediocre love story, common for it's time, and there isn't anything remarkable about the directing, the lighting, the script, the music, anything.So why are people giving Casablanca so high ratings? Is it the fact that you just have to love movies like this, because ""it's a classic""? Is it because of the godlike status of stars like Bergman and Bogart? Is it because of sentimental reasons? ...that your parents and grand parents loved it, so therefor we do?I'm sorry, but this is a rather boring movie where nothing really happens and people like me will probably be downvoted with the thought process of me ""not understanding it's greatness.""

This is look to kid-Casablanca,"Before watching Casablanca I had a small idea what the movie was about but not truly sure of the whole movie. Once I watch it I liked it.The plot is about a bar owner named Rick played by Humphrey Bogart who once live in New York City. After running from the Germans in France he ended up in Casablanca. Were he runs a bar that many powerful people come in to and business is talked about. Rick is kind of the leader if the mafia leader. People end up in Casablanca to try to get away back to in America. Many powerful people come in to place and try to get Rick to sit down and talk to them, but he never does till one day he hears a song that has not heard since France. This is doing to a long lost friend that he never thought he would anymore. Ilsa Ricks love in the movie is on here way to try to find a way to get out of Casablanca and back to New York. She just needs the help of Rick to do it.This puts Rick in a hard spot. With all that is going on with Llsa and her friend Victor brings out the try style of him.This movie uses a lot of music to build the mood and show you the mood. Its show the mood of the characters or scene that is taking place . Since the movie was in black and white there uses a lot of dark lighting or light lighting to show good or bad people. As well as misty or even love. For the 40's it is well done and can compare to today's movies. The made it looks like love. They love. Over all this is a great movie that draws you in from the begin to the end. You never really know what is going to be coming around the corner. You think you have a clue what is going to happened then it changes on you before think you figured it out. I know understand why this is an American classic and I would tell any more to watch it.

The greatest movie ever made,"When one closely analyzes a movie, they find that it is even better.  Such is the case with ""Casablanca,"" in my opinion the greatest movie of all time. While studying this movie, I've noticed many interesting things which shows how brilliant this movie really is.  For example, when Renault meets Major Strasser at the airport, he says, ""unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.""  Now think about that.  UNOCCUPIED France.  He clearly has no respect for Nazis.  That's just one of the little things that makes this movie great.But how can I write a review of ""Casablanca"" without commenting on everything else?  Humphrey Bogart--the greatest tough guy in movies.  Ingrid Bergman--a hottie with a brain (take that, Denise Richards!).  Paul Henried--manages to get the scene stolen from him at every turn, but when you watch the movie, it's hard to think of it without him, Claude Rains--fantastic!!!  Peter Lorre--Possibly the most memorable small character in movies.  Even the dialogue should stand out as a performance. Julius and Phil Epstein were so good at writing lines that the actors could say and show that the movie was getting into their heads.  Who doesn't know the line ""Here's lookin at you, kid?""

Ironically, two actors who appeared in the film were ardent anti-Nazis, Helmut Dantine and Conrad Veidt. Mr. Veidt died in the mid 40s and never returned to Germany.

I have seen just about every single Ingrid Bergman film and have never been disappointed. And Bogie? There never has been or ever will be another like him. His performances will always stand out, no matter how many years pass. Another outstanding performance in this film is by Paul Henreid, who plays Victor Lazlo, an underground hero and bane to the Nazis. There is a part in this film that always overwhelms me. At Rick's place, the Nazi soldiers have all gathered and start singing their ""National Anthem"" much to the chagrin of the rest of the customers, who are mostly French. France has already fallen and is occupied by the Germans, so these people are very downhearted at hearing this Anthem being sung. At that point, Lazlo (Henreid) walks over to the band and demands that they play ""La Marseillaise"", and they do, causing everyone to stand and sing, showing their allegiance to France. The German singers are then drowned out by the French. It is overwhelming and is like a look into the future of the war and Hitler's ultimate defeat.

Casablanca isn't Casablanca without Humphrey and Ingrid!,"Casablanca, starring the cool Humphrey Bogart and the angelic Ingrid Bergman is more than just a movie. It is a landmark film, transcends deep into American culture, and become the most popular motion picture of all the worlds of all the times. What makes Casablanca so popular? I can't explain it, so does everybody I supposed. I sincerely don't think that the pairing of Bogart and Bergman made them the best of all time. Bogart is better with his real life partner, and Bergman is far better with Cary Grant, her match in terms of good-looks and sexual tension. Nevertheless, Rick is Bogart's best role, the role really suited him. Bogart typically played smart, playful, courageous, tough, occasionally reckless characters who lived in a corrupt world, anchored by a hidden moral code. Rick seemed as cool as cucumber, but didn't dare to hear somebody played 'As Time Goes By'. Other than Casablanca, his best films are The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of Sierra Madre. If you want to appreciate good acting, Bogart's Rick is the first to start. Ilsa is hardly Bergman's best role. She's more convincing as a tortured wife in Gaslight or an alcoholic woman in Hitchcock's Notorious. But when the most beautiful woman in the history of films played the role of Ilsa, Ilsa too had become the most beautiful female character in the history of cinema. I can't remember seeing a face more beautiful than hers; she is breathtaking, illuminating every scene. To watch Casablanca is to fall in love with Ingrid Bergman. Both Bogart and Bergman wanted to quit during filming, because they thought the story was ridiculous and unbelievable. Bergman was more critical, she hoped that nobody will ever screened Casablanca again after she died. The whole production was a chaos; nobody thought that they were making the best film of the 20th century. Bogart having problems with his third marriage, Bergman worried about her future role in her next film, the producers didn't know the ending yet and so on. For those who might think of remaking Casablanca, just forget it. For the greats Bogart and Bergman have long been dead, and for Casablanca isn't Casablanca without the two of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Business is his religion and his mistress.The death of two German couriers triggers a shakedown of the ""usual suspects"" and a general alert goes out for the murderer and for a dissident who has escaped from Europe.On this night a foreign couple arrives, upsetting the delicate equilibrium of Casablanca and Rick's world. Rick insists ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", but the police captain Renault (Claude Rains) suspects that Rick is ""At heart a sentimentalist"".The story of ""Casablanca"" is multi-layered. While it is a product of its time and place, it is also universal and timeless. Every time I watch this film, I discover more details and I appreciate even more how well it is constructed.Filmed during WWII, ""Casablanca"" is an acknowledged classic and winner of the Oscar for Best Film. There are many reasons for its reputation, including a stellar cast, excellent writing, its music, and a stylish presentation that might be called international noir. It is a tremendous love story within a political drama. No doubt it will remain a favorite of film fans...as time goes by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I should never have switched from scotch to martinis Great Lines,"The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's - man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words.

It's all in the script!Flawless.,"Casablanca's formula is superb. The script contains all the elements of classical cinema with a wonderful array of characters blending in politics, passion, romance, war, self sacrifice, nationality, heroism, mystery, love, friendship, intrigue, patriotism....The characters are carefully thought out. It takes a masterful writer to define a character with few words. Rick of course has the best definition of humanity. We learn by him saying ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" that he is out for number one but then we learn he is a softy when he hears reason within and calls on the number ""22"" to aid a poor refugee and his wife. The screenwriters have a great time with this man and Humphrey Bogart played it flawlessly.It is Elsa whom is the truest of hustlers. She knows how to use her abilities as a beautiful woman to gain power but for the good side. Her character appears vulnerable and soft but cleverly disguised it is she who truly saves the day. Ingrid Bergman is radiant!Claude Rains was given great dialogue and Peter Lorre is the perfect sleaze.Filled with music and song that give the drama it's life.A marvelous production design and beautiful black and white photography accompany an incredible cast. The film is perfect. One of the great film romances of our time. Everyone is a romantic during war. It must have lifted the spirit of millions during a horrific time. Classy and sophisticated.

Cinema at its finest,"Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane,Brief Encounter and Rebel Without a Cause. All of these films are classics,but I don't think any of them can topple the legacy and transcendent beauty of the masterpiece that is Casablanca.
The terrific script works unbelievably well with Humphrey Bogart's character Rick, as he moves through life with cynicism and sarcasm. ""I don't stick my neck out for everybody""sums up the Rick we meet in the first quarter of the film.He is courteous to his customers,but for a mysterious reason he is only really concerned about himself and doesn't seem worried about others.Then,our queries are answered.Ingrid Bergman arrives,and it is then we understand the true reason behind Rick's underlying sadness and cynicism.As the film progresses,the audience experiences some of the best on screen chemistry ever seen;Bergman and Bogart are incredible together,in the few scenes they share,their emotions and love for each other is reflected extraordinary by the actors. The fantastic script merges in with their characters so well,as they toy and wonder where their love will take them. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre provide terrific performances to shine with the two co-stars.Now,the ending. Most romance films often end with a conventional happy ending.Michael Curtiz and the Epsteins gave us so much more. As we hoped for Rick and Isla to reunite,Rick's sacrifice in the airport unfolded, and we realised that the ending is not so gloomy after. Rick's sacrifice of letting Isla go with Victor,was undeniably heartbreaking for Rick,yet his sacrifice to do the moral thing for the right cause internally left him redeemed and ultimately content that he did the right thing for his nation. The screenplay in this film is so magnificently woven together with the performances of the actors,iconic dialogue and soundtrack,that it firmly distinguishes itself as the greatest romance film that has graced our screens. It is simply the epitome of great cinema, a preeminent work that is perhaps the most phenomenal film to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The reason to check out the classics.,"I thought Casablanca was going to be one of those over-hyped classics that's boring to watch. I couldn't be more wrong. The first thing that grabbed me was Humphrey Bogart. He did an excellent job portraying his character rick. Rick was a smooth, calm, collect kinda guy which set the mood. All of the actors/actresses contributed some very good acting too. The lighting was top notch and the music will stick in your head. The story which took place in the ww2 era, was very exciting to follow and did not let up once in grabbing your attention. The movie was full of dialog that I've heard in other films and TV shows but never knew it until I watched it. I recommend this movie to just about anyone with a heart and half a brain.

I have to say I thought it was great.  I can't analyse the film because to me there is nothing to analyse.

Casablanca,"Casablanca starring Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henried was an all-around great movie. This is a romantic film where Ilsa was falling for Rick and Victor. Rick was Rick and Ilsa had the stronger relationship. Victor and Ilsa seemed to have a plain relationship. In the end, Rick forces the captain to allow Victor and Ilsa to go to America while he stays behind. This shows how much he loves Ilsa because he wants the best for her even though it meant her going with Victor. A scene that was good in the movie was the national anthems being played in the café. The German's started singing their national anthem. Then Rick cued everyone else to do the French national anthem. This is a key scene because it shows the people actually standing up against the Germans and their invasions. The relationship with Rick and the Captain was also good too. Most viewers at the end would actually think that Rick turned on him but he didn't. He used the captain to help Victor and Ilsa to get away and then the captain stood up for Rick when the Germans came to try and stop them.

A Perfect Example of the Golden Age of Film,"Adam Roberts ENGL 110 MA 1 Kopplin Due 2/19/13 CasablancaThere was a time when movies did not have to be gory or intricately produced to score big at the box office. Though some will say that time has since passed, it is always nice to look back at how the modern movie scene came to be. Perhaps one of the finest movies of the mid-20th century exemplifying early movie styles is Michael Curtiz's Casablanca. If it were to be released today, many modern movie goers would shrug it off as ""old grandpa crap"". However, due in part to its portrayal of refugee lifestyle, direction, and unique take on current events, it cannot be argued that Casablanca has earned its place among the early classics.The very thing that puts Casablanca in a unique position is its borrowing of the current state of political turmoil that existed in the early 1940s and making a side story to it. Many actors were refugees from Europe who had come to America to escape the German Reich. The cast features such top-notch actors as Ingrid Bergman, who plays the tender Ilsa, and the star Humphrey Bogart as Rick, a bitter and sarcastic club owner who can't quite let go of past love. It is clear from watching that every viewpoint is shared in the story; each refugee shares a different look on how the events of the time affected them. The mix of French, German, Austrian, American, Czech, Hungarian, and even Moroccan refugees adds a sort of cohesion to the movie; it is telling a tale of the 1940s human experience.The setting of World War Two is quite honestly not the greatest setting for a love story, yet at the same time Curtiz sees a prime opportunity. The theme of sacrifice, one of the common ideas behind true love, is notably present in Bogart's character. Curtiz looks at the picture as a series of moral dilemmas that need solving one at a time, starting with Rick overcoming his disgust with Ilsa. It shows a passion for revealing a character's interior struggles one at a time.Warner Brothers had a knack for mass producing movies during the Second World War to entertain citizens during a time of great emotional toil. Casablanca captures the attitude that many held during wartime, but wraps these views around the central plot of a love story. Love is hard to find in a war environment, and in the end Rick has to allow common sense to overtake his emotions, but in a way this is the greatest show of love in the entire film.""Here's looking at you, kid"". It is one of the most recognizable quotes from a highly recognizable movie. In a time when everybody desires to get what they want when they want it, maybe some of us should examine what it means to sacrifice for the greater good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A film that gets better with age (mine, that is)","It's hard to think of something new to contribute to the commentary on one of the best-loved and most-discussed of all films. But my affection for Casablanca prompts me to try.I watch the film about once every two years, and every time I get something more out of it--maybe because I'm a little older each time. It strikes me as a very adult film, as opposed to most of the movies put out today that seem aimed at the 14-year-old in all of us. As time goes on, I find myself relating more and more to Rick and Renault: cynical, world-weary, but bemused by the folly around them and content as long as they're left alone. That is, until events conspire to present them with a choice: abandon completely any ideals you may have once held, or take a stand for them.Rick's choice, his solution, is one that most of us hope we would have the courage and nobility to make. And what a brave choice for a Hollywood movie to make: the hero doesn't get the girl! Instead, he gets back his soul. Casablanca dares to say something that few artists or politicians in our self-centred, post-WWII age are willing to say: that sacrifice can be more important, more worthwhile, even more satisfying, than reward.Granted, Casablanca may not be the best film ever made. The Godfather, Schindler's List, and Citizen Kane are, doubtless, ""greater"" films, more important films. Mention them to a film buff and you'll get an astute, respectful nod. But mention this one and you'll get a delighted smile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Casablanca at 60,"With the possible, arguable, exception of Citizen Kane, this is THE finest piece of celluloid ever to exist. I give it a notch over Kane because it has the romantic interest of Bergman and Bogey (Elsa and Rick) as a second powerful sub-plot. The casting is perfect, the story is exciting, supporting characters have (in the ensuing 6 decades) become as memorable and important as the leads. If you buy DVD's, get this one or Kane first. These films will be the basis on which to compare all others that have come before or after. If they are dated..well then so be it. Great stories transcend time (how many remakes of Romeo & Juliet exist for example?) and Casablanca is such.The multiple tales of human folly, fear, death, hate, love and living for a higher purpose are seamlessly integrated into a hundred-odd minutes of magical story telling. Will anyone make a film like this again? No...that would be impossible. Perhaps come close but never exceed this perfect example of the motion picture arts. And art it is. If it were a painting it would hang in the Louvre, if a song, comparable with Beethoven's 9th, if a book, it would be on the shelf next to Shakespear's First Folio. Enough...see the movie...again.

The greatest movie of all time!!!!!!,"If you like Humphrey Bogart (and who doesn't), you have GOT to own this movie.  If you have not seen it you are in for a real treat when you do. Bogart portrays a real pathos here that has been unsurpassed.  Ingrid Bergman as the woman torn between the two men she loves will tug at your heartstrings.  Some of Bogie's most famous lines are in this movie (i.e. Renaud; ""So Ricky why did you come to Casablanca?""  Rick: ""My health.  I came for the waters.""  Renaud: ""But Casablanca is in the middle of the desert.""  Rick: (In a very non chalant tone), ""I was misinformed."")  This movie has everything; comedy, drama, romance, and tragedy.  In my opinion, there is no other movie like Casablanca.  It is absolutely incomparable. You must see, rent, or buy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless Romance Meets Wartime Intrigue,"""Casablanca,"" a timeless classic, stands as a remarkable piece of cinema that effectively blends romance, drama, and wartime intrigue. Set against the backdrop of World War II, this 1942 film directed by Michael Curtiz, showcases a narrative structure that is both classic and engaging. The story revolves around Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American expatriate who runs a nightclub in Casablanca, and his encounter with a past love, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). This encounter reignites old flames and plunges Rick into a dilemma between love and virtue.The film's thematic depth is striking. It explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the choices one must make in the face of overwhelming odds. The moral complexities faced by the characters are portrayed with nuance, making them relatable and human. The narrative elegantly weaves personal stories with the larger historical context, offering a poignant look at the struggles during wartime.From a technical standpoint, ""Casablanca"" is a marvel of its time. The black-and-white cinematography creates a perfect ambiance, capturing the mood of uncertainty and romance. Max Steiner's musical score adds to the film's emotional depth, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. The script, packed with memorable lines, is sharp and sophisticated, contributing significantly to the film's enduring appeal.As the story unfolds, one can't help but be drawn into the world of Rick and Ilsa. Their chemistry is palpable, making their emotional journey both compelling and heartrending. The supporting cast, including Claude Rains as Captain Renault and Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, add depth to the narrative, each character bringing their own flavor to the story.In conclusion, ""Casablanca"" is a film that transcends its era. It's a beautifully crafted tale of love, loss, and redemption, set against a tumultuous historical backdrop. The film's ability to balance personal drama with broader themes is remarkable, making it not just a great war film, but a timeless story about the human condition. It's a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a rating of 9 out of 10. The emotional impact of the film lingers long after the credits roll, making it a must-watch for any film enthusiast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Transit,"I can't see this one often enough.  Besides bringing back the team that made The Maltese Falcon and adding the unbelievable Ingrid Bergman at her most beautiful, Claude Raines as just the perfect corrupt slimeball bureaucrat Frenchy trading visas for sex with the cute wives of refugees and Conrad Viedt at his best creating the character upon which Colonel Klink was undoubtedly based.  Peter Lorre as a pathetic loser, Sidney Greenstreet is still ""The Fat Man"" and Bogey is still the hard boiled realist.  The difference to the MF is that instead of a Dashiel Hammet derivative detective story, this one is based on themes from what was the classic story of the early years of Nazi history - the transit visa.  That was the holy grail that meant survival to millions who fled between 1932 and when the borders closed shortly after the fall of Paris.  From this perspective, Ricks actions can be seen not so much as noble self denial but the hard reality that in such times the problems of two lovers ""don't amount to a hill of beans.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The script is paced evenly, with a score that is as memorable as it is practiced in finding the right notes to help a scene pay off.Thematically, too, this just completely sticks the landing. Bogart fits the role of a cynical expat like a glove, and watching his collected exterior break upon the shores of Bergman's mysterious mien was a defining portrayal of a classic romance narrative.

A magnificent film despite its bizarre origins,"It's set in early December 1941 in Casablanca, Morocco, immediately before the United States entered World War II. It's a pro-war romantic drama that follows an American ex-pat in Casablanca with a mysterious past. Richard ""Rick"" Blaine had run a saloon and gambling hall in Casablanca since fleeing Paris when the Germans occupied it in June 1940. Casablanca is part of unoccupied France and thus a destination for many people fleeing Europe trying to get to the United States.Casablanca is filled with interesting characters local police prefect Louis Renault (Claude Rains), Signor Ugarte (Peter Lorre), who has come into possession of two valuable transit passes allowing departure to America, and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), who controls illicit economic activity in Casablanca. Also, there are Sam (Dooley Wilson), the piano player in Rick's establishment, and German Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), who is after Victor Laszlo.Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) is a Resistance leader from the Czech underground who has arrived in Casablanca with his wife, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Throughout the film, we learn of Ilsa's relationship with Rick in Paris, why she didn't flee with Rick, and Victor's efforts to leave Casablanca so he can continue his work.""Casablanca"" is a case of a magnificent film created despite itself. It was cobbled together in mid-1942 by a whole series of different writers. But the movie's pacing, editing, cinematography, and classic lines have made it an enduring must-see.
