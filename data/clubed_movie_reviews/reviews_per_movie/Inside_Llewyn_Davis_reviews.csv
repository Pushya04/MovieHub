"Once you let this film sink in, it turns out to be very rewarding","""If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it's a folk song.""The Coen brothers have worked together over the past couple of decades delivering some inspiring work. Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.The film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing.I'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Exposing egotistic society,"This Coen brothers take on the legendary US folk scene in the early 60s, through a down on his luck protagonist, gives nice touch of Greenwich village atmosphere and struggles of an aspiring musician. The musician, based on some of the later famous folk personalities whose music was used, is talented, not mediocre or anything like that, though he has had a tough moment in his life, losing his singing partner to suicide, due to cruelties that he is also exposed to. He struggles without money, and amused Coens take a dark look at the heroic battles of an aspiring artist, who finds little understanding and all the condemnation in his surroundings. Judging by the many condemning comments on this site, subtleties have been lost on the masses. It is a cruel society that equates success with moral virtue, and considers poverty as a moral sin. The artist due to his integrity refuses some chances for commercial success, but even that is construed as his failing by some of the comments, and therefore much of vulhgar mob. Thus, the joke is again turned on the shallow members of the public, who celebrate reality stars while condemn a clearly virtuous, but struggling actor, just because he lacks success. In the end, we get a glimpse of Bob Dylan, who had a powerful gift that was ultimately not possible to deny, but only after he was discovered by some wise people, and who famously snubbed the booing mob and the shallow journalists and could afford to follow his own path. Instead of celebrating the success, Coens shed light on the struggle, and provide an opportunity for the unsophisticated non-creative consumer mob to demonstrate their monstrosities and in some case appallingly complete lack of empathy and absolute inability to distinguish poverty from lack of virtue, bad luck from lack of talent, terrible circumstances from moral deficits. The conclusion is again, that people who do get, through the sheer combination of power of their talent, personality and good luck, to the top, have every reason to shun the shallow hating mob that would, no doubt, shred them to pieces with gusto if they had fallen to bad luck.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"An under the radar, anti-Hollywood masterpiece","This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review for on IMDb. There are only a few movies in history that have impacted me as much.The first time I saw Inside Llewyn Davis, it left me feeling empty and confused. While I appreciated the music, the acting, and the cinematography, I couldn't understand why anyone would love this movie (and I am a huge Coen fan). After all, it's just scene after scene of a jerk getting beaten up by life with no real plot progression and no real reason to care about any of the characters.I then came across the movie again on TV and decided to give it another chance.After this second viewing, the movie's themes connected with me in a big way. After my third and fourth viewing, it shook me to my core.This movie is almost too realistic. It follows none of the conventional ""rules"" and there is no winner or hero. There's no real drama. There's no ""silver lining"". There's only struggle. And then acceptance.For every one Bob Dylan there are myriad Llewyn Davis'. Really talented musicians and artists that work really hard and simply don't catch the lucky break. People go under the radar, under-appreciated and overlooked. People that never make it big and therefore question whether they should be doing it at all.This is a film for the everyday folk; a beautiful empathetic look at art, music, and everyday struggle.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Don Quixote with a guitar,"No doubt: Llewyn Davis is a loser. First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it.  Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature. The film opens with a  long scene in which Davis (Oscar Isaac) performs a sad old folk song.  The camera gently hovers around him, catches the hushed, intensely  attentive atmosphere of the smoky basement club, while he sucks his  audience  us  into the dark, sorrowful world he creates in his song,  hinting at a depth he so often will not show in ""real life"". It is this  contrast, the dialogue between the sadly funny tale of a modern Don  Quixote and that other, older, tenderer story, the music tells. For as  much as this is Llewyn's story, it also is that of the redeeming power  of music. For even if Davis is the same at the end as the story comes  full circle and returns to its opening, as he once again gets beaten up  and is succeeded on stage by a young, cocky folk singer with a nasal  voice who will soon change music  and not just folk music  forever,  there is just the tiniest hint that this Llewyn Davis might have some  sort of promise after all, maybe not as a successful singer, but as a  human being.  Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired loosely by the story of Dave van Ronk,  a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene around the time of Bob  Dylan's arrival there in 1961. Dylan learned a lot from van Ronk and  stole some of his most promising songs, but that is a story to be told  another day. This one is about a man lost in a world that hasn't been  waiting for him, who has a mission that is entirely his own. The  lengths to which he goes to show the world he doesn't care are  astounding. And yet he craves love. Oscar Isaac is a miracle: even in  his most repelling state, in his most rejecting attitude, there is a  flicker of sad longing in his face, his eyes, a face the Coens show us  much of. It is one you need to dive into, closed to the casual observer  but hiding so much pain and uncertainty and desire to live one  sometimes thinks it must explode. The Coens' cinema is one of subtlety,  of nuanced, of shades of grey between the black and white. In Isaac,  they have found their perfect actor, heading a stellar cast including  Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Justin Timberlake.  As so often, the Coen brothers are masters at creating an atmosphere, a  universe of its own, unique as well as absolutely consistent. It is a  world of the night, in which grey shades reign, days are pale and dust  is everywhere. Even in the open there is a sense of narrowness, of  tight spaces, lightless basements that are cage and protective space in  one. It is the tiny holes that provide the only rooms for creativity,  for the soul to speak. And so it is that the dark world of the  underground gradually regains some warmth and coziness, the dark  becomes a zone of comfort, while everything else becomes cold and  distant.  Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a  comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. It is a Quixotic tale full  of quirky characters at time bordering on the fairy-tale like   especially true for the sequence around Goodman's character, a  trodden-down mixture of villain and clown that calls up associations of  the expressionist nightmare world of their earlier film Barton Fink.  The other foot of the film is firmly on the ground, in the existential  struggle of a man the world won't welcome. But there is still that  third element: music, that timeless realm of love and pain and  suffering and hope. It is here the film is anchored, it is here this  Don Quixote conquers his windmills, armed solely with his guitar. It is  here it all comes together. Tragedy, comedy, fairy tale, social drama,  held together by the softest of touches. Another Coen brothers  masterpiece. What else could be expected?",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A road movie with little traveling,"Much like most other movies by the Coen's, this seemed very different to everything else they have done. Before seeing it, I expected it to be a sincere attempt at portraying a Dylan-like figure, with a heavy focus on the music itself, and also with a whole lot of nostalgia. This is kind of true, but these are not the aspects of the film that'll stay with you (even though the music was really good!).There's not really much of a plot in this movie, but it's so well crafted that you hardly notice. Llewyn has a goal, but it's obvious from the start that this movie is not about reaching that goal, but rather about his every day struggle, and the life as a folk musician in an almost mythical period of music history. Llewyin is an interesting character, flawed but easy to like. His struggle feels real, and plays into an overarching theme of how your fate can be out of your hands, but also how perseverance can lead to something good.The movie is similar to road movies in that it features a lot of different characters that Llewyn meets and interacts with. Some of these are very much Coen-esque, and I'm always amazed by how Coen manages to establish such layered side characters, despite them only appearing on screen briefly. Bot casting and writing must be stellar to be able to do this, and they seem to do it all the time.It ends in a way that makes the movie more than just a mood piece, and opens up for some interesting discussions. Once again, they've managed to make a brilliant film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The anti-Dude,"At some point of this the folk singer we've been following is stranded at night by the side of the road in a car with possibly a dead man and a cat, another man has just been arrested by police for not much of a reason. He gets out to hitch a ride and there's only a cold, indifferent night with strangers in their cars just going about.This is the worldview the Coens have been prodding, sometimes for a laugh, sometimes not. I can't fault them, it does seem to be inexplicably cold out there some nights. They're thinkers first of all, intellectuals, so it stings them more so they try to think up ways of mocking that thinker who is stung by the cold to amuse themselves and pass the night.So this is what they give us here. A joyless man for no particular reason, who plays decent music that people enjoy or not for no particular reason, who the universe has turned against. The Coens don't pretend to have any particular answer either of why this is, why the misery. It might have something to do with having lost a friend, something to do with not having learned to be simply grateful for a small thing. It might have something to do with something he did, the initial beating up in the alley is there to insert this. Sometimes it's just something that happens as random as a cat deciding to step out of the door and the door closing before you can put it back in. Most of the time it all kind of snowballs together.It's a noir device (the beating - cat) bundling guilt with chance so we'll end up with a clueless schmuck whose own contribution to the nightmare is inextricable from the mechanics of the world. The Coens have mastered noir so they trot it here with ease: the more this anti-Dude fails to ease into life the more noir anomaly appears around him.Of course the whole point is that it's not such a bad setup; people let him crash in their apartment, a friend finds him a paying gig, somehow he ends up on a car to Chicago where he's offered a job. It's not great either, but somewhere in there is a pretty decent life it could all amount to, provided he settles for less than his dream. (This means here a dream the self is attached to). I saw this after a documentary on backup singers, all of them profoundly troubled for having settled for less, all of them nonetheless happy to be able to do their music.Still, 'The incredible journey', seen on the Disney poster, may in the end amount to no more than an instinctive drive through miles of wilderness. The Coens are cold here even for their standards. I wouldn't be surprised to find it was Ethan, the more introverted of the two, ruminating on a meaningless art without his partner.Is there a way out in the end? Here's the trickiest part, especially for an intelligent mind. You can't just kid yourself with any other happiness like Hollywood has done since Chaplin. You know it has to be invented to some degree, the point of going on, yet truthful. Nothing here. More music, a reflection. It's the emptiest part of the film as if they didn't know themselves what to construct to put him back on stage. Visually transcending was never their forte anyway. They merely end up explaining the wonderful noir ambiguity of that first beating.Still they are some of the most dependable craftsmen we have and in the broader Coen cosmos this sketches its own space.",,Anonymous,Music
Coen brothers recreate an era,It's 1961 in Greenwich Village. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer who lost his musical partner Mike to suicide. His new solo album isn't selling but then neither is anything else he did with Mike. He stays at his friends the Gorfeins but the cat gets locked out. Then he visits his friends Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). She tells him that she's pregnant possibly by him. And Llewyn's life keeps drifting on.Brother filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen have brought something different with this original character in this unique era. It's beautifully filmed as usual. Oscar Isaac is a newcomer and an unknown. He fits this character very well. He has a drifter musician quality to him. Carey Mulligan takes a hilarious turn with her angry performance. The movie has a mellow and rambling vibe. It also has its big moments. The music is awright but nothing exciting. It's a man slowly drifting in the world as his musical career tries to stay afloat.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fantastic sound, atmosphere, acting.","Inside Llewyn Davis is an intimate, well-executed, and honest slice of life. It features a humanistic, heartfelt performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular folk singer, arresting cinematography, and a sharp, tight-fisted script by the Coen brothers, who also directed.It's Greenwich Village in the early sixties, when folk music was either coming into its own or ready to be usurped by a more mainstream genre. Llewyn has no home, drifting from gig to gig and crashing on couch after couch as a matter of design; is vagrancy is his life's plan. Llewyn is at turns a noble soul who exists for the sake of making the music he wants to make and a resentful twerp who mooches off friends just to sustain his unsustainable lifestyle.The movie is only somewhat linear, with closing scenes mirroring opening scenes, and it is told entirely from Llewyn's point of view. The Coen brothers masterfully show us not only Llewyn's perspective but also an outside perspective; this allows us to feel both empathy and loathing toward him.Llewyn is nothing if not complex. The movie does a terrific job of avoiding the usual clichés, such as a down-on-his-luck musician catching a lucky break, or a bitter man having a quick change of heart. It's not that Llewyn is constantly sneering at everyone, holding his poverty up as both a shield and a trophy, it's that he is so multilayered that when he does a kind act or offers some praise or thanks, we don't feel that his doing so is in any way out of character. Llewyn is a self-tortured soul, but unlike caricatures of wandering folkies, he is at his center a realist, albeit a prideful one.During his travels and travails, Llewyn encounters people ranging from the genuine (his singing friends Jim and Jean, played by Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan) to the absurd (a rotund, blustery John Goodman). Oh, and a cat that travels with Llewyn - at least until he can get him or her back to the owner. The encounters with the genuine folks feel just as normal as if you or I encountered them; those with the more absurd of the lot feel perfectly surreal, and when they do end one almost wonders if we've all imagined the encounters through Llewyn himself.The music is beautiful and moving. Isaac himself performs Llewyn's songs, with a sweet, vulnerable voice that offers a touch of soul to Llewyn's otherwise-bleak surroundings. When Llewyn is really on, you can feel his pain leap right off the screen into your brain; when he appears to be going through the motions and not singing from his heart, you can feel the lack of depth that his intended audience also feels. Isaac is just flat-out terrific.Ultimately, it is Isaac and the music that push this film into the territory of great cinema. The story itself is stark, moody, unyielding - just like a New York City winter, really. And the movie, like Llewyn's own life, appears to have no point - except to illustrate just how pointless Llewyn is making his life, through his stubborn marriage to his craft and a desire to stay uprooted",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Watch it for the music, the feel of 1960s New York, and Oscar Isaac's Performance","If people love or hate this movie, I really don't get it either way. I'm middle of the road. I enjoyed the music, the atmosphere -- which is rather dreary, but it is NYC during winter -- and Oscar Isaac's performance.Some reviewers said Davis' character wasn't especially likeable, but anyone who would carry a friend's cat all over Manhattan, while also toting a guitar and an overnight bag, because he was responsible for letting it getting out of the apartment can't be a bad guy.I understand his frustration. For anyone who has ever tried to do something hard for the love of it while hoping enough people would care that it would make a difference but felt like most everything was against you, there's a poignant message here.I chased my viewing with a whiskey on the rocks and didn't regret the two hours I spent. Why some musicians (and writers and artists and actors) fail and others who aren't any more talented, maybe even less so make it is a mystery of the universe.And for the record, I would rather listen to Llewyn Davis than Bob Dylan any day of the week.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful Cinematography, Captivating, Worth Seeing Again","Saw the prescreening at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, MI with average expectations, this is my reaction:This film is an experience, but not for any sort of superficial special effects, action or CGI. It's an experience in which you will feel fear, joy, hate, hope, sorrow and contempt all within an hour and 45 minutes that feels more like 15 minutes. We are sidelined, watching a short snippet of Llewyn's seemingly dismal life, drudge on by, yet we are drawn. We connect with Lleywn's anger and struggles, as if we too are burdened by his failures and challenges. But amongst the bad, there are moments of cheer, and laughter and peace reminding us that good still exists. What dominates is power, balanced by music, money and pride, yet this movie is better served as a reminder that life is an experience, and individualistic. We are reminded that more often than not, things do not fall into place and luck is rarely on our side. But no matter how many times people fail you, one should never fail, before one's self. This movie is an experience, it indirectly breaths life into each of our souls, and should appeal to anyone in touch with the most crucial human emotions: compassion and empathy. Hold on tight, because it is one experience that will remain with you long after the credits are through. Perfectly casted, perfectly scripted, perfectly filmed; perfectly entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Marvellous musical masterpiece,"There have been movies made about musicians, both real and imagined, from End of the Century through I'm Not There, taking in The Future is Unwritten and A Mighty Wind. We've had almost every conceivable approach, from straight-up documentary through imagined version of events as well as completely invented bands, singers, songs, and concerts. Yet, I don't think that anyone has ever managed to do what the Coen Brothers have produced with this tragic, comedic, touching piece.Which is to essentially transport you into the grooves of an LP, Inside Llewyn Davies, and bring you a beautifully realised portrayal of the eponymous hero as he trudges his weary way through the greys and greens of Greenwich Village in a cold New York. And it is so reminiscent of the experience of listening to your favourite vinyl album from track one, side one to the final track of side two, whilst curling up on the couch with a cat in your lap, listening to a selection of melodic, melancholic, traditional, and new folk music.The music binds this movie together and Oscar Issac inhabits the title role in a world-weary way that aches with ennui and longs for something never expressed. We follow his tramping travails through a range of vignettes that build subtly towards creating a quite compelling picture of the man behind the music. He sometimes does what we expect and at other junctures, veers off in a mad new direction. There is little explanation for any of the decisions that he does, or doesn't, take. He's searching without any clear idea of the quest.Along the way, we meet a wonderfully diverse bunch of supporting characters, from the biting Jean, acerbic tongue and acid looks, through the snoring bully Roland Turner and his valet Johnny Five, as well as Mitch and Lilian, the Upper West posh couple, but especially Ulysses, our hero's apparent companion over the week (or was s/he?). They all offer opportunities to understand Davies' psyche slightly more, albeit admitting that not even he appears to be fully cognisant himself.It's a lovely looking film, beautifully shot and much more enjoyable that I would have believed possible from watching the trailer previously. T Bone Burnett has done a sterling job on the soundtrack, it's so affecting and the way that the songs are all allowed to play out saw the audience in the cinema in which I saw this mainly remaining seated through the end credits as well. Which brings me back to the vinyl album sensation. You don't pick up the needle when your favorite record is playing the final track, because you want to get on with something else instead. No. You let it run right to the end of the groove and then your heart fills with an equal mixture of pleasure and joy, sorrow and sighs, as the last bars fade to quiet and all that's gone before becomes a memory that's so strong and so addictive that you want to turn it over and put the needle back into the groove all over again.This movie is precisely like that sensation and I loved it, from first frame to last. A quiet understated tragi-comedy, dark in places, and shadowy in others, but with a humanity and a compassion that you cannot avert our gaze from. Hell, it's even got a coda of a scene to be dealing with, which at the end takes your mind back to the start of the production and forces one to reexamine what has just passed before your eyes.

"There is a creative sadness in here, but it is heavily masked in sporadic plotting, hidden meaning and a dreary tone","Like almost everyone who loved or hated this film, I do generally like the Coen brothers and am not against having to do work to enjoy and appreciate a film. This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of ""you'll not appreciate it"" but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.I really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the ""week"" feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.The music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the ""blame"" (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.Full of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant. I'm sure if you ""get it"" then it is a film to adore, but for me it just didn't work at all.",,Anonymous,Music
The Gloomy Innocence Of The Coen Bros,"It's like a gust of wind that never stops. I was altered, disturbed and amused by the clarity of this poets. From Joel and Ethan to Bruno Delbonnel, Oscar Isaac, to T Bone Burnett and everyone who enters, even for an instant, this sublime, unique, startling P.O.V. Aware but never condescending to the audience. No explanation as to why this story deserved to be told. The answers are private, deeply personal, enlightening and, at times, chillingly transparent. The face of Oscar Isaac, my God! For me one of the most enthralling discoveries of 2013. At times it reminded me of an updated character in an Italian Neo-realistic film, others one of those images from one of Martin Donovan's sessions. I sat through Inside Llewyn Davis twice in a row.

Stay Outside of 'Inside Llewyn Davis',"The wife and I have been looking forward to this film coming here ever since we saw previews in December. I enjoy most of the Coen Bros. movies and the quirky characters they create. Unfortunately, this contained none of those, and was a chore to sit through. Some of the encounters are entertaining, but overall, the story just isn't that interesting. The music got rather tiresome after a while as well. Something a little up-beat thrown in might have helped keep me from fighting against my eyelids. There was very little to laugh at here as well, which is also not generally the case with the Coen Bros. Hopefully their next effort will be back in form. I don't know that even the die-hards will enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Great Coen Brothers Film,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a hard film to quantify. It is very much a Coen Brothers movie, and it is very much its own thing. I did not know the history of the story. I did not know the story behind the Gaslight club in New York nor did I know of the famous figure who started at the bar back in 1961 when the film takes place. I found out after the film was over. However, not knowing that, I still thought this was an incredible movie.There are oddly poetic scenes in the film. There is a scene where the main character Llewyn Davis hits a cat with his car. As he watches the cat limp away into the darkness injured, I felt that it was an interesting image that seemed to mirror Llewyn's life in the film. Although I was aware of the poetic aspect of the film, I did not feel that they were forced moments. In interviews the Coen Brothers always seem to play dumb. In an interview for this film the Coen Brothers talked about the cat in the movie, and how they didn't know what to do with the story, so they threw in a cat. Anybody who has seen a Coen Brothers movie can appreciate that this is far from the truth. Every moment and image seems to be very specifically placed, and that was the case for this movie as well.You can't judge this movie the same way you would judge every other film this year. It's almost as if the Coen Brothers have their own language that they are speaking, that the audience does not fully understand. We catch some things, and even with those few moments, I was mesmerized. Sometimes I really notice their style like in their film A Serious Man, and I find myself confused and bored, but this film felt very true to me. I sympathized with the main character and his struggles, perhaps because I consider myself a creative person as well, so I know how hard it is. At one point Llewyn says, ""I'm just so f-ing tired,"" this line says a lot more than just I want to sleep. It is something we can all relate to, a feeling of just wanting to give up, and in this way, the story is a universal one, but then again it's the Coen Brothers, so automatically I know some people might not like it, but I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"""The lighting is great and subtle....""","The lighting is great and subtle, the photography is great -the light shades of colour are divine. We anticipate dark thoughts when we visit the Coen Brothers -unknown and familiar themes that enter along a corridor that runs on a threadbare thread that connects in a world of early morning travel.In a gentle way, this is lovely film, and subtle with its comedy - with one strange act of violence that reappears as though the film is set in rotation? But there never seems an end or a conclusion from the road of travel to the arrival of another gig.A ginger cat accompanies the songwriter, and I guess this has a meaning in a sublime of thought of creative freedom?

The viewer though, becomes mildly tired on a journey of creative and artistic adventure of anticipation.The film is great though, but flawed in identification: The anti film: like a 'rolling stone that gathers no moss'. We are never allowed to forget the hallmarks of a Coen film; strange though it may seem -are we missing a third Coen brother to make the film three dimensional?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Oscar Isaac is Incredible!  Coens Best Since 'Fargo',"I am completely smitten. I have long admired Joel Coen and Ethan Coen  and what they have offered the realm of cinema. I am in love with  ""Fargo"" still until this day, and they've provided solid efforts on  nearly every outing since. Their newest endeavor that focuses on the  folk scene in 1961 is an absolute dream. Everything from the impeccable  Oscar Isaac to the music that enriches the deepest trenches of the  soul, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is one of the best pictures of the year,  plain and simple. It's the Coen Brothers finest film since ""Fargo.""  Our story begins with a folk singer, Llewyn Davis that has continued to  pursue a music career in 1961 despite being penniless and lacking any  real stability. Migrating from couch to couch, we get a deep look into  a character with a dream that just won't die. As he fights for his  chance to share his voice with the world, following an unexpected loss  of his singing partner, Llewyn is hard to love. He makes poor choices  and seems to lack any responsibility in his life. It's a wonderful  creation of a character that offers insight into a changing time in our  history.  First of all, I can't get the amazing music out of my head. All the  songs used are absolutely brilliant. Oscar Isaac's richly matured tone  is so soothing and authentic; I'm surprised a music company hasn't  nabbed him up to make a record yet. His opening and closing songs are  his, as well as the film's, pivotal moments that encapsulate the  endearing message and theme. ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" and ""Fare Thee Well  (Dink's Song)"" are astonishing records that may not just fall into an  Oscar race but a Grammy wouldn't shock me in the least. It has the same  magical effect as ""Searching for Sugar Man,"" two films that seemed to  capture the innocence and culture of a generation that seems lost. In  terms of performance, Isaac is incredible. So raw and genuine, it's one  of the year's finest performances by any actor. He has made himself one  of the most exciting actors to watch in the coming years. This will  lead him into more challenging and accessible roles. This guy could  become one of our finest actors in just five years' time. This is  something that should land him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. It's  very much deserved.  In their respective but short screen times, John Goodman, Garrett  Hedlund, and Carey Mulligan are all infectious and notable. Goodman  plays a character similar to his ""Harling Mays"" from Robert Zemeckis'  ""Flight"" and makes the most out of his appearance. Mulligan is volatile  and I loved every second of her. She brings lots of dark humor and fire  to a role that shows the depth of her abilities as an actress who can  perform impeccably in any genre. We even get her singing again which  had me melt two years ago during her ""New York, New York"" in Steve  McQueen's ""Shame."" Hedlund comes and goes but makes his mark as he  often does.  Justin Timberlake has made a seamless transition from musician to actor  and back to musician. Great in roles like ""The Social Network"" where  his star power doesn't distract from the story at hand, in a Coen  Brothers film, where he sings (in a very current pop way), he becomes a  bit distracting. I was very aware that Timberlake, probably this  generation's Michael Jackson, was sharing the screen. More than likely  not his fault, it could be a case of being ""too big"" for your movie.  One thing that the film has taught mewe need to give Adam Driver more  movie roles. Timberlake, Isaac, and Driver put their marks on one of  the songs ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" and make it one of the year's most fun  and remarkable numbers.  Joel and Ethan Coen continue to show their ranges in directing and  writing. Flawlessly executed in character understanding and keeping our  story moving. Llewyn Davis is such a complex and interesting man and  their screenplay gives Isaac room to breathe and explore the subtle  nuances that make his character unique and real. As their alter ego  Roderick Jaynes, the film moves like a smooth monorail, hitting all its  marks and picking up new and exciting quirks along the way.  An almost silver-green canvas evokes the dark and grey tones of the New  York scene in 1961. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel masterfully  captures the ticks and beats of Isaac as he sings with heartbreaking  emotion and walks through the frigid cold streets. Jess Gonchor's  production design places us all in the folk scene, with intimate bar  settings, old-time music studios, and even the classic feel of a  Greenwich Village apartment building.  CBS Films has a gem on their hands with ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" A sure-  fire Oscar contender in several categories including Best Picture. If  there's any justice in the film world, Oscar Isaac would firmly sit  near the top of the finest performances of 2013 in Best Actor and nab  nearly every award he comes in contact with. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is  sensational and an instant classic to be remembered.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The anti social musical film,"Llewyn Davis, a struggling folk singer. He's not so successful in his professional as well as personal life.
He has quite a relationship with cats. Doesn't have enough money to sustain his daily days. Doesn't have a home and is a wanderer. The people he loves despises him and he despises other people.
The film shows you the ups & downs or more like downs & downs of llewyn's life. Towards the end of the film the character's depression was quite visible.
The story progression of the film is really interesting.
The cinematography is quite basic and yet pretty.
The tonality & ambience of the film is very unique, very soft, dreamy & quite soluble. You'll doubt whether you're sleepy or it is the film which is like that.
Oscar Isaac played Llewyn very well.
An underappreciated & great musical film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Isaac brings a realistic Davis to life, but the segments don't combine to form anything greater than an ordinary character study","A question that's always fascinated me is: if you made a movie with all excellent technical elements - great cinematography, strong acting, good direction, and a realistic slice of life script about an ordinary person with no greater ideas in play, how would it be received? This doesn't sound too different to me from this movie, or from Boyhood, and yet both were universally acclaimed. While the quality certainly provides a floor, I do think there have to be some story, ideas, or characters to engage the audience to make it a great movie. In Inside Llewyn Davis, we get the picture of a struggling 60s musician. Isaac is extremely impressive both in the musical scenes and in portraying his complex character. We get several story threads - the cat, Jean, John Goodman in the car, and then his music and career at the end. I didn't feel that these threads tied together to create a defining idea of motif. It's undeniably well made, but is it enjoyable or do I feel any emotional attachment to Davis? Not quite, and honestly I don't even have that great a sense of his defining characteristics, aside from struggling to get by, making people mad, and caring about music. It's a slice of life movie that doesn't go anywhere or do anything new for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece.,"This is one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year, one of those films in which you can't really appreciate what you've seen until it's over. You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is. The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Sad and Tedious but beautifully filmed 7/10,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a special odd film by The Coen Brothers. It is slow, beautifully filmed and with a strong slap to the face about success in life. And the struggles of one person to achieve his goal.What I find so empathic about the film and Llewyn's character is how realistic and reliable it is to a modern day person figuring himself out and chasing his dream.From the very first frame, you can see this movie is filmed really well (Shout out to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel). The Dark and cold colors add perfectly to the tone and whether of the film. Not only the whether in the movie is Fall but the characters themselves have a cold persona.The cast is brilliant, Oscar Isaac with another key role in his amazing career, Carey Mulligan is wonderful and serves as a character who puts the mirror in front of Llewyn to showcase what is wrong with him.John Goodman and Geralt Hedlund joined in for the ride (literally). And Justin Timberlake has a nice small role as well as performing.My favorite scene had to be when Llewyn, jim and Al Kodi were performing on set together. Great scene with nice chemistry among characters.The only thing I feel a little conflicted about was the plot in general, throughout the whole movie Llewyn has his ups and downs (mostly downs) and didn't seem to be going anywhere, nor he or the story. It just felt stuck.Even the ending is the exact same scenario we've seen in the beginning of the film. Bringing it to both a closed but opened situation.I understand if viewers would have felt a little cheated by the end, but do take in consideration that the Coen Brothers Normally end their movies with both a closed and opened ending, with their characters either evolving or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
really really really really good,Great story about an artist who has lost his passion in the thing he loves and is still struggling to accomplish what he's had been trying to do with his partner; become a successful folk musician. What we see is the antithesis of what you'd expect from the Greenwich folk crowd which is a community of people who love this music and support each other because of it. What we see is a man's dead dreams and his struggle to even remember anything that was good about them. Brilliant music performances.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
7/10,"Oscar Isaac is the freaking man and don't you forget it. Not the best Coens by a long shot, but it was raw, funny, and sad. The music was great, and it all felt real. I enjoyed this trip.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Another near masterpiece from the Coens,"Like Barton Fink before him Llewyn Davis is a man struggling to make the big break and the bucks whilst not compromising his artistic integrity.I love the music, i love the performances, the script and the photography. That road trip sequence is beautifully shot with the stop at the Kubrickian diner memorable.The whole thing has an other wordly, dream like feel to it as we watch this musician get colder more tired and more broke and pushed further out into the margins. I empathise with him even though he can be an arrogant and abusive swine.Its also very very funny. I dont think the Coens have written a funnier line than ""Where's its scrotum?"" and then John Goodman and his valet come into the picture and its gets funnier still.With the greatest singer songwriter of all time following him on stage at the end i thought it was a symbol of things to come where Dylan rises and rises to legendary status, Llewyn is assigned to the category of also rans as he again recovers from a beating by his conscience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Darker Slice of Life Tribute to Folk Music,"""Life is a journey"", but if you see anything romantic in that statement, you are not Llewyn Davis. It almost appears like he is on the verge of loving his art, - but without this love he is going nowhere fast. He sings his heart out but is his heart really in it, or is he just trying to scrape a few nickels together; keep on keeping on until he achieves some version of success in the music world?But I wonder if the desperation portrayed in this movie is merely applying today's negative image of a penniless couch-surfer onto what was a more dynamic, and younger 1960's Greenwich - where musicians sleeping on couches might have been the norm - and might not have been such a bad time (especially if you factor in the marijuana which the movie completely overlooked). In any event, if you're not having fun doing it, maybe you're not in it for the right reasons. The script seemed designed to extract as much emotional punishment out of each scene as possible. Don't worry, this isn't the suffering of child-laborers in Africa. In the end we're supposed to care for an under-appreciated artist - amongst many - trying to make the world a better place, hopefully, like an artist should. Good to acknowledge that. History has lost masterpieces, no doubt. ""Without the flower the branch shall die""Strange situations and strange people materialize in fun Coen brothers fashion, and we have to draw out some important symbolism. Characters emerge but are left - like his past - not fully developed or explained. This one's got a little of the blues in it. You are better off rooting for the cat.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A True Labor of Love,"Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)**** (out of 4)The Coen Brother's latest takes place in 1961 at Greenwich Village during the folk scene as struggling artist Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) tries to make decisions on his future. I'm not going to reveal too much about the plot but I must say this is quite the jewel and that I loved every single frame of the picture. When it comes to the Coen's films, I usually find them very good but never at a ""great"" level but this here is certainly an exception. Being someone familiar with the time and setting, I thought the directors did a remarkable job at really capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the era. The cinematography is without question some of the best that you're ever going to see and the entire look of the picture reminded me of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" album cover. The soundtrack is also a terrific one with all of the numbers really jumping off the screen. Within seconds you're caught up in the lyrics and the music. The entire film takes place within a week, which is just perfect for the journey that Davis goes on as he tries to express himself through the various ups and downs of his life. I really thought the screenplay did a marvelous job at building up a complete and full leading character but it was also quite excellent when it comes to the supporting players and their impact on Davis. The performances are certainly a major plus with Isaac doing a marvelous job in the lead role. I really loved the way he brought this character to life and especially the various moods that he goes through. This includes some very dark moments in the film but also some pretty funny ones where his mouth gets him into trouble. The supporting players include very good turns from Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman is simply divine in his small role. The directors have obviously put a lot of love and affection into this project and it shines through during every single scene. This probably isn't going to be a film that appeals to the masses but those who appreciate cinema are bound to love it.",,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie for showing the complexities of art & success from the point of view of a struggling musician.,"To be honest, this typical film might be boring for ordinary and amateur film enjoyer like me because the pacing is very slow, there are no fantastic scenes and actions, eke plot twists in it. However, this film is very thick with the deepening story of the main character. The complexity of Llewyn Davis' character is very well illustrated by the extraordinary acting of Oscar Isaac and WOW He really can Sing! Throughout the film, the atmosphere is very melancholic, sad, and depressing which makes the visuals and music sink me deep to join into the story and sympathize with all the hardships and struggles that Llewyn is experiencing.The most impressive scene is when Llewyn perform for Bud Grossman, with a full emotions and great performance, but still, in Grossman's eyes, Llewyn is not impressive enough for the industry. The scene felt so realistic and somehow satisfied me. Even though the storyline is relatively flat, there are no super actions or surprises, this film depicts the sacrifices, struggles and realities faced by musicians for a career in the music industry. Digging deep in an effort to achieve success that feels very realistic because in fact the journey to success is not always smooth, right?Overall, I can enjoy this film as well as being my springboard to be able to explore more genres of drama films with a slow pacing and a focus on in-depth character narratives with hopes for the future, not just films with fantastic scenes or full of plot twists that can impress me, but melancholic musical drama films like Inside Llewyn Davis can also be an inspiration and an entertainment that I can enjoy.

You're a folk singer? Oh I thought you were a musician,"The first decade of the new century saw a lot of biopics about musicians. Think about ""Ray"" (2004, Taylor Hackford, about Ray Charles), ""Walk the line"" (2005, James Mangold, about Johnny Cash) and ""I'm not there"" (2007, Todd Haynes, about Bob Dylan).A few years later Joel and Ethan Coen made their own biopic, but they did it their way. In the first place their subject Dave van Ronk (after which the main character Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) is modeled) is of course much less famous than the stars mentioned above. In the second place the film does not portray Dave van Ronk in his heyday but in his early years at the beginning of the 1960's. After auditioning at a record company the manager asks him if he is interested in being a background vocal.Last but not least the film is not solely a biopic but is also portraying the cultural scene in New York at the easrly 60's in which folk acts had to compete with jazz and gospel. When Llewyn tells a jazz musician that he is a folk singer the reaction is: ""Oh, I thought you were a musician"".The movie lacks a concrete storyline, but as compensation there are some colorful support characters. Best of them is in my opinion jazz musician Roland Turner played by John Goodman. Indeed, the one of the quote above.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A poignant character study during the 1960s folk scene,"Despite hearing about how great the Coen brothers are, I've barely seen any of their films apart from The Big Lebowski. After seeing Inside Llewyn Davis, I really want to check out more of their stuff.Inside Llewyn Davis takes us through a week in the life of a young folk singer named Llewyn Davis in 1961.I love character studies and Inside Llewyn Davis is practically that. We really learn more and more about the protagonist, Llewyn Davis, and it's one of those character studies that left me thinking well after it ended. It's such a poignant film that doesn't follow any clichés or typical Hollywood tropes and the film could have taken that route but I'm glad it didn't. Not much really happens but each scene feels so purposeful towards Llewyn's journey and struggle. As the film goes on it made me realise what a flawed person Llewyn really is but at the same time I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him. I don't listen to folk music at all but all the songs were wonderful. Not only was Oscar Isaac's singing great but the Coen brothers did a great job instilling meaning into each of the songs especially the ones sung by Llewyn Davis. By learning more about him and the way he's constantly being beaten down by the world around him, the meaning behind the lyrics of his songs became more powerful to me and helped me understand his mindset better.I also loved the visual look of the film. The lighting and lack of bright colours made the movie feel incredibly gloomy and depressing which perfectly matched the overall tone and story. The film is definitely a depressing one but the Coens sprinkle humour here and there which allowed for some lighthearted moments. This is my favourite performance given by Oscar Isaac. I learnt he is a great singer and he absolutely nails the character. Carey Mulligan was also very good and Justin Timberlake also did gave a great performance. John Goodman is fantastic here and gives us some of the best scenes in the film.I'm seriously impressed with what the Coen brothers did with Inside Llewyn Davis. It's a film that takes its time but doesn't waste it. It won't be to everybody's liking but if you're a fan of folk music and character based films then I would highly recommend watching Inside Llewyn Davis.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Music Provides a Gateway to the Hidden Soul,"A somber, often morose walk through the self-imposed daily miseries of a struggling musician at the onset of the '60s folk revival. Strangely paced and often lingering, like many Coen brothers films, it's densely packed with backstory that, while only hinted, reverberates as though it had been fully explored. Llewyn carries several weights with him; a disintegrating family, several failed relationships, a constant need to seek out empty couches for the night and a personal guilt for never quite cracking the big-time. He's a cold character, quick with angry outbursts and hurtful words, but we see a hidden warmth when he wraps his arms around a guitar and steps up to the mic. The film as a whole cherishes such musical interludes, shines them like a flashlight upon each character's innermost spirit: troubled, worried, silly, it's all out in the open on the stage, no matter how guarded the individual may be away from those bright lights. The plot doesn't have a lot of direction - at the core, it's a relatively unspectacular week in the life of a nobody - and that can make it dull and plodding at times. It touches a lot of emotions, though, from laugh-out-loud funny to quietly desolate, and the quality of the music makes up for a lot of its shortcomings. A worthwhile journey, if not a spectacular one.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Great music, downbeat hero.","""...And what, just exist?"" Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac)Folk singing in 1961 was far preferable to working the unromantic Merchant Marine, to which the eponymous hero of Llewyn Davis might have to return at the suggestion of his sister, Joy (Jeanine Serralles) and for his lack of success. The Coens have again crafted a tale of a hero not going anywhere but trudging along waiting for something to happen (think Libowski journeying for a carpet).Llewyn sings gallows songs in smoky coffeehouses (one is the real Gate of Horn, which also is a reference to one of Penelope's comments in the Odyssey) and finds a place to crash at night, sometimes with a friend and his wife, whom Llewyn may have impregnated. Along the way he's inadvertently responsible for a savvy orange cat named Ulysses, either a symbol of our hero's wanderings to get home or of Holly Golightly's ""Cat"" in need of a home.The film is aimless itself, mostly a pastiche of possibilities for a singer who is good but lacking a spark to take him to the Bob Dylan level, or even remotely to that peak. He's not even smart enough to forsake a quick pay for future royalties from a song he helped produce, Please, Mr. Kennedy.The Coens have set the gloomy scene with a grey mise en scene evoking the faded albums and hopes beautifully lensed by Roger Deakins' substitute, Bruno Debonnel (Deakins was doing Skyfall at the time). While Llewyn's songs are very much in the folk tradition, they do nothing to relieve the despair.Coen Bros fans must see Inside Llewyn Davis regardless of its despair. It evokes an era with gorgeous, somber photography and an eponymous hero in the vein of Libowski or O'Brother.In all, the film is a Homeric demythologizing of an age when Jack Kennedy was still alive and hope had not yet been checked. The film's ending with the same violent beginning presages the dismal cycle of loss that is Llewyn's lot and ours.We have been inside Llewyn Davis and it's not all that pretty.",,Anonymous,Music

Not what folk music was about,"Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) was written and directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.The film is about a struggling folk musician who can't support himself by singing. We're to assume that he's right at the brink of the folk revival of the 60's, and he's poised to become a star. All he has to do is earn enough money to survive until Bob Dylan and Joan Baez come along to make folk music profitable.The story doesn't work for me. In the first place, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) isn't all that talented. (We heard folk music in Ann Arbor, NYC, and Newport in the 1960's, and Llewyn would have been considered OK, but nothing special).He doesn't appear to have any feel for the music in the sense of where it originated, who may have sung it before, and what historical significance it might have.He makes fun of an older folk singer, who may be meant to represent someone like Jean Ritchie from Kentucky. Urban folk musicians respected people who learned folk music through the oral tradition. They didn't make fun of them. (Anyway, as a performing artist, Llewyn should have realized how vicious it is to heckle an onstage performer.)Folk music in the 1960's was always allied with labor struggles, civil rights, and other progressive causes, but Llewyn appears apolitical.In the movie posters, he's shown carrying a cat. That makes us think that he may not have a place to sleep, but he's not going to abandon his cat. Actually, it's not his cat, and he does abandon it eventually.Finally, his behavior towards his sister is rotten, he betrays his best friend by having an affair with his friend's partner, and he's cruel to an older couple who try to help him.Even though the Coen brothers are talented directors, I don't see why people would enjoy a film about a low-talent, unlikeable loser. If you still want to see it, it will work well on DVD.P.S. This movie includes a road trip from NYC to Chicago. Note to Coen brothers: In 1961 the route between those two cities was not uncharted frontier territory. There were highways and expressways and people used them.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Coen Brothers' love letter to folk music.,"""The George Washington Bridge? You throw yourself off the Brooklyn Bridgetraditionally."" Inside Llewyn Davis' witty one-liners are just one of the conventions to typically feature in a Coen Brothers collaboration.Musician Llewyn Davis (earnestly played by Oscar Isaac) journeys the competitive folk music circuit with nowhere to call home; just like the records he produces, the guitarist goes round and round in circles, as he contends with life's many curveballs.

He sings himself and he can apparently sing. But he doesn't treat the character like a saint or someone without flaws. There is a lot wrong with him, but you have to embrace that.

"A solid, symbolic character study from the Coen Brothers","Inside Llewyn Davis is the latest film from the Coen Brothers, a drama centred around the Folk scene in the winter of 1961 in New York City, following Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a folk singer who has a amazing ability to rub people the wrong way and sofa surfs around Greenwich Village, attempts to make a living on his music and struggling to survive as he maintains he fulfils his dreams.Inside Llewyn Davis has an incredible cast with the likes of Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and Sally Hawkins. All of them give excellent performance and are armed with a sombre script that is still filled with wit and play well rounded and realised characters. Mulligan was blessed with the best lines and jokes in the film. The film has an excellent soundtrack, with songs sung live and performed in full.Llewyn is a unlikeable character as he enters into a world of self-destruction as he tries to juggle his life and be successful, but gain quick money. But there is reason as he is struggling with his brief whilst the cat serves as a symbol of the ups and downs of journey and showcasing his character.Inside Llewyn Davis has a great bleak look thanks to Bruno Delboonel, adding to the downbeat tone the Coens were going for as we follow Llewyn on his journey and see him into a vicious circle.7.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The Odyssey of Most Existence,"""Inside Llewyn Davis"" a film directed and written by Joel and Ethan Joel Coen was released in 2013. The Coen Brothers had made some very good movies, most of them have a tinge of humor, even if it's irony or sarcasm, and I love it.This film starring Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis, Carey Mulligan as Jill, Justin Timberlake as Jim, as well as John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, Adam Driver, and others, was executed flawlessly. The story centers around Llewyn Davis. It is a week in the life of Llewyn Davis.Davis lives on friends' couches moving from one gig to the next trying to make it as a folk music singer in Greenwich Village in New York City in 1961. While ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" was the Coen Brothers' story about a group of escaped convicts in search of buried treasure, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is more of a solo odyssey through a more modern world of surviving week to week, paycheck to paycheck, always missing the big break, always in search of somewhere new to stay, for just one night.The film's central themes include grief and loss, purpose, and belonging. Like only the Coen Brothers can, the film does a great job of communicating so much without explicitly saying something leaving the viewer to decide for themselves and reflect on their own existence.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Theirs is a style that takes a trait of humanity, cranks it up to 11, and puts it through its paces. In this case, they take on people who purposely sabotage their own happiness.The film follows Llewyn Davis who, recklessly and tortuously, destroys his relationships at every opportunity. Time after time after time, he returns kindness with selfishness; responsibility with irresponsibility; support with abandonment. Grossly judgmental, incredibly unsympathetic, utterly foolish, this is a man who brings on his own suffering with an odd sort of sustained glee. He seems to revel in his own misery, constantly making bad decisions, and then getting mad at those who did what he told them to do.This is an odd juxtaposition with his chosen artistic pursuit: folk singing. Folk singing is all about empathy and connection, but Llewyn can't empathize, and definitely can't connect. This is pointed out to him time after time after time, but he just doesn't pick up on it. At all. Therefore, he fails. He is very similar to his co-star, Ulysses, a cat who (in a very characteristically cat-like manner) seems disconnected from what is happening around him, until it's time to wake someone else up from a sound sleep.It's not a bad film, there are some quirky, funny moments in it. But I gave it 7 out of 10 because it lacks that characteristic ""special heartwarming spark"" of a Coen Brothers film. ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""Hudsucker Proxy"", and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" had a heartwarming character or situation to help pull you out of the morass of darkness, intentionally acting as counter-point to the misery of life; but ""Llewyn Davis"" doesn't really have this. I suppose the cat is meant to fill this role (there is a neat little moment when Llewyn and the cat track each other's expressions quite effectively), but it doesn't really work as well as (possibly) intentioned.An OK movie. Not the Coen Brothers' best.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
the Chilly Blue palette of the folk of NYC,"Once you get used to the washed-out, chilly-blue color scheme, it's another sad-funny tale from the Coens, mostly sad for how much life, bad luck and sometimes his own choices kicks the (albeit sometimes d*ckkish) downtrodden folk singer Llewyn Davis in the teeth. He's a captivating protagonist, possibly for all the wrong reasons (in another hands): he's not a 'cool' person to be around most of the time, he's prickly, he doesn't get along very well with the women in his life (well, certainly one, played by Carey Mulligan, her very best work yet, like revelatory), and yet he's very talented and has some soul.But it's a soulful film, about a subject that doesn't get touched on enough which is the creative person who just can't seem to breakthrough. What happens to those who have the good stuff but can't get to that one next step, or connect with a wide audience like some of Davis' other contemporaries do? What happens when the Man With The Keys that can get you into the business says, ""I don't see a lot of money here?"" As a creative person/artist myself, this movie had the air of a documentary in that sense. Well... Bob Dylan can rip you off, apparently.Oscar Issac gets his breakthrough here, I must add. He makes this guy compulsively watchable and even if we don't always like him he is a real person, he's someone with a lot of warts and Isaac doesn't shy away from showing that (via the Coens' blisteringly comic/dramatic script). And for all the moments that spark out as being piercingly funny - any of John Goodman's scenes, talk about stylized, over-the-top dialog being performed with just the hint of humanity and devilishness - it's more drama than comedy. There's a scene where Davis goes to see his father, who isn't doing too well. How this unfolds, how the shots go between father and son as he plays him a song, you almost want to cry watching it. If it's not one of, you know, the Coen's top 5 best or whatever that means, it's an impressive, quality film that will last and be a kind of genuine document of that period in 1960/1961 when folks was a thing that could matter.And the morale of the story is.... take good care of your cat.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Really Good....,"A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" has been highly acclaimed, and was voted the 11th best film of the 21st century by 177 critics in a 2016 BBC Culture poll. This is very shocking. The film is indeed quite good, but 11th best film of the last 15 years? That is high praise, especially for a film that barely got noticed by the Academy.What I enjoyed most was the music, as I'm sure most people did. Having Justin Timberlake involved was a smart move, both for the film and for him. I have been quite impressed how his singing and acting have outgrown his boy band image. Very few of his era have made the transition so smoothly.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful,"It's a great story, incredibly well told.The Coens continue to hone their own craft, and work with able others to create truly fantastic spectacle. Watching this comes close to tipping me over to the view that they do drama better than they do comedy... but I'll demur: They're non-overlapping magisteria.I've observed other very good, very descriptive comments in these IMDb User Comments, so I'll leave it here and send you there. The stuff folks point out--the faithful reproduction of intimate artistic moments; a portrayal that makes the invisible visible; all production details lovingly attended to--is wonderfully true.My only qualifier to all the above comes down to whether you find this kind of slice-of-life, everyman heroism compelling.But I'll add this: If you tend to characterize all that as hoity-toity art-house frippery, I'll send you to this flick, anyway: I daresay it just might bring you around.Check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pet peeve of mine...,"I am no fan of expletives. I think there is too much of this going on in society and in movies in general.So, to use the f-word in this movie is not even attempting to reflect the swearing that took place during the time period represented. Virtually no one used that word as it was certainly deemed too crude (in fact if you go back only 15 years or so in the US, the f-word was not used nearly as much as it is today in general conversation).I say bad on the Coen brothers in this regard for selling out to contemporary American culture, instead of staying true to the time period.Otherwise, I enjoyed the film and it was a typical creative Coen brothers work.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not much, but something","A pure-voiced folk singer hitches rides on the road to stardom, but is that really his destination?Rich story of what is basically a road trip, if you include the sofa-surfing as part of the journey. This is billed as a comedy - with the Coens I'm never sure - and it turns out short on laughs, long on irony - although there is one purely joyous scene in the studio recording of a hit song.The characters are well drawn and performed, the dialogue always engaging, leaving plenty to chew over. Pace is good too, with mature editing that gives the whole thing energy and fullness. Only complaints: I couldn't figure out what happened to the cat on the road, and the jazz man briefly muttered something I didn't catch.Early '60s Manhattan is well evoked, with just one obvious distortion in the teeny narrow hallway with apartment doors facing each other. There's a procession of grotesque characters and events, with a couple of abruptly bizarre notes from the jazz man and his beat poet, but also some epic domestic moments involving two pregnancies that leave indelible marks on the hero's life.The music soundtrack is impressive, with clear depth of production and history delivered by the film-makers. The whopping irony of the final performer in the folk club puts the whole thing in perspective, but I got a giggle from the salute previous to that in the acapella version of the Old Triangle from the Aran sweater-clad Clancy brothers.In the end, we discover the name of the cat, which is a signal to think of the story in a different way. This may be a low key tragedy of the talent that could have been, but I think that misses the point: it's really a journey home, with a sense of regret but no hard feelings - or at least none that the hero can't adapt to. Beyond that, maybe there's a joke in there about wasted semen. Is that just me? I'll stop right now.Overall: the ironies of a wasted life add up to something.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Gorgeous Elegy from the Coen Brothers,"For every Bob Dylan out there, there are hundreds, probably thousands, of musicians who don't make it. Many of them are even very talented, but they're lacking whatever it is they need to break out and become a star.Meet Llewyn Davis, one of the thousands. Navigating the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s, Davis is a good singer of good songs, but he's stuck on an endless treadmill of existence of his own making. We don't feel sorry for him, because he's a jerk. But we, or at least I, feel compassion for him, because every time he opens his mouth to sing, he expresses the vulnerability and warm humanity that he's not able to express in any other way.The Coen brothers have created a vibrant, unsettling, marvelous movie with ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a dark night of the soul journey led by the actor Oscar Isaac, who plays the title character flawlessly. In this overcrowded movie awards season, it's criminal that this film got lost in the shuffle and that virtually no one seems to think it's worthy of serious awards attention. But then again, when I see the films that do win awards, it makes me think that maybe ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is in better company with things as they are.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen's... enough said,"Sometimes when you are with your friends you will go into those 'what if' scenarios. You know things like what if you found a million dollars, or what if you only had one week to live? I always remember someone asking me what would be the one thing you would grab if your house was on fire. Well I want to change that question to this: if you could only choose one filmmaker to always make movies, which would you, choose? How do you decide, when there are so many great filmmakers? Well my choice would be the Coen Brothers. Now I know what you are thinking, I said one filmmaker, and my answer happen to be brothers, but my response to that would be, when they direct and write their films they are like one incredible creative force.I choose the Coen's because they march to their own drummer and tell stories that always seem special, and memorable. They don't make movies that exist in the normal world; instead they invite you into their world. Now in the Coen's world there tends to be a lot of anger, but with that anger you also get passion and the most unique kind of humor as well. In their new film ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", they tell a story about a young folk singer trying to navigate Greenwich Village in 1961. That singer's name is Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), and if you couldn't guess by the name the story is about him. Llewyn is trying to cope with being on his own after his musical partner jumped off the George Washington Bridge. Although extremely talented things just don't seem to go right for Llewyn, and it is mostly his fault. You see Llewyn does not have the best attitude and always relies on the generosity of others to survive. It could be crashing with his friend's girlfriend Jean (Carey Mulligan) or getting work with Jim (Justin Timberklake) to help pay his debts. No matter how bad his life can get though, Llewyn can always escape into his music.I know why I love a Coen Brother's movie; to me it is just like comfort food. As in comfort food, you know what you are getting; you will get great characters, a great story, and a little added ""Coeness"" that makes their stories so special. While their movies have those central elements in common, their stories and themes are never the same. With ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" everything is there and as with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" we get a great soundtrack to boot. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Llewyn Davis, who learned to play guitar for this role. In fact all of the musical scenes where actually recorded live during filming for an authentic sound. Everyone has a favorite Coen movie, because no two seem to ever be alike. The only thing they have in common is they are always seem to be one of the better movies of that year, and with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" that trend remains.Brian Taylorread this and other reviews @ http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A gem best viewed with an eye for depth,"** SPOILERS **Inside Llewyn Davis personally swept me away the first time I saw it and my head was swimming with the events throughout the story and the interpretations of them as I understood it. Please keep in mind as you read this that I'm speaking of art and interpretations are all they could possibly be, not anything concrete. But I have gathered that some people don't take much from the movie while I found at least the overall theme of an endless cycle to be pretty much blatant. Anywho this review is mostly for those viewers. So the most salient theme like I said is that of the endless cycle we follow Llewyn through. The relentless, crushing cycle of Llewyns life and the painful monotony of it all is only magnified by the casual way the viewer glimpses into it, as if it's inconsequential when the story starts or ends. I felt that in the last leg of the movie it was very obvious that this was simply another week in the life of Llewyn Davis. The constant familiar occurrences of a person making the same decisions in the same place, something not exclusive to a struggling musician but relevant all the same. It can be argued that none of these events are actually very significant, but simply tell Llewyns revolving story. The end is a kind of repeat of the beginning, but I feel convinced that some things may have not been there before when Llewyn experienced it. First I found that the poster Llewyn notices before his last gig seems very important. It's a movie poster that says ""The Fantastic Journey"" or something of the sort, a stimulus that to me suggests that Llewyns repetitive misadventures are not the end-all, but instead a means to an end. In other words the idea as I'm explaining it is that perhaps his story was not meaningless and it was a journey taking him to whatever's next. He plays his last gig and is socked by the same or similar goon as he was in the beginning, while Bob Dylan performs at the Gaslight, probably for the first time. If the goon represented the folk scene, or Llewyns environment in general (both of which were constantly ""kicking him down"" or whatever), then Llewyn literally says goodbye to that life at the end as the goon is driven away. This is placed perfectly with Bob Dylans performance because the monumental success of Dylans career was sure to be the final nail in Llewyns coffin. I also like to think that maybe there were signs earlier in the movie that Llewyn was staging his gradual exit. For instance, he got his shipping papers in order but there was a setback. So of course here he is playing The Gaslight again, and the cycle continues. Only now he is one big step closer to moving on and possibly, finally, being released from the cycle. So it can even be interpreted that any other week in this story is similar, but maybe peppered with these small steps. Another example of this is how he didn't let the cat out of the apartment the second time he left. Another small step. (The cat is a whole different review worth of speculation btw). Exceptional film. Perfectly executed I thought, and with a real artistic integrity. I think some people are bored by the music scenes, and I'm a musician so I really can't comment on that too objectively, but at the risk of sounding smug I can't help but say that if you didn't have the patience for the music scenes in this movie, or Treme, or things of the sort, then you really might not love music as much as you probably say you do.",,Anonymous,Music
An Interesting View of a Character No More/No Less,"The Coen's sometimes make small films. They have a frame of reference that others don't. This is the story of a man. If you don't like him, that's not a problem. He is a folk singer. He is doing his thing in a time when that genre was in great demand. But he is also a self-centered, living-day-to-day jerk who leaves messes in his wake. He wants to work, but has a disdainful view of his own accomplishments. He treats people who do kindnesses for him with the same disdain that he uses on strangers. He does nothing to ingratiate himself with the people who could help him. We don't know where he is going and neither does he. He ends up hooking a ride to Chicago with a taciturn driver known only as Johnny-5. In the back is the scene stealing John Goodman. The ten or so minutes in that car are some of the very best. Goodman taunts and pokes (literally, using a cane) Llewyn, calling him Elwyn. He is absolutely brutal and yet hilarious. When Llewyn arrives in Chicago, he has a brief audition with a producer played by F. Murray Abraham, who basically tells him he's okay, but he isn't hearing any money coming from him. This leads to more sidetracking of the old career, landing on more couches, trying to get back into the Merchant Marine, and more failed efforts. I think if those who are so disdainful of this film were to look at it more closely, there is a black humor that really works. The Coens are known for that. If you think that this is a picaresque offering where the main character learns his lesson, you aren't going to get that. Remember the scene in ""Fargo"" where the guy is putting the leg in the wood chipper and is scolded by Francis McDormand. He didn't learn anything either.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Strumimg our way through irony,"If I go now to the basement and look real hard, I can probably find the vinyl from that era: Dylan, Ochs, Van Ronk, Peter Paul and Mary. This film certainly has some personal nostalgia wrapped around it, even though the Coens were probably in grade school when this music was produced. Inside Llewyn Davis is a touching portrait of a musician down on his luck, a recurring Coen brothers theme. Llewyn (Oscar Issac) is a true talent, but a handful of unfortunate incidents have left him hamstrung emotionally, artistically and financially with just about everyone in his personal and professional world fed up with him.The music is beautiful, the acting excellent, the script tight and disciplined, but the movie just doesn't go anywhere. Unlike most other reviewers, I find Llewyn a warm and sympathetic character, even though most of the characters he interfaces with show anger, contempt, and hostility toward him, he perseveres. Unlike the harsh critique of Albert Grosman (F.Murray Abraham) his music is evocative and strong. The creative marketplace is both ruthless and fickle. The brilliant and talented are often looked over for the shallow and facile. Llewyn is often reminded of this at key points in the film, but can do little to remedy it.This is a movie about failing. It is depressing and unfortunately very real. Llewyn Davis should be judged not for his character flaws, but the caprice of the creative world he has chosen to live in.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Unconventional moody tale,"I have seen the movie last Saturday. My expectations were not too high, because I don't really fancy folk music.I left the theater impressed. Although music is a main element, the focus is on Llewyn. He carries the movie.Symilar in tone with ""Barton Fink"" and ""A Serious Man"", ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" stands out with its beautiful visuals and melancholic narrative.The titular character and the glimpse we have in his life remind me of ""The Catcher In The Rye""'s Holden Caulfield , but I can't help to compare it to the Norwegian movie ""Oslo, August 31st"", which shares the same tone but in a slightly more depressive manner.Do not set your expectations high or low, just go into it with a clear head. This is as different from True Grit as ""No Country For Old Men"" is different from ""A Serious Man"".An 8 out of 10 for me.And one more thing: the trailers make the movie look visually gloomy to an exaggerated extent, which is not the case in the movie theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The acting is very good and the movie is OK but if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it.,"""If it was never new and it never was old its a folk song."" Llewyn Davis (Isaac) is a folk singer living in New York in the early 60's. He is trying everything he can to make it big while struggling to find his way. He couch hops from house to house and picks up gigs when and where he can. When the woman who's place he is staying with tells him he has to move out it begins a long week for Llewyn that changes everything about him. At the risk of offending people I am not a huge Coen Brothers fan. I have liked most of their movies but my problem with them is that some are very slow moving and are really made for a specific audience. The music in this one is good but not as good as in O Brother Where Art Thou. The acting is very good and the movie is OK but again if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it. This is a movie where not much happens you just follow one guy around for a week. Overall, Coen Brothers fans will like this. If you aren't a fan you may struggle to get through it.

"beautiful, powerful film","The Coen Brothers have impressed me yet again with this dark, emotional, and beautiful comedy-drama about life, love, music, and cats. It's a heavy film at times, and a hilarious one at others. Throughout the film the Coen's show off their talent for filmmaking to much success. Every ingredient of this film is put together in such a way that it forms an impactful, funny, and original masterpiece. A film that I recommend to anyone with a heart and soul, this is one of the most realistic, yet, at times, somewhat surrealistic films that I have ever seen.The performances are all excellent, especially Oscar Issac who fills his performance as the wonderfully three dimensional character of Llewyn Davis with all of the emotion and complexity necessary for the likable and, at times, horrible main character. Other stunning performances come from John Goodman-whose performance is extremely funny, Carey Mulligan- whose performance is extremely emotional and, at times, downright despicable, and Adam Driver-whose performance is quite brief but is still manages to be pleasingly quirky and humorous.This is a very different and beautiful film, the type of film that you don't come across all too often, but when you do, it's like buried treasure.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Llewyn's The Odyssey,"After finding the greatest mass-culture success and reaction with their searing, post-modern Western No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers seem to have been on a journey throughout their last four films. As always flouting the expectations of audiences and studios, they went at the pace and direction in which they felt most comfortable. This resulted in a high-energy, excitingly quirky and sometimes violent comedy; a most studious portrayal of a man in 1967 struggling with the greatest Jewish questions; and a straight-on genre piece made with the finest touch of cinematic craftsmanship available. Do any of these projects have a connection? At their basest, one could surmise they all are about the characters' intentions of finding home. This, of course, is a word used so often as to be overstated, yet the meaning has become so varied it can apply to almost anyone and anywhere. Now, the Coens go to a spiritual home of sorts for so many cultural figures in the early 1960s: Greenwich Village.Intentionally set just before one young man from Minnesota came to New York and shook the whole scene out of its self-conscious doldrums, the story follows the titular character floating amongst acquaintances, sympathizers and fellow musicians as he attempts to put together his own career after a tragic loss. As has been noted, this is a great set-up for the cliché rags-to-riches story, yet the Coens are far too intelligent and savvy for that. They said they began writing the screenplay with the image of folk singer Dave Van Ronk being beaten outside the Gaslight Cafe after a concert, which is what happens to Llewyn Davis. He receives just about everything a down-on-his-luck artist could: physical and emotional beatings which leave him alienated from just about everyone. In most other stories of this kind, this would provide the artist with the perfect opportunity to dig deep within himself and find exactly what was missing previously from his output, resulting in the breakthrough success he was searching for all along. Yet, Llewyn's problems either go too deep or he is in the wrong business at the wrong time.Like all their films, the Coens show a masterful ability to synthesize exquisite imagery, eccentrically memorable supporting roles and a bleakness that worms its way into your soul. Here, the bleakness comes out the complexity Llewyn Davis gives to the audience. Never ones to make a statement about how we should feel about their characters, Llewyn might be the Coens' fullest and most thriving creation on their resume. A bile-filled, slightly narcissistic, handsome rogue, Oscar Isaac plays him as almost upset by his own actions yet perhaps unable to stop himself from self-destructing. Trying to apologize to an ex-girlfriend, attempting to dine with intellectual supporters, even preparing to perform for a seemingly generous audience; all these instances are pure examples of Llewyn Davis' astonishing ability to screw himself over. He knows the consequences of his actions as soon as he says or does whatever it is, yet there is not necessarily a lack of sympathy for this man. He is an artist, struggling to find not only his voice but his purpose in finding his voice. Should this life-changing decision he has made be a defining time in his life, or is he still drifting, forever doomed to be unattached and undefined?Other supporting roles are almost as superb as Isaac. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as a performing duo who reluctantly help Llewyn out in various ways; Ethan Phillips and Robin Bartlett as the academic couple who think they are helping Llewyn by treating him as fodder entertainment for their friends; and John Goodman as a corpulent, slightly sinister jazz musician who reminds one of Robert DeNiro in Angel Heart. His condescension and constant put-downs of both Llewyn and the folk scene express many peoples' feelings as well as perhaps Llewyn's self-hatred of what he has become.Constantly on the outside looking in, folk music was at this time struggling to maintain its existence amidst the Red Scare but also the up-and-coming rock and roll scene burgeoning throughout the United States. Traditionally, Bob Dylan has been hailed as the savior of this genre, yet just like the concept of home this may be overstated. In the end, with a new figure emerging on the scene effectively rendering him obsolete, what may be most important for Llewyn is the future, rather than the present. His ex tells him he has no concept of the future and he counters by telling her she has no concept of the present. Perhaps they are both right about one another, but as it turns out, which side of this argument would it be worse for Llewyn to come out on? Presumably, the struggle maintains itself for as long as he tries to express it through music. For him, home may be just a five-letter word.",,Anonymous,Music
"Engrossing Film with Charming Performances,","Inside Llewyn Davis is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It's a very engrossing film as we follow a week in the life of a young singer who is struggling to make it big. By the end of the movie, I felt very connected to Llewyn Davis, having being given a very good feel of his day to day life and how he navigates through all his problems.My only real complaint about this film would actually be that it is far too short. Running at just over 100 minutes, I felt it had more to tell us, like the story could have been more developed, that this character had more potential. Once the credits came up, I was a little underwhelmed.The performances is what could make or break a film like this, thankfully each part is perfectly casted, with everyone managing to find a lovely balance of humour and drama. Oscar Isaac shines as Llewyn Davis, every subtle choice he makes for the character adds so much depth and he is truly connected from start to finish, he is also joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund. It's a very sweet Coen Brothers film with some beautiful music and relatable characters.

This is far from one of the better Coen Brother pictures but it does contain enough unique characters and circumstances to make it a must see,"Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) is a Coen Brothers movie that I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows an aspiring musician that lives in Greenwich Village in the 1960s hoping for an opportunity but relying on a network of friends to survive. Can he catch a break or will be ruin every opportunity due to debts owed?This movie is directed by Ethan and Joel Cohen (Raising Arizona) and stars Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi), John Goodman (The Big Lebowski), Carey Mulligan (Shame), Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network) and Garrett Hedlund (On the Road).This is a very unique character piece with fascinating circumstances. The acting is very good and everyone, top to bottom, delivers a strong performance. The dialogue is also very well written and the storyline unfolds perfectly. I will say the main character gave me a lot of anxiety much like Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems. The movie is a bit depressing but the ending felt very realistic.Overall, this is far from one of the better Coen Brother pictures but it does contain enough unique characters and circumstances to make it a must see.

Heartbreaking movie that tells of what the 'real' world looks like,"Life isn't great and we all know it but you carry on and make it great and dream big and work hard till you get to the top That's what we are always told but the truth is it doesn't always workInspired by a true person the movie tells of a week inside the cruel and miserable life of an unknown bar musicianLlewyn Davis was talented and had the potential to be something in the music industry but we all know that it doesn't always work out for a great potential He suffers everyday he doesn't have any money, no place to stay, no work and everything seems to be getting from bad to worse for the young guyThe Coen brothers tell the truth in this that not always you end up being Eminem and their incredible directing brought this deep and dark story to life What is weird about this is the storytelling which is great by the way as it tells of a week only in his life just to know the nature of his life and this isn't your normal protagonist who always end up being a winnerLlewyn Davis isn't someone trying to make it big, he is just trying to make itOscar Isaac just nailed this and the up and rising actor deserved some recognition at least if not an Oscar nomination but as of now he is one of the best rising stars and he is primed to be a 'winner' Oscar nominated actress Carey Mulligan had a brilliant role in this just as she always doesThe Coens' screenplay make this 'hard' journey lighter with their always not explained black comedyThe best thing about this one is the dark cinematography and music that seems as faded as Llewyn Davis' lifeOverall it was great but the thing is the story it tells it just isn't usually being made to movies maybe because they're trying not to be negative but this isn't negative, it just is life So wake up from your dream and live it as it is and of course dream big but always remember that this could be the outcome This one has been incredibly hailed by critics",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Melancholic Melody of Lost Dreams,"Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of its titular character, a talented yet troubled folk singer whose dreams of success are constantly thwarted by the harsh realities of life. Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Llewyn is a raw and poignant depiction of a man grappling with his own demons and chasing a dream that always seems just out of reach. The film's narrative is a winding road of heartache and hope, a reflection of the universal struggle to find meaning and purpose in a world that often seems indifferent to our dreams and aspirations.What sets Inside Llewyn Davis apart is its ability to capture the essence of a bygone era while remaining timeless in its themes and emotions. The folk music scene of the 1960s serves as a backdrop for Llewyn's personal odyssey, with its intimate coffeehouse performances and larger-than-life personalities, each with their own quirks and struggles. From the enigmatic fellow musician played by Carey Mulligan to the eccentric jazz musician portrayed by John Goodman, every encounter adds a layer of depth to Llewyn's search for meaning and redemption. But beneath the surface of Llewyn's quest for success lies a deeper truth - that talent alone is not always enough to achieve greatness. The film reminds us that for every Bob Dylan, there are thousands of Llewyn Davises who struggle in obscurity, their voices lost in the cacophony of the world.The film's cinematography is a visual feast, capturing the moody atmosphere of a New York City winter with a poetic beauty that is as haunting as it is mesmerizing. From the dimly lit clubs of the folk music scene to the snow-covered streets of Greenwich Village, each frame is imbued with a sense of longing and melancholy that lingers long after the credits roll. The soul-stirring soundtrack, too, is a character in its own right, with haunting folk ballads and soulful melodies that echo the emotional journey of its protagonist. From the mournful strains of Fare Thee Well to the bittersweet beauty of Hang Me, Oh Hang Me, the music serves as a poignant reminder of the power of song to heal the soul and soothe the troubled heart.Inside Llewyn Davis is a hauntingly beautiful ode to the pursuit of success and the sacrifices we make along the way. It's a reminder that greatness often comes at a price, and that sometimes, the journey itself is more important than the destination. Allow yourself to be swept away by its haunting melodies and poignant storytelling, and you just might find yourself reflecting on your own journey through life's winding roads.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A rather moody turn for the Coensis a folk music spiritual sequel to ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""","Joel Coen remarked regarding the film that it ""doesn't really have a plot. That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in."" The Coens are notoriously tight lipped about their films, but this offhand remark is a pretty insightful into the type of film they intended to make with ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" Telling the story of struggling 1960s folk singer Llewyn Davis, the film ends up an ode to capturing a specific time and place, as well as a celebration of the 60s folk music scene. Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina"" and Poe Dameron in the latest Star Wars trilogy) plays the intense Llewyn and spends the film in a wintery NYC couch surfing, trying to reach a wider audience with his music, and wanting to land a record deal or even a gig. The first couch he lands on he ends up losing the owner's cat and that becomes the main narrative thread of the film, such as it is, but the film is really about an artist so committed and uncompromising in his vision that he ends up unable to find success or an audience. Ironically, this is a trap the idiosyncratic Coen Brothers have manage to avoid, finding success in their modestly budgeted films, which has given them a level of autonomy that's allowed them to achieve their vision. There was criticism of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" by actual folk singers of this era that it wasn't an accurate depiction and that it was NOT a happy tight knit community and was more made up of competition and backbiting. Still, it's a gorgeous representation of a time and place, even if it's a bit of a fairy tale. This is the crisp wintery New York City I remember seeing in actual NYC films during this actual period, like ""A Thousand Clowns"" or ""The Pawnbroker."" The film is gorgeously photographed by Bruno Delbonnel, known for working with the likes of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Tim Burton, and with Peter Bogdanovich on his Jazz Age tale, ""The Cat's Meow"" (the Coens' regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, was unavailable shooting ""Skyfall""). The production design detail is dynamite! Watching the film I just wanting step onto the screen and be a part of this 1960s NYC, even if it's a fairy tale version that never existed (sort of how I also want to step onto California shore of a Beach Party movie). ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is fascinating in how it holds the viewer's attention despite the lack of a strong narrative. This is in large part thanks to the talents of Oscar Isaac as Davis, making this flawed and at times unlikable character compelling to watch for for nearly two hours, as well as the Coen's deft touch for creating a stylized atmosphere, colorful characters, and filling the film with memorable songs and soundscapes (another element they are often not given enough credit for), in what is probably their best use of music since ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake also appear in the film as successful folk singers Jim & Jean, as does Adam Driver in a funny bit part, and Coen Brothers regular John Goodman makes a memorable appearance as an obnoxious jazz musician. Overall, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" has more heart than most Coen Brothers' films and I would argue stands amongst their finest. FUN FACT! The singing voice of Mike, Llewyn's deceased music partner, is Marcus Mumford from the band Mumford & Sons, and actress Carey Mulligan's husband.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dirgeful Lament,"This film made me feel the physical cold; the snow, wind, rain along with the gray skies. The atmosphere magnified the way of the world. It reminds me that we are all on a journey through life. Better choices may glean us better rewards and less suffering, but in the end we all die some how and some place.Llewyn's music was good as far as ability and performance but I tend to agree with the character played by F. Murray Abraham. He said he did not see a lot of money being generated from it. Although music with a lugubrious nature has done so, part of the problem was Llewyn's look. The hippie movement had not yet arrived in 1961. A clean cut look was still needed to succeed. Think of real life folk acts like; Peter, Paul and Mary, The Smothers Brothers or The Kingston Trio, any male singers with a neatly trimmed goatee, even a young Bob Dylan.The other message in this film was lack of responsibility. Llewyn was more compassionate towards the cat than his two known lady friends. It seemed to be that having an abortion was a standard solution to a heat of the moment careless pregnancy. But it does take two to tango.The movie went full circle from nowhere to nowhere. The Coen's did a good job of showing the struggle to become famous and the hardships it can cause for oneself and others directly and indirectly involved. At least he was not a heroin user (yet). Hopefully, Llewyn decides to go electric in 1963 at Newport. Rated 7.3/10, slightly better than some 7.0 films.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Struggle,"If I had to describe this film in just one word it would be the word struggle. That's what we go through when we go inside Llewyn Davis. The struggle artists have to go through to get out there.If you're a musician, a filmmaker, a writer, a poet, a painter, an animator or anything else in the creative industry then I highly recommend this film to you, to give you a possible vision of your future. Life is tough, and that's what Llewyn Davis shows us. We go through unfortunate and very relatable events with our protagonist in this story. We all had moments in our life where we screwed up. We all made mistakes and we all have said things we didn't mean to people we love.Aside from this film being very relatable, it's a really well directed piece of art.A thing you will notice if you're a fan of the Coen's, like myself is that this film didn't have Roger Deakins as the DP, who at the time probably was working on Prisoners. This time we get Bruno Delbonnel behind the camera's and he does a fantastic job. The lighting is very impressive, especially in the opening scene. The shot-reverse shot can also been seen a lot in this film, which makes it feel very familiar to the Coen's previous works.The music, acting and overall direction is great. After I watched this, Oscar Isaac instantly became one of my favorite actors working today. John Goodman once again teams up with the Coen's and delivers a solid performance. Other actors and actresses do a good job as well, Carey Mulligan is a great singer and she is a really diverse actress. I hope she appears in more movies from the Coen's.My only complaint is that the second act in this film had bad pacing. It felt like it didn't fit in with the rest of the film and it didn't do the characters a lot of justice. The third act makes up for it though.Overall, I feel like this is a very overlooked film with beautiful music, great screenplay and good performances. How this has a 7.4 on IMDb is quite surprising to me, then again I can understand if some people think this movie drags, because there doesn't happen a lot aside from character interactions.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Inside Llewyn Davis,"What I liked: This is a great character study. It's really well grounded in reality and how unfair life can be.

I wasn't as invested in the character as much as in other character studies like Manchester by the Sea or Raging Bull.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Intriguing character drama goes nowhere,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a film by the Coen brothers starring Oscar Isaac as the title character. This film has its moments where it is seemingly a one man show with different characters coming into scenes then exiting. The acting is very strong and there is some sort of sympathy we feel for Llewyn Davis, although his character is quite scummy (perhaps it's the affect of Oscar).Although in the end the story starts off where it leaves off feeling somewhat cheated. Perhaps the film is to show the journey and how difficult the profession can be. However, the film is quite enjoyable and decent but not as great as the strong praise by the critics.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Play it Again, Llewyn","The Coen brother's Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of its titular character and his woes on the Greenwich Village folk scene during a week in 1961. Starring Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis, the Coens have fashioned a character whose social inadequacies and inability to communicate are his downfall in life and on the music scene. He's talented, but despite the kindness of others, remains stuck in a cycle of despair that leads him from one couch to another. Davis is one of the Coen's more aloof and unlikable central characters; throughout the film he's rarely inviting and, in the snubs and scowls at his friends and colleagues, he's difficult to gauge and remains largely impenetrable. This may be a drawback for some, but I found his story to have a strong allure, especially with the Homeric narrative and vibrant undertones that reveal themselves in the way one may become familiar with a new album. The cinematography is quite splendid here also, and is important to mention, because the colour palette and use of browns and greens make this film look like an old album cover. This is also reflected in the framing of some scenes, whilst there's a certain nod to The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan; something Cameron Crowe also done in Vanilla Sky. In support are Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman, all of whom are memorable in small roles -- Mulligan and Timberlake play a singing couple called Jim and Jean, with the smiling and well-liked Jim being very much the antithesis of Davis. Even when Jim isn't present in the film, he's spoken about in such a way that it's easy to appreciate the subtleties of Timberlake's performance and how it resonates against Isaac's. Mulligan is more scathing, being almost as harsh as Davis, but with good reason, and although Goodman's role is small, it's pivotal given the choices present when Davis is given a touch of his own medicine. Importantly, the music here is quite splendid throughout -- some songs are written and performed with tongue firmly in cheek, such as Please Mr. Kennedy, whilst there's sincerity present given the quality of the music's production and the songs having been sung live in every instance bar one. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the Coen brothers finest films to date, which is no mean feat, although it's not their most accessible and, much like it's central character, there's depths to be found despite an aloof nature.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Echoes in the Alleyways: The Lyrical Odyssey of 'Inside Llewyn Davis,"In the dimly lit corners of Greenwich Village, amidst the smoky haze and the strumming of a guitar, emerges the Coen Brothers' ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a melancholic ballad of a struggling artist in a world that's just slightly out of tune. Oscar Isaac, as Llewyn, embodies the weariness of a soulful troubadour, his voice a haunting echo that lingers long after the last note fades. The streets he wanders are painted in muted hues, a testament to the masterful touch of cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who captures the chill of a New York winter and the even colder indifference of an unforgiving industry.Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, among others, drift in and out of Llewyn's journey like specters from a forgotten folk song, their performances resonating with raw emotion and unspoken truths. The Coens, ever the maestros of mood, weave a tapestry of fleeting moments and lingering regrets, their narrative structure as free-flowing as a beatnik's verse. Every frame, every chord, every glance is a deliberate brushstroke on this canvas of dreams deferred. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't just a film; it's a poetic reverie, a melancholic lullaby that beckons us into its embrace, urging us to find solace in the shared solitude of the human experience. In the end, as the lights dim and the credits roll, we're left with the haunting refrain of a life lived in the shadows, forever chasing that elusive spotlight.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Going nowhere,"This film tells the story of a young struggling folk singer, and his eventful week in New York.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is the title of the album by the title Character, Llewyn Davis. It is not creating ripples across the nation in the 1960's USA, and he struggles to make ends meet. He crashes in various friends' places, a few days at a time. His encounters with these friends are eventful, but they do not seem to get anywhere. I thought Llweyn Davis was right back where he started after almost two hours, and the big circle he travelled was not even entertaining.In a plot driven film like this, it is crucial to grab the viewers' attention - but there was little to grab mine in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".

A Very Engaging Character Study About an Unlucky and Unlikable Singer with a Lost Dream,"Terrific cinematography and an engaging albeit frustrating somber narrative about a struggling folk rock singer. The acting is mostly terrific (minus Jean's actress who tends to play it more over-the-top) and the music is amazingly soothing and somber. It's a solid deconstruction of the starving artist and cycles of monotonous disappointment from bad habits and missed opportunities, despite getting muddled with making the main character a little too unlikable at times and not really ending on a meaningful note. But I can still relate to the struggling artist themes and appreciate all the cinematic talent that went into this movie despite my gripes. It's definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Inside Llewyn Davis,"Leave it to the Coen brothers to give us one of the most original and unique films of last year. They have been doing this most of their career from Blood Simple, up to and including, Inside Llewyn Davis, with very few missteps along the way. This is a later film I saw of 2013, but as of now I would have to say that it is my personal favourite film of last year. Why? Well, I will do my best to explain that in the following few sentences. First off, I like the character Llewyn Davis a lot. That isn't to say that he was a great, or inspirational character, or anything like that. In fact the character himself is a pompous and full of himself person with not that much going for him and his over indulgence and pride and arrogance are the downfall of him. He is not all that likable a character, but that is what I liked so much about him. He is our antihero for this film and his personality and the many assorted predicaments that he gets himself into, during the course of this film are so intriguing and fascinating that this is one film that grabbed me from it's opening shot to it's closing one. I laughed with and at Llewyn, sometimes felt a little pity for him, but mostly just really enjoyed watching him as he tries to make a name for himself in the music industry and sort out the various annoying problems that go on in his life, some of which, as I mentioned, he causes himself because of his attitude and his big mouth. Fans of other Coen brothers films know that they like their music and really good cinematography and this film is not failing in that regard either. A lot of the film's original folk music (actually performed by actor, Oscar Isaac, and cast) is very good and really suits the setting of the early 1960's Greenwich Village folk scene. I still can't quite contemplate how ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" did not end up getting a Best Original Song nomination at the Academy Awards. The cinematography (which it is nominated for) is superb. The film takes place during a long and dreary winter and the cinematography gives the film a bleak, cold and very depressing look which really enhances the mood and tone that the film is going for. It was achieved successfully. The acting was also fantastic from Oscar Isaac, playing Llewyn Davis, to the various supporting characters that he meets during his travels as well. As, I mentioned earlier, Isaac performed the songs written for him and he gets so into character playing this unlikable and self indulgent character, but also lets us laugh and occasionally have pity for him as well. It is a brilliant performance that should have been nominated a lot more than it has been. All the supporting characters and actors are great as well and the thing about these supporting characters is that each and every one of them is just as interesting as it's main character, so watching them is an absolute joy as well. The Coens always do their own screenplays and they have a certain style that has become familiar to fans of their work and this film brilliantly shows their madness and creativity. The character development runs deep and the film is so entertaining and often gives us a lot to laugh at as well. It is also fantastically different and offbeat and really unlike any other recent film in memory, which I give them a lot of credit for. They know how to set certain scenes, build up characters and surprise and shock us out of nowhere with things we just did not see coming. The film is about music and the folk scene of the early 1960's, so fans of music, or people who lived through that time should easily enjoy and find a lot to identify with in this film. For someone like myself and many others who were not around at that time, there is still so much to love here and the story is one that can appeal to any and every generation of film fans who appreciate unique and great works of art which we have on display here. This film is a great work of art from the talent and skills behind and in front of the camera. This is a film that entertained and grabbed me from when it started to when it ended and made me laugh and just made me appreciate the brilliance that is the Coen brothers for another great film in their already impressive lineup. Inside Llewyn Davis, is my favourite film from 2013 so far and if you are in the mood for something different, original and artsy, then it may be one of your faves too.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Llweyn's Obnoxious, Yet Cohen Bros Still Got it","After watching the Coen Brother's latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, I was forced to be left with one question: so what? Yes, Inside Llewyn Davis is shot magnificently, with long shots and brilliant camera angles that capture the essence of Greenwich Village in the 60's. Yes, the film has beautiful cinematography and yes, the acting is magnificent, especially by the talented Oscar Isaac. But the question 'so what?' still lingers, after watching this film. We were forced to watch a week in the life of a struggling musician who bounces from couch to couch, trying to make ends meet. At times, I even rooted for him and wanted him to get paid because he's a talented musician who's not selling out. Other times, I hated the guy with a passion. Indeed, Llweyn is a jerk but true to his work and music. The movie ends the same way it starts: will not include any spoilers here. Perhaps the Cohen Brothers are trying to show that his Llweyn will never amount to anything; perhaps, satirizing the music business: if you don't sell out, you won't succeed. So, perhaps, he will be stuck in the same predicament even after the credits roll. It is not his music that stands out, however, but his unimportant exploits that take place in various circumstances during the movie. All the characters had their fair share of Llweyn and they demonstrate their feelings throughout the movie, making us aware of his personality; a ruined relationship with Jean (Carey Mulligan), a unfortunate incident causing him to lose his friend and singing partner, and a unsympathetic manager that no longer believes in him. All those things paint the picture way ahead of everything else. It's all regarding Llweyn, and half way through the film, we've found out all we need about his persona. Although the film is shot magnificently, it accomplishes nothing, mainly due to the script's failure to become climactic. The most fascinating part of the film is the road trip that introduces us to a few characters played by John Goodman, F. Murray Abraham, and Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five. The road trip is long as we feel its length through the various shots that depict the icy cold roads of the Midwest and Llweyn's adventures. He witnesses a near death, almost gets arrested, and hits a cat with a car. overall, the film is about a man's life and how he shapes the lives of the people he impacts. His music, although wonderful, play second fiddle to his character. Inside Llweyn Davis is a visual masterpiece but the story needs more.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Melancholy the film,"The Coen brothers have always shown their love for music through their movies, Inside Llewyn Davis takes a look into deep entrenched roots of folk songs and the love the Coen's have for it. The film is a story about the struggle of a man who's life is stuck in a perpetuity of circularity, a loop of meaningless actions conveyed through different journeys he takes throughout the movie. The soundtrack takes control of the film with outstanding performances from all the singers with the lead (Oscar Isaac) stealing the show with his voice that conveyed dread in songs of melancholy that hit you and take hold of you as a viewer.

"Coenheads disappoint here a bit, but Mr. Isaac is where is at!","As I went ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (please please please, don't take that the wrong way) I discovered I was watching a mediocre film that was a bit overrated by the film critic industry. But Inside Joel ""Meeza"" Mesa there is a disturbed pun cerebral cortex that causes Mr. Mesa to actually think he is part of the film critic industry; so there you have it. Anyways, this Coen Brothers feature stars Oscar Isaac as Lllewyn Davis; a struggling 60's folk singer who leaches of acquaintances, strangers, and other musicians for places to stay as he tries to make a folking name for himself in the music industry. Llewyn is not a nice guy; he is bitter, abrasive, and narcissistic; but boy does he love pussy. Get your mind out of the gutter, cause the pussy I am referring to is a cat of a couple friend of Llewyn who accidentally gets stuck with him, and he does go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the cat. Joel & Ethan Coen are filmmaking legends, so it's hard to nitpick them; not good to nitpick a Joel anyways. But I don't think their direction and scribe of the picture captivated me, but at the same time it was not a folking bore either. Many say that Oscar Isaac got snubbed of an Oscar nom for his starring role here. I do agree that Isaac was phenomenal, but with such a heavy competitive field in the Best Actor race this last season, I think Oscar was properly snubbed; but Oscar's Oscar time will come, try saying that six times in a row at a fast pace. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake give fair performances as the folk duo singing couple Jane and Jim, or is it Jim and Jane. Llewyn impregnates Jane by folking around too much with her; I guess he was having too much fun with ""Dick and Jane"". ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was not the movie I thought it would be, but as an outsider looking inside to the film critic industry, I still suggest you take a look for yourself.

"""A Slow Brown Sad Movie""","The above quote from Suzanne Vega is how I felt about the film.

I love that era, have all the Rhino ""Troubadours of the Folk Era"" CDs plus the ""Washington Square Memories"" boxed set. I was ready. But this movie wasn't really what I expected. Kind of a monochrome and joyless look at the scene. It sounds like it was a lot more vibrant than the film depicts it.Not that Oscar Isaac is bad; he's quite good in his role. I am not as crazy about Carey Mulligan's character who is just too bitter and angry the entire time due to an unexpected pregnancy which she seems to take no accountability for.People have forgotten the era it seems so I am thrilled whenever we can catch a glimpse of it.

"A Watchable, Witty Movie!","Review: I quite enjoyed this witty movie about a folk singer who just can't get a break, even though he's extremely talented. The storyline was put together well by the Coen Brothers and Oscar Isaac plays the lead extremely well. There are some amusing scenes that made me laugh, like the scene in the studio with Timberlake, but it does seem to go a bit downhill when he goes on the road. There is a taste of Were Out Thou, with the old American music, and I enjoyed the scenes with the cat that has many lives, but it's not a classic Coen Brothers movie like The Big Lebowski or Fargo. Watchable!Round-Up: Oscar Isaac seems to be taken quite seriously in Hollywood at the moment and I'm sure that he will get an extra boost after starring in the near Star Wars. With films like Robin Hood, Drive and the Bourne Legacy in his portfolio, he has definitely made some great choices in his career and he also a great voice to add to your skills. All of the other actors like, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman & Carey Mulligan, only play small roles in the movie but they put in good performances. Oscar Issac is in every single take of the film which doesn't get tedious or boring because of the mixture of wit and seriousness which works very well. For such a small project, it deserved to make a profit because of the way that the Coen Brothers write there movies so well.Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $33millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there musical, down and out, type of movies about an artist trying to make it in the music world. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The best film of the 2010's so far,"Inside Llewyn Davies was one of those films that just stayed with me for days. It was by far one of the best films of 2013 and it definitely should have gotten more recognition during the awards season.This film was directed by the Coen brothers (who comprise of Joel and Ethan Coen), of whom I am a big fan of as they can incorporate a large amount of different styles into the same picture.The story centres on Llewyn Davies (Exquisitely played by Oscar Isaac), a budding folk singer who is trying to get out there and known in a pre-Bob Dylan Greenwich Village in the 1960's. In his words he does not want to merely 'exist'. He ends up being tangled in various different forms of problems involving his fiery ex-lover Jean, his overly complimentary friends the Gorfien's and a brilliantly over-the-top song about not wanting to go to space in a 1hr 40min escapade of very fine filmmaking. Now the Coen's have already showcased their talent for film-making as well as writing and this film feels like the most Coen brothers film yet. This film just seems to showcase all of which the Coen's are great at and for that reason I love it to pieces.The Story in this film is a beautiful flowing narrative of 1 week in Llewyn's life, with none of it feeling forced or added as filler. This film can draw a lot of parallels with their 2000 film ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", with strong uses of music and also the use of the Greek Odyssey for storytelling elements. You know that part in a lot of films where the character is in complete crisis and are back to square one with seemingly no way of things going right for them? Well that is pretty much the whole of Inside Llewyn Davis but trust me, it is fantastic! Now what I loved so much about this film was how the Character of Llewyn Davis is written. He is an incredibly rude man with a short temper, strong use of profane language and a habit of ""Turning everything he touches into sh*t"". Despite this however, the audience can't do anything but feel for him, this is where the amazing use of music comes into the equation, music in this film is where we can sympathise with Llewyn and find something to like in him. Now, I think that is down to two things; 1, these are one of the only times that he seems emotionally open. And 2, how the character has been written for present day audiences, his dry and sarcastic sense of humour and the very subtle taste of contemporary style in the folk songs that he sings. This makes the audience feel the blow when he is told for what seems like the millionth time that he hasn't got what is wanted. The music is performed live which really enhances the feel.Now the performances in this movie are all fantastic. Oscar Isaac really brings the dry, sarcastic, rude but endearing complex that is Llewyn but he's backed by some real talent. Carey Mulligan's beautiful and blisteringly angry Jean, Justin Timberlake's overly smiley and optimistic Jim, John Goodman's smug elitist Roland Turner and Garret Hedlund's lone wonderer are all masterfully done with hints and nuances that only heighten on the second watch.The film only really has one issue with it, and that is that there is a scene where an A Capella group sing the song ""The Auld Triangle"". This scene is sold to be live, like all of the others but the group are clearly miming and I have no idea why the original group who sung the song (Punch Brothers) didn't do it live instead. As much as this did take me out of the film for a bit, it did not however dampen my thoughts on it, I still love it! I would also like to add that the film on a purely technical level is also absolutely brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful, with a slightly dulled but effective gradient being used to nicely showcase Llewyn's outlook on life.This film is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of Folk music, or interesting stories and I can't recommended it more.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""If it was never new and never gets old, then it's a folk song""","Rivaling The Man Who Wasn't There for saddest story comes their touching and raw story of Llewyn Davis, a struggling folk musician in New York, 1961 as he plays for little to no money to unethusiastic crowds and rotates sleeping arrangements with his rich condescending friends, to his hateful ex-girlfriend.Following a familiar trope often seen in Coens films, life just isn't being kind to it's main character. It offers a fine blend of pure bad luck, to stupid decisions he's made himself which begs the overall question, how much of what's happening is his fault? The writing gives you just enough to keep you guessing throughout the film.It features Oscar Isaac in his breakout performance as the title character, amazing audiences around the world with his singing and playing ability which was all recorded live during principal photography, a long ardous process but it pays off.
We're given a range of unique personalities which you would only find in the lyrics to a folk song, with Carey Mulligan as the angry ex-girlfriend with the voice of an angel, Justin Timberlake, the new innocently cocky boyfriend of Llewyn's ex, John Goodman as a brash jazz musician he meets on the road along with Garrett Hedlund, a beatnik poet who I feel is one of the Coen's most mysterious characters out of all their films.The film will make you laugh, sigh, shed a tear and leave you feeling desperate for this poor musician, just trying to get by, but the world won't let him.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Nowhere Near Coen's Best,"I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring. The cat was the best thing about this picture and I'm a dog person.",,Anonymous,Music

Inside Llewyn Davis,"Aspiring folk musician ""Llewyn"" (Oscar Isaac) finds himself in Greenwich Village in New York during the winter of 1961 trying to make a living from his art. He's a well known face in the clubs having been part of a jobbing duo for many-a-year, but now he is finding it much harder to crack the scene as a solo artist. His aspiration has an habit of blinding him, though, and his somewhat erratic behaviour stresses his relationships with fellow folkies ""Jim"" (Justin Timberlake) and ""Jean"" (Carey Mulligan) on whose couches he finds himself increasingly relying. To add to his woes, his manager ""Mel"" (Jerry Grayson) isn't really much cop and his eponymous album isn't exactly flying off the shelves. ""I know"", he thinks, a change of scenery. A chance meeting with the enigmatic ""Turner"" (John Goodman) and his word-shy driver ""Johnny"" (Garrett Hedlund) takes him to an interview in Chicago with the talent-spotting ""Bud"" (F. Murray Abraham). Might any of this help our budding Bob Dylan make any progress? The drama itself here is really intimately presented, with some tight photography helping to convey the emotion maelstrom this man is living through as he tries to reconcile his almost puritanical search for perfection with his growing appreciation of the real - and not so accommodating - world. There's a great little song with himself, Timberlake and the sparingly used, but on-form, Adam Driver (""Al"") that shows the latter has some solid musical timing, and a good sense of humour too! This looks like a labour of love - not just for the Coen's, but for Isaac who genuinely seems to sweat the role. It's a wee bit wordy, but the ensemble ensure that the segments of his life and travels in search of something intangible become and remain engaging to watch. Oh, and it's true - everyone else does sing Dylan songs better than he does himself!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Inside Llewyn Davis is brilliantly written and masterly directed, containing Oscar Isaac in one of his best performances, it's slow paced but magnificent","'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a great drama-black comedy which is written, directed, produced, and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen. This might be their most underrated film, one that didn't hit mainstream but can justifiably be called one of their best, it also contains one if not the best performance of Oscar Isaac. There's drama, a bit of comedy with his comedic timing, and also just an actor doing a terrific job doing multiple things at the same time. For example, Isaac plays the guitar simultaneously as he's acting and staying in character, flawlessly. In my opinion, this is hands down one of his best performances and it's so interesting how this was his breakthrough role. A. O. Scott of The New York Times writes, ""Llewyn's repertoire and some aspects of his background are borrowed from Dave Van Ronk, who loomed large on the New York folk scene in its pre-Bob Dylan hootenanny-and-autoharp phase. Oscar Isaac, who plays both Llewyn and the guitar with offhand virtuosity, is slighter of build and scowlier of mien than Van Ronk, with a fine, clear tenor singing voice...Mr. Isaac, a versatile character actor here ascending to the highest levels of his craft, refuses the easy road of charm. Like his character, he trusts his own professionalism and the integrity of the material."" The supporting cast includes Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham, Justin Timberlake and Adam Driver.The film's premise: A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.For this review I'm keeping it spoiler free so I won't go into any details, but I absolutely loved the story, as we follow Llewyn Davis for one week we grow to care for him, he's extremely flawed and could be seen as a nobody, yet he's an everyman. The Coen brothers wrote this character so realistic, like everyone else but especially him. They found an actor who played the part perfectly, their direction is felt in every scene. Their mise-en-scene is absolutely fantastic, so is the camera work and composition. Every shot is perfect and who else contributes to the spectacular shots? Bruno Delbonnel who served as the cinematographer and I have nothing but praise for his work on this film, the choice of lens and look of the film. Combined, these three have created such a beautiful looking film. The Coen brothers creates such great drama and comedy, but I absolutely loved the music which is played by numerous of actors but especially Oscar Isaac, music that is played on set by them. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing), both well earned but I want to go deeper into the sound mixing. Mostly for the music, but I absolutely loved one thing which increases the drama significantly and it's whenever something bad happens to Llewyn Davis the sound grows louder, and we see that halfway through the film when Davis takes a seat on a subway like he normally does but now the sound is loud and we hear everything louder than before as a man is looking at him. Where a similar scene was played out with a more natural sound, thus emphasizing things are getting worse after time. The Coen brothers shows how the visuals and cinematography is as important as the sound for this film. The film also was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards (Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Isaac) and Best Original Song).'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a flawless film, beloved by critics and the audience. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called the film ""an outstanding fictional take on the early 1960s folk music scene"", praising the ""fresh, resonant folk soundtrack"", and said Isaac's performance ""deftly manages the task of making Llewyn compulsively watchable"". Many film critics had this on their best films lists of 2010's, it might be one of the best films released in 2013. With a great lead and a supporting cast whom all gives terrific performances, this is a film you need to watch, yet there's one thing you could criticize if you want. The film has quite a slow pacing and that can either be something that will make you find the film less good or be at peace with it, being at peace with the slower pacing makes the film into the spectacular film it is with each scene and moment brilliant as the next. There's also no real plot with Joel Coen saying ""That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in."" I found that a negative thing at first but films like this are special, it's solely about the character and the writing is excellent. I'll finish off my review with Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian who gave the film the highest score, ""Brilliantly written, terrifically acted, superbly designed and shot; it's a sweet, sad, funny picture about the lost world of folk music which effortlessly immerses us in the period."" I agree fully.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coens in a minor key,"Llewyn Davis is, what one of the characters in the movie calls, a ""loser."" That is, a struggling folk musician in 1961 Greenwich Village who's so bad off he doesn't even have a place to call his own. Instead, he's been reduced to sleeping on friends' couches for as long as they're willing to put up with him. Then it's on to someone else's place (he seems to have a rotation system set up amongst a group of regulars). Llewyn has also recently become a solo act following the suicide of his partner, and no one seems much interested in hiring Llewyn to play on his own. To further complicate matters, it seems Llewyn might just have impregnated his best friend's wife during a recent one-night stand, a woman, by the way, who really can't stand a thing about Llewyn, least of all the prospect of being a mother to his child.In comparison to the flamboyance of some of their more recent works such as ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading,"" ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" finds Joel and Ethan Coen at their most subdued, spare and inward-looking. More somber mood-piece than narrative-driven drama, this is what we get when the boys decide to compose in a minor key. As such, the movie may try the patience of some in the audience and appear too slight to others, especially with its lack of a clear-cut resolution come fadeout time. The movie becomes especially stripped-down when Llewyn heads off on his own to Chicago in search of a gig, sharing a ride with an enigmatic and eccentric musician/heroin addict played by who else but John Goodman (this IS a Coen brothers movie after all).Llewyn finds his identity and purpose in music and in the counterculture persona he displays to the world. The only trouble is that, while he feels superior to all the unenlightened ""squares"" whom he sees as having sold out to the Man and to crash commercialism, he's still dependent on those people to lend him a helping hand. After all, what's the point of being your own man when you have to keep throwing yourself on the mercy of others just to find a warm place to bed down for the night? Llewyn's troubles seem to be the result of a combination of factors: a lack of ambition, grief over his partner's death, and his decision to hide behind nonconformity as a justification for never growing up and never accepting the responsibilities that come with being a man. It could also be that he's just a bit of a jerk by nature.Oscar Isaac gives an effectively understated performance as the title character, and the rest of the cast (including Carey Mulligan, F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake) is fine as well. Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is starkly beautiful, especially in those scenes set against the bleak landscape of a wintry Midwest.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't quite the engaging survey of the music scene or of Bohemian life in that specific place and time that the critics have claimed it is (the soundtrack is not really all that impressive), and it is no crowd-pleaser by any stretch of the imagination, but if you lower your expectations a mite, you may just get find yourself getting into its subdued portrayal of a social misfit.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"This film is, without doubt, one of the most boring films I have ever seen.","Don't waste your time! This film is like watching paint dry. It has no plot, no structure, and fails to entertain in any way. The characters are poorly developed, things that take place don't make sense and don't contribute to the telling of a story. It's like ""Waiting for Godot"" with some music. People who gush about it are, I'm sure, of the same ilk as those who gawked at Ed Wood movies as if they were at the Sistine Chapel. The Cohen's have done some really wonderful stuff in the past. Films that keep the audience entertained and engaged....like Fargo, Brother Where Art Thou, and the Big Lebowski.

"Oscar Isaac Delivers, The Music Soars in our Hearts, and The Coens bring in their Finest Work","If it was never old and it was never new, then it's a folk song. Words spoken by Llewyn Davis in this film that could not apply to it more. This film is a folk song in its structure, tone, and scope; a song that makes us laugh, think, and at times break.Writing/Direction: Ethan and Joel Coen are two of the modern masters of cinema with works that range from the Big Lebowski to No Country for Old Men. While those are certainly good, I am firm in my stance that none of them hold a candle to the intimate character study that is Inside Llewyn Davis. Their direction paints a portrait of intimacy while sticking to a dulled color palleate that fits perfectly. Their writing is fantastic. Fun fact: they actually do not plot out their movies, they just write without having much of an idea where the story is going. It is true creative writing that allows us to spend a week Inside Llewyn Davis.Performances: While John Goodman is typically hilarious, Carey Mulligan is accurately and rightfully dramatic, and Justin Timberlake is pitch perfect, none of the supporting characters can compare to the finely tuned performance of Oscar Isaac, who gives what may be his best work yet. There were times I forgot I was watching Poe Dameron/Nathan from Ex Machina and only saw Llewyn Davis on the screen. He portrays a sarcastic, witty, somber Folk Singer with ease and his vocal parts are off the charts. Oscar Isaac is one of the truly underrated actors of the modern day.The music is fantastic; a medley of folk songs combined with what would be considered modern back in the 60s (Please Mr. Kennedy). The cinematography is intimate and well-framed. Every aspect of this film corresponds to the Coens' finely tuned work. (10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Holds Filmmaking to High Expectations.,"I imagine the inspiration for Inside Llewyn Davis hit the Coens one night when they were letting folk music saturate their souls. Inside Llewyn Lewis is like a folk song acted out on screen. It may sound like a journey that isn't worth venturing on, but Joel and Ethan Coen have a nack for telling simplistic stories in an artful way. Though this film does not conquer relatively recent masterpieces such as No Country for Old Men or A Serious Man, Inside Llewyn Lewis is another bulletproof tale for the Coen brothers to add to their protracted resumes.The title holds no hidden meaning, the audience shown the story from within Llewyn's perception. We are immersed in an unimaginative world through blue-tinted cinematography that highlights the faces of the characters as ghost pale. Incredibly beautiful and unique photography that feeds an underwater feel to the viewer, adding to the isolation and lack of direction Llewyn feels. Adding to that, Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn, a performance that feels extremely personal to its audience. The frequent, tranquil folk songs create the rhythm of the picture, soothing the audience for approval, which it earns. The screenplay is an odyssey of searching for life direction, a story that would be truly gloomy if it were not for the Coens everlasting Fargo-esque, awkward humor. The comedy is sinfully funny and fits in between moments of drama. The Coens' screenplay explores the lead character's dark period wisely without abandoning their audience, only aided by the adept directing.Carey Mulligan, who's performance shattered the screens with a strengthen arm in 2009's An Education, shows worse sides of her acting abilities as time moves her on. Here, she receives scenes of anger to bring to life, a task that obviously was asking too much of the actress by the Coen brothers. Mulligan actually detracts from the film. One knows it isn't a good sign when Justin Timberlake upstages an Academy Award nominee...with less screen time than her.Inside Llewyn Davis is an easier sell to audiences than most of the Coens work, but illusion of the ending may send audiences scattering. The approach is performed well by the Coens and could actually be seen as quite smart, but it's a move that could confuse audiences not anticipating a bit of trickery. I have thought on the ending since seeing it, there are different interpretations audiences can embrace, I do not know which I side with at the moment.The film follows emphasizes a cat as symbolism for the lead character, they build a strong comparison case. I think the Coens have proved to deserve a reserved spot on every critic's year-end top 10 list with their multiple films having a consistent quality. It seems the directing duo can do no wrong. They have expressed their range now, yet with all their films they retain an auteur trademark of an ""earthy"" atmosphere. A reliable film for those who appreciate the craft being held to high expectations.Grade: ARating: 8.0",,Anonymous,Music

One of the Coens' best - it's grown on me a ton,"I think this might be a top 3 Coen Brothers film for me. The only two I'd probably put ahead of it are Fargo and The Big Lebowski, and like those two, I find Inside Llewyn Davis really easy (and tempting) to revisit.It's got great music, visually it looks amazing, there's a fantastic mix of humour and sadness, and the whole cast is great- especially Oscar Isaac in the lead.I feel like it's a movie about a guy who the universe seems to be picking on, and he tries fighting back in anger against the world that seems to have it in for him, only for that to make things worse. Not in a supernatural way or anything, but many Coen Brothers movies do have a vague kind of otherworldly feel to them, and this one's no exception. The strange ending gives credence to that, I think. It's one of those typical Coen Brothers endings that I wasn't sure of at first, but on a rewatch, it feels right (see also No Country For Old Men's final scene).Llewyn is a great character who's sympathetic until you realise he's not going to learn to better himself. There's something tragic and frustrating about that, and it's because the writing and Oscar Isaac are so good that this is actually to the movie's benefit. He does some pretty awful things in the film's extra bleak second half, but at no point does it make you want to check out of the movie.Inside Llewyn Davis is a modern classic, and arguably close to perfect. I think it will continue to get even better as the years go on, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen brothers' best film in over a decade,"The Coen brothers are really a cinema apart. They have their unique style, blending multiple genres in a way that feels natural, with an interesting cinematography that makes them easy to differentiate, (usually) great and original music and often witty dialogue/characters. Yet, I often find them polarizing: while I've loved some of their films ('Miller's Crossing', 'Barton Fink', 'The Big Lebowski'), I often found some difficult to like others.Not since 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', over a decade ago, have I liked a Coen-directed film (except for 'True Grit', though that one doesn't feel like a Coen movie at all). In fact, I could consider 'The Ladykillers' and 'A Serious Man' among the biggest disappointments in the decade (among the worst too, at least among 'big, important' productions).Surprisingly, it was 'Inside Llewyn Davis' that peaked my interest again. This simplistic, almost pointless slice-of-life yarn about a fictional 60's washed-up folk singer doesn't look like much, but just like 'Fargo' in the 90's it is deceptively captivating. It is heavily a drama, yet with a somber humor and wit, where the characters aren't forced but actually realistic and the reason you keep watching on. Oscar Isaac is also part of the reason, being able to naturally convey a Coen character's wittiness; he is kind of a downer, yet sympathetic, and Isaac even manages to sing well.We have some good casting in here too (which became less common within the Coen's films as time passed; they've never casted as well as they did on 'Barton Fink' or 'Miller's Crossing'). John Goodman is really good on his small part, as is F. Murray Abraham in a cameo-like role and Max Casella as the bar owner. Carey Mulligan was quite cute, and her interaction with Isaac's was very fun to watch; moreover, she has a very good voice and is nice to hear sing.Adam Driver was a surprise with his deep voice, but again had little screen time. Justin Timberlake seems to be becoming quite popular lately; he sings well enough, true, but he isn't a good actor at all and makes his character look like too much of a wuss. Even if they insisted on casting a singer for the role, they could have chosen better.The songs are all original, collaboration between the Coens, their musical supervisor and sometimes Timberlake. Maybe because I like folk music, or because Isaac is a surprisingly good singer, but I loved them; coincidentally, Timberlake's 'Please Mr. Kennedy' was the only song that I didn't like at all, though he kinda repents in his other song with Mulligan.Overall, a simplistic to the point of pointlessness, but nonetheless engrossing and likable picture. Oscar Isaac is the highlight here, as are the excellent cinematography and the songs. Also worth noticing is that, as often, the Coen brothers leave a lot of references to Homer's 'Odyssey'; pay attention to the cat if you wish to get it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Coen Brothers at their most personal,"Inside Llewyn Davis might be the most emotional Coen Brothers movie. It is a deep look inside its protagonist's life. By the end, you truly feel like you know this person.Oscar Isaac delivers a wonderful, subtle and engaging performance. He is one of the most talented actors out there and, in my opinion, still somewhat underrated. Additionally, his vocal performance on the movie's soundtrack surprises me and I cannot get some of the songs out of my head.The look of this movie is very unique and it took me a while to get used to it. I don't know if it is the gorgeous cinematography, its heartfelt dialogue or the cat, but somehow everything in this film felt very close. It made me feel like I was there with Llewyn during this strange week in his life.That being said, the film has, in my opinion, some minor flaws. This is just my impression but I think this film feels a little all over the place structurewise. Maybe this is exactly why some people love this movie but I found it a little confusing at times. Also, I would have loved to learn more about Llewyn's relationship with Jean. Carey Mulligan is a terrific actress and does not get enough screen time.All in all, I recommend this film. It is an essential part of the Coen Brothers' filmography and a very engaging and emotional character study.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One positive thing emerges from viewing this film:,"Garrett HedlundYes, I'd have to say that watching this film was worth seeing Garrett Hedlund. I have liked his voice since hearing him sing in the film 'Country Strong.' Other than that, this was a dreary, sad, grim depiction of NYC life - and fairly accurate if you do have to be in that city when the sun is not shining and you don't happen to live in one of the fancier boxes they call apartments or even houses.The main character is unlikeable - so unlikeable that I did not want to learn the pronunciation of his name. I did not care. Lucky for the audience, the scriptwriters stress the pronunciation of his name half-way through the movie so that you have to remember it. Is it important to like the main character? No. But it helps to have some shred or spark of charm to catch your attention.I'm a bit familiar with folk music and live coffee-house folk music. I'm more than a bit familiar with the Hootenanny generation (that was my generation). I even have a relative who sings in coffee houses and writes songs. It is that dreary, yes - scrambling to play for a pittance. Only the very devoted and dedicated stay with it hoping to someday have a life that allows them to pay rent money from this kind of work.Having Bob Dylan sing in the coffee house at the end was the perfect wrap-up to this film for me. His voice is very cat like, twangy, even yowl-y as a cat might yowl. He is a song writer but a crappy singer. Still, a very successful one.Which should inspire all Llewyn-type characters: if Dylan can sing and twang his vocal chords as well as guitar chords with fabulous success, so can you!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Despite being close to the age of 50, the Coen brothers still underwent a very welcome process of maturing with Inside Llewyn Davis","Llewyn Davis, a loose take on the folk singer Dave Van Volk, will, in hindsight, not be remembered as one of the Coen brothers' most interesting characters and neither will the movie, in which he is the eponymous protagonist. However, Inside Llewyn Davis is still another great picture by the inseparable duo that can deservedly look forward to a couple of Oscar nominations in January.Whether it's the trademark cynical writing, the excellent acting throughout the cast, the bleak yet beautiful cinematography (even though it's not Coen regular Roger Deakins this time around, but Amélie's Bruno Delbonnel), or the perfectly done editing (reaching its pinnacle in a sort of match-cut between a man and a cat walking) – this semi-musical is done flawlessly and should be a feast for connoisseurs of quality movies. Yet I can't exclude the fact that the 105 minutes feels like a lot more than that and that the full-length folk performances popping up every now and then only increase this. That's not an all-too-strong counterargument though, as the sheer fact that Ethan and Joel Coen succeeded in making a so heavily down-to-earth and unspectacular story into a movie that I will definitely watch some time again is enough for praise. The protagonist, as it turns out, is probably the most relatable character in the year of 2013 and seeing him perpetually fail in his attempts at becoming able to really live from his hobby gets all the more harrowing to watch through that.Inside Llewyn Davis is the perfect dramedy and additionally a lovely experience for fellow cat-lovers, as the tubby with the aptonym Ulysses gets more screen time to be cute than all the supporting actors. That again shows that it's all about Llewyn and his never-ending cycle of failing, which makes the movie, despite being a step back in humour and inventiveness, a Coen number one: in the category of those of their works one can easily spend an hour thinking about.",,Anonymous,Music
"A 1960's folk musician, as told through Bronze Age literature","For those of you who are considering seeing this movie, a few thoughts:From my point of view, the user-reviewers who didn't like it missed out on the subtleties and complexities of character and tone. A movie's not obliged to follow the same form as most, or tell a story we've heard before.There's odd, dry humor that percolates through it, as you might expect from the Coen brothers, but this is their more serious side.Unlike many of their other movies, this has a more sincere warmth to go with the darkness, the oddness, and the intelligence.It's a rich, sad, dark winter's tale. It's the kind of stiff drink of storytelling that would not be out of place in the Bible or Gilgamesh or other classic literature. It's about a man stuck in a time and place and manner of being, as he hits up against the limits of what is possible for him, and often is his own worst enemy.See this when you are in the mood for more nutritious entertainment, and feel free to give yourself just enough distance from the main character that you can have a good look at what makes him human.The music is great, and it's all live performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I don't see any green it!,"Inside Llewyn Davis is an interesting exploration of what it means to be true to your art in a commercialised world. The sixties was the beginning of the recorded music revolution, so it's a great place to meditate on these ideas. Llewyn Davis our main protagonist is an egotistical folk musician, one of many minor stars being churned out in this growing industry. He is penny-less, selfish, lost and traumatised from the suicide of his singing partner. He seems enslaved by his past while running fearfully to some illusive and vague idea of success. He's a man who suffers for his creative ideals but the people he meets and serves as a musician, don't seem to be interested in art but money and status. Or is it his gloomy and selfish outlook that causes him to see things this way, its bit of a chicken or an egg question.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lovely music and good acting are just not good enough for a Coen Brothers film.,"Lovely music and good acting are just not good enough for a Coen Brothers film. There has to be something intriguing.This film is good, but its not great. That is the disappointing part of a Coen Brothers film. If it's good, then it will just not work. This film specifically is a bout a musician and his cat. The cat plays an interesting role in the film.This is a musical, as there is lot of music and the protagonist is musician himself. Based in 1960's folk music, the music is just too good. Be it ""Hang Me""or ""Five Hundred Miles"". Thanks to the artists Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake and others.Production design and Cinematography are immaculate which is very much expected. The writing is good too. But it's actually the acting that made the lines good. Oscar Isaac shines as Llewyn Davis. But it's John Goodman who stole the film for me. His performance is so so good.This film triggered an interesting debate between me an my friend, as to why the end and the beginning are similar. Is it a metaphor or placed deliberately or is it something else. I missed it completely but when I reflected upon what I saw, it was interesting for me.So there are interesting aspects, but yet lot of the film is obvious. And if the expectation is a of a typical Coen Brothers film, you may be tad disappointed. Yet, definitely, this film is worth a watch. A 3/5 for this.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Cohen brothers do it again,This is quite simply a masterpiece and the Cohen Brothers finest work. Outstanding performances and nice cameo roles. This is a great film for someone who appreciates good cinema and not your run of the mill high budget Hollywood nonsense. The music is probably the best I've heard in a feature film for a long time. I highly recommend this film for fans who appreciate real cinema. A slow burner but instantly has a Cohen Brothers feel to the movie. I'm guessing the Oscars snub for this film for best actor was because the lead was not very likable and not a very nice guy I guess and the Oscar panel like to play it safe and unless you are an American hero you won't be nominated. In my eyes Oscar Issac had produced the performance of his life and should be very proud of his achievement as so the Cohen brothers.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Maybe my favorite Coen brother's film,"If you enjoy folk music, melancholy films, character studies or any alike this is a must watch.

Inside Llewyn Davis Finds the Coen Brothers in Sublime Form,"Winner of the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in sublime form & puts on screen an aimless journey of a messed up individual navigating through the New York's folk music scene of the early 1960s. The film covers just one week in the life of Llewyn Davis where we see him trying to deal with the increasing pile of obstacles he faces on a daily basis, most of which are of his own making. In short, Inside Llewyn Davis is simply an observation of a reckless individual who refuses to get his life together.In spite of having no definite plot, the Coen brothers somehow manage to make the film work through their remarkable use of dry humour & unconventional narration. The film makes great use of Coens' trademarks, the production design is impressive, cinematography is this film's most striking aspect, editing could've trimmed away some more scenes & the soundtrack introduces some wonderful folk additions performed by the cast themselves.As for the performances, Oscar Isaac delivers a breakthrough performance as Llewyn Davis & it's his brilliant performance only which makes it possible for us to sympathize with the quite unlikable character he plays in this film. Other supporting performances are also good but present in short doses featuring Carey Mulligan as Jean, Justin Timberlake as Jim, John Goodman as Roland Turner; a jazz musician & Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five. Also making a prominent mark is an orange tabby cat which is a symbolic character in the film.If you're into folk music, then you might find something to like about this film. If you're a fan of the Coen brothers, then you will find something to like about this film. On an overall scale, Inside Llewyn Davis is a tragically funny cinema that explores the bleak disappointments that so many people around the world face at some point of their careers and tries to expose a deeply unsettling truth; It's that even the most talented individuals don't always end up being the successful ones. Multiple viewings advised.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Music
Interesting Character Study,"The Coen brothers previous musically themed effort, O brother, Where Art Thou, proved that the boys have a knack for finding good music. Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk singer in New York in 1961. Oscar Isaac is a revelation in the title role. He has a great voice and hits just the right tone as a somber, starving and wandering artist. Carey Mulligan is a girlfriend and fellow singer, who, besides being an excellent actress, is also a talented singer. The entire cast is good, and the Coen's script has the expected sardonic humor we have come to expect. I am taking away a point for an extended scene with John Goodman which is funny for a few minutes, but drags on and is out of place in this film. The music is beautiful and makes this a movie worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Outside looking in,"I know nothing about the folk music scene in early 1960s New York, yet I found this film engaging, funny, thought-provoking, and moving. The Coen Brothers can be a bit arch at times, and there are hints of clever-clever in Llewyn's (Oscar Isaac) fraught relationship with Jean (Carey Mulligan), but in the end one is left with the sense of a serious and intelligent story with plenty to say about the nature of the music 'biz' back then and now – the Moebius strip narrative structure is there for a reason.The title character is a struggling musician, recently forced to become a solo act following the suicide of his buddy. Homeless in winter, despondent about his existence yet passionate about his craft, he sofa-hops his way from day to day. He wants to be taken seriously, but no one seems to understand him, inside or outside The Business.The Coens lucked out with their lead man. Isaac is a talented musical performer and a subtle actor. From Barton Fink to The Man Who Wasn't There, the brothers like to throw their ostensibly passive protagonist into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party of a world, and obsess over amusing minutiae whilst alluding to vast themes of fate, integrity, and free will. Here, Llewyn is drawn toward his destiny by a runaway cat called Ulysses. Along the way, we encounter a variety of cameos, from the likes of John Goodman (obviously), F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake. I had the sense that each represented a different aspect of the essential conflict at the heart of Llewyn's journey: between personal integrity and simply making a living.Crucially, the music is fantastic, and each song – whether a ballad from the man himself, a comedy pop record, or a quartet sea shanty – is given time to play out in full. It never feels like the Coens are sniggering at the perceived quaintness of the period.On the outside, this film has the qualities of a comedy; but it's an absurdist humour which leaves a tragic aftertaste. Don't expect the screwball madcap of Intolerable Cruelty or Burn After Reading. Inside Llewyn Davis is closer in tone to A Serious Man – except this the more accessible film, and probably the brothers' warmest film to date.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A loser's tale,"New York City, the early 1960s. Folk music is briefly fashionable; still, there are too many musicians, and not enough money to support them all. Eventually, in real life (but also at the end of this movie), Bob Dylan first energised, then eclipsed the scene. But 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is mostly the story of someone who doesn't make it, a hapless loser whose hopes decline steadily throughout the film, with a mixture of comedy and pathos. Some parts (the road trip) I really enjoyed, although others were predictably painful without any relief. As for the music, I quite like it, and it's respectfully treated, although you can also see why its intensity didn't make too many fortunes for the people who sung it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A pleasant watch - unless (folk) music is uninviting for you,"As I have managed to see all movies directed by Joel and/or Ethan Coen (many of them even multiple times), it is natural that Inside Llewyn Davis was on my list as well. I like the Coens' approach, choice of character actors, and that all characters are ""odd"" in different ways. The same applies to the movie in question, where the viewers are invited into the New York folk music scene in the 1960ies; thus, there are many songs fully performed on different occasions (probably annoying for them disliking Bob Dylan, The Byrds and like), but they are masterfully carried out and fully fit into the general context, at times, there are funny scenes during or after them. The mood of the movie is rather gloomy, stressed by the gray weather, and the protagonist's condition/situation and lifestyle enables to logically introduce the bunch of colorful characters and witty lines - with Roland Turner (splendidly performed by John Goodman) as the most ""Coen-specific"" one.As for the cast, as typical to the Coens, there are both known and less known persons involved. Goodman is a kind of Coens' trademark already, Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake have suitable roles as well, Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis was not so vivid to me - perhaps due the fact I cannot remember him from other movies. But still, the chemistry is there, and the development/fate of characters remains unclear, unsettled - so pleasantly characteristic to the Coen brothers as well.All in all, another nice contact with the Coens, although not at the level of e.g. Fargo or No Country for Old Men.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A MUST WATCH for any music fan,"This is an incredible film and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, including the credits. I was immensely pleased by this movie and no amount of trailers could have prepared me for the full experience.I should warn that anyone who doesn't enjoy either slow movies or folk music will probable not like this film as much as the next person. The Coen style of dark humor is prominent throughout the film, albeit very drawn out. I think it's appropriate for the support of the protagonist's struggle.The color process, and scenes filmed are generally dim and void of any bright colors like orange, yellow, or red. They have a soft focal effect and much of the movie has a cold feeling. (besides being filmed in winter) Many of the shots are serene and beautiful in a very simple kind of way, which I appreciate because the it lets the film focus on the musical experience and marries the two into something incredibly original.The last time I had my emotions thrown as much was when I watched ""Her"". That movie deeply upset me and I neither laughed not cried... that's another review. This film made me laugh and cry throughout. By the end, I was... I couldn't describe the type of laugh I had between the tear of joy streaming down my face.Do you love music? Are you a musician? Are you an artist... any kind? Do you have a primal struggle? Do you feel your life is crap? Do you like cats? Hell, are you a sucker for having a laugh/cry alone in front of your big screen for a quality movie because you already have a bias for all Coen films to be gold... you don't even need this review!I would highly recommend this film if you answered yes to any of those questions. Lots of great surprises and typical Coen humor. Obviously a must watch for a Coen fan but a great film to ease someone in who's never seen..? Please watch this movie. I guarantee you will like it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Little Too Much Depriciacion,"First of all, movies are about entertainment, these days they compete with computer games - big-time. Action captivates, enthralls, exposing people to emotions they want and enjoy, rather additive. This is a self depreciating movie, about failure, failure to connect. It is quite funny at times, and exposes the advanced emotional ability of the singer and his struggle parlayed against the drumbeat of those who have none. Most successful movies have always been about how we overcome, giving more than we have,,'overcoming the odds', no matter what. This is what makes us human, makes us unusual in the animal kingdom, makes us unusual in this universe! For all the ""Cohen Brothers' have to offer this is a missed opportunity evoking only disappointment by the character. I did hope for better, especially exposing a topic that is as important as 60's ""American folk music"" and it's raw expressionism. More excitement did come, the 70's and it's LSD/everything influence, thanks Bob D. for introducing a new way of thinking and paving the way for others. Dg...",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Glossy portrait of a miserable man,"Most of this movie is watching Llewyn run around trying to figure out where to sleep and where he can get a bit of money. He's a bit of a jerk so it's sort of fitting that he has a hard time.After sitting through this I tried to figure out what was the point of it all. Why would the Coen brothers want to tell this story? I came up with two scenarios.First, as someone who is a bit of a jerk myself, I suppose it allowed me to reflect a little bit on how it can be sort of miserable being a jerk. Apart from that, there were a few cheap shots at the square characters in the film, which I guess is a bit of consolation for all the wallowing in your own misery that this film incites.The second scenario, if you're a bit of a nice person, I suppose you might get some guilty pleasure out of seeing a jerk suffer.We are given a possible explanation for why he behaves the way he does. It's a minor suggestion of a 3rd dimension to a character in a movie in which all the characters remain flat caricatures.The backdrop is early 60's Greenwich village, but that seems largely irrelevant. I don't think any effort went into trying to give a sense of what life was like in that particular space in time. Apart from the retro set design, old cars, and prevalence of acoustic guitars, the story could just have well have taken place anywhere. The music is well recorded and the singing is pretty good. They were wise not to stick in any of the cliché folk songs that are often associated with this period in history. But the only song that actually stuck in my head as I made my way home from the theatre was the recording of the Dylan song they played. I suppose there's a few subtle hints that might make people try and connect characters in the film to real people, but there is little substance behind these hints.It is well filmed, interesting camera angles, and nice cinematography, but that is not enough to make this worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A case study in the beautifully bleak which pivots around the crumbling fortunes of folk musician Llewyn Davis,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a case study in the beautifully bleak; A gorgeous accrual of the damned unlucky. The fortunes of Llewyn Davis go from bad, to worse, to the awkwardly oppressive; to holy HECK whose temple have you desecrated? The opening scene is immersive. A shallow focus makes pointed commentary as we edge into contact with the protagonist. His eyes are shut to reality. Everything in ""King Midas's idiot brother's"" reach is blurred, undetermined, unstable. The camera flutters over a stilled audience, ash slumps from a cigarette: a testament to Oscar Isaac's eerily stunning performance. Yet this illusory solace is not given licence to last. The scene ends with Llewyn Davis in the gutter, having being subjected to an unexplained assault. Thus ensues a deliriously convoluted anti-plot; a gluttonous indulgence in structural perversion. Inside Llewyn Davis is remarkably open. The glory of the Coens' direction is that the audience is granted the respect to interpret the poetic pit stops as they please. And my-oh-my there is a veritable feast of symbolism on which to chew. One notably meaty motif is the cat, inarguably the cutest exercise in thought provocation à la feline since Breakfast at Tiffany's. Although admirably pernickety in its devotion to period and place, Llewyn Davis' plight is universal, and smattered with moments which tease dark mirth from the painfully blunt. The Coens' deftness of direction filters levity into depth with harrowing immediacy. Yes, this movie is funny. And it traverses many shades of humour. From the space race schmaltz satire ""Please Mr Kennedy"" (Adam Driver I enjoyed you, and that's not just my inner Girls fan talking), to Carey Mulligan's lesson in awkward swearing, to the house pleasing ""Where's its scrotum?"" I challenge you not to giggle in the midst of the morose. Inside Llewyn Davis is a bittersweet ode to the greyness of life; a quality Mirrored in the muted pastels of Bruno Delbonnel's Oscar nominated cinematography which is not only atmospheric, but meditates on Davis' story, making observations of its own. Further praise, goes to the cast. Oscar Isaac is the newly patented face of bitterness. But everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, packed a punch. Watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"I get it, many others missed the point.","Inside Llewyn Davis is the latest offering of the unstoppable Coen brother movie machine, and perhaps the most sophisticated. Unlike Fargo, or No Country For Old Men, they don't beat you over head in this one, with obvious characters for you to hate and love. In this movie, they make you figure it out yourself.Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk musician, coming of age in the glorious folk scene of the early 60's in Greenwich Village. It should be a romantic orgy of self-exploration, overnight successes, and the coming promise of free love.But that's not what the Coen brothers deliver. They give you a horrifically flawed individual, wandering through this mystical landscape, but somehow unable to reap the benefits. Llewyn Davis has the look, he has the sound, he has the songs, he is brimming with talent. But over and over again, all of his experiences and relationships fall away into nothingness, and his music never captures audiences thirsty for the music that moves them.That's because, Inside Llewyn Davis, is nothing at all. This is brilliantly laid out by the Coens, when Davis goes on a quest to find a Chicago music manager, who might get his career back on track. The manager asks him to play something from his album (oddly enough, the same title as the movie). What does he find? An empty shell, albeit a talented one.This movie is brilliantly filmed, richly layered with characters, and perfectly plausible as a true story. But this is all just a vehicle for a singular Coen message: if you don't care about anything in this world, if you don't engage life, embrace others, develop meaningful relationships, develop yourself as a human being, then all the talent and opportunity in the world won't help you - your life will be nothing more than a tormented waste of time.It's a message for the ages, a warning for today's society, a truth that time cannot destroy, cloaked in romance and wonder at the dawn of the most dramatic cultural awakening in North American history.So, if you're looking for something deeper, not satisfied with explosions, happy endings, and worn-out clichés; if you want a movie that will make you reflect on your own life in a way that might make you clutch to those you care about just a little bit closer, then I recommend you take the ride, and see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Who is it aimed to?,"I'm a folk lover from Bob Dylan to Leonard Cohen, Pentangle, Fairport Convention, Alan Hull, I am listening to a lot of Bert Jansch latelly but I also love early sixties bands like Simon & Garfunkel, The Mamas & the Papas, The Byrds, The Lovin' Spoonful, ... I also like anthropology so I thought I was really going to enjoy this. I felt the movie was going to be slow from the very first song. It really has a sixties feel in it, it slightly reminded me of The Graduate, which is probably my all time favorite movie, and I couldn't help but feel that there is a lot of good elements that are missing here like humour and a pace. I've seen other Coen brothers' movies, I am aware that they tend to do downward spirals but this is kind of a waste. I think the reason why most of their other films worked for me was that, at any point, I felt sympathy for the protagonists. It is kind of essencial for the process and it really doesn't happens here. There are no good things happening to Llewyn and at some point you just realize he really is kind of an a** and deserves it. No identification at all. It has some great cinematography, the movie just looks beautiful, great filming and great acting, but it's not engaging and it's also very slow. I feel like people who say this is good are trying to look smart.",,Anonymous,Music
Folk Music: A True Underdog Story,"In true Coen Brothers style, Inside Llewyn Davis is five hundred miles away from their last film, True Grit. Unlike the tense revenge western that True Grit was or the screwball comedy that was Burn After Reading, Inside Llewyn Davis is surprisingly down to earth which is refreshing change of pace as today's film market seems to be filled with over blown Hollywood disasters and it is nice to see directors like the Coen's, Scorsese and Winding Refn that don't feel like they have to cater to the lowest common denominator as Llewyn Davis is one of the most genuine, subdued films of the new century. Despite this, Inside Llewyn Davis keeps the quirky and sharp dialogue you are likely to find in any of the Coen's films is still present and correct.Oscar Isaac of Drive fame stars as the eponymous Llewyn Davis (it's Welsh), a down on his luck folk singer who is just trying to find fame whilst barely scarping by. Davis, in true Coen fashion is, no loser, no two ways about it and Isaac plays it with convincing subtly. All the other actors are extremely competent as well. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake star as folk duo Jim and Jean and John Goodman in what is possibly his best role yet as Roland Turner a crippled yet articulate jazz musician who Davis hitches a ride with to get to Chicago. Each of the actors play their roles with their own style of performance. Mulligan plays Jean as a bitter, spiteful woman who cares little for anyone apart from herself and her partner Jim. Timberlake however plays Jim as a caring individual who just wants the best for Isaac's Davis. Goodman however completely steals the show in a role in what could easily have been a cameo but the Coen's expertly extended the role in what culminates to be some of the films best scenes.Inside Llewyn Davis is the Coen's best film since Fargo and much like Fargo; Inside Llewyn Davis combines stunningly distinct characters with a compelling story that is very loosely based on a true story or real people. All this makes Inside Llewyn Davis one of the greatest subdued masterpieces ever made and if you only see one Coen Brother's film in your life, make it this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Murray Abraham) in hopes of establishing a solo career.A striking recreation of the 1960s café scene, directors Joel and Ethan Coen bring their oddball blend of dark humour, eccentric characters and esoteric metaphors to the format.And while not every message is comprehensible and not every ballad is enjoyable, the artistry is undeniable.Incidentally, the folk singer movement ended the very day Bob Dylan became indecipherable.Yellow Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A tribute to every aspiring artist in the world.,"It's been three long years since the Coen brothers were enjoying their second peak of their career with the 1-2-3 strike of No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading and A Serious Man. While True Grit garnered similar acclaim, it simply hasn't held up for me as much, though it does have some worthwhile aspects. I'm overjoyed to see them explore something original that they clearly care passionately for as music is such a key part of their films. Inside Llewyn Davis has a cynical but honest thesis. Not every talented artist makes the green. It's a film that not only makes you think about the origins of folk songs, where the frustrations of surviving feeds into the performance, but also all the great art the world has missed because they don't get exposure. Fortunately, the Coens don't have that problem and they're free to share this fascinating idea with us, as if they're accepting how lucky they are in the film industry.Inside Llewyn Davis is like a mix of O Brother Where Art Thou in the focus on music with A Serious Man in its thoughtful deconstruction of conventional storytelling. Plot threads start in the middle, some subplots don't even conclude. It deliberately goes nowhere, mirroring Llewyn Davis' rocky path in life. It's cinematic, but it feels true to life. However, that lack of plot is a blessing and a curse. Even though the film is already relatively short at 100 minutes, it needed some significant trimming. There's too many scenes which didn't feel like they affected Llewyn besides as merely physical obstacles to his doomed goal, particularly John Goodman's character. Granted, in typical Coen fashion, the comedic timing of their side characters is an absolute joy, particularly Stark Sands, Adam Driver and the bark and bite of Carey Mulligan. But this is the Oscar Isaac show.Despite a challenging and short role, he was a highlight in Drive. For a character I expected to hate, he was surprisingly likable. Ostensibly he was born to play Llewyn Davis. Although he can be mean-spirited, short-tempered and egotistical at times, he's sincere and not delusional, so downtrodden yet determined that we can't help but support him. He's the spokesman for any aspiring artist and watching his dedication and heartfelt passion is satisfyingly reassuring. Only the Coens could get away with a script like this. A character-driven story about a loser who goes nowhere twice. I read it beforehand out of curiosity a few months ago but I wasn't too impressed given its sloppy economy and use of jump cutting. It was entertaining, but not as thought-provoking as the end film. Fortunately their sharp editing of the film makes it more dynamic and the witty lines shine through. It's certainly one of their funniest films in a long time.However, it still struggles with pacing a little bit, especially as its third act seems to linger rather than payoff. It's surprisingly entertaining and quietly poignant in moments that cut to Llewyn's core. The selection of songs makes it a better experience too, especially their perfect choice of recurring songs in ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" and ""Fare Thee Well."" The original song ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" is ridiculously catchy too. I wasn't sure about the cinematography from the early trailers. It looked too washed out and post-processed even though I loved Bruno Delbonnel's work with Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It grew on me however, especially in incredible wide shots. That rich atmosphere feels like an eternal winter. The Coens have created a wonderful portal to a compelling and creative period, but it's not one I would want to live in, just visit 100 minutes at a time.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A well made and acted tale but slight by the Coens lofty standards,"The Coen Brother's certainly know how to make depressing oddly entertaining and continuing on in the vain of Barton Fink, A Serious Man and arguably other of their films, Inside Llewyn Davis is a seriously morbid film that finds much humour in its protagonists failings but due to the limited nature of its story it is not hard to see why (despite many bemoaning the fact) come the Oscar nomination process Davis was virtually shut out completely even though many hailed it one of the years best.Our depressed figure here is Llewyn Davis, a folk singer so morbid and bereft of lightness that hanging with him for these 100 minutes can at times be as hard as the winter streets of New York. Llewyn is rightfully miffed at his current life situation as his musical partner has recently committed suicide, his new solo record is earning him nothing, he doesn't have a place to stay and his friends women Jean (played by Mrs. Marcus Mumford herself Carey Mulligan) is pregnant with a child that is possibly his. Many of these situations that Llewyn finds himself in are typical Coen Brother scenarios and Isaac is a fine leading man in what could well be a career defining performance for him but it doesn't make Llewyn any more tolerable as a person and character. With such an overly morbid tone that film is made around its fantastic music and top notch production design.With dynamo musical producer T Bone Burnett at the helm of music duties and with help from Mumford and Sons frontman Marcus Mumford the music in Davis is such a blast that it elevates the film from what could of been a permanent state of neuroses. Setting up the tale of Lllewyn around the folk scene of the 60′s was a masterstroke move by the Brothers and is fantastically captured by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel in what was a rightfully Oscar nominated aspect of the movie. You can feel every breathe of cold winters air, every smell of a cafés cigrettes and every strum of a well played guitar. The film excludes atmosphere and would easily rank as one of the Coen's most well filmed movies which is a grand feat indeed in a catalogue of beautiful movies.With a great soundtrack, a well performed and casted group of actors and with a great visual eye Davis is a quality made film that is also a tale which could of done with a little more narrative scope. The journey Lllewyn and subsequently we take in the end is nothing more than slight and The Coen's with all their other fine elements would of been wise to enhance the story that little bit more. Always watchable, often enjoyable yet not always lovable, Inside Llewyn Davis ranks as another fine Coen Brother movie but perhaps one of their less meatier jaunts.3 and a half couches out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coens Made a Regular Film,"I enjoyed watching this movie. The narrative is interesting and engaging. The characters are mostly well-portrayed. The songs are decent but dry which is understandable given that it's only meant to be heard once or twice. There are a few moments that were as clever or intriguing as anything the Coen Brothers have done but there is an overall lack of subtlety for most of the movie that is uncharacteristic of their films. It doesn't really feel like a Coen Brothers movie but more like a regular story about a folk singer; an enjoyable one but nothing too special. The story does has its twists and turns and ambiguities but the film, as a whole, didn't stick in my mind after the way that I had hoped it would.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

From ""Barton Fink"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" to ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"", as one fellow amateur critic put it, you can always tell when you're watching a Coen Brothers movie, despite how different they may play. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is in the same vein, yet still manages to stand alone as a unique tale of a man who's either a self-absorbed jerk or a supremely unlucky soul. The film makes no judgments of its' own, and through its' quirks and memorable dialogue, it stands as a supremely enjoyable, if not melancholy masterpiece.Llewyn Davis (Isaac) has an abundance of talent, evident from the opening scene as he performs a soulful folk scene. Unfortunately, he carries an abundance of arrogant negativity with him as well. After the opening number, bar owner Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella- Doogie Howser's old buddy if you can recognize him) tells Llewyn that a friend wants to speak to him outside. This is no friend- the gruff man is angry about criticism Llewyn threw his wife's way at an earlier time, and proceeds to beat Llewyn senseless. It's a great tone-setter for the film, as we can sense Llewyn's greatness with music and his propensity for poor social behavior in the same sequence.That knack for paining others doesn't stop there. Upon waking the following day, Llewyn manages to lock himself out of a friend's apartment after mistakenly letting out the house tabby cat. Then he calls upon folk-singing 'friends' in Jean (Mulligan) and Jim (Timberlake) to stash the cat while he takes care of business. The problem? Jean is none too happy with Llewyn for reasons I won't reveal, and then he lets the cat escape out of their window. The same day, he upsets his sister after a brief visit. See a pattern yet?Llewyn just can't get out of anyone's way, including himself. He's without a partner (who appears to have killed himself without reason), without a permanent home, without a competent career plan or agent, and without a confidant. He has plenty of 'acquaintances', whom he calls upon to provide him with a couch to sleep on, but even they have become disillusioned with him. There are those that will see this film and feel sorry for Llewyn, and others who will feel he deserves what he gets. It's hard to argue with either point of view, but here's an alternate thought- he seems to meet everyone on their worst day. Could it be that Llewyn is just trapped in a vicious circle of self-doubt and bad timing, made worse by how callous he's forced to become with everyone's negativity towards him? I got the impression that the character means well, in all honesty- he's just locked into a good run of bad luck.I'll try to illustrate my theory by describing a series of scenes in the latter half of the film. Llewyn has decided to make his own luck by hitching a ride to Chicago, whereupon he'll meet Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), producer extraordinaire, who will realize his talent and make him a star. His companions for the trip are Roland Turner (Goodman) and Johnny Five (Hedlund), two more eccentric people Llewyn tangles with, and another cat. Llewyn ends up having to take the last leg of the trip on his own, even leaving the cat behind (it's just another being he'll let down, right?). Upon arrival in Chicago, it's clear that despite the conditions he's in, Llewyn is optimistic; he may not trust himself, but he trusts his talent. He meets Grossman, plays for him- and Bud isn't interested. It's not that Llewyn isn't talented, which is clear, but as the man says, it won't sell. I believe the film shows its' soul in this scene. Llewyn croons with a purpose here, his entire career and life leading up to that moment, but that moment has already passed him by. It's heartbreaking to watch, as Llewyn finally get his opportunity but cannot seize it. I loved how the camera slowly zoomed in on him while he played. It was as if we could, for that moment, dare I say, see 'inside Llewyn Davis'.Very few filmmakers are able to squeeze so much out of what might seem so simple, but the Coens are the masters. This is a flawless film for what it is- a multi-layered character study. On the surface, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" may seem like a basic, quirky story about a few days in the life of a jerk. Digging deeper brings forth a different result- a portrayal of a man who's been calloused by bad luck and what's projected on to him by others. The cycle of unfortunate luck and choices for Llewyn just goes on and on, encapsulated by the final scene of the film. It's a fitting ending for one of the best films of 2013, and we're left to wonder if Llewyn will ever catch a break.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Plunges you into its character's world and bathes you with his emotions,"While watching Joel and Ethan Coen's Inside Llewyn Davis, a film that undoubtedly details a fierce bout of depression its titular character is battling, I became deeply upset and sorrowful, to the point of simply not saying much while viewing it, lumbering through the remainder of my night, and finally, going to bed with a lump in my throat. I awake this morning to write the film's review in a more refreshed but still fragile state-of-mind.This is one of the strongest impacts a film has had on me in quite sometime. On this basis alone, the film deserves a glowing review, but thankfully, the film is stuffed with greatness that appears to be bursting from the seams, so that part isn't tricky. What's tricky is to convince you, the reader who perhaps hasn't seen Inside Llewyn Davis, why it's so great and why it's the next film you need to see. My only condition before continuing is you promise not to ignore this recommendation because the film is ""depressing"" or ""sad."" Set in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1961, the film follows a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Issac), a depressed and struggling folk singer, who has just lost his singing partner Mike Timlin after he throws himself off the George Washington Bridge. Llewyn is now stuck in a funk, forced to continue his singing career by himself, which we can see isn't going so well. Llewyn's performances in folk lounges and in impromptu meeting sessions is great, but one can tell he stood behind his partner Mike when performing. Llewyn clearly needs someone to help him sound more polished, but because he's forced to be on his own, this makes getting gigs and being accepted into the folk world that much more difficult.Llewyn is as wayward as one can be, currently not living anywhere, and frequently staying in the apartment of his closest acquaintances Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). Jim finds Llewyn to be a good guy to work with, while Jean loathes him; she tells him to his face that he is ""King Midas's idiot brother,"" for everything he touches turns to s***. Jean also reveals to Llewyn that she is pregnant, and fearing that there is a chance that Llewyn could be the father, decides to abort the child to do away with it entirely. Everywhere Llewyn goes, he finds little to no acceptance; even a mildly optimistic drive to Chicago with two other musicians results in Jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) browbeating him the whole way. His only companion is his neighbor's (metaphorical) cat, whom Llewyn guards with his life and lugs around with him wherever he goes, despite frequently losing it.Watching Llewyn be verbally assaulted, mistreated, and unappreciated, you just want to shed tears, which is what I did within minutes of the film. During the first few minutes, we hear the beautifully-sung tune ""Fare Thee Well,"" which Llewyn sung with Mike, while watching a clearly broken Llewyn riding the subway with the cat he so lovingly protects from danger. Yet, despite a scene like this, one questions how much we can sympathize with Llewyn. While he is clearly facing a deep, professionally and emotionally affecting depression, we see him neglect important things, like the feelings of his acquaintances, personal responsibilities, his constant refusal to compromise, and so forth. Some viewers may find Llewyn difficult to sympathize with; once you realize that many of his actions are likely attributable to his severe bout of depression is when the character becomes easy to have sympathy for.Llewyn wouldn't be the character he is without the help of Oscar Isaac, an incredible new find of an actor who you will hear more and more about in the next few years - mark my words. Isaac nails the beautiful nuances and facial expressions that indicate something is right with our protagonist. He handles the outbursts, the heartbreak, the smug wit, and the complications of Llewyn with biting realism and understated craft, never becoming too over-the-top nor too subtle and inhuman. Other talents that encompass the picture are Mulligan, Timberlake, and Goodman, all of which bringing their own character to the table in an effective manner.Then there's the incredible music and cinematography that just loan themselves to the material at hand. The music, first and foremost, is riveting, built from the ground up on some of the catchiest and most memorable folk ballads you've heard in years. From the exceptional ""Fare Thee Well,"" to the goofy and infectious ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" the smooth and soothing ""Five Hundred Miles,"" and the somber performances of ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" by Llewyn, which bookends the film, everything about the picture's soundtrack is moving and effective. Then there's the beautifully bleak visuals, thanks to renowned cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who effectively personifies depression through the film's excessive black and gray visuals. If you call the film's palette of colors ""ugly,"" you're only reemphasizing the feelings of the protagonist of the film.Inside Llewyn Davis plunges you into its lead character's world utilizing what could be classifiable as mumblecore filmmaking techniques, giving you many different emotions to feel and many different instances that you can either quietly laugh at or simply sulk at. Watching this film, as stated, was an incredibly emotional experience for myself, not on a personal level but a human level. The Coen brothers have gone on to detail one of the best films about depression and loss that I have yet to see and, in addition, have made a film that speaks to the folk music world in a lyrics and themes far too many of them probably understand.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty good,"This film is nothing amazing, but it doesnt have any notable issues either. Its just good. The llot is a bit slow at times ehich makes the film a bit boring. The films best feature is its cinematography, which makes to film so good to look at. The actors are a bit uncharasmathic. However they make up for this by singing well. In general, this film is okay. It probably wont last long in my memory 
 and certainly isnt as iconic as other Coen Brother films, such as Fargo and Raising Arizona.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"An anti-hero story,  inspiring human compassion","It's a very slow movie, and slowness reflects the lethargy of an anti-hero, the folk singer Llewyn Davis who wanders along the roads of a music-living Greenwich Village, where it is difficult to come out, although you are a talented artist and are in love with what you sing. Davis is very vulnerable, probably beyond hope in this sort of Odyssey, his voyage is a no home-direction voyage, with no Penelope waiting for his return, but if his sluggish attitude may annoy, it also inspires human compassion, in this case for a man who probably believes in art, but understands that art is not enough, and cannot cope with this matter of fact. The real tragedy lies in the incapability to connect to others, and first to himself, he is both self-centred and stuck on a motionless existence of his own making, you get angry with him and would like to slap him, but in the end, you cannot hate him.Isaac plays a difficult role with the due intensity and the right sensitivity, mainly when inspiring contrasting feelings, mainly that feeling of wanting to give up which makes him a universal character. The rest of the cast, although playing minor roles, help design the mood of a charming and yet contradictory musical era. And the ginger cat Ulysses (a significant name, indeed) is awesome and the scenes with Davis wandering in the Greenwich village with him in his hands and his guitar in tow are the ones I liked most.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Its hard to like this movie, but I love it..","My Second film of Coen brothers after I watched ""The Big Lebowoski"" and I think Coen brothers are really best. Very small, simple, artistic movie about the life of struggling singer and his connection with different people.Set in the 1961 mostly in New York City, this film gives a different shade of New York which I personally fell in love with. Llewyn Davis played by Oscar was simply amazing, and I think lot of the work was done to the development of this character.The other roles played by Carey mulligan and Justin Timberlake were small but they do leave their mark.If you just look at the story line of this movie, you would think that this is a sad or depressing movie, which sometimes it becomes. But all the credit goes to director, cinematographer and music that goes along with this movie, you kind of get captured in the beauty of this art.My rating for this movie is 8 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The story is quite trivial and uninspiring, with little humour.","Inside Llewyn Davis tells the tale of a moderately gifted singer/songwriter, back in the early 60's when the likes of Bob Dylan was on his way up. Davis tries, unsuccessfully, to make a name for himself in the pop music business.It is a nice little movie, extremely well made by the much loved and highly rated Cohen brothers, but ultimately, the story is quite trivial, uninspiring and not deserving of an Oscar, despite the general clamour than it should have been nominated.Llewyn Davis, the lead character, is not a very appealing or likable person and the film really doesn't go anywhere. All it is succeeds in doing is spreading a little more doom and gloom into our anxt - filled lives. It is supposed to have some humour, but apart from one or two isolated incidents, to me it was unremittingly grim.I am only mentioning this film because of claims from many in the industry that it should have been nominated for Best Picture. Trust me, they are wrong. It didn't deserve to have been nominated – any more than 'Her' deserved to be nominated.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A classic Inside and Out Llewyn,"Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't fail to intrigue its target audience which is obviously folk fans, supporters of Bob Dylan will absolutely love this film and anyone with the experience of busking and trying to break into the music scheme will find great memories and moments re sparked into their lives as Llewyn a young musician tries to make profit and reach success from his short music career.Having no real plot elements can make the story feel a bit slow at times as well as having a protagonist that we are supposed to like but have a hard time coping with because of his attitude. Otherwise the acting is top class and the music as stated above will capture the hearts of any Bob Dylan fan both young and old. Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan were both fantastic in their chemistry.All in all a fantastic film but it's re-watchability level isn't great unless it's for the music as there isn't much to miss except for a couple scenes that viewers may want to verify.Rating: A- Comment: A film for anyone but 60's folk fans are going to absolutely love it",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not the 60s people, scene, nor music... and a failure as fiction too.","So let's completely forget that Llewyn Davis is not Dave Van Ronk. Let's forget that there are historical inaccuracies in the scenery and other parts of the film (the Gaslight was tiny, not the cavernous club in the film, there was no alley behind that café, I'm somewhat doubtful that Davis would have been playing a 1928 or 1929 Gibson L-1 that looked so clean, when Llewyn is playing guitar in the car on the way to Chicago, he's using a Shubb capo. The film takes place in 1961; Shubb capos weren't available until 1980, while Llewyn is making a payphone call on the elevated subway platform (Woodside/61st Street), a modern 7 train pulls into the station on the opposite track, despite being set in 1961, Llewyn passes a poster for Disney's ""The Incredible Journey"" which was released in 1963, there is a Lava Lamp shown in one scene. The Lava Lamp wasn't invented until 1963 and wasn't available for purchase until 1965) let's forget everything and just approach this as a complete work of fiction.Plot: The story doesn't seem to go anywhere. The main character tries to find his way in the folk music scene but doesn't have much success, nor does he seem to put anything resembling a passionate effort into it. He goes through some moves and attempts a few things, but they seem half-hearted. Maybe he's just completely discouraged but he doesn't seem to invoke much sympathy in his attempts. Things just seem to happen to him and the people around him, oft-times for inexplicable reasons. Which may be due to...Characters and their development or lack thereof: There just doesn't seem to be anyone likable in this movie. Llewyn Davis is just not a very likable character. He's belligerent to the point of being hostile, self-absorbed, seemingly uncaring about the people around him, even his fellow performers. And yet he sings beautiful folk ballads about royalty and people and you wonder how the hell is he connecting to these songs when he can't seem to connect to actual humans? Now maybe that's supposed to be part of his ""mystery"" but I just find it confusing. There is no joy in Llewyn Davis' life, and so it's hard to really care about him. In fact it's hard to care about anyone, they're all pretty self-absorbed and unlikeable.Jean (Carey Mulligan) is another mystery. We know nothing about her other than she had a brief affair with Llewyn and hates him for it, is married to Jim (whom she says she cares about), but there's no character here... who is she, what does she think, where is she going? There's nothing to really like or dislike about her - she's just there.Jim (Justin Timberlake) is a cipher. Who is he and what does he want? He floats in and out, sings a song, gets a record deal for a commercial ""folk"" song he wrote (we have no idea how that came about other than to surmise that a John Hammond Sr-like figure had something to do with it)... he's a clean-cut nice guy but why should we care? He seems completely oblvious of what's going on around him.Troy Nelson (Stark Sands) may be the only likable character in the film because he seems to actually like the people around him. But he's depicted as a Forrest Gump-like simpleton character, so even his likability needs to be tempered.Jazz man Roland Turner (John Goodman) is a junkie who dislikes everything except for the really bad beat poetry that his ""valet"" Johnny Five (Garret Hedlund) spouts out. It's a relief when he's finally out of the film.Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), a not-even thinly disguised Albert Grossman, owner of the Gate of Horn club in Chicago, has nothing to make anyone like him... but then neither did Albert Grossman. He's only in it for the money and that's just the way it was.Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella), the owner of the Gaslight Cafe, is thoroughly sleazy and only books women who sleep with him.Al Cody (Adam Driver) is another folk singer who Llewyn crashes with and he might be a likable soul, but he's another nonentity.None of these or the other characters ever really develop a persona other than their surface personalities that just seem to be people you really wouldn't want to hang around with.Music: Some of the songs are quite nice, but what seems to be missing a lot of the time is the joy and passion that one would expect from this music and this time. Many of the songs are rather syrupy version of songs that originally had more of an edge to them.In all fairness the film probably does a relatively decent job in depicting the transition from people singing actual folk songs to the singer-songwriter school of folk music that Dylan, Paxton, Neil, Ochs, Anderson and others would soon usher in. But unlike ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", or other Coen Brothers films there's really noting about ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" that's going to make you want to go back and see it over and over again.Buy Dave Van Ronk and Elijah Wald's ""The Mayor Of MacDougal Street"" , get some of Dave's albums (especially the new Smithsonian release ""Down in Washington Square"") and have yourself a really good time!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
For true film lovers,"After watching many of 2013's juggernauts (i.e. American Hustle, 12 Years a Slave, Captain Phillips etc), the Coen Brothers' finest film remains as my favorite for the year. If you are looking for a generic Hollywood movie with a neat plot, perhaps with a 'surprising' twist and other cheap crowd pleasers, this movie is not for you. However, if you truly love film for its core purpose of emotional evocation, your $10 will be well spent on this ticket.Throughout the movie, I was finding it hard to cling to the slow moving story, as we follow Llewyn Davis through his unsuccessful musical career and life. But I realized that as soon we abandon our conventional approach to the way we watch movies, great films like this can be far more appreciated. This is not a movie that is driven by plot, but instead by mood and its atmosphere. Bruno Delbonnel's melancholy, wintry cinematography was clearly the film's greatest strength as it conveyed the growing sense of futility and gloom that Llewyn had to persevere.Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn Davis convincingly as the played-out, morose victim of many life failures. Through the entire film, his character expresses no enthusiasm notably due to his brokenness - however in one of the closing scenes, during his final song (Fare Thee Well), Isaac performs the song with truthful passion. At that point we see Llewyn's only real means of expression are left only through his art.I saw this movie as a truthful representation of an artist's futile pursuit for success. However others may see it differently and more deeply as futility in one's life or perhaps as an atmospheric portrayal of America's early folk music industry. Such ambiguity is the beauty of great films.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Folk fans will love it,"(66%) Not the Coen's best movie by far, but then again not their best is still better than most out there can usually manage. Everything here is as you'd expect, it looks great, the performances are solid from the start, and it feels, just akin to Llewyn himself, like a real labour of love. There isn't a huge amount to the story, but for what it's worth it's well told, and fans of folk music will be in heaven as this is a part musical filled with mostly live performances that play through the entire song, so if you dislike folk then stay the hell away from this. A worthy low-key quality watch, that has a dream like quality at times that's like no other.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Typical Coen brothers movie,"I always love the quirkiness of a Coen brothers script, and this film definitely hits that mark. The lead actor, Oscar Isaac, is terrific. It's rare that you find an actor who is also a good musician. What I found very unauthentic was the language. I was in my early twenties in the early 60's, and I don't remember people cursing that much. Unless musicians and New Yorkers were that much different, people just didn't talk like that. I don't know why writers always feel they have to be so over the top with the language. Sometimes it's just too much and becomes offensive. A good story otherwise. I loved the production design and T. Bone Burnett's soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A melancholy but subtly humorous character study,"I've been a longtime admirer of the Coen Brothers, and they have made some of my favorite films. Still, most of them have been accessible in some way. This one was quite a hard nut to crack. INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a loose story about a down-on-his-luck singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). To name a few problems, his former musical partner committed suicide, one of his sexual flings is pregnant and it may or may not be his, and he was recently let go from his record company. In other words, life is hard for him. To make matters worse, he isn't too sympathetic of a character either. His go-it-alone nature and tendency to speak his mind get him into hot water with a whole host of people he meets over the course of the film. And yet he keeps on going, devoted to pursuing his chosen profession. That was my way in, and what eventually helped me get into the movie. Despite what life threw at him, he never gave up. Not only that, but there were some truly soul-stirring songs peppered throughout which helped to lighten the mood, even if they did describe things like saying farewell and being hanged. I also enjoyed the color palette and general visual aesthetic of the film. It was almost like chiaroscuro with muted blues, grays and browns. Also, like most Coen Brothers films, this was a comedy, although there was more of a greater tragic/melancholy tone this time around. The closest comparison I can make is with their previous effort A SERIOUS MAN, which dealt with similar themes of a man against the world and falling victim to circumstance. However, LLEWYN DAVIS is played straighter and has a more uplifting resolution, if one can call it that. Overall, though my patience was tested at times, it was rewarded somewhat in the end. As far as technical filmmaking quality and the performers/performances involved, this some of the Coens' best work, even if it was a little dense for me at first. This probably isn't the best film for Coen Brothers initiates, but for seasoned viewers I feel like this could hold something special. In fact, I'll probably get more out of a second or third watch myself. Recommended, with some reservations.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Defies all expectations,"I have been shamelessly recommending their films to everyone I have met for the past half a decade, most of them gave them a watch and hated their films, now I have learned a lesson and try not to recommend their films to anyone. It's surely not everyone's cup of tea. I have been earnestly waiting for Inside Llewyn Davis from ever since I first saw its trailer about a year back. At first instance I shrieked at the idea of Coen brothers making a musical. Dark comedy and musicals does not really go together, does it?. They surely must have compensated on either the musical part or their staple dark comedy. After watching the film (twice) I am bemused at how they have proved me completely wrong. They made a film which is so very much a Coen brother film, and yet an absolutely brilliant musical. The dark comedy, although not that dark at times manages to get better on the 2nd watch and is fascinating. The film is about a folk musician called Llewyn Davis. It is set in the 1960s,an era which gave birth to one of the best country/folk musicians of all time, and ILD is surely a homage to that fact. Llewyn Davis is no rock star , neither is he astutely talented, rather he can be called an underdog, sleeping on couches ,kicked around by people and record companies. His music partner has recently committed suicide and he is failing to come to terms to a solo career. The film chronicles a week in his life. Llewyn Davis is played to perfection by Oscar Issac. The film has a fantastic ensemble cast which gives it the quirky feel it has got. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman are the most notable of the small but interesting characters in the film. The music from T Bone Burnett transcends all realms and takes you back to the 1960s. As it is the case of many of their films, ILD also has no background music ,the only sources of music are from live performances from various characters in the film. They are mixed in so seamlessly that you don't even notice the background music missing. Cinematography is very well done here.Strangely enough Roger Deakins did not shoot this , hope their long collaboration with the Coens does not come to an end. Bruno Delbonnel shot this and the soft touch he has lend to the film added to the fact that this is in it's basic essence a musical. Deakins may have done a better job but Delbonnel did not disappoint, in fact at parts it was brilliant ILD is funny and depressing at the same time, a combination which can be devastating in the hands of people not belonging to the class of The Coens.You leave feeling amused and sad at the same time.As Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian rightly said the Coens have hit this one out of the park.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Another great collaboration between the Coens and T Bone Burnett,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (preview screening)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 8/10Overall: 7/10As befits a film about a misfortune-plagued folk singer in the dark days immediately before Bob Dylan caused a resurgence in its popularity, Inside Llewyn Davis is full of great folk music.It not only runs through the background, but is woven into the story too. The up-and-coming Oscar Isaac performs several songs, leading me at the time to think he was an actual folk singer the Coens had convinced to act, and supporting stars Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake both raise their own voices, proving surprisingly talented at it.T Bone Burnett must be given a large part of the credit for the music. He chose and assembled the songs at the behest of the Coen Brothers, having previously performed a similar task on The Ladykillers, and on O Brother Where Art Thou's wonderful Mississippi blues soundtrack.The film has a different look to any other Coen Brothers film, due to a change in cinematographer: their regular collaborator Roger Deakins was replaced by Bruno Delbonnel, who has a handful of Oscar nominations under his belt, although it pales in comparison to Deakins' eleven!Once you get past the visual style though (which is actually quite beautiful once you get used to it) and Llewyn's surliness, the Coen's trademark wry, surreal sense of humour is much in evidence. ILD comes from the more sober line of Coen Brothers films than their zany comedies, but there are still plenty of laughs, in my opinion.And then, although he takes a long time to turn up, frequent Coens alumnus John Goodman's reassuring presence in a quintessentially Coen Brothers role could almost have been directly transplanted from any of the other films in their shared career.It's not for everyone, but as a die-hard Coens fan, I was not disappointed... and I will probably be buying the soundtrack before too long.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The ""Artist"" as a Timeless Cliché","I was excited to have the opportunity to attend one of the first stateside public screenings (Austin Film Festival) of Joel and Ethan Coen's Grand Prix winning Inside Llewen Davis. Having begun my own professional music career as a 14-year-old, peach-fuzz-cheeked wanna-be folksinger at Café Espresso in Portland, OR, under the mentor-ship of Marc Ellington — who bore more than a passing resemblance to Dave Van Ronk in size, talent, and facial hair — I had a strong personal interest in revisiting the era through the skewered lens of the Bros Coen.This is the same Greenwich Village described by Bob Dylan in his memoir Chronicles — brutally cold and damp, unforgiving in the way only an urban jungle can be. Llewen Davis, as portrayed by Oscar Isaac, reveals a timeless cliché: the egocentric ""artist,"" careening insolently from one self-induced disaster to the next while flaunting a sense of entitlement that is completely undeserved. The guy is, in a word, an asshole — a fact that bitter, accidentally knocked-up Jean (Carey Mulligan) never lets him forget. As a music guy, I respect that all the music performances were shot and recorded live, not enhanced with post-production tricks. Most music films are so far off base they make my skin crawl. There are some cool songs — most of which are rendered top to bottom — as well as a couple-a funny send-ups. However, I heard nothing extraordinary, composition- or talent-wise. I'd recommend that Isaac not give up his day job. He's a fine actor but an average singer-songwriter.The performance that justifies the price of a ticket is delivered by John Goodman. With this cane-wielding, junkie jazz musician, the Coens have once again invented a character for Goodman that dominates the screen with unpredictable, genuinely frightening, sickly hilarious power. In this extraordinary turn, Goodman rivals, perhaps even surpasses, his appearances in Raising Arizona and Big Lebowski.Inside Llewen Davis lacks the charm or brilliant cartoon quality of Oh, Brother, Fargo, or Intolerable Cruelty. It's an expertly made small film with no heroes and some listenable music. If you're hankerin' for a dark, chilly, cheerless tale in which nearly everyone's a self-serving dick, this is just the movie for you.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Absurdity, the spice of life","The Everly Brothers, The Andrews Sisters, The Carter Family, even Karen and Richard Carpenter; there has always been something special about family harmonies, something that separates them from all the rest no matter how good.The Coen Brothers, in their filmmaking harmonies, have clearly separated themselves from all the rest. With now a body of work spanning almost 30 years, they rival the accomplishments of any filmmakers anytime, anywhere, and in the vague and general category of Americana, I don't think they can be touched."" Inside Llewyn Davis"" is yet another foray into a character's existential journey into a Coen Brother's absurdist reality. Unlike most other Coen Brothers heroes which have a plan they attempt to execute and are resisted by absurd external forces, Llewyn Davis's biggest problem is himself.A talented singer/musician Davis tries to make his mark in the pre-Dylan Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 1960s. But he can't get out of his own way. He alienates his family and friends; he misses opportunities; and makes careless decisions that will haunt him in the future. He commits to no one and no thing. In fact he's a bit of an A..hole.Oscar Isaac has the difficult task of creating enough empathy for this extremely flawed character so that the audience will follow his journey through the length of the movie. With a certain quiet intensity, he pulls it off.Isaac fashions the character who is not so much following his own star, but is doing the best he knows how with the talents given to him. In the process of day to day life, Llewyn makes rash and expedient decisions that are largely determined by exigent circumstances that require that decision right now, and invariably those decisions are not so much wrong, but more they just don't work out.Opportunities are often best seen in hindsight.The Coen Brothers always create great supporting roles and this is no exception. Justin Timberlake plays Jim Berky a friend and fellow musician of Llewyn who does his best to help Llewyn out. I continue to be amazed at Timberlake's range as an actor.If you remember his cynical hustler in ""Social Media"", here he plays the exact polar opposite as a naïve stereotypical 60's pre Kennedy Assassination idealist who is absolutely certain that everything is going to turn out alright.Carrie Mulligan plays Jean Berky (Jim's wife) who has had an adulterous relationship with Llewyn. Mulligan gives a one note performance, always angry and berating Llewyn at every opportunity. It becomes a bit tiresome after a while, especially considering that she takes none of the responsibility for her own condition, but it seems to be what the script calls for so it's hard to blame Mulligan.John Goodman has his customary role in a Coen Brothers movie, here he plays a bombastic (what else could Goodman play?) passenger in Llewyns car pool to Chicago. I have no idea as to the purpose of this character and its relationship to the rest of the movie, but it's Goodman so it's entertaining to watch.Just as an aside, I often don't get what's going on in a Coen Brothers movie. To this day I don't really get ""No Country for Old Men"", but I liked it.F. Murry Abraham has one scene, and he dominates it. A great screen presence, I wish I could see more of him.And I would be remiss if I did not give the brothers credit for managing a great performance out a big orange tabby cat named Ulysses. It is Ulysses who probably elicits the biggest laugh of the movie.Coen Brothers fan that I am, this effort is a little too ambiguous for me. I like my characters to have a little direction, whereas the point of this movie seems to be the lack of direction. The brothers admit that there is no real plot to this movie,it is a character study, and the character is not all that appealing.It's the story of a screw up, but a not degenerate screw up, but a sort of ""everyman"" screw up. Our egos would have to be pretty high and mighty if we were to think that given the circumstances Llewyn found himself in that we might not make the same choices. It is this distinctly Coen Brothers touch that kept me interested in the movie.Still, in the end Llewyn is a character who one could say gets exactly what he deserves. That he is reaping that which he has sown.Of course you could say the same thing about ""Citizen Kane"". So there's that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

can I get my money back?,"What a cruel joke! We thought this was a pretty terrible movie. Perhaps if you are a lover of folk music trivia you can find subtle meanings. It was lost on us and we are big 60's folk music fans although we did enjoy the soundtrack. There were no characters in this film that we liked or cared about. Of course folk singers did have trials and tribulations in pursuing their craft but they were people with values, nothing like the singer portrayed here. The plot meandered from one mean vignette to another. The John Goodman sequence wasn't funny or deep, it was just annoying. The hallmark seemed to be that everyone when off on an irrational rant for whatever reason. The use of profanity was overdone. It further belittled the characters. I'm shocked that the film has apparently gotten some measure of critical acclaim.I was certainly expecting something clever and amusing. This was not it.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen brothers make beautiful music together,"The Coen brothers don't seem to feel bound by any particular genre, and that's a lovely thing for their viewers. With Inside Llewyn Davis, the writer/director duo delivers a gem of a movie about New York's 1960s folk music scene. Told in a pseudo-documentary style, the flick follows fictional Dylan-era singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) as he spends a week bopping from couch to floor to car, from New York to Chicago and back again, pursuing a career in music even as he becomes less enchanted with his calling—or at least with the lifestyle it entails.Inside Llewyn Davis is told so skillfully and with such authority that you imagine Llewyn really was part of Bob Dylan's scene. The film is grounded by a fabulous performance from Isaac, who nails the singing and guitar playing along with the acting. It also features an excellent soundtrack, produced by industry mogul T Bone Burnett.As you would expect from looking in on a week in the life of a talented, vagabond musician, the film unveils a fascinating smattering of characters, human and otherwise, who cross Llewyn's path. The supporting cast includes John Goodman, a scene-stealer as bluesman Roland Turner, and Isaac's Drive costar Carey Mulligan as songstress Jean, showing off the vocal chops she debuted in Shame.Overall, Inside Llewyn Davis is an emotional arrangement rich with mood and atmosphere; watching it often feels more like dropping in at a club than taking in a movie. There isn't always a clear direction, but each performance leaves you with the impulse to clap. And it's all wrapped up in an interesting finale that perfectly ties the film to time and place.This is a great picture. I'll be surprised if it doesn't wind up with more than a few nods, come Oscar season.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Amongst Coen brothers' best.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Coens Best,"From the opening moments of the film, Oscar Isaac's performance as Llewyn Davis had my heart aching in the sad beautiful way that only an old folk song can. The pain of a life full of work and hard scrabble effort welled up in my soul like the tears you shed for an old man who dies with an empty bank account and a well worn picture of his long gone sweetheart.I won't talk too much about the plot of this movie because it is one of those meandering plots that really serves more to explore the character of Llweyn than to entertain or create a tight through line. The film is really more about understanding the soul of folk music and one of the people who makes it.His frustrations and obstacles are the same as many musicians. He's nomadic, aching from a loss, flat broke most of the time, and seen, by many of the people around him, as a bottom feeder, living off of other people's kindness until he drives them crazy enough to force him to leave. He's a good performer but not a great one and a lot of the time his pain makes him a real jerk to those around him. He's a working artist.Normally I wouldn't go into such a lengthy description of a character but so much of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is about understanding the place that music holds in Llewyn's life and how he sees the people around him in comparison. The world around him is cold full of people who seem to want to use him for their own purposes then blame him if he asks for anything in return. Even the people who seem to really like him can't help but ask him to basically play impromptu shows in their living room.Yet his music speaks to them all. They may not know how to capitalize on it and he may not know how to turn his talent into cash but everyone seems to recognize that he has a gift.Enough about the character (although his complexities could be the topic of several essays.) The rest of the film is a stunning piece of work. The cinematography is subtle at times but not afraid to do its own share of the speaking in the film, alternating between the cold distance of the city of New York and its inhabitants as well as the close hominess of small apartment living rooms with couches that double as beds yet symbolize his vagabond status.The music is quite simply, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The soul of the performances is brilliant but the Coens continue to show their deep understanding of relating themes through their films' music rather than just playing nice songs. While Llewyn's music is aching and drawn out like your first high school crush, the music of the other musician's whom he disdains are snappy, calculated, arranged and somewhat robot like. In fact many of the songs not played by him feature countdowns and numbers, making it feel computed by something other than emotion.While this isn't the Coens' funniest film it certainly has its moments.Even while communicating serious ideas The Coen Bros. never forget that their audience is not a group of masochists who just want to punish themselves with sadness. Even some of the hardest moments of the film elicit guffaws, not because they are jokes, but because the turns are so unexpected, even as they are not usually great moments for Davis.As in many of the Coens' films, one of the things I find myself loving is their connection to the every-man. When the go to make a movie about a folk singer they don't make it about a famous or successful one. The majority of people work their lives away with recognition only from their family and friends, and even that is sometimes absent.Though they are famous, they don't seem to have let it remove them from telling of the woes and toil which befall most of the work-a-day folk who live in this world. Those people who may tell a story that makes their friends laugh but would never be a famous stand up comedian, the men and women who build other people homes too lavish to live in themselves, or perhaps the singer who could never sell out a theater but who picks away at a beat up six string and sings with a sadness that causes everyone in the bar to think of those they miss but still love.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hipster cinema at it's worst,"Seeing that ""Contains spoilers"" check mark while writing this review I thought to myself - is there anything in this movie that I could write that would actually ""spoil"" anything for other people. The answer I'm afraid is: no.Inside Llewyn Davis is a pretentious, pointless and incredibly contrived film by two brothers that have obviously lost touch with reality. This is hipster cinema at it's worst. No plot, no development, no climax and no resolution. Now, I'm no stranger to less known, artistic films. I'll take anything from Korean, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Portuguese, Japanese, Polish, Czech, English or American cinema. I really do enjoy slow, intricate movies. And I love character studies! Except, this movie doesn't really study this self-destructive jerk of an folk singer that's trying to work his way into music business. Because there's nothing to study. The guy's a talented a-hole with issues. I know a lot of those in person. And they're all the same.When the movie ended my girlfriend, a musician herself, simply said ""what a load of bull"". And I couldn't agree more. Even though I was desperately waiting till the very end for some kind of a big ""gotcha"" that would tie it all together and show that this movie does in fact make sense, that moment never came.The only good thing is that the songs are okay and the atmosphere of the 60's seems well portrayed. So I'm giving 2 stars for each.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Vivid Recreation of a Moment in American Popular Culture,"Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS dramatizes the life of the eponymous hero (Oscar Isaac), who tries to carve out a career as a solo folk singer after his partner commits suicide. The film vividly recreates the atmosphere of the Gaslight Cafe, a real-life venue that opened in 1958 and closed in 1971, where acts such as Bob Dylan, Bill Cosby, and Luke Faust performed. The Café attracted high- profile patrons: Jimi Hendrix was known to visit one night. Llewyn is never going to be that popular; but we have to admire his spirit as he tries his best, despite numerous obstacles placed in his way. The 1961 setting is significant: the Coen Brothers' film recreates a significant moment in American popular culture when people broke free of their conservative shackles and began to express themselves in much more basic terms. Politics became a legitimate subject for popular music, rather than the anodyne lyrics characteristic of many chart-topping hits of the late Fifties. Llewyn tries his best to emphasize the significance of his songs, but no one appears to listen to him. The film suggests that the music business was a cut-throat world, in which talent went unrecognized and agents only promoted the tried and tested, rather than the experimental. This is brought out in a significant exchange where Llewyn travels to Chicago, only to be rebuffed by the seedy-looking Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham). The film is full of significant moments and quirky casting: I particularly admired the casting of Justin Timberlake as Jim, another would-be folk musician who tries to change his name to guarantee success, but ends up on the musical scrapheap, just like Llewyn. Deliberately shot in low-key color, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS befits repeated viewings, in order to make sense of its multi- leveled structure. Potentially a contemporary classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Well-acted, if flawed melancholy drama with a unique touch of Coen brothers' dark sense of humour.","After scoring their biggest hit to date with their first Western genre, TRUE GRIT (2010 -- a critically-acclaimed movie which I personally thought was overrated), the Coen brothers goes low-key with INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in the winter season of 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS revolves around Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a talented folk singer who suffers a rough week following Timlin's unexpected suicide, his music partner at which they sing together as a folk group duo called Timlin & Davis. As Llewyn tries to embark into a solo career, his journey proves to be an unpleasant experience. With no money for a place of his own, he forced to crash with various friends from time to time. He even had a hard time trying to get paying gigs, while his girlfriend Jean (Carey Mulligan) thinks he's a total loser.THE GOOD STUFFFrom the sublime opening scene that begins with Llewyn singing ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" at the Gaslight bar, the Coen brothers successfully captured the melancholic atmosphere of the 1960s folk music scene surrounding New York's Greenwich Village. With the help of lush cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel and the distinctive period look by production designer Jess Gonchor, the movie certainly have the lived-in quality that transports you into the particular era. Even though INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a depressing movie, the Coen brothers manage to strike a fine balance between their downbeat tone and dark-comedy element without going overboard one after another.Apart from the Coen brothers' beautifully restrained direction, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is also a musical triumph for its folk music. This is largely thanks to the talented T-Bone Burnett himself, at which the songs are performed live by the actors themselves. From the above-mentioned ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" to ""Five Hundred Miles"" and a particular uplifting tune of ""Please Mr. Kennedy"", all the songs are simply top notch.As for the actors, Oscar Isaac scores a breakthrough performance as the soulful Llewyn Davis. He's particularly terrific the way he expresses the lyric when he sings a folk song while strumming his guitar with full of emotion. Equally great is the highly-talented Carey Mulligan, who is memorable as the estranged and foulmouthed Jean. The rest of the supporting actors, even the small roles from Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund to F. Murray Abraham, have their fair share of acting highlights.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)Three folk songs -- ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"", ""Five Hundred Miles"" and ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" -- are particular highlights that stuck in my head. The blackly comic but symbolic scene involving the orange cat is another must-see sequence.THE BAD STUFFThe debatable finale somewhat left me cold, and yet unsatisfied the way Coen brothers chooses to end the fate of Llewyn's career journey.FINAL WORDSMinor flaw aside, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS remains one of Coen brothers' best movies ever made in their illustrious career.http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The Coens explore the alleys and doorways of old Greenwich Village,"This one doesn't have the manic energy of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?,"" the Coens' last foray into American folk culture. Set in the Village in 1961, just before the big commercial folk boom took off, ""Llewyn"" is a dry, sardonic tale that asks the musical trivia question ""The first time that Dylan played the Gaslight, who was the guy that went on right before him?"" Oscar Isaac doesn't have the pipes of a great trad singer like Van Ronk or Ewan MacColl, but he does pretty well by the songs, and he gives a great performance as an actor. Llewyn loves the music, doesn't want to go back to just ""existing"" (specifically, signing on as a merchant seaman, like his father), but he's too hard-edged and uncompromising to do more than just scrape by. After he blows an audition by singing a dismal Child ballad (why not ""Cocaine Blue""? D'oh!), the clubowner offers him a spot in a new commercial folk trio if he shaves his beard and just keeps the goatee (that's Peter, Paul and Mary for you younger folks), but Llewyn just shakes his head.The story's played pretty straight; Coen brothers weirdness mostly occurs on a roadtrip to Chicago in the company of a junkie jazzman (that's the John Goodman part), a mumbling Beat poet and a big orange cat. Survivors of that era may hear echoes not only of Van Ronk but Tom Paxton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jean Ritchie (the gentle ballad singer that Llewyn heckles), plus an a capella version of the Clancy Brothers; a few red-diaper babies may even get the throwaway joke about the Schachtmanites. I must admit I was dubious at first, about both ""Llewyn"" and Llewyn (he's not a very relatable character, as they say), but being a confirmed Coen bros. fan, I watched the disk again and was totally won over.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Behind the moody enigma, a simple but beautiful statement: ""just respect the music""...","In ""O' Brother, Where Are Thou"", one of the best parts of a rather inconsequential comedy, was the catchy and somewhat penetrating singing of ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"", a little musical hit that played as significant a part to the plot that the role bluegrass music really played to appease people's anguishes during the Great Depression. In a way, folk songs were both the artistic outcomes and the fitting cure of these times of melancholia. And maybe this is why the Coen brothers decided to pay a second tribute to folk music, through their moody character study of fictional folk singer, Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Isaac, a real revelation to me.Study is an overstatement though as you don't learn much about folk music from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" except maybe the most essential thing, which is that music is something to respect, no matter where it comes from, and whom it addresses, music is a language that belongs to someone, borrows from a few ones and is shared with everyone. It's not just about the journey about Llewyn Davis consisting of many attempts to rise as a star and immediate falls, it's the journey of music within his experience. And adversity is the stuff music drains its creativity from, human suffering, folk songs are about everyday struggles, the haunting ""Auld Hand Triangle"" is a ballad about prison and hell, even the upbeat ""Please, Mr. Kennedy"" is about someone who doesn't go to space.""Who wrote this?"" disdainfully asks Davis, and Justin Timberlake's answer is priceless ""I did"" no big deal but he says it with such confidence that you better believe he takes pride in it, and why shouldn't he? In a later scene, Davis is asked to perform a song in front of friendly guests and for some reason, he's reluctant, refusing to be treated like a trained poodle, this is his way of living, and can't just sing like that. This attitude is rather contradictory with the way he criticized people with careerist moves, and his evocation of myths when it comes to the building of a star's image. In a way, Davis needlessly mystifies his Art when talked about career and when he's given professional advice, he brandishes the Artist card. Is he deliberately dishonest or innately erroneous?Character studies are never as interesting as when they deal with people full of contradictions, and Davis strikes like someone who's never really come to term with his personal issues, he holds his Art into high regard, but he refuses to make any concessions that could allow him to reach his goal. There's one thing though, he loves his music and he's never as convincing and mesmerizing as when he takes the guitar and sings, the rest of the time, he's hesitant, clumsy and pathetic, letting his impregnated girlfriend (Carey Mulligan) treat like him dirt without a reaction. Davis hasn't found his language to reach people, it might be music, but the film takes place in the musical sequence that came before Bob Dylan, so we know Davis won't be the 'chosen one'.Now, are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Maybe. Maybe not. I did recognize a pattern though: everyone who didn't show respect to someone's music got somewhat punished at the end. It starts with Roland Turner, a teasing instrumentalist played by John Goodman. When Davis, tells him he's a folk singer, the answer is ""I thought you were a musician"". Later, the pompous prick is found lying on the toilet floor, victim of an epileptic stroke. At the end, Davis is also put in the same place, hit by someone who seems to have a problem with him. The ending scene is the opening, but it's only at the end that we realize the reason of the aggression, like the punch-line of a song, and in a way, Davis had it coming for having disrespected music.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is perhaps the most enigmatic Coen brothers' film since ""Barton Fink"" and there are many similarities between Fink and Davis. These are two men who believe they are in touch with life, through their status as artists and common men, but they're not. Fink is so obsessed to be called a common man that he turns it into a concept that is totally unlike the world, and alienates himself physically (small hotel room) and morally (existential block). At the end, he really doesn't know where he stands for. And Davis is so wrapped up in his artistic ego that he's incapable to male concessions. And he's lost. But he'd rather give up than destroying his life, indeed, , there comes a point when self-esteem and passion interfere.The merit of ""Inside Lwellyn Davis"" is not to deal with this enigmatic character by writing a complex plot full of symbolism. This is a straightforward, rather neutral story, set in New York City of the 60's before what would be considered the greatest musical sequence of rock' n' roll 1963-1973. Even the cinematography is pastel, and gray as to illustrate this neutral period before the rebellious explosion, or the gray area where we can't really label Davis. In a way, he embraced the incertitude and transitional aspect of his time, being both a protagonist and a victim, loving so much his music he failed to respect the others.The film doesn't strike as a Coen masterpiece but there's something truthful and sincere about it. That they managed to hire actors who were also talented show that the Coen brothers really wanted to make the music believable and were lucky enough to find that special something and I bet they would have abandoned the project if a talent like Oscar Isaac didn't pop up. And indeed, there's not one single music scene that feels acted or artificial, I guess that's also out of respect to music.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Coen Musical,"I saw a preview of Inside Llewyn Davis last night. The press got the best seats reserved and members of the local folk station, which is playing several cuts from the soundtrack, got the rest. It was a logical move to fill the seats with people who should like the movie and fans of folk from the 60s through today should like the movie. The many songs are nearly all full length and performed by proper musicians (and Justin Timberlake.) Oscar Isaac is actually an actor now, but began as a musician and plays a struggling musician in 1961 New York City. I can't say if he's a good actor or well cast, but he is a great performer. Despite my dig at Timberlake, mostly due to his perfectly appropriate branding, he performed well also. His fans are unlikely to enjoy his performance, he plays folk songs in the style of Peter, Paul and Mary. That's not the only surreal aspect to the movie since it is fully Joel and Ethan Coen. This one is very dark, far more like No Country for Old Men than O Brother Where Art Thou despite the music, and funny if you like their humor (I do.) The Coen-style conversation is covered by Carey Mulligan and John Goodman with many other characters providing one-liners and other humorous moments, proper actors all. Music fans and Coen fans will all enjoy parts of the film, and soundtrack fans and Coen fans will love the final result. Hope it comes to a theater near you.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Truly evokes an era,"Inside LLewyn Davis truly evokes the era of the folk scene in 1961 New York, with a struggling musician (Oscar Isaac) trying to make it as an artist, or maybe better put, just make it through each day. I loved the musical performances in this, the supporting cast is deep and fantastic, and the film mixes some funny moments in with the (often self-inflicted) desolation this guy feels. Adam Driver singing his part on 'Please Mr. Kennedy' is hilarious. John Goodman spewing out all of his character's annoying opinions is too, and Carey Mulligan is perfect as always, especially while singing '500 Miles.' The crushing business aspect of the industry is perfectly captured in F. Murray Abraham's line ""I don't see a lot of money here"" after Isaac pour his heart out in song (he's brilliant by the way, did I mention that?). It really made me want to put on some old music from this period, as the streets we see in Greenwich Village bring to mind the cover photo from 'The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,' and the trio of course Peter, Paul, and Mary. Even as we watch Llewyn Davis's dreams flounder and wonder what will become of him, the window the Coen brothers give us into this time and place is lovely, and pitch perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I love 60s, and this movie shew a different view of the folk scene, maybe I could say from the inside. I understand many people won't like it, you have to like this kind of movies or at least folk music. No way near Walk The Line, or even Almost Famous, those are surely better movies, but if you really liked those then I think you will like this too.

Not one of the Coen Brothers' best films,"I hate to say it, but from all the Coen Brothers-films I've seen, I liked this one the least. It lacks some essential Coen Brothers-features, like bizarre characters, crazy plot twists and visual exuberance. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a rather plain film, sometimes even boring. I wouldn't have thought I would ever have to say that about a Coen Brothers-movie, but there you go.The film shows New York folk singer Llewyn Davis, who is a loser in every possible way. He has no commercial success, he has no money, he sleeps on couches at friends' and friends-of-friends' places, and he constantly quarrels with everyone he meets. This could be entertaining if it would lead to funny situations, interesting insights or dramatic developments, which it does not. There is a sort of running gag with a cat, but these jokes are very predictable and simply not very funny.The biggest problem with this film is the storyline. There is none to speak of. We see Llewyn riding the subway, walking the streets, sleeping on couches and quarreling with friends and relatives. The only time something actually happens is when he goes on a trip to Chicago, but even that turns out to be aimless. Oh yes, and we see Llewyn Davis singing. There is a lot of music in the film. That's great if you like sixties-style folk singing (men with acoustic guitars in the style of Pete Seeger or pre-electric Bob Dylan), which I don't. Even the actors don't really stand out, with the exception of John Goodman. His performance brings back the real Coen Brothers-feeling, but is rather short.This film can be appreciated as a reconstruction of the sixties folk scene in New York. The character of Llewyn Davis is inspired by Dave Van Ronk, a long-forgotten singer who was essential to the New York folk scene. I suppose there are lots of references to real-life people and events from that scene, but from the Coen Brothers I expected more than just a film for fans of sixties folk music.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Ballad of a common man,"A melancholic and gray atmosphere with folk music playing is the opening scene of the film. Enough for the Coens to pour out all their talent and expressiveness in what could be their best and least valued project.
The film runs for a week in the life of Llewyn Davis, a folk music singer-songwriter.
The Coen brothers transport the viewer to an era, rather than the journey of a story. In reality the narration does not have a fixed point, what is shown on the screen is nothing more and nothing less than Llewyn Davis inside, a common man, after all. It is not necessary that the film contain a story, precisely not having it and the simple fact of contemplating is what makes it so spectacular.
For this reason the brothers brilliantly compose the narration in a circular way and with an extremely sad, gray, but at the same time funny staging. It is almost as if the creators wanted to laugh instead of cry over the situation of the protagonist.
The Coen brothers are one of the most versatile directors today and this film does nothing but reaffirm this, at the same time that it teaches us how they are capable of creating an attractive tragicomedy for almost any viewer, since after all, the film it is but the ballad of a common man.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Not only for his amazing performance as an actor, as he perfectly plays the conflicted and subtly funny character the bros wrote for him, but as a folk performer who hits every emotional note as he sings. Another thing is that the songs where filmed live by the Coen Brothers and that peaks the challenge for Oscar Isaac just to the point to be amazed.While the other actors are bypassing side-characters (except for Carrey Mulligan who is more present than the others) all of them manage to play their roles pretty awesomely and feel like Joel and Ethan Coen picked them very specifically for the characters they wrote, as every one of them understands how they must play their figure so that the subtle comedy can work. This film showed us the ability that the Coen Bros possess to write original characters.The dialog was fun to watch as you always expected a dose of crude humor to suddenly pop up. And that's another aspect that was handled pretty good. The humor in the movie is very subtle, natural but never over used, and it comes mainly from the dialog and the performances who hit every humorous note needed.Scene selection is something that the Coen Bros excel at, and now that folk song selection is their thing too. These songs fit the mood of the movie perfectly which is bleak but at the same time sympathetic. And plus the beautiful photography this is a well done package.Being said, this movie isn't a cheerful one. Llewyn takes quite a life beating in many scenes and it may be a little melancholic for some viewers.But it knows it's themes and works with them in such a way that you won't get this film out of your head in a few nights.I just said that because this movie is deeper than just simply Llewyn's journey this movie has metaphors and symbolism in it that won't be easy to find but movie lovers will love to dig through the internet for answers. And that will be a gripe for some too. Many will feel confused because they just wanted to watch a fun movie or just sit back, relax and look at some meaningless crap (I sometimes like doing that too).So in the end, great movie, amazing music, great acting, an awesome pretext for making your brain hurt by analyzing it but clearly not aimed at the general audience. I am giving this movie a 9/10. Check my other reviews at http://thechannelofawesome.blogspot.mx/",9.0,Anonymous,Music
you never go wrong with the coen brothers,"it looks like it is time to start talking about some of the Oscar candidates, before the awards get here quickly. my main disclaimer is being a fanatic of anything coming out of coen brothers' imagination or captured by their lenses, which is a serious caveat when trying to analyze objectively any of their masterpieces.Inside Llewyn Davis is a story based on a period of the singer dave van ronk's life, and his battle to triumph in the music scene of the 60's in the Village. the dark humor of of the coen clan is present as ever, even though in this movie the ""dark"" part of it overrides the ""humor"" part, because, despite the usual genial bits of irony/sarcasm, the environment of this movie is itself covered with a blanket of clouds on the artistic growth of a struggling musician.Oscar isaac excels in his performance and both justin timberlake and carey mulligan are good highlights to the cast without compromising. in summary, this movie has everything the coen brothers got us used to, dialogs, cinematography, soundtrack, everything nearing perfection. in terms of cinema, the coen are like that person that comes and tucks us into bed when we're on the verge of entering dream zone.p.s.: there is a Portuguese proverb that says ""it is hard to please greeks and Trojans at the same time"". even though that is true for movies during the awards season, the fact this movie is not nominated to the Oscar of best picture (in a time of nine or ten nominees) or best adapted screenplay, is in itself telling of the strange criteria of some of these nominations.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Zero plot,"As compelling as Oscar Isaac is, and as much as I appreciate a character study, I need a movie to have at least some plot.Singer struggles. That's it. That's the entire story. It's not even a story, bc nothing happens. It's more a look at a state of being on the edge. A couple of potentially complicating factors are introduced, but they don't amount to anything. They don't actually result in any complications for him. So, there wasn't nearly enough here
to engage my interest.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Touching.,"There is something very lonely about the life of a musician. He seems cursed, to wander here and there, never quite obtaining what he wants and finding nothing but hardship along the way. Such is the case with Llewyn Davis. He is a rag-tag songwriter who sets out to make it in the world with little to no help from anyone, especially those closest to him.What I appreciated most here was the cinematography, which is very ""closed in"" and cozy. It overshadows most everything else. The acting is sufficient to carry the story, which isn't terribly original, but the film holds together and ends up entertaining you.There is definitely a Bob Dylan cutout the C Bros are trying to make with Llewyn, though they make him a little more sad and lonely, with his friends and lovers treading all over him. There is also a troublesome cat that adds to his woes.The end result of the film is sad and kind of unresolved, though maybe the life of a wandering minstrel is such. I'd recommend the film. There is good music and visuals and the C Bros always seem to know how to spin a good yarn, even when sad things are happening.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Subtle Mastery of the Craft of Film Making,"Like watching a Zen master flick a wrist, swishing a paintbrush, intonating silently ink to paper, seemingly haphazard, only to end with such perfect brushstrokes arranged, as if by a miracle, in the shape of a cat the Coen brothers have thrust Llewyn Davis into the cannon of their existentialist film stock. Inside Llewyn Davis insinuates a maddeningly frustrating folk performance existence on the title character. Like the drive up California's grapevine, it is nearly impossible to tell, while amidst the journey, that you are ascending a story arch. Only upon reflection can you see how far you've come, and indeed, the great heights achieved. As in life, there's no point in waiting for a punch line or a neatly revealed resolution - the point is the journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Boring, Boring, Boring","This character doesn't change at all during this two hour film. It feels like this movie is only about the music and not about the characters. Why was the John Goodman character even in this movie? The director doesn't give this character a chance to impact the Ilewyn character. The audience feels no empathy for the main character...why was this movie even made? The character does not change from the opening scene to the final scene. Do we care that Ilewyn has a temper tantrum? The answer is an emphatic ""No."" I love many of the Cohen Brothers movies, but this is not one of them. The film needs to be at least 30 minutes shorter and needs to dwell on more of the internal issues that the Ilewyn character is dealing with.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Does anyone really get it?,"""ILL"" is a film that we could admire. It certainly shows a lovely recreation of a period long gone, and it has a cool soundtrack, but we wonder if by the end of the movie, we really got what just happened. There is some type of odyssey, with enough references by a very talented pair of writers/directors giving us another artsy exploration of a flawed person's life.In here things just happen, and we're part of an audience who could be driving by a car wreck or a beautiful building, so we respond accordingly. The story's protagonist is certainly having a really difficult time that he seems to bring upon himself. His opinionated and arrogant persona certainly helps him derail whatever opportunity he might have to improve things. It certainly doesn't help that his fate appears to be written. Life appears just to be one messy circle.There's one big question here: Who is that ""gentleman in the hat""? Why is he so aggressive? Is he Llewyn's conscience? Just a figment of the extraordinary imagination the Coens are able to conjure? He is there at a critical moment, and we wonder if we just sat through 90 minutes to understand there is no hope here.Our ""hero"" jumps from sofa to sofa seeking help and shelter. He appears to take this for granted and rarely appears grateful. He visits people whom he appears to have wronged and shows little remorse. Even at times when he's given a way out of his mess, he finds a way to ruin the opportunity. We don't get much of a background, but we truly know his black cloud has been around for a while.The film is hypnotic, as we follow him around time, interacting with people who in one way or another try to tell him that his dream might not happen exactly the way he wants it. There's a mention of his ex-partner, and we wonder what drove Mike to his ultimate fate. A few people manage to remind him what will his ""hubris"" lead him to. Goodman's physically compromised character is a hoot. He tells us so much with his body language, and his santeria speech is a winner. Then we see the authorities at work, the power of bureaucracy and the simplicity of a poisonous remark. I want to thank the Coens for allowing F. Murray Abraham to use his facial expression and a very minimalistic dialogue to deliver one very effective strike.As I mentioned before, there is much to admire here, but it's not as good or entertaining as ""Oh Brother Where are Thou?"" or even the mysterious ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Here we are again, seduced by the critical mermaids, and are we being misled like the people who accompanied the mythical Odysseus? Is this tale another illusion or the victim of an illusion created by others?",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Incredibly dull, strained script, difficult acting, many pointless scenes.","This film plods along and has nothing other than a mundane message to offer: people try and sometimes lose. The main character is fundamentally uninteresting and has nothing to say and presents no unique perspective on anything. He is presented as being painfully irritable, and the effect is painfully irritating. The story goes nowhere; it stays exactly the same from the first to last frame. The best part of the movie -- the only bright spot -- is Carey Mulligan, who is excellent in her role. She is the lone interesting character with any viewpoint or personality to express, and the only saving grace for this drawn out mess. Mulligan gives a complicated, energetic and trenchant performance and deserves major credit for making this marginally watchable. The Coen brothers, however, are taking a nap on this one. The worst parts are the pointless, stilted and unconvincing musical performances (five or six full songs?) by the main character. This was done to fill (waste) time? This movie needed a full re-conceptualization and a major re-write before filming began. The actors do their best with a meandering, shallow script. Washed out, almost mono- or duo-chrome visuals, watered down storytelling, and diluted speaking parts; this is a wash out on many levels. Some good performances, some good cinematography and interesting shots, but in total a waste of time. No offense intended, but I imagine only very bored or very pretentious and easily impressionable viewers would find this valuable or interesting in any way.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Never has an elegy been so full of life, incident and gentle, comic tragedy.","In a movie industry that encourages simplicity and accessibility, the Coen brothers and their almost uniformly excellent, resolutely quirky films have always set themselves apart. Where most other directors and writers would celebrate the triumph of the human spirit, Joel and Ethan Coen craft movies that practically take delight in the futility of human endeavour. Life and its attendant twists and turns, their oddly-named characters discover, just happen to you, however you might try to dictate your own terms. Even their fizziest of comedies have a darker soul buried beneath the laughs.In much the same vein, Inside Llewyn Davis defies easy categorisation. It's ostensibly about the titular Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a struggling folk singer who couch-surfs across New York to avoid sleeping on the streets. For the week in his life that the camera stays with him, Llewyn is hunting for the cat that slipped out of his grasp when he was staying with the wealthy, Jewish Gorfeins (Ethan Phillips and Robin Bartlett). Along the way, he tries to ply his trade, hunting down a job opportunity in Chicago that might free him from his stints at the tiny, smoky Gaslight Café tucked inside New York's bustling Greenwich Village.Tucked away within the meandering narrative, however, is a soulful meditation on the fickle nature of fate, fame and fortune. Frequently, movies and well-meaning mentors tell us that we are the architects of our own success: if we want something badly enough, if we're talented and work hard, the universe will provide us with a happy ending.The tragic folk ballad that is Llewyn Davis, the hapless anti-hero of his own life story, tells us something quite different. Here is someone enormously gifted - this would be a different film entirely if Llewyn only thought he was a good singer - who has never managed to grab onto the spotlight when it flickers over him. He shares it, briefly, with singers who will go on to do far greater things than him. (Watch out for the iconic tousled mane and harmonica of the man who will soon change the face of folk - and popular - music forever.) Money, fame and joy seem to elude Llewyn at every turn, despite (and sometimes due to) his best efforts to get by.Inside Llewyn Davis also works as both road trip and character study. As we travel with Llewyn from Manhattan's classy Upper West Side to the narrow, boxed-in apartment of his best friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), we get a peek into Llewyn's tenuous relationships, even the best of which are wrung dry of favours and predicated on lies. In an almost callous way, he fights with Jean (Carey Mulligan), Jim's girlfriend, over an indiscretion, and in the next breath, lunges desperately after a cat that bears a passing resemblance to the one he lost.Llewyn's determination to do whatever it takes to get noticed - to get a job - also underscores the surreal road trip he endures to Chicago. This is perhaps the most characteristically Coenesque stretch of the entire film, the black humour played with a twist of sarcasm and irony as Llewyn is trapped in the car with his fellow passengers. He must suffer the derision of pushy jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) and the casual disinterest of beat poet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund), until circumstances - odd as they inevitably are in a Coen film - separate them all again.The performances in the film are, in a word, sublime. A struggling actor for many years, Isaac must have seen the parallels between Llewyn's story and his own. This is his moment in the limelight, however, and he knows it. Isaac plays the highs and lows of the Coen brothers' melancholic script with marvellous self-assurance, and is hauntingly note-perfect in the songs and stories he spins for unappreciative audience members. Mulligan, Timberlake and Goodman all deliver memorable supporting turns, the first two even contributing a beautifully-harmonised rendition of Five Hundred Miles (with Stark Sands) to the soundtrack.Anyone looking for the same oddball dynamics and sensibilities that the Coen brothers have honed to a fine precision in films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men should take heed: Inside Llewyn Davis is made of gentler, subtler stuff. It's a snow-washed blend of amusing drama and bitter comedy, played at half the tempo of the Coens' more frenetic output. As such, it might appear languid, and even a bit lifeless on a first viewing. But it's that rare kind of film which lodges itself firmly in the heart - or perhaps the soul - as it makes the most melancholic, magical music for a man who's slipped between the cracks.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Llewyn is a real human being,"Folk music has been around ever since there have been folks, but the folk revival of the 1960s was due in large part to the increased topicality of the songs and their relevance to the changing times. Though singers such as Joan Baez and Ian & Sylvia among others continued to sing traditional ballads, singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, and Phil Ochs brought new life to the folk scene with their songs of sharp social and political comment. Little of the new vibe, however, creeps into the Coen Brothers Inside Llewyn Davis, the story of sad-eyed troubadour, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a talented folk singer who remains stuck, singing in conventional mode while singers of perhaps lesser talent move forward.Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, the film is loosely based on the memoir of Dave von Ronk, a successful sixties singer/songwriter and left-wing political activist who was known for his personal generosity and loyalty, qualities that are not reflected in the film's main protagonist. The dour Davis is understandably downcast after the devastating suicide of his friend and member of his folk group Timlin and Davis and the strain and weariness shows clearly on his face. He releases a solo album but it does not bring success and a scene in the office of his agent (Jerry Grayson) tells us all we need to know about his financial and emotional state. Without any stability in his life, he is forced to rely on friends and whatever family he has to put him up for a few days at a time.His frustration is such, however, that he alienates those who try to help him including his sister Joy (Jeanine Serralles) whom he puts down for her conventional lifestyle. He is also at odds with his friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), and his wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) who thinks she is pregnant with his child and wants him to pay for an abortion. Her foul-mouthed disdain (uncharacteristic of women in the sixties, by the way) for Llewyn is both a sad and a comic high point of the film. Davis also stays with Columbia professor, Mitch Gorfein (Ethan Phillips), and his wife Lillian (Robin Bartlett), parents of his deceased partner.A sequence in which the Gorfein's cat escapes from the apartment during his stay prompts a chaotic chase scene with the elusive animal and results in the singer having to carry the cat around with him for most of the film, a symbol of whatever you want to make of it. A trip to Chicago to visit record producer and owner of Chicago's Gate of Horn club, Albert Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) introduces us to a few more colorful characters such as Roland Turner (John Goodman), a heroin-addicted jazz musician with severe disabilities and a sharp tongue (who Davis cruelly leaves alone in an abandoned car on the highway), and the chain-smoking taciturn actor Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund).The scene depicting Davis' solo audition with Grossman is mesmerizing in its stillness and sense of anticipation. Here Davis performs the English ballad The Death of Queen Jane while Grossman sits next to him, his gaze focused intently on the singer. Though the song is beautifully rendered, it seems inappropriate to what Llewyn is trying to accomplish, prompting Grossman to say, ""I don't see a lot of money here."" The music in the film, however, arranged by T-Bone Burnett, is its centerpiece and is deeply moving, especially songs such as Hang Me, Hang Me, The Last Thing on My Mind, beautifully sung by Stark Sands as Troy Nelson, a young Army officer, Bob Dylan's Farewell, 500 Miles, Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song), and the Ewan MacColl song The Shoals of Herring, sung by Davis to his sick father.Even though the Coen Brothers' message - that it's difficult for any new artist of average talent to be successful in a highly competitive arena, especially when their actions are toxic and self defeating, is not a startling piece of information, Llewyn is a real human being who has so much soul that, while we may not like him, he strikes a responsive chord in anyone who has ever been on the outside looking in. Basically, what is inside Llewyn Davis is what is inside all of us, the longing to be accepted, to connect with and contribute to others, a longing that, though it is often misdirected and filled with pain, is universal and allows the film to transcend the singer's limited perspective. While Davis insists that singing is just something he does, we get the sense that, underneath his ""poor me"" act, he clearly knows that his singing indeed is ""a joyous expression of the soul,"" and is now ready to tap into it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
'Beautiful' is the Only Word I Can Think of to Describe Inside Llewyn Davis,"I went into this movie unsure of what I'd think, considering I don't typically listen to folk music and considering the mixed reviews it received. I'm happy to say that it was absolutely amazing.Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't have a particularly deep plot. It's about a folk singer trying to become famous. It's a pretty average music movie plot, which isn't a bad thing, especially in this case. The plot is very well carried out and realistic nonetheless. The choices Llewyn Davis makes feel more human than other movies I've seen, despite how hard they were to watch at times.The characters are the driving force of this movie. Llewyn Davis is very well developed, and his character feels real and full of depth. Not everything that he says or references from his life will have major significance in his life later on, which really adds to it. The other characters are all amazing too, although I wish we could have spent more time with some of them. But just like real life, people come and go. There's not a lot we can do about that.The music aspect of the movie was, although the overall plot, not as big as I thought it would be. Llewyn plays and watches other performances occasionally, but he doesn't do either very often. It's part of his character, but I kind of liked how there wasn't an excessive amount of music, despite the fact that I loved every song sung in the movie.Overall Inside Llewyn Davis is amazing. With a well-done plot, fantastic characters, and great music, it's well worth anyone's time. If you didn't like it, then I really can't see why, but that's just your opinion. If you haven't seen it, then go do it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you like music or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A captivating film. I count myself lucky to have seen it.,"This is an early review. I scored tickets to an early showing at the AMC in San Diego.The film puts you in the life of New York musician Llewlyn Davis in the early 1960s. Although you might get the feeling that the protagonist is a version of Bob Dylan, I was reminded more of a Kurt Cobain kind of vibe. The film is full of harsh times, brooding and despair, most of it is brought on by the handy work of Llewlyn himself.The film is beautifully shot and masterfully acted. I've been saying it for years but this film will prove that Oscar Issac is a legitimate actor, an artist truly.While I would love to get into a spoiler filled tirade I'll simply say that this film is a must see. It's fantastic.J",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Time stood still,"I would like to share an experience I had while watching this film. When Llewyn goes to Chicago to audition for Bud Grossman he sings a song I'd not heard before. In that stark setting, playing to just one person he breaks our hearts. And as the song was sung in our big theatre, time stood still. It is an experience I will cherish as a moment of brilliant cinema. I can always see the film and that scene again but it won't be like the first time on a cold winter night in a dark room full of silent strangers. I've been a fan since Blood Simple but have really enjoyed their masterpieces Fargo and Barton Fink. When you are in the room watching a Coen brother's film you are transported to an alternate reality. It is a place of mystery with a touch of foreboding deliciously written for just us the audience. We are the fortunate ones.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A meditative comedy,"Writer/director/brother duo Joel and Ethan Coen have always been really hit and miss for me (I loved ""No Country for Old Men"" and hated ""The Ladykillers"", ""Raising Arizona"" and truly believe ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of the most overrated films of all time) but ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", with all of its dry and metaphysical humor, is a homerun.Nearly void of plot, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is sort of a ""day (more like a week) in the life of"" story of a relatively homeless folk singer named Llewyn (Oscar Isaac). We follow him as he loses the neighbor's cat (which becomes a living, breathing motif throughout) asks for money, deals with the fact that he may have gotten a woman who hates him (played by Carey Mulligan) pregnant, does session work, rides around in a car with two characters (John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund) whom resemble Pozzo and Lucky from ""Waiting For Godot"", and toys with quitting the folk scene for a regular 9 to 5. Now clearly, while this doesn't sound like much in the way of entertainment, that Coen magic somehow makes this little movie one of the best of the year.Finally, Oscar Isaac will get the recognition that he deserves! Yes, as you would probably imagine, the music in this film is great (the soundtrack is worth buying) thoroughly capturing the folk scene in Greenwich Village in 1961. But it is the performances from Isaac, which demands an Oscar nomination and Mulligan, who spends the entire supporting role with a consistent sour puss expression on her face only rivaled by Cate Blanchett's Jasmine, and the intelligent, true-to-life, self deprecating sense of humor which stems from the Coen's immensely clever and incredibly deep conversationally driven script, which deals with issues of relationships, questioning when is it OK to give up on ones dream and a smattering of enlightened ramblings from simple looking characters, as only the Coen's can depict.Final Thought: At the end of the day, it's hard to pin down a clear cut reason as to why I thought ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was so brilliant or why it resonated so much with me. So, I'm going to stop trying.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's the journey, not the destination","It's about the journey, not the destination. Hard to explain why this movie works, other than that. It appears to be a rambling, pointless film. However, the rambling, almost-cyclical, quite depressing in a way, story has many charms.It is the story of an almost-famous everyman, his trials and tribulations, the almost irrecoverable rut he is in. Fill those adventures with the Coen brothers usual mixture of quirky characters, humour, symbolism, red herrings and character depth, and you have a very engaging story.Great performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Good supporting cast too. Probably the most surprising performance is by Justin Timberlake. Yes, we already knew he could act, but here he is hardly recognisable as an early-60s folk singer. Solid performance.On the subject of musicians, the music is one of the highlights of the movie. Some great tracks, some written just for the movie. Helps if you like early-Bob Dylan/Steeleye Span/Fairport Convention- style folk (and I do), but it is very well done.Subtler than your average Coen brothers movie, but well worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"An Excellent,Unforgettable And Funny Comedy-Drama From The Coen Brothers","Inside Llewyn Davis is an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that combines wonderful direction,a great cast,a fantastic script and a terrific soundtrack and with all of those element Inside Llewyn Davis is not only a great film but also The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in the New York section of Greenwich Village in 1961,Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of Llewyn Davis(Oscar Isaac),a Folk singer who is trying be a successful music artist while dealing with his own personal life taking him on an interesting journey of discovery about himself.Inside Llewyn Davis is another amazing film from one of my favorite directors master filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen AKA The Coen Brothers. The Coens have been on a roll delivering great film after great film the first film being their excellent Oscar winning Masterpiece No Country For Old Men(2007),their wonderful and very underrated Black Comedies Burn After Reading(2008)and A Serious Man(2009),the terrific Western remake True Grit(2010)and now Inside Llewyn Davis,an outstanding Comedy-Drama that is funny,intimate and The Coen Brothers delivering another incredible film to their body of work. Right from the beginning Inside Llewyn Davis is a sensational film that gives us a brilliant and at times quirky character study set in and around the Folk music scene in Greenwich Village New York with a movie that is simple but is still very engrossing and unforgettable because when you watch the film you are on the journey along with the main character. The Comedy and Humor in Inside Llewyn Davis is funny and weird and done in the style that is very much like the Coen Brothers using the characters and interactions with each to drive the Humor which is subtle and interesting. Although the movie is funny the Comedy has much more in common with A Serious Man then say Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski. Another thing that I love about The Coen Brothers films and this movie as well is the amazing photography and attention to detail. The photography by Bruno Delbonnel is beautiful and visually stunning making the cold snow and winter look very bleak and isolating and at times surreal with harsh lighting that is dark and light. Also,The Coen Brothers' attention to detail and production design by Jess Goncher give the film a realistic look and truly takes you back to the year of 1961 whether it's in a bar,on the road or in a music studio you will feel like you are in the Folk music scene of 1961. The music scenes in ILD are exceptional and gives the film not only a great energy and tone but an accurate depiction of what the Folk music scene was like in the early 1960s and the performances by the actors feel true(it helps that actor Oscar Issac is a guitar player and singer in real life). You can now add Llewyn Davis to the gallery of great and memorable characters from The Coen Brothers films because like most of the other Coen Brothers characters Lleywn is a character looking to find himself in his surroundings and trying to figure out where to go whether it's dealing with trying to be a successful Folk musician or his personal life that at times can be funny and dramatic. And while Llewyn isn't always the most likable character has a depth that makes us relate to him because we are along with Llewyn on the journey he goes on. Llewyn Davis is a great Coen Brothers character that anchors the film and is a character you will never forget. The screenplay by The Coens is wonderful and memorable filled with great dialog mixing Comedy and Drama the only way The Coens can do. The ending of Inside Llewyn Davis is truly amazing because it makes ask questions about what happened throughout the film while leaving you with laughs,wonder and mystery. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Oscar Isaac is excellent and memorable as Llewyn Davis,with Isaac bringing emotion and depth to the role. Carey Mulligan is terrific as Jean,Llewyn's ex-girlfriend. Justim Timberlake does a fine job in his small role as Jim,Jean's boyfriend. Coen Brothers regular John Goodman is wonderful as Roland Turner,a Jazz Musician. Garrett Hedlund is great as Johnny Five,a beat poet. F. Murray Abraham is great as Bud Grossman,a guy in the music business. Ethan Phillips(Mitch Gorfein),Robin Bartlett(Lillian Gorfein),Stark Sands(Troy Nelson),Adam Driver(Al Cody)and Max Casella(Pappi)give good performances as well.The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and stylish,with The Coen Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Wonderful direction by The Coens.The soundtrack in Inside Llewyn Davis is fantastic with mostly Folk songs by Oscar Isaac and more. An outstanding soundtrack.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers or Folk Music,I highly suggest you see Inside Llewyn Davis,an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that is The Coen Brothers at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Leaving the theater silent with a touch of melancholy.,"I was on my way home on an icy day in NYC, after going to art galleries in Chelsea, and decided to pop into a theater and see Joel and Ethan Coen's INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS. The wintery weather befitted the mood of this slow, strange, original movie which left me with a lingering unexplainable feeling of pensive melancholy. I exited the cinema confused and stunned thinking of beginnings, endings, and repeated beginnings, a cycle which spins round and round – "" the times they are a-changin."" Afterwards, I took the bus home to my Greenwich Village apartment - deep in thought - the very locale where in 1961 an aspiring folk-singer named Llewyn Davis attempted to maintain his creative integrity in the face of commercial and personal ambush, often self-inflicted; youth is the period for reckless and self-righteous inquiry as well as outbursts of peevish anger and defiance.INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a road trip with an expressive dark-eyed, bearded Oscar Issac playing the lead character – a young man stumbling along the path he has chosen for himself; a young man determinedly serious about being a folk singer who wants to be taken seriously; a young man who is careless and yet caring, a young man who is finding out about himself and his effect on others with haunting revelations from his past and present shaping future actions. Llewyn's songs sung in a mellow, resonant voice (arranged by executive music producer T-Bone Burnett} are an audible measure of the depth of the complexity ""inside"" Llewyn Davis - more so than any of the dialogue he laconically utters.Communication with family and friends are almost farcical if they were not so ruefully inadequate. The Coen brothers skirt the line of caricature and burlesque when depicting these incidents, lightening the acutely dispiriting ambiance. There are many weirdly compelling bit parts by actors that contribute to the surrealistic mood of the film. One example being John Goodman who is grotesquely sinister, playing a fellow traveler in the claustrophobic atmosphere of an automobile, spraying a frenzy of wildly bizarre dialogue during those staccato moments when he is not ""nodding off"" from whatever actions he is performing every time he staggers off to the bathroom.INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS flows at a pace all its own. A cat by the name of Ulysses flits in and out of various scenes, referencing Homer's epic poem The Odyssey, alluding to the ""trials"" that our hero must go through to return a changed man to himself. This is also a movie about being an artist, hanging on to one's own vision in the face of the marketable embrace of mediocrity. The sadness I felt when INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS ended was the bitter shroud of familiarity.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Looks like mud, sounds awful","There were lots of things they did well - the recreation of 1961 New York is great, but...1. I'm tired of muddy looking movies. I don't care if they are supposed to be depressing movies, they don't have to be relentlessly dark and colorless/mono-tinted and low contrast visually. (See ""Die Wand"" for an example of what I mean.) I'd like to say let's not go back to the 70s shitty looking movies, but we've been there awhile now. Oh, how mooooooody.... (Yeah I get it -- dark screen, dark mood -- how clever.)2. The music in this movie does NOTHING to capture the vitality of the music of the real 1960s Village folk scene. Its mostly slow and dull and boring, even if the lead does have a nice voice.3. It could use a real story.Other than that, it might have been OK.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A Song for the Asking,"This film is highly recommended.Written, directed, and edited by the Brothers Coen, Inside Llewyn Davis is an oddball comedy about a self-centered but talented folk singer in the 1960's Greenwich Village. The film lingers over the absurdities of life as its abrasive and unlikable anti-hero tries to find any trace of success in the dark smoke-filled nightclubs that made the New York Village scene such a viable place back then. The film contains many quiet and poetic moments, filled with insightful observations about its characters and that more innocent era.Rumor has it that an artist must suffer for his art. Inside Llewyn Davis embellishes that myth as we moviegoers spend one fateful week with this struggling songwriter and his chance encounters with various people in the music biz. It is Llewyn's winter of discontent. He's out of money and out of patience. Fame continues to elude him but not life's hardships. His musical partner has committed suicide. Llewyn's first solo album is doing poorly in sales and he just may have impregnated his best friend's wife. Llewyn would rather commit to a short song on center stage than care for anybody or anything. Dealing with life's harsh realities are too taxing, even as he is forced to become an unofficial guardian of sorts for a friend's cat, Ulysses. Soon both man and cat are off on their individual odyssey for the meaning of life, but only one will find it.In their nuanced film, Joel and Ethan Coen have added another assortment of quirky characters to their on-going array of bizarre behavior, although this time the central character is more disagreeable than needed. Oscar Isaac plays Llewyn and he gives a solid performance, capturing the talent and the bad luck that befalls his character with a sneer and a sad bitter-more-than-sweet song for the asking. With a terrific film score assembled by T. Bone Burnett and showcasing many of the folk tunes from that era (500 Miles, Fare Thee Well, The Last Thing on My Mind), the film is high on atmosphere and strong on character development. Plot-wise, there's not much to tell, except that the film shows a series of missed opportunities and misadventures for Llewyn, most of which are lessons not learned. Inside Llewyn Davis is more character study and a nostalgic reminder of another time long gone than the traditional action-driven entertainment one would suspect from these filmmakers.Contributing to the film's richness are fine supporting performances by Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as Jean and Jim, a more popular husband and wife folk duo, Stark Sands as Troy, an up-and coming idealistic song-smith, and a drug-addled John Goodman as Roland Turner, a jazz musician. ￼ This is one of the year's best crafted film. The period details are brilliantly evoked by the moody photography of Bruno Delbonnel, the purposely dated costumes of Mary Zophres, and the essential spot-on production design by Jess Gonchor. There is an genuine authenticity to the film due to their stellar contributions which convincingly portray the American folk scene of 1961.The title character of Inside Llewyn Davis is purposely remote and distant. It's hard getting inside this tortured soul, as he never connects with anyone. Joel and Ethan Coen have created a deeply captivating film that keeps the moviegoer on the outside looking in, observing the characters and appreciating their conversations. We become voyeurs lost in the milieu of the sixties folk scene, always questioning Llewyn's state of mind, well aware that the times are a- changin' around him. Inside Llewyn Davis is wonderful escapist fare and one of the best films of the year.

"Even though more subdued and artistic, 'Llewyn Davis' is another great Coen film","Nothing the Coen Brothers ever do is really a change of pace, but ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is about as close to one as you're likely to get from the filmmaking duo that has rolled out nothing but critically acclaimed hits since 2008 Best Picture winner ""No Country for Old Men."" Even with a three-year break between directorial projects for the first time in almost 20 years, they strike again with ""Llewyn Davis,"" perhaps their most understated and emotional effort to date.""Davis"" is a melancholy story that finds occasional moments of classic Coen Brothers humor (that killer combination of wit, frankness, exaggeration and irony) and stirs the soul with an influx of folk music. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a couch-surfing folk singer of unquestionable talent struggling to make money in New York's Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. Plagued by a number of mistakes in his work and personal life and followed by the shadow of his stint as one half of a folk duo, Llewyn impatiently pursues his big break despite the lousy circumstances.Isaac get his much-deserved big break as Davis, a role that could really only be played by someone yet to become a full-fledge movie star. In fact, the Coen Brothers veer away from casting their usual suspects entirely (except for John Goodman in a small role), which gives ""Davis"" both a different feel for the Coens in general and helps to get across the sense of anonymity in the folk scene. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake play supporting roles as Jean and Jim, some lovable local favorites performing in the scene, but they're a small part of the film overall.This is Llewyn's story entirely, a disheartening portrayal of the American dream, and without an ounce of sugarcoating. Plus, Llewyn is far from the brave and naive optimist who's hopelessly in love with his craft. He sees it very much as his passion, but it is his career, his work – a means to a paycheck. He's not the smartest or the most likable character, so it's actually the scenes in which he performs so beautifully that will move the audience to root for his success. We can observe his talent, but objectively, we can also see the very qualities in his personality and even his music that account for his struggle.Although ""Davis"" has a number of striking scenes, some of which are difficult to watch, there's not much shock factor in this particular Coen Brothers film. The plot is non-traditional in the sense that there's no main conflict with scenes that move toward a resolution, rather everything that happens is meant to give us a window into the unforgiving nature of the life Llewyn has chosen for himself. His desperation road trip to Chicago to try and land a gig for a man with a prominent club sums a lot of this up. He bums a ride with Goodman's character Roland Turner, a jazz musician who tests Llewyn's wits to no end, and his ""chauffeur,"" Johnny Five, (Garrett Hedlund), a poet of few verbal words. The trip takes a strange turn with less than desirable results.In most Coen films, each character or event, no matter how small, has something to say to the greater overall theme and ideas of the film. ""Davis"" is no exception, though it does so in much more subtle ways. One of the more prominent metaphors involves an orange cat that falls into Llewyn's care. Although the symbolism is obvious, the meaning remains open to interpretation in a way the Coens do so well.Music is of course integral to this film in a way it has not been for the Coens since ""O' Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Music immediately sets the tone in addition to creating a nostalgic, poignant feeling throughout the film. The script explores the many uses of folk music as well. There are soul-bearing, intimate ballads like those sung by Llewyn to the political hijacking of folk music such as the scene in which Llewyn and Jim record ""Please, Mr. Kennedy,"" to the way folk music has evolved from songs from the ""old country."" ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a film that all artists will appreciate, and quite possibly anyone who has dedicated themselves to something only to end up disappointed time and time again. The Coens approach this subject with brute honesty but also a certain poetic sensitivity. Especially when held up to their many irreverent comedies, ""Llewyn Davis"" will long be used as evidence supporting the Coens' knack for artistic, nuanced filmmaking.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"Please, Mr. Kennedy","Right around the same time I started wearing Chuck Taylor's and aviators, I was having a nightly sexual tryst with my boss. While she claimed to love me, I fear her passion was unrequited, I only did it because I maintained the circular logic that the more I had sex with my boss the cooler I would become; but, she was from Wisconsin and made love like it. I remember one night, we just finished up and she had this knack for tying back her hair in bed to the point where it looked like she was giving herself a face-lift. She put on Snow Patrol and began bobbing her head like it was on a spring, slowly reminding me that we are all in a circuitous free fall around the drain's end... I said to her, ""this isn't music."" That's pretty much ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" in a nutshell.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Watch and Learn,"The thing I liked best about Inside Llewyn Davis is that unlike most movies today, it doesn't put long expositive speeches in the mouths of its characters to explain exactly what's happened in the past, what's happening now, and what's going to happen in the next scene. We get inside Llewyn simply by watching him make his way in the world.Many reviewers have remarked that Llewyn is his own worst enemy, or that he's an unpleasant character, but if you watch the movie carefully, you'll get an idea of why he is that way, and perhaps even feel a bit of sympathy. The Coens don't come out and tell you about Llewyn's family background, instead showing brief vignettes that allow you to come to your own conclusions about the family dynamic. And if you pay careful attention to what happens before each of Llewyn's outbursts, you'll see that he lashes out because he is hurting. He's yearning for the music to be something that lifts him above the tawdriness and disappointments of everyday life, but trying to make a living at it keeps dragging him down in the mud.In short,like all art, Inside Llewyn Davis requires you to put some effort into the collaboration, and to think about what you are seeing and what it means. If you are so used to a movie experience in which you are spoon-fed explanations, you may just let the pictures pass by and conclude that there isn't much there. But if you take the trouble to think about why, for example, Llewyn's last version of ""Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)"" is so different that the preceding ones, you may start to get inside Llewyn Davis.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Sad Reality of Show Business,"Wow. Honestly, I'm still touched by this pure work of cinema. It's quite a pessimistic and depressing- albeit very honest- depiction of the lives led by the people who aspire to be something greater than an average employee for a corporation. In this case, we have an impeccably talented folk musician named Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) who's not exactly in the best of circumstances, considering his impoverished state and exhausted soul. Folk music has never been an overly popular genre, and his struggles prove the unfairness within dreamers' lives. Right from the get-go, we understand that Davis has been doing this for a while now. Unfortunately, he's not making a living off of participating in that which he absolutely loves and is spending every night at another friend's or relative's residence. His willingness to endure the hardships that plague his unlucky life (rather than fall back on something that's more financially sound) is undoubtedly appreciable.The sad truth certainly should touch anyone who's looking to involve themselves in the entertainment industry, specifically, for quality (as can be seen here) is oftentimes disregarded as the majority of the public are drawn to simpler and more crowd-pleasing material. For instance, as I observed my surroundings in the theater room, I realized that not many people sat in the audience. That right there, folks, is the sad reality of the entertainment business, proving the lack of recognition of sheer quality in general as we're frequently distracted by the more extravagant productions that lead you from one intense situation to another. As I was originally stating, the pop and hip-hop music reign supreme while the intelligence found in tamer and more lyrics-based tunes is inequitably overshadowed. And rather than eventually permeate this clever picture with heartwarming events and Hollywood-izing the ending, the Coen Brothers remain ruthless in their brutally honest and genuine portrayal of a struggling individual who I largely sympathized with.Davis's road ahead and behind is wretched, and you're forced to see him run into an adverse incident after another as if someone completely cursed him once in some unimaginable way. His behavior initially might bother some viewers, but as you witness the cruel and unforgiving individuals around him and the harsh environment- I, at least, definitely understood his persistently hostile attitude and mindset. He's not the ""asskisser"" who finds success in the industry by forming connections here and there and sleeping around elsewhere; he limply carries along with his integrity and dignity in tact. The filmmakers wisely never compromise in order to implement some superficial element to his character so as to present a more likable side.Anyways, being that this is primarily a character-driven narrative, Oscar Isaac's performance is surely crucial to how the final product turns out. Fortunately, he's unquestionably phenomenal- I've got to love and appreciate the subtle performances as opposed to the showy and ""Oscar-baity"" paths that lots of actors seem to take in these kinds of films. No, Isaac is so capable in his role that you can't help but admire this miserable character as he proceeds along on his inauspicious journey. I found everything from his low-key mannerisms to the overall hesitant and reserved personality (especially when in the company of loud-mouthed or more enthusiastic people) incredible and utterly convincing.Of course, I have to vastly rave about the film's amazingly beautiful and unique cinematography. To me, it seemed pastel-like, for lack of a better term, in a sense and borrowed a grayish, or predominately colorless, visual style. Throughout its duration, we're introduced to particularly darkened rooms, pervaded by rising smoke and an attentive crowd in a respectfully silent atmosphere- occasionally, we sight the light illuminating one side of the room while the other side remains desolate and gloomy. In essence, the Coen Brothers always know how to showcase the most stunning of camera-work, and speaking of traditional Coen Bros. strengths, the writing also keeps us highly invested throughout the numerous enthralling encounters and dispiriting conversations Davis runs into on his mentally gruesome adventure.All in all, Inside Llewyn Davis is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of 2013 (it expanded nationwide in early 2014, which is why I'm writing the review this late). Notice how I haven't even covered any weaknesses of the film. Guess why? Because there are none, and usually, Hollywood pictures disappoint me with their endings in that unnaturally happy or unnecessary fashion. Like I said, this film, however, refrains from sacrificing its artistic integrity as the melancholy tone never subsides. If you love the art of cinema and treasure the passionate filmmakers that still allow for clever projects like this to be made, go see Inside Llewyn Davis!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Isaac is phenomenal as the titular character trying to find a balance between art, business, life and relationship in this instant Coen classic.","The Coens are arguably the greatest American filmmakers going today, and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is no exception to this theory. However, we can't judge ILD like their other films, or like many other films period. Instead, it begs to be critiqued like a great folk song: simple yet elegant, layered and lyrical, stark yet brightly colorful, familiar yet utterly new, funny but ultimately somber. This is musical cinema at its most pure, placing us firmly within the main characters shoes, forcing us to ask, ""Who are these people on stages that we idolize?"" ILD follows folk-singer Llewyn as he struggles to find a balance between life, relationship, business, and art. But unlike many struggling artist films, we aren't made to simply feel the plight of this guy's fight for notoriety and mourn his ambiguity. Instead Llewyn, phenomenally played by Isaacs, is an extremely abrasive albeit immensely talented character. His life is an endless cycle of minor highs and crushing lows. So despite the many colorful and self-centered characters we meet, played by a whose-who of ""Hey! It's that guy!""'s, Llewyn has only himself to blame. The original soundtrack, written by T-Bone Burnett and performed by the actors, is the best I have heard since ""Once"". They have nailed what it feels like to be a musician. The songs alone are enough of a reason to recommend, if it weren't also for the hilarious script, strong performances and stronger themes. ILD will stay stuck in your head like a catchy, beautiful song long after you leave the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A pleasant surprise,"As a Coen Brothers fan, I've always felt that, at least for me, they are pretty much hit or miss. While I loved NCFOM, I hated The Big Lebowski and didn't get the hype surrounding Fargo. With Inside Llewyn Davis I think that they created one of their best crafted movies, one I would go so far as to call a subtle masterpiece. It's all there: the amazing acting by Oscar Isaac, who carries the movie with a complete understanding of his character, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the direction... In an age when movies tend to be more and more about action and fast paced dialog, a movie like this feels like a breath of fresh air. Its deliberate slow pace only adds to the incredible atmosphere of the world the Coens build around their protagonist, allowing us to feel his struggle and his loneliness. It's much more about what we feel than what we see. Kind of just like in life.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Llewyn Davis's Week In A Well-Carved Nutshell. ♦ 85%,"I haven't been that impressed by the director duo with their takes on crime, except No Country For Old Men; that was epic. But this time around they give out such an enterprising story, I sat there relating it to myself.As the story moves forward, we are given a perspective through the protagonist. Oscar Isaac has marvelously played the character and it is only because of him that we both feel sad & funny about his plight and his toil and his homelessness. His actions are so true to the level it never goes haywire because reality shines everywhere in the script: from the cat called Ulysses to his ex-girlfriend to his famous father. All elements are so finely tuned, I am in love with this film so much.Next is the music; I might cry if it doesn't win an Oscar for the sound mixing. Such wonderful folk songs... they are in my local play-list now. Beautiful lyrics, production by T-bone and Isaac himself with the diction. And the songs are played in full, which doubles the enhancement.The plot is maneuvered nicely etching a powerful screenplay, keeping us away from boredom. And humor at the right time when it is least expected was another fantastic thing about it. Inside Llewyn Davis is told in less than 2 hours and it captures the whole terrible week of the singer in a fabulous fashion; it talks about people, relationships, road to fame and most importantly, struggle. It throws light into how passion can sometimes fail to earn us a bread. But, this has more to it. Go ahead!BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended! This is the right film to catch with your sweetheart on a cold winter night. The songs will get you. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Sometimes change is Good,"This is now the best movie made. The Coens have always come out with great movies but not in such a time of revelations. This is just before the Beatles came in and the the British invasion of music happened. I remember because a little while after in a new magazine called National Lampoon there was a take off on it called ""The Adventures of Zimmerman"" and Bob Dylan saves America from the British invasion of Stones and Kinks and other British rock and roll, in the form of a comic book. Dylan is heard right at the end of the movie when Llewyn Davis gets punched out. The movie is taken from the life of Dave Von Ronk,in the book ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"". I read the book and he's not as hard edged as his depiction in the movie. I'm glad he he was friends with Dylan. The actual pop music at the time sucked then, just like it does today. But it was about to change. And so Dave Von Ronk got to experience the folk revival and be friends with one of the creative geniuses of that time. That's not too shabby. These are and have been scary times because of phony and obviously bad politicians. Maybe a real democrat will finally get in the White house and some great music will come back. But probably we'll just get fooled again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Down and Out in Greenwich Village,"I consider myself a Coen Bros. fan. I have a high tolerance for the unusual and I expect the quirky when the Coen Bros. put their magic together. This film starts out slowly and eventually drifts to an ignoble ending. The main character is dull and over the course of approximately two hours he gets duller. If you are hoping to see a Coen Bros. film that excites and entertains, unfortunately this will surely disappoint. The settings of the 1960's in Greenwich Village New York are ""spot on"". The music ( if you are into folk music) is mildly entertaining and the acting is entirely satisfactory. Its just the story line and the theme that is duller than dry dust in an old cardboard box. I can say that the movie had a very nice cat. Throughout the movie I cared more about the welfare of the cat than I did for the title character.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

From the coen brothers movies that I've seen so far this isn't the type of movie that I was expecting from them but it was certainly a welcome surprise. It was incredibly well shot especially in what felt like such an uninspiring setting.Easily Oscar Isaac carried this movie on his back, Llewyn Davis felt like such an awful character in the sense that you can't help but dislike him, and while I certainly dislike him, due to Oscar isaac's phenomenal portrayal i really couldn't help but root for him. And honestly who knew Oscar Isaac had such a great voice. 8.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A fantastic Drama peace,"Ethan Coen and Joel Coen has to be two masterclass director's and writers in movie media, and I said that back in my older reviews of these two.The story to Inside Llewyn Davis is about a trip through New York's folk music scene in the 1960s as a singer-songwriter does his best to make it through these times.Every time the Coen brothers release a new movie I always expect something great from them as they other films never let me down and always top my exception. With Inside Llewyn Davis it's a road trip film with little comedy this and there, and once again the Coen brothers showed off how talent they truly are, because this movie is freaking fantastic.I have to be honest here but I didn't know who Oscar Isaac was before watching this movie. I couple of times I heard someone brought up his name but that's it really, didn't know who he was so when I watched this movie my first thought when I saw his acting and singing was ""I want to see him in more films"", because this guy is just brilliant and I'm a bit disappointing of myself for not seeing his other films in the past. His character can come off a bit of a douche at times but he played the role so well and breath so much life into it that I actually liked him, all because of Oscar Isaac.The directing and the writing by the Coen brothers and do I need say more, I'm running out of things to say about this two masters of filmmakers. The movie is was written really well and once again I'm can't find anything else to say of what I ready said before in my other past reviews. The songs in this movie are probably some of the best music I've heard in a while and it was really catcher as well.I love the way this film looks, you know that bright, clean looking and gorgeous to look at cinematography that stands out. The cinematography in this movie is just utterly spectacular. every shot looks like it took forever to get the perfect shot and a lot of hard work went into this to get, but the people who did the cinematography in this movie pulled it off perfectly and no wonder they got a Oscar nomination for it.My only small little nick pick with the film is the John Goodman character (Roland Turner) Now don't get me wrong I like John Goodman has a actor and as a person , but I didn't feel like he fitted in the film, that might just be me but his character just kind of show up and then goes and never brought up again.Overall Inside Llewyn Davis is a fanatic drama peace with a lot of amazing things to experience in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Realistic View of The Life of a Musician!!,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a drama that is set in the 60s. It features Oscar Isaac in the leading role as a struggling folk singer. This movie by the Coen Brothers is markedly different from some of their previous ventures as it is much more serious with little humor.Despite having a relatively short runtime of just over 100 minutes, the film manages to show the journey of a musician who has to face rejection most of the time, sleep on other people's couch, and in general find it hard to make ends meet.Oscar Isaac is brilliant in the role and he shows great emotion while playing the guitar. Carey Mulligan plays the friend of Llewyn Davis who is furious at him for getting her pregnant. She does a decent job in her small role.The Coen Brothers don't give us a typical Hollywood movie in which everything works out in the end. Instead, we get to see how the hopes and dreams of Llewyn Davis are crushed and he has no choice but to quit playing music. The film is anticlimactic but the journey is worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Indescribably boring,"Nothing happens in this movie, therefore there's nothing to describe. It's just flat out boring. I restlessly sat through it all hoping something would happen; it is a Cohen film after all, of whom I am a fan. But, nothing came to fruition and I walked away disgruntled and felt cheated of my time. Luckily I didn't see this at the theaters because I'd have been angry to have paid for it and probably would have driven into a ditch on the way home out of pure anguish.Listen, save yourself the disappointment by popping in No Country for Old Men or Fargo instead and keep your sanity.

Coen Brothers do it again and again.,"I really enjoyed this film, it was carefully crafted into a precise and persistent story of a man who thought he was at rock bottom to only discover that it could only get worse. The writing of this film was probably the most impressive feats next to the acting by Oscar Isaac and the aesthetic created throughout the film. This film was also something that I have not seen in quite some time, in which the arc of the story was completely upside down. The rising action became the falling action, obstacles were distractions, and the climax was the low point for the character. It was fresh, new, and provoked thought. The one criticism I had was how the beginning and ending were portrayed. It was necessary to show the ending at the beginning, to give insight into Llewyn's character. Although the way it was shown made for a confusing and rushed ending which left the audience a few scenes back. This and a few scenes throughout could have been cut down a bit as the film began to feel dragged out. Overall, another fantastic film from the Coen Brothers.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Oscar Issac just breaks it with this acting, hes just amazing, it's like if he was born for doing this character.

I can't believe I waited so long to watch it,"Inside Llewyn Davis has become one of my favorite Coen Brother's movies.The story was very simple, which I felt was needed for this story, too much complicated things would have made it confusing. Some side stories ended abruptly, which I didn't like, but small enough to look over.The acting was good, Oscar Isaac was the stand out performance while the others were OK. There were some scenes where it was hard to understand Oscar Isaac or the other characters though.The camera work was great. There were so many nice shots that they captured my eyes immediately. I don't believe there was one scene that didn't look good in this movie. There was some noir feel to some scenes while others felt light hearted and bright.Inside Llewyn Davis is a very heart felt and personal movie. Personally, I don't see it reaching to the mainstream audience, but I do see it being a cult film that will be remembered for a long time.

Inside Llewyn Davis,"I have always appreciated the Cohen brothers even if I have not always enjoyed their films, I've often found them hard to sit through with the exception of 'The Big Lebowski' and 'No Country For Old Men'. When I first heard about Inside Llewyn Davis I was interested because I am a fan of the folk scene amongst other elements of the film as such as the time period and setting.I sat in the cinema upon the films release with optimism but I was cautiously optimistic as I thought I would react to it in the same way I react to most of the Cohen brothers' films, masterfully created but hard to watch.So what did I think of Inside Llewyn Davis? I loved it. Not only Is it my favourite film of 2013, but it is also now one of my all time favourite films. I saw it the day it came out, now, months later, I still cannot stop thinking about it. I've had the blu ray imported from the US because I can't wait for the May release here in the UK.My favourite elements of the film are; the soundtrack, put together masterfully by producer 'T Bone', The acting, brilliantly carried by Oscar Isaac in one of his biggest roles yet with amazing supporting parts from Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman, the story, which I felt was beautifully simple whilst managing to be deeply harsh and real as it follows a week in the life of a failing folk musician in the 60s and finally the cinematography. The Cohen brothers had to use a cinematographer this time around as their usual was otherwise occupied with the latest James Bond flick, this both shows and delivers as we are greeted with the cold, blue, vintage-like tones that add to the bleak tale.I honestly can't find any major flaws with the film, some criticisms that accompany the film are that it's extremely bland and uneventful with an underwhelming ending that ultimately goes nowhere, but I would disagree because the uneventful story is also a connotation for Llewyn Davis' life that appears to be inspired by folk singer 'Dave Von Ronk', I can't exactly explain the significance of the ending without ruining it and I feel like spoiling it even for those who don't mind having it spoilt will then loose something from the film that they need to discover for themselves to appreciate it. All I can say is that it is harsh yet grounded and actually quite sad. The film has a fairly short run time but I feel like it was the perfect length otherwise the story could have become repetitive or tedious. I think Inside Llewyn Davis was expertly constructed and it is the definition of art. I can't wait to revisit the film. I think it is an important film that all film buffs should watch. I can understand why some people may not get on with the film because they may find it too melancholy and tedious, but I feel it's a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An uninteresting story you endure but the pay-off never comes,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a story about an uninteresting folk singer in the 60s.During the long first act of the movie, he has an uninteresting time in New York so he decides to head out to Chicago.I thought things were going to pick-up at this point as John Goodman tags along for the ride and there are a couple of incidents which I thought would be developed but the journey turns out to be as uninteresting and his subsequent short stay in Chicago.This is a movie you endure because it is a Coen brothers movie so you keep thinking there will eventually be a pay-off especially as it has been rated so highly but there isn't one.The film ends as uninterestingly as it begins, literally. I would call this their most mediocre movie to date. The dialog isn't clever and there isn't even one decent tune.I actually read somewhere that the Coen brothers were worried that the movie was too uninteresting so they added a cat. It does not redeem the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Coen Brothers' ode to the heart of a true artist,"​​​Inside Llewyn Dewis is not a quintessential Coen Brothers' movie. It ain't dark. It doesn't have cold humor. It won't stay with you all your life. But, it is still one hell of a movie. Technically, it is as good as any period musical drama character study can get.It is a story of the journey of an artist and a celebration of a musical form, the folk music. It is about the heartbreaks and 'no breaks' that an artist can get if he is not ready to compromise his standing on the manner and style of creation and display of the art form which gives him maximum pleasure and satisfaction. Inside Llewyn Davis literally takes us inside the heart of a true artist, how fragile it is and how that fragility, those sentiments translate into his works, in this case, his voice and his music.It is a lovely movie and thank god there was Oscar Isaac, a Julliard graduate singer actor because it is hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to the role. Carey Mulligan in her short part in the movie, once again reminds you of how she made you fall in love with her in her previous movies.​Anyone who has ever felt the need to create art and has felt a special connection between his feelings and the desired output, you are in for an amazing ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great music, Oscar Issac showcase, weird dark character study","INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS (2013)Oscar Issac is currently one of my favorite actors based on his performance in Inside Llewyn Davis and Life Itself; he's a talented performer with depth, vision, and charisma, even when playing the King of the couch-sleeping cads and a rat to several cats in this movie. Because he's such a jerk, I found it impossible to root for Llewyn Davis, a down-on-his-luck, (some of it self created), underappreciated folk singer struggling with his messed up life and flailing career, but whenever he played guitar and sang, I couldn't help but be drawn in; his musical adeptness and passion for it was the guy's redeeming quality, if indeed he had any.The story is said to incorporate anecdotes based on Dave Van Ronk's life as a folksinger in the early 1960's in Greenwich Village, playing clubs like the Gaslight Cafe, where, in the film, he sees a young Bob Dylan perform one night in what I thought was a perfect film moment.The film bustles with the Coen Brother's complex character studies; creative dark humor; unexpected plot turns in the anti-hero's odyssey, (including a road trip from hell with a deft John Goodman as a heroin addicted jazz player); adroit cinematography; and a splendid soundtrack by Coen collaborator, the tremendous T Bone Burnett, which is largely filled with songs adapted from traditional folk tunes. Included in the playlist is an outstanding version of 500 Miles, sung by the trio of Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan, (who give delightful performances as Llewyn's friends), and Garrett Hedlund, as an up and coming star who, much to the chagrin of Llewyn, is outshining him.This film is worth watching for the music alone, then add to that this finely polished ensemble of actors and intriguing filmmaking -- it's a great watch, mesmerizing and fun, though ultimately dark... definitely not uplifting.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Subtle tale of folk music & cats. Sharply written, viciously funny.","There are two versions of Coen brothers (I'm not including the evil, shadowy version that inflicted The Ladykillers on us). Inside Llewyn Davis is not from the Coens of The Big Lebowski or Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? This is from the gloomy, shuffling, subtle Coens of The Man Who Wasn't There.Know this from the outset: this isn't for flighty fans who want to sing along, laugh out loud and enjoy the romp. This is a slow, inward-looking film that gently delights and brings smiles that occasionally bubble into light chuckles. I loved it.Taking a week out of the life of a young, troubled and struggling folk singer from Greewhich Village, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), Inside Llewyn Davis follows him as he trudges from sofa to sofa in a New York winter as bitter as himself, searching for validation and a breakthrough, incapable of seeing that the greatest obstacle in the way of success is himself.Of the regular Coen company only John Goodman is present, as irascible jazz musician Roland Turner, filling the back seat and armed with a cane, but as we have come to expect from Joel & Ethan's work, the screen is littered with memorable characters that aren't so much carved as cut from the script with pinking shears, jagged edges catching on those around them.Always beautifully written, their characters are brought to life by an invariably eclectic bunch, from New York outsiders to Hollywood stars. Lead from the front by Oscar Isaac, sprinkled through this 104 minute joy are the likes of Justin Timberlake, F. Murray Abraham and Carey Mulligan, as the fantastically dour, dowdy and razor-tongued Jean. When she sneers at Llewin, ""Everything you touch turns to s***, you're like King Midas' idiot brother"" we laugh and shrivel simultaneously. Hers is a wonderfully nuanced performance of a character that is sharp of tongue and blunt in attitude. With evenings spent in her company, is it any wonder that Llewin's self-esteem packed up and went south long ago?Isaac, in a rare but welcome lead role, marries the social ineptitude of Llewyn with the natural talent and bloody-mindedness that attracts friends and supporters before pummeling their emotions. We cringe, not from Issac's performance, but from each verbal bludgeoning Llewyn dishes out in his tiny life cycle. It is like watching a blinkered hamster lumbering around a barbed wire wheel when there is a vast stretch of calm and freedom a couple of steps to the left.Shot with muted hues that peak at 'dim' and trough at 'dull', Inside Llewyn Davis is a delightful comedy of folk music and cats with undertones of Greek mythology that takes its time, wanders at its own pace and stings with killer dialogue that the Coens have mastered.Where else would you hear a character screech ""Where's his scrotum?""For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Everything you touch turns to shite, you're like king Midas's idiot brother.","This the story of a loser. He can't make it as a singer, so he coach surfs with friends and family.The bad thing is that he manages to anger all those that try to help with his personality. He even gets one pregnant. How bad is his luck? He eschews royalties on a song because he needs the money for an abortion. He really didn't need the money as the one he paid for two years ago never happened and the doctor didn't know where to send the money. The song he gave up the royalties becomes a hit. Yes, his luck is that bad.It is always enjoyable to have John Goodman in a film. Is he in every Coen brothers movie?The best part of the film is, of course, the soundtrack, which includes such songs as ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"", ""Dink's Song"", ""Please Please Mr. Kennedy"", ""The Death of Queen Jane"", ""Green, Green Rocky Road"", ""Cocaine"", and ""Shoals of Herring"".",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Profoundly Disappointing,"The Greenwich Village music scene in the early '60's, by identity a folk revival but really a confluence of so many things; e.g., youthful angst, atomic fears, academia, neo-beat, etc., was full of vitality and greatly influenced the anti-war movement, not to mention the hippie era and the evolution of folk rock. ILD is sadly lacking in anything informing or uplifting and instead offers us a melancholy, older and less articulate Holden Caufield. There are several scenes in the film showing the title character performing well but show me just thirty seconds where Llewyn is depicted as loving - or even liking - music itself. Rather, Llewyn is totally self-absorbed when not pre-occupied with finding a couch to sleep on. One gets the feeling that LD would grab any diversion available and folk music just happens to be the one that is there. The ""cat"" subplot is not only pointless but thoroughly annoying. The talented Cohen brothers are in a funk and throwing up (pun intended) well crafted junk. Forget the accolades for ILD. It's mediocre stuff. PS / Dave Van Ronk, allegedly a loose model for the ILD mainc haracter, was an exceptional guitarist; e.g., performing such Scot Joplin instrumentals as THE ENTERTAINER and MAPLE LEAF RAG. The guitar playing in ILD is given zero reverence and I'm sure it was T-Bone Burnett's idea to have the professor friend own a Sears Silvertone to contrast the Martins and Gibsons.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen's at their most melancholic,"Looking like a Bob Dylan record cover come to life, Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coen brothers' first film since 2010's True Grit, takes place on the wintry streets of 1961 Greenwich Village in New York. We follow it's lead character, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac), a talented but struggling folk singer crashing from couch to couch, trying desperately and comically to hold his life together and come through what was one of the most exciting times for folk singers - this was the year Bob Dylan broke out of the scene. The film, like Llewyn, wanders sporadically, seemingly without direction, but this is the Coen's finest work in years.The Coen's have always been cruel - be it shooting Brad Pitt's lovable idiot in the face in Burn After Reading (2008) or needlessly killing Donnie in The Big Lebowski (1998) - and here they revel in beating down its protagonist. But they have a lot of sympathy for him also - when he's beaten up in the alleyway by a shadowy stranger, we know he deserves it, but feel sorry all the same. And it's the same attitude they have with the subject matter. Although they often poke fun at the free-spirited melancholia of it all, they have a lot of love for the music. Long-time collaborator T-Bone Burnett provides the tunes, and it's a great soundtrack. Most impressively, the cast perform live on set, and Oscar Isaac manages to belt out a beautiful opener in Dave van Ronk's Hang Me, Oh Hang Me (the film is loosely based on van Ronk's memoirs).It's often difficult to work out what kind of film it is. It shifts between being a drama about an artist struggling to make an impact, a sombre look at what life was like as a folk musician in the early 60's, a Kafkaesque comedy with a tragic anti-hero at its heart, and a dark, somewhat mystical odyssey. Like the Coens' earlier film, A Serious Man (2009), it keeps the audience at arms length. But as brilliant as that film was, Inside Llewyn Davis is a more mature take, creating an altogether warmer film, offering throwaway, laugh-out-loud moments such as Llewyn's recording with fellow artists Jim (Justin Timberlake), a marketable, likable sort of guy, and Al Cody (Adam Driver), whose performance during Please, Mr Kennedy steals the entire damn film.As the film progresses, and Llewyn finds out Jim's girlfriend and performing partner Jean (Carey Mulligan) is pregnant, possibly with his child, and after he embarks on a doomed road trip with heroin-addled jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) and chain-smoking Beat poet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund), it becomes clear what the film is really about. The final scene will leave some people scratching their heads, but I believe it signifies the point in all our lives when we look at our own existence and contemplate the meaning of it, often coming to no conclusion. This is beautiful, thoughtful, sometimes uncomfortable film- making, with the Coen's at their most melancholic.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fascinating period, fascinating character","Llewelyn Davis is a compelling character around the time of the folk revolution in New York. He was very talented but also a bit of an abrasive character. He is a conflicted character and so he isn't able to reach his potential as a performer. He is patronizing, elitist, and arrogant which rubs many people the wrong way - most notably when he attends a dinner party and hilariously insults the overly earnest music one of the hosts is performing. However, he's a musician, he is very talented and so bookers must contend with him. This makes him a very compelling character because he acts in ways that are counterproductive to his career or his personal life.The scene in Greenwich Village is recreated with great detail, sometimes hilariously - most notably when a Peter, Paul, and Mary like group is kitted out in some truly horrible sweaters. The costuming and staging adds a great deal in creating the mood of the movie.The most notable part of the movie, however, is the character of Llewelyn Davis, as created by the Coens and realized by Oscar Isaac. He is a charmer with the ladies but much too honest and can't hold his tongue. He has a lot of opinions, most of which antagonize and set people off. While this internal conflict holds back his music career, it makes for great complexity which is the heart of an incredible movie.There is some great work by Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman but Oscar Isaac is really fantastic. The creation of the script and the deepening of our understanding about the start of the ""folkie"" scene and how things are much more complicated than we're often led to believe, make this a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
INSIDE this character drama you will find....,"And here comes another Coen Bros film. Another film with some very memorable characters led by the somewhat newcomer Oscar Isaac. He is basically the only lead in the movie, everyone else is a glorified cameo. Besides perhaps Carey Mulligan, who is great as the ticked off ex-girlfriend type. The whole movie comes off as a depressing journey for a man who cant find himself. The deeper meaning is he cant move on from his best friend and music partner committing suicide.Praise- The look of the film is great, so much that it was nominated for an academy award for cinematography. Even without much of a climax, the Coen Brothers work their magic and do a great job directing. They always find a way to make their characters memorable. Even in the Big Lebowski (which I think is a highly overrated film) I remember some of the lines of the infamous 'The Dude'. I really liked that they threw the cat into the mix as the heart and soul of the movie. It truly symbolizes his music partner and that he finally realizes how to let him go and move on. Man does Davis struggle through most of this movie though. It really seems like nobody cares for this guy and the only people that actually allow him to stay more than one night are the Gorfein's. Perhaps they are the parents of his former partner?Complaints- I don't have many problems with the movie, as the writing is pretty much flawless as is every other Coen Bros movie. I would say for me, the movie didn't pull me in emotionally as much as I wanted it to. I had heard it has as much heartbreak as Pursuit of Happiness. It just didn't thrill me as much with the emotion.As a whole its a great small film that has some great deeper meanings of loss and getting over something that haunts you and eventually makes you hit rock bottom.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
If The Sun Also Rises were Set in the Sixties...,"...Then this would be it. Ernest Hemingway takes his book title from the verse in Ecclesiastes that states ""Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again. Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns."" Like The Sun Also Rises, Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't have much of a plot. Its characters, particularly the titular Llewyn, drift from place to place, never really going anywhere. And like Jake Barnes, from the Hemingway novel, Llewyn has a piece of himself missing--his former singing partner, Mike. Llewyn loses himself in this lost part of himself, and thus falls into the wind's swirling, circular course. But his obstinacy and pretension keep Llewyn from escaping, and so, as the movie's beginning and ending scenes suggest, Llewyn is stuck in a rut from which he'll never escape until he can learn to compromise.And since I've already compared the film to one literary work, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to bring in a few others. Llewyn's cyclical life evokes Sisyphus, although if Albert Camus imagined Sisyphus happy, the Cohen brothers imagined him broken, weary from pushing his meaningless rock day after day.And then, of course, there was the cat, that elusive creature that kept slipping through Llewyn's fingers, much like his dream of being a renowned musician. I can't help but think of T. S. Eliot's ""Prufrock"" here, with the ""yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes.""But anyways, I thought the film was excellent. The writing was superb, the direction was great, and Oscar Isaac really shined, even if only as a diamond in the rough.

A Yet Another Winner from the Coen Brothers!,"Joel & Ethan Coen are amongst the most prolific, talented duo-directors of the Modern-Era. Their body of work is simply remarkable & with their latest offering 'Inside Llewyn Davis', they emerge victorious yet again!

The journey of its protagonist, Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Issac, isn't eventful or celebrated. His journey consists grief, pain & struggle. But, what compliments him in his journey, is his own music.The Screenplay Written by the Coen's themselves, is undeniably engaging. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is perfect. They deliver a story of a troubled musician most effectively. Cinematography is outstanding. Editing is crisp. A Special Mention for the wonderful music.Performance-Wise: Oscar Issac is brilliant as Llewyn Davis. He enacts the struggling musician effortlessly. Carey Mulligan is, as always, first-rate. John Goodman is delightfully despicable in his part, while F. Murray Abraham shows up in a powerful cameo. Justin Timberlake suits the part & adds great depth to the songs.On the whole, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a very well-made film, that excels in every aspect. Two Thumbs Up!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Incredibly eye-opening,"The Coen brothers have always been so full of surprises. It is not astonsihing how contrasting a comparison of one of their films with another can be, and despite that, you can always identify their influence behind the camera. Inside Llewyn Davis is the biggest example of this so far.This fictional story takes place during the revival of the folk genre in the 1960s, honoring all the voices that made the era stand out through the eyes of Davis, a young musician struggling to balance his money problems and an uncertain future, all while trying to make a name for himself in what eventually ends up as a vicious cycle. Many times, we get stuck in an automatism without realizing, not because it suits us, but because it is what remains, along with the hope that, at some point, something will interrupt that cycle.Probably, there will be no intrinsic opinion of this particular film. However, the effectiveness of its theme cannot be denied, which it would be almost impossible not to feel a minimal identification with. Also, the soundtrack is a gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Believe me it is not your regular movie but looks like one!,"No doubt it was a good movie with fine characters and great story. This movie reminds one of my favourite movie of recent time 'Frances Ha'. Because both the main characters from these two movies are more alike. Theirs professional struggle and also chronicles relationship problems.This, Coen brothers latest created lots of noise before hitting the screen. Like everyone I too expected what they gonna give to us. I enjoyed it. The folk songs were so good and it was not nominated for Oscar because most of them were not original. According to the filmmakers, especially the music section was inspired by 70s, but not the lyrics.Beautiful cinematography, very eye catching colour palette. It was on the short list for Oscar, but lost to the magnum Opus 'Gravity'. I was rooting for any of these two in this category for Academy awards.I think Carey Mulligan is used to it with a character like this, an anti-good roles or an irritable one. In a recent 'The Great Gatsby' as well she was in such role. But I like her, she's the one of a beauty that Hollywood imported from Britain.The only trouble the movie gave me was the tease in many parts. It teased me with its scenes when I expected something it went opposite direction made me look like a fool. Yeah, it was good thinking by the Coen brothers as the script writers, but I felt a little let down when they carried away throughout. In the end the buzz they created did not end in what everyone could expect. I don't know it is good or bad, but the movie will win our hearts.Believe it is not your regular movie, but looks like one, that is the trick made by the legendary brothers.

Inside Llewyn Davis,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a melancholic but engaging and enthralling character study. I had no idea what to expect going into this, I always go blind, but with this even more so. And I was suppressed to have a really good time with it, because character studies aren't really my type of movie most of the time as they tend to slack in pacing. Which this movie does not.Directing excels at selling the world Llewyn lives in, the colors, the music, the ambience, the characters. It all fits, and it sucks you into that world. Combined with the music and it really becomes a complete picture. Besides that pacing, like mentioned before is great. Having just read the trivia, that cat.. I'm very happy that got thrown in because it adds just that bit of needed dynamic to keep it rolling. So pacing was great.I haven't seen enough Coen brother movies yet, just a few and felt somewhat underwhelmed, but here I get a taste of why people love these directors.Character and story. I find it hard to say like some others that you're rooting for a bad person, the layer beneath his behavior has all to do with his deceased partner. Something that gets talked over and somewhat glossed over intentionally. Like not wanting to talk about, not being ready to deal with it, avoiding it, and thus ending up like this. Lack of luster for life. Adding that to the character it doesn't make Llewyn a bad person, just a troubled and pathetic one. Which feels more right to root for. Of course his behavior puts you off more and more throughout the movie. Story was fine, myriad of events and some quirky moments. Structure was a nice surprise, smart way of keeping a underlying mystery on top of the rest and makes looking back on it fun.Music/acting, fantastic. Just great, Isaac kills it. Becoming more and more a fan of him, just strong performances all around, everyone pulls their weight. Mulligan honorable mention, very strong.All in all, enjoyed it a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Unfortunately, the Coens saw fit to showcase several of these masterpieces, in their entirety. That alone could send you to the bathroom to escape.But, there was more (or less): An incredibly banal and tedious script, and acting that couldn't rise above it.I went back to the snack bar for another quart of Diet Coke so I could stay awake while I waited for something to happen.

Inside Llewyn Davis,"The Coen Brothers deliver upon a personal, soulful drama they have never explored cinematically, resulting in a brilliant film. Oscar Isaac gives one of his best performances, playing a role that allow him to show his best features as an actor through facial expressions that tell a story on its own. The character he portrays, while intentionally unlikeable, has a charm and relatability factor to him that makes the journey feel personal. The beautiful cinematography is depressive, allowing the viewer to further become immersed in the emotions of the main character. The music in the film is soulful, adding to the enjoyment and sadness of the journey this film embarks upon. The introspective look into the life of a failed folk musician, creates an emotional story that explores the ideas of depression, loneliness, and the pursuit of ambitions.

He has an amazing voice but the music was very uninspiring, though i guess that's supposed to be the point because he's a failing musician in the story.It was occasionally funny but the main redeeming feature of the film was the cat stories. That cat was cute as heck and i would always be looking forward to the cat scenes. I understand that the film is supposed to be a little window into this guys life but the lack of detail sort of made the film wash over you creating a lack of empathy for the character.

"""Farewell true love, we'll meet another day, another time...""","Not suited for the popcorn loving masses. Stay away, this is not your cup of tea! Having said that I can now praise this wonderful Coen Brothers gem for all those who are curious about these genius movie twins. Any one who knows the Coen Brothers wont be reading these reviews, they will be watching their magnificent work. However for all those who dont yet know who the Coen Brothers are, this review might be very helpful with my one and only advice: go watch it.The Coen Brothers do it their way. Instead of making a movie about the glorified period in Greenwich Village that put Bob Dylan in the spotlights, they made a movie of the bland period BEFORE that truly gifted singer songwriter saw the light. Who would dare do that, other than the Coen Brothers? Who would dare make a movie about a singer songwriter that has no talent?Every Coen Brothers movie is full of losers: people who just fail at everything they aim for. This story aint no different. It's about Oscar Isaac trying to make it in the music business of the early sixties. And he fails miserably. But the meticulous portrait of his failing is done so splendidly, that it is a great joy to watch this man fall from grace.""A fantastic true life"" drama was the quote from a disney poster that was featured in this movie. And true to life this story is. Bleak, grey and going nowhere. Nothing happens. A man loses a cat. A man finds a cat. A man goes to Chicago and returns from Chicago. He goes with nothing and he returns with nothing. Well, he has gained something: the wisdom and insight that his music carreer and his life are going nowhere. All this bland, depressing waste of effort is photographed, edited, scored and acted in such a brilliant way that I honestly dare say, that this movie gets better every time I watch it. No longer the story is relevant, but the depressing mood, that smothers every scene. And that mood is one of quiet despair and loneliness. No director can portray loss and despair with such grace as the Coen Brothers have done with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Magnificent!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
For Musicians,"I will start by saying that if I wasn't a musician my self, as well as a folk music fan, i am not sure whether I would have rated this movie as highly as I did. If you are someone trying to play music for a living then this film will definitely appeal to you. Appreciating the magnificent musicianship (Oscar Isaac could sell an album of songs like this) really improves the movie. For a casual movie watcher the absence of closure may discourage you from liking the film, as well as the complete lack of exposition throughout. The best way to enjoy the film would be to step back and try to watch it just as the description says ""a week in the life of a young singer"".As I've said, any budding musician will easily identify with Llewyn. So these are the people I'd recommend to go and see the film, they will love it. Others, maybe not. But nonetheless it is a terrific film that is not the norm, something The Coen Brothers are specialists at.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Artistes who Fade Away...,The film shows a struggling Singer's life for 7 days in the 60's NY Greenwich Village Folk Music Scene. The film starts with a Fantastic Song that sets the world-weary tone of the film. Coen Brothers' unique style of direction coupled with dry humor & fantastic cinematography makes for a laid-back watch. Oscar Isaac is terrific as the struggling bitter musician who has immense passion for his art and yet never finds his moment in Spotlight & everyday gets punched relentlessly by the World. Dude sang & played the guitar beautifully too. Carey Mulligan & John Goodman were great also.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Uncredited,"Aw, but what about the cat? Wow, whoever the animal handler was for this film, they really did some great work but, who exactly played 'Ulysses' then? The Coen's appear to have another hit on their hands by looking at the other side of success. Here we have a conceited amateur performer who is trudging around trying to make a living when half of his act has died. He's in mourning and doesn't know it and sings mournful songs with little subject appeal. He's not someone you'd want to have anything to do with yet he can find a whistleable and memorable tune from some hidden depths. Cinematography is spot on, dialogue is spot on, casting is spot on, sounds are spot on. What more can you say!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Really long and very boring,"The acting, great. The lead character, also great. There just is not enough movie here to justify the length. It's tedious and a test of loyalty for Coen brother fans, apparently. The cast just does not have enough to do, and Oscar Isaac has too much to do. As a character study, the movie would have been more interesting at half the running time. Also, almost all the cast except Oscar Isaac end up as idiotic caricatures. It s very unfortunate. I do not recommend that you see this movie. I saw the movie because I had to build some cabinets and I had not done this for a few years. I was so sore, I just wanted someplace to sit and not fall asleep. If you think my telling you why I saw the movie is boring, believe me, the movie is 10 times worse. Avoid.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The Times They Are a-Changin',"Beautiful story of poetic soul trapped in time before his time, an antiquated, band-lead world of the early 1960's music scene. Rich in Coen symbolism, Inside Llewyn Davis portrays an every talented man, unadjusted to society that doesn't appreciate his obsolete poetry, soon to become world wide trend for the next decade and a half. Nothing he tries seems to work and all his endeavors turn to dust.But Llewyn fights on, led through stormy seas of his life by destiny that he desperately tries to hold on to, loosing a grip on it whenever he looses the cat, his mystery companion.He gets a beating from his bad luck, in the alley behind the Gaslight Cafe, posing as his ""friend"", after the performance where he takes a pity on himself singing ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" from depth of his troubled mind. Every person he meets is another piece in the jigsaw of his redemption waiting to happen. As the cycle of his downfall makes a full circle, he is back where we found him, but something has changed. Slim silhouette with a slightly husky voice, takes the stage and opens a new era in popular music, making ""never new"", and ""never old music"", the voice of a generation. Llewyn says ""Au revoir"" to shadowy ugly figure of his bad luck, that speeds away from him, in a yellow cab. The Times They Are a-Changin' and his destiny has led him out of the tempest of life, that had kicked him around.Certainly one of the best films in the Coen canon, Inside Llewyn Davis will always let you find a new layer on it. It will make you laugh it will give you hope, and the music is beautiful and moving, with unsurpassed performance of ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" shining through. Worth of repeated viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Classic Indeed,"Inside Llewyn Davis (English): This Classic film (in my opinion) which won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film festival 2013 is indeed one of the best films coming from the Coen Brothers, based on the struggle of a young singer who overcomes obstacles and makes his way as a popular American Folk singer. The film is actually a pure art house outing where the music score by Todd Kasow and various is based on the music played within the film and is indeed great. Then the production designing by Jess Gonchor and team brings out the best of the '60's in the film, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is worth cherishing as he paints every frame beautifully, then comes the great characters especially played by Oscar Issac who delivers excellence on screen, then Justin Timberlake, Carrey Mulligan, Ethan Phillips and others at their usual best. Overall, with an initial slow pace and then picking up the pace within its progress, the narration by the Coen Brothers makes you just lost in its musical fold, making it worth a watch for Cinema Lovers. My rating would be: 4.5/5.﻿",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Coen Experience,"The Coen will never cease to amaze me with their capacity to take what could be a very boring story and make it an amazing tale. This one is a fine example of this, of course helped by a great performance by Oscar Isaac. Add to that great music and you get a very good experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Realistic enough to make performers wince,"As an active member of the poetry, folk music and performing arts community in Melbourne, which is burgeoning just as the Village Scene was at the time of the movie and which is one of the most active arts communities in the world, I was interested to see this movie. A sort of low-key folk 'This Is Spinal Tap', like that movie it is accurate enough to make you wince.I'm new to the Coen Brothers but I've watched about half of their films. Their main strengths are in the creation of lead characters who are memorable and complex, the excellent cinematography- always including wonderful and significant shots - and the well-visualised environments. Their movies, when based on their own texts, can be a bit simplistic, or as one reviewer here said, linear. That is, they have depth but can in some ways lack complexity. Their versions of life are still to some extent a Hollywood imagination or perspective, grounded in an imagining of reality rather than in the experience of it. Also it is only really the central character that is thoroughly depicted, though the other characters always have life. When they are using an external text, as in 'No Country For Old Men', they are capable of making movies that provoke thought and questions that can be considered for many years. The supporting characters in that movie have strong existences and realism. The Coens would be better off in many cases using texts written by actual members of the worlds they depict.The criticisms from veterans of that scene who say the movie does not truly represent the vibrancy of it are not justified. This movie is not attempting to be 'Nashville'. It visually demonstrates the internal world of the lead character.In some ways this movie is a homage to struggling performers and as such, should be seen by anyone who is a part of a similar scene. The first two thirds of this film contain consistent comedy which is low-key but hilarious in a quiet way. After that it may turn too dark for some viewers. A good movie and one that I will revisit, but not a great one.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Grim, Depressing and TOTALLY unenjoyable except for the music","I watched this movie because I was a part of the 60's Greenwich Village folk scene and was expecting an enjoyable nostalgic experience. I saw and thoroughly enjoyed Dave Van Ronk many times in many places including the Gaslight cafe. I played in Washington Square park on many Sundays with almost everyone. I am not a fan of the Coen brothers and I know them about as well as they know me. When the movie started with nifty rendition of the well known Van Ronk's Hang me I thought I thought I'd hit the jackpot. Well, nothing was farther from the truth. Although the acting was fine, the plot was so depressing that I actually felt like I was watching a nightmare. No one was happy about anything, no one accomplished anything, it just railed on about the futility of life in general. This movie (again, except for the music) is worse than boring, it's downright depressing and upsetting and detracts from my positive images and memories of the 1960's village scene. I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone enjoyed this movie or gave it a good rating. Both my wife and I left the movie feeling just plain MISERABLE.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderfull,"Film that tells a look into the life of a musician in full crisis of his life and his art, a look that tells how difficult the life of an artist can be and how bad things can go but that with someone you can count on by your side everything is better. Truly dramatic and raw story, without softening or funny moments that without moments of very real and artificial discomfort makes the viewer feel genuine sadness who can do nothing but empathize with the protagonist and hope for the best for him and also for the cats that cross the his path.

"A beautiful, charming, fairytale of New York","The Coen brothers are maybe best known for their action thrillers, such as 'No Country For Old Men' and 'Fargo', or possibly their romping comedy 'The Big Lebowski'. In 'Inside Llewyn Davis', however, I saw something entirely different: a quieter, almost silent, tale of character - a sad and yet funny film about a week in the life of a young New York folk singer (excellently portrayed by Oscar Isaac).The title ""Inside Llewyn Davis' is a curious one. It seems to promise an insight into the understanding of the principal character, and this is exactly what we get. In the opening scenes, I saw a charismatic and mysterious character, but as the plot rolls on, I began to learn more and more about this character, and also like this character more and more. This is the genius of the film: the protagonist is an excellent example of a character who is not lovable - in fact at times he seems detestable - but he gets such a bad hand that we as the audience are inclined to feel sympathetic.Another aspect of the film that is completely nailed by the Coens is the tone. It seems like a dull take on a somewhat dull life at the beginning, but by the end of the first act of the film I began to realise what was not a dull mood but one brimming with character: sometimes the mood was soulful, sometime it was sad, and at others it was plain heartbreaking. This mood was helped along by a series of aspects and devices: first and foremost, I must talk about the cat. The use of the cat to describe the situation of the plot and to brilliantly convey humour may just be the loudest and brightest example of the genius of Joel and Ethan.The cat isn't all that the writing of the film excels in. During the scenes of dialogue, I felt as though they were real, creeping upon me and connecting with me deeply. They were emotional, devastating and hilarious all at once. The script was helped, of course, by a truly magnificent performance from Oscar Isaac - frankly, it was a crime that he did not receive so much as a nod from the academy. I should add to this that boy, can he sing! All songs in this film were performed live, which I cannot acclaim enough and adds a whole new dimension to the screenplay.The other major way that this film builds such brilliant tone is through the cinematography. I expected something good from Bruno Delbonnel, but what I got was sensational. Perfectly capturing every scene in every frame is a true challenge in film making, and Delbonnel has done it as well as anybody could have. Again, I must refer to the academy: I am so glad they nominated the cinematography, but I thought, although Birdman was the better film, that Delbonnel deserved the Oscar over Lubezki.The main criticism that most of the audience are having from this film is ""What actually happened?"" which in some ways I can understand: the story literally finished in the same place it started. However, I believe that the people saying this have missed the point of the film completely. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a journey into, and with the character, of Davis, and therefore the audience should not require plot development or, at a stretch, much character development: I was compelled to watch and re-watch this film because of the technical aspects and characters of the move. A good plot does not a good film make.Inside Llewyn Davis is a quiet but masterful work from the Coen brothers, as they continue to hop to and in between many genres - in fact, in may just be one of their best. I would ultimately recommend the film to any fan of Joel and Ethan Coen, or any fan of film in general, with this triumph of script and character.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
all the other reviews are on spot,"i'm adding yet another review because, even though the movie was about a real life ""nowhere man"" right out of a beatles song, (all the other reviews are right on target with how uneventful the movie is, and there's no action), that's what makes it such a great movie. going to movies where there are bullets flying and the hero walks through unscathed gets old. those movies are unrealistic. i'm tired of them. this was a movie about something real. there wasn't any guns. there wasn't any nudity. there were some controversial issues raised, but that's part of life. yes, this movie was dull and uneventful, but i can relate to that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Tired Film,"The protagonist has his life sucked out of him due to failure from trying to make it in the music scene. And the only redeeming quality is the connection felt to this character since you will likely have the life sucked out of you after viewing.Its about a man trying to make it in the folk music scene in new York city. Inside Llewyn Davis needed but lacked something smart to envelopment the audience into the folk scene. It needed to present us with whats going on in that scene. If they couldn't do it technically (since all that was done regarding the setting was showing cold, muted colors and bleak dark environs that do not transport you anywhere except to a place of gloominess) they should have at least tried to put in some dialogue about the scene, a bit of a historical perspective, something about folk music itself, anything to get the audience into the 1960s folk scene setting which was what the movie was about. Perhaps the movie wasn't really about the folk music scene but rather a metaphor for the man who fails in his vocation. The film was about portraying a face that is not able to make it and perhaps the difficulty of trying to be a folk singer during that time period. The music was portrayed and listening to it was a delight and the only redeeming quality unfortunately is was barely discussed.The reason this film really fails is it exposes the worst of the worst film-making techniques and styles that the Coens are capable of. Quirky and boring caricature like characters that are trying to be amusing or maybe funny but you absolutely don't care about. Characters who are arbitrarily literally dropped out of the story which is OK because you don't care about them. There is really no character study of Lllewyn Davis he is sad, a little frustrated without very minimal backdrop to why he does what he does.The second major film-making problem was that it seemed put together in a very amateurish way since it has a disjointed feel, lacks flow, contains scenes of random nothingness infiltrated with characters of such banality. This was the worst Coen Film since the random characters which are sometimes amusing in their film were carelessly put in, had nothing of interest to say and completely failed to amuse. The random scenes in their films that usually don't fit in can sometimes have this quirky suspense about them but there was no suspense in this movie. The movie seemed lazily put together, the main character was tired and it may ultimately leave the audience tired.The only pleasantness derived from this is the actually folk music we get to hear. A complete song was played which is the only enjoyment I can foresee an audience deriving from this poorly put together depiction of bland misery. Devoting significant movie time to playing complete songs is also a problem. So the only good thing about this movie even added to the problems since by having a lot of time devoted to playing the complete song; the character development, the story and the substance were all forfeited.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Really great movie with an excellent soundtrack,"This is one of my favorite movies of 2013. I am a huge fan of the Coen brothers, and they didn't disappoint this time. Inside Llewyn Davis is a interesting adventure that is fun to be on. I feel like this movie was made to show no matter how tough times get you can't give up. The soundtrack is great, I want to buy it. I'm not a huge fan of folk music, but this movie made me like it. Then the acting was great. Oscar Isaac was great, and the Coen brothers made interesting side characters like they usually do. The writing was fantastic, I laughed a few times during this. This movie is one of the best of 2013. I would recommend it to Coen brothers fans, but they probably already watched it, and I recommend it to folk music fans and just about everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Different Kind Of Film,"When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't really have any urge to rush out and see it. It just didn't seem like a movie I would enjoy. But over time I kind of gained an interest in checking it out, and I'm glad I finally did. It's different for sure, but interesting, and there's a lot there.The whole movie is extremely aimless and roams around, just like the main character it follows. Llewyn Davis kind of roams around himself, sleeping on couches and just taking it a day at a time. He doesn't exactly have a specific goal in this film, lie most films would. It also doesn't really wrap the whole thing up at the end. But it's not exactly about that. It's about the journey he goes on and what he learns. I thought the whole cat situation he gets involved in was interesting, and there's a lot to look into regarding that (""Llewyn is the cat""). There's also a weird connection between the first few minutes of the film and the last few minutes, where it almost feels like some kind of time loop. I think due to the nature of some of the discussions in the film about Llewyn just not trying to change and letting things happen to him again and again, I think the loop worked. It may confuse some, but I think it is really neat. I'm sure on a second viewing I would pick up on more.The performances were great. Oscar Isaac is really captivating as Llewyn. I found myself interested in whatever he was doing, not matter how simple, and that's extremely important in a film like this where the plot is so aimless. There are also performances by Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and even Adam Driver that are great (also that other guy from Girls appears which is kind of funny). I also really enjoyed the music. While it's not the kind of music I would listen to normally, it's really well done and great to listen to.Overall I think this is a unique film that's worth a watch. It does a lot of subtle and interesting things that keep you interested throughout, and it's a movie that would benefit from a second watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A rare gem in this era,"""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is the kind of movie that is scarcely produced anymore. It's a rare film which resonates with the reality of everyday struggle to ""make it"" in life, minus the typical heroism. It avoids ""Hollywoodization"" of its characters and plots, which may explain the Oscar snub, and the storytelling is great (try to relate the beginning, the middle and the end of the film).Llweyn Davis is a folk singer/musician who struggle to meet ends. His solo album isn't selling and he has to 'couch surfing' at people's houses. Although his life is reproved by others, he refused to settle for ""merely existing"". He goes to great lengths to pursue his passion but finds the dream increasingly further away. He is stuck in a circle.Oscar Isaac superbly embodies his character, and the soundtrack is amazing. One more thing I find interesting is that the characters (and the conversations they had) represent the society in many aspects. Overall, if you are the kind that appreciate a good movie that is not just packed with blockbuster action, this one is a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One of their best,"This is a funny, thought provoking, beautifully made film about another member of the seemingly endless line of Coen Bros losers. Some of the shots make you gasp, they are so lyrically filmed. I am surprised that so many viewers found it disappointing. The range of cameos by some of our best actors is an added attraction. Carey Mulligan is absolutely gorgeous and the role she plays very interesting. Above all there is the music, which as so often with the Coen Bros is one of their strongest points. The songs are crucial to the theme and tone of the movie. All this and a lovely ginger cat - really, it's hard to ask for more. Somebody said that in an ideal world every film would be directed by the Coen Bros and it's hard to disagree on a showing as convincing as this one",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Interesting look at folk music,"One of the aspects of the film that is portrayed rather well is showing the character Llewellyn struggle to make a career with his singing which is something that tends to hap or quite a lot whether it is an established artists or those up and coming in the music business. Another aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the blues guitar music in the background in addition to the excellent vocals that are song by the cast particularly Oscar Issac and Justin timberlake who has a small role as Jim. In terms of the Llewelyn character himself there is a part of audience that wants to relate to his struggles but the half of him seems like a hipster to me,",8.0,Anonymous,Music
What to do when all meaning is gone,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a rich work of art, be that in cinema or in music. The title character is a man filled with remorse and emptiness, who after the suicide of his partner drifts around looking to basically survive and live off the music he makes. All throughout the movie he will interact with people he knows and even travel to Chicago. This story invites you into the life of someone who seems to be going through life without any sense of purpose. He assumes music as his way of being, folk music to be exact, and all he does ends up being connected with the songs he does and also his presence in the whole business. Personally I rooted for this folk singer despite his flaws and wrong decisions that after all just makes him more human.I am usually not a fan of the Coens and their feature films. The only other movie I can say I've loved from them is No Country For Old Men, and that one was from a different perspective. I'll admit that I haven't seen Fargo. but still they fail to capture my fullest attention. Given its musical nature, Inside Llewyn Davis nails the mark on the songwriting and composing point. The commitment the filmmakers had on perfecting every single detail is something I very much appreciate. The performances are quite good and Oscar Isaac handles the responsibility of leading the movie quite splendidly. With some eerily beautiful cinematography and a inquisitive script, Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those rare movies that leave you asking questions but on a positive note. Definitely a must-seeRating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The songs are absolutely beautiful and make up one of the year's best soundtracks!,"'INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The Coen brothers' newest film is yet another of 2013's biggest Oscar contenders, as well as one of the best reviewed movies (of last year) and the Coens' careers! It's about a broke folk singer trying to make a living, by following his dreams, in New York City's Greenwich Village (during a week in 1961). It stars Oscar Isaac as the title character and co-stars Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Adam Driver, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham and John Goodman (who appears in almost every Coen brothers' movie). I found the film to be interesting and entertaining enough (despite an overly depressing nature and lack of story) but most of all I loved the movie's music.The film takes place during one week in New York City's Greenwich Village, during February of 1961. There's no plot at all but it does have a decent amount of interesting character development. The movie tells the story of Llewyn Davis (Isaac), a struggling musician and ex-merchant marine. He was a part of a mildly popular folk singing duo but his partner committed suicide. He's now trying to make it on his own but his solo album 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't selling. He's broke but makes a little bit of money playing clubs while sleeping on friends' couches and waiting for his manager to get his record distributed. He also has to deal with a bitter ex-lover (Mulligan), who thinks she's pregnant with his baby, and take care of a friend's cat (he locked out of it's apartment by accident).The movie is funny in places (in the Coens' usual style) but mostly it's a pretty serious character driven drama about the struggles of a gifted small-time musician. In that way it reminded me a lot of the 2009 film 'CRAZY HEART'. T-Bone Burnett did a lot of the music for that movie as he does this one (and a couple of other Coen brothers' films as well; 'O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?' and 'THE LADYKILLERS'). The songs in this film were mostly recorded live and played in their entirety. I think they're absolutely beautiful and make up one of the year's best soundtracks (without a doubt). Because of the music I give the movie an especially high rating but the dark negative subject matter and lack of plot certainly don't make the film one of the funnest movies of the year (or the Coens' careers). It does seem very true to life though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The King's New Clothes,"Previous Coen films have been among my favorites of all time, especially ""Fargo"" and ""True Grit"". These brothers write and direct terrific films. But the praise for this film is undeserved. It reminds me of the fable of the King's New Clothes, where everyone is blinded by the king's celebrity and no one has the courage to state that the king is naked! This film is a dud. It is more of a vignette than a story. There is hardly a plot. I didn't even get the feeling that the principal character Isaac/Davis really loves music. He performs a few songs very well, but where are the scenes where he writes music, listens to others, shows passion? This film lacks depth and is missing the rich Coen humor and irony that we have come to expect.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Coen Bros, not Disney","Much of this extraordinary and technically perfect film is about subtext, glances, gestures, and throwaway dialog which (like the main character's box of keepsakes) is not really meant to be thrown away.One example of many, near the end Llewyn passes a threatre marquee for a Disney film and pauses to consider it. I don't claim to have mastered all the nuances -- only seen this once so far -- but the contrast could not be starker.This is not a Disney film about winners. This is about losing, but doing so against one of the iconic backdrops in American history.The sets are almost perfect. You almost believe you are in a time machine. The only error I could find (because I started to really look) was a scene under an overpass. The construction of the footings was square, a design that was not used back in the day.Loved the cameo by John Goodman. Unforgettable. Loved the way the cat became Llewlyn's ""spirit animal"" - almost.The biggest treat is an almost unrecognizable Carey Mulligan who at the same moment, manages to come across as tough, hardened, petite, larger than life, crass, sweet, naive, cunning, sexy, powerless and powerful.Wow.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I went into this movie blind. I knew it had a good reputation, but other than that, I knew nothing about this. The opening song really drew me in, and set this up to be a really great movie. It didn't take long for me to recognize the trademark style of the Coen brothers, which made me like it even more.
I can't say enough good things about this movie. In fact, I can't really say any bad things. The entire story is entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. The direction, the acting, the writing....everything is impeccable. I especially enjoyed the short cameos from John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham.Despite everything great about this movie, what makes it brilliant in my book is the music. I'm like folk music as it is, and all the songs in Inside Llewyn Davis are great by any standard. I could easily listen to this album every day and still want more. As a side note, the ending nod to Bob Dylan offered quite the finish.In short, main highlights are the acting (Isaac's talent continues to blow me away) and the music, along with a little bit of smart humor. This is highly recommended for people who love watching talent showcased on screen, because everyone involved is at their very best here.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A gloomy, inspired music scene","With this one the Coens are taking a much more subdued approach to a story about music. Particularly the music of Llewyn Davis, a down on his luck former folk music singer.

First of, their is a ton of goood music in here. If you're a fan of old times folk type music, you may find yourself enjoying this movie a little bit more. It also has at the level of a dark comedy about it to, but its alot ore underpayed here. I would not go as far as to calk this film boring, but it is quite slow, quite relaxed, and that too makes it feel calm and easy to watch , which is a positive for me.

Another classic from the Coen Brothers,"10 February 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Inside Llewyn Davis. Joel and Ethan Coen - Informally known as the Coen Brothers, are award winning writers, directors, producers and editors (see Wikipedia) and going to see one of their films is a rare treat in this world of CGI, big budget glitzy, science fiction, action and violent cinema going that we take as the norm these days. With Inside Llewyn Davis they have added another significant film to their repertoire. This is the story of a week in the life of one Llewyn Davis, a folk singer without a clear plan of where he is going. Once part of a duo, he is trying to make it in Greenwich village after the suicide of his singing partner. Seemingly without friends, he moves from apartment to apartment and sofa to sofa as he gradually antagonises all those prepared to take him in. In true Coen Brothers style, this is a gritty dark view of someone in a situation he seems unable or even unwilling to pull himself out of. A lot is said without uttering any words and I found myself alternating between feeling sorry for the guy and wanting to shake him hard and tell him to pull his socks up. Good soundtrack and a handsome ginger cat!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Nothing to say. Nothing to sing. Nothing to. . . Enjoy.,"Either a vanity project by the famous brothers or a practical joke played on pompous halfwits who'll throw 5 stars at anything if they think someone else might beat 'em to it first. The film makers may well claim it's a serious look at a particular musical era but heigh-ho, they said 'Fargo' was a true story. . . and many people believed that, too.Plot less, witless, and with neither narrative drive nor the remotest dramatic credibility, the movie fails so abysmally in every area -- and in every achingly boring minute of its running time -- that there really can be but one conclusion: It is a joke. A practical joke.It's been put together to identify those who slavishly admire The Emperor's New Clothes (of whom, it seems, there are thousands, though principally the industry's award-givers and so-called 'film critics' the world over) in order that the film-makers can have a good laugh at 'em -- fair enough, but I wish it hadn't cost me real money to participate in someone else's juvenile party game.PS: is there some problem with John Goodman nowadays that either he or his agent can't find a halfway decent script? After the repellent nonsense of his turn as a drug dealer in the awful ""Flight"", he's yet another drugs-associated fat berk here. Cornering the market in a role is one thing. . . but cornering this market? Sheesh.PPS: Great performances by the assorted cats in this movie though. And for all the pseudy 'expert' critics out there, there's a lovely nose-thumbing reference to a 1960s Disney movie involving travelling people, travelling animals, which (a) actually had a plot and (b) was a genuine road movie (which this is not) and (c)showed just how good American film-making can be.

In this ""Odyssey"" Llewyn is always with a cat(almost of the time.For me the cat represents Mike,his lost partner, you can see that in some scenes, like almost at the end, when the cat as the beginning of the movie tries to get out of the house, with LLewyn , but LLewyn wont let him,after that Llewyn goes to a café , and he plays a song, an old song that he used to play when he had Mike.The cats name is Ullysses, and like in Homero's Odyssey, Ullysses travels and at the end he returns home, That happens in Inside Llewyn Davis, LLewyn travels and the end of the film is similar to the beginning, this Odyssey happened to Llewyn forgets his partner's death and to keep playing wonderful music.At the end, LLewyn says goodbye, and at the same time Bob Dylan is playing at the bar that he used to play, that means that Llewyn was not hard-worker and very arrogant.Bob Dylan started from the bottom, and there you can see the difference from Bob Dylan's career and LLewyn's career.The acting is brilliant, so the directing and the music. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of my favorite movies of the year, and i think it should have been nominated for best picture and best direction, at least. My congratulations to Ethan Cohen and Joel Cohen. 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An Enjoyable Film,"2013 Movie Review - Inside Llewyn Davis #moviereviews #movies2013 #oscars2014 #coenbrothers New Coen brothers' film is about a poor Folk musician in New city in 60's. Right out of the bat, I find this a drama and comedy film (aka dramedy), so if the sense of humor of Coen brothers don't appeal to you, then this isn't enjoyable for you – this was unexpected to me to be that funny. I'm personally not a fan of Folk music but the songs are well composed and matched to the tone of the film – I didn't mind any of them, not that I would listen to them again, but I certainly wouldn't mind them if I was watching the movie again. The performances are great and likable here: Oscar Isaac, plays this leading role perfectly, an unlucky, poor, stubborn, and even rude and cocky character; Carey Mulligan is just one of my favorite actresses, and I enjoyed her performance here as well; Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Adam Driver, and Garrett Hedllund are other familiar faces who play small roles and again, they do a solid job, maybe even underused, but my favorite performance goes to the Cat – I liked that damn cat so much, I couldn't lay off my eyes from it. This bring me to the next point, the cinematography of this film is amazing, especially working with the cat, it must have been difficult but they manage to grab some amazing and gratifying images.In conclusion, even though for me the movie got dragging at some points due to the amount of the folk songs, but somehow I was invested in the main character and his struggles and also the humor in the tone, so I don't know if this is a movie for everyone, especially that there's not really a clear ending, it's an open interpretation, which Coen brothers often do for their films. Anyway, I give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The portrayal of a struggling average folk singer in denial of his mediocrity is so spot on,"Having seen so many of Oscar Isaac's performance before watching this, I had my tempo set quite high and he didn't disappoint. It is one his best performance if not THE best. This man truly deserves an Oscar.Cinematography and direction is top notch and this is one of most well lit movie that I have seen. The way it shows Llewyn Davis as any other character we meet from daily life and not as a genius prodigy central character who just happens to be unlucky is my biggest takeaway.Another brilliance from the Coen brothers; this definitely will linger on for quite sometime.I'm tired. I thought I just needed a night's sleep but it's more than that.Seldom has something like this been expressed so perfectly.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Inside Llewyn Davis showcases the ego Inside Us,"Llewyn Davis is an aspiring solo folk guitarist. He is sure that the music he makes is the best kind and the fellow folk musicians around him are either career oriented or they lack talent. How this ego makes him almost ruin his music career and doubt his own capability, is beautifully captured. The movie doesn't shy away from showing the egoistic nature of individuals which truly hinders our growth towards happiness.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
a testament to the cool Coens brand of cinema,"with exquisite image compositions, storytelling and omnipresent music, the film fully reflects the obsession of Llewyn Davis for his passion, his firm conviction that the world underestimates his talent.more than anything else, i think, what makes the Coen Brothers so special is their unique ability and manner in layering their story. there is always this other layer, an existential, mythical plan that allows the film something more than what it seems on the surface, the sort of thing that i'm certain will ensure success upon multiple rewatches. the Coens are able to trigger mystery and involvement by having those narrative gaps and scenes that can not (or should not) be understood immediately; and so, the set is ready to fill the film up with our own projections.maybe i've talked more about the filmmakers than the film itself, but it is all the more worthy for being able to showcase the Coens brand of cinema and stand as a testament to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Inside Llewyn Davis Review,"I was looking forward to Inside Llewyn Davis, but I can't really call myself a Coen Brothers fan having only seen a handful of their movies. After watching the trailers I was greatly intrigued by the visual style and story, and Inside Llewyn Davis not only gave me that but much more as well.The movie is incredibly well written. I never know what would happen next and found myself incredibly invested in the characters. The movie is very gripping, which is a great feat considering we are just watching a week of a man's life and struggles. There is some amazing symbolism and hidden meanings, some of which I'm sure I will keep thinking about for days after watching.The acting is phenomenal as well. Oscar Isaac is excellent in the title role, he carries the whole movie and does a brilliant job of doing so. There are a lot of supporting cast members as well, including Carey Mulligan and John Goodman who are both great. Justin Timberlake is in this movie as well, and he actually plays a different type of role to the usual college computer nerd he normally plays.Of all the Coen brothers movies I've seen, Inside Llewyn Davis is by far the best directed. The cinematography is incredible and just as I was hoping for, has a very unique and beautiful visual style. Although the film is set in the sixties, it has a timeless feel to it so that it could fit into any decade. The pacing is impeccable, when the movie was over I was surprised at how quickly it seemed it had gone, I don't want it to end. I'm not normally a huge fan of the type of music that this movie showcases, however I thought that the soundtrack was excellent. Inside Llewyn Davis is a movie that I certainly plan on watching time and time again, and I strongly recommend that you watch it too.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
So this is why I dislike folk music?,"Hate to be the one sour note, and it is great that so many people can enjoy this movie. But from a musical and musicians point of view, it is hopelessly out of tune. And it is the biggest miss for music fans since Scorcese completely ruined a very good idea of filming a story about the swing era, New York, New York. The problem with both films, is that the directors exhibited a tin ear to what was really behind an entire genre of music, and failed to capture almost all of the joy, sweat and tears that goes into musical creativity. If the Coen's wanted to capture the tragedy of musical losers, then they have not even done that. Because the whole reason music becomes an obsession in the first place is because there is so much that is positive about even very small roles in the musical universe. And what the Coen's really miss is the small fact that the folk era was not just the petty lives of secondary artists, but an entire country, even an entire world, singing there heart out about the liberation that was sweeping human consciousness. And there was one other small fact; folk musicians were known for more that silly tantrums and little minds. Many of them, to this day, were satisfied to be historians, mythologists, and keepers of the flame from many cultures and traditions. The shocking glory of Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Dylan in that style and so many others was pure magic. All of a sudden there was music of such simplicity and beauty, that the world was stunned. If the Coen's had any inkling of this in the making of this movie, I missed it.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
See it through his eyes,"Inside Llewyn Davis will do just as the title says. The Coen's script and direction bring life on the road as a starving artist to a reality before your eyes. It plays with suspense beautifully, showing you the hopeful highs interspersed with cold depressing lows. The monotony of trying for something but never succeeding lies heavy on the shoulders of the viewer. The barrier between story and reality is almost completely immersive.It's not a long movie but it does tend to drag on. Just like the life of Llewyn, the viewer feels drawn along peaks and valleys of interest. Llewyn's week long odyssey ends where it begins, nowhere.The film has a message, a unique one (like most Coen pics). It does a great job of delivering it in a way the makes best use of the medium. Keep your mind open to what they wish to share and you'll get something out of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Unlikable and amazingly overrated.,"The reason I saw this film is that it's a Coen Brothers film--and I nearly always love their films--whether they are comedies or dramas. However, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was, for me, a completely boring film with very little to recommend it. If I hadn't known it was a Coen film, I never would have guessed it aside from having John Goodman in an odd little role and a reference to Ulysses.Llewyn Davis is a struggling fictional folk singer. Not only is he only moderately talented, he's pretty much a bum--living off others and hoping they'll let him sleep on their couch for a day or two. Now if he was a nice person, this could be forgiven. But, unfortunately, he's a rather foul-mouthed guy for the early 1960s and there isn't a lot to like or admire. This film is about a week in his life where not a lot happens. And to me, this ALL sums up why I didn't like the film--Llewyn is a jerk and nothing of consequence happens in the movie. End of story. I kept hoping SOMETHING would happen to make it all worth watching but no such luck.On the positive side, Oscar Isaac's acting was good as the title character. And,....well, I guess that's all there is on the positive side. I rarely have seen a movie so praised by critics that left me this dissatisfied. In this sense, I'd place it among films like ""Tree of Life"" and ""The English Patient"". See it if you want--just don't be surprised if there just isn't much to enjoy in this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Entirely Pointless,"I love the Coen Brothers for movies like O Brother Where Art Thou and The Big Lebowski and I expected something great from Inside Llewyn Davis, especially because it has received such glowing reviews and has garnered so many award nominations.Inside Llewyn Davis is dreary, pointless, and unpleasant. The main character is not likable, and the audience's distaste for Llewyn is solidified when he leaves a cat stranded with a drug-addicted old man on the side of the highway. The other characters are more Coen Brothers trademark oddballs, though none of them contribute in any meaningful way to the main character or the story. John Goodman, for example, is hilarious, but his character is absolutely purposeless.It seems to me that the Coen Brothers wanted to make a movie about folk music and to work with T Bone Burnett again, but lacked the motivation to make anything truly substantive. Even the music around which the movie is centered still lacks gravity, perhaps because nothing that is presented on screen has any real emotional pull or interest. It has drawn supporters from the art-house crowd who like the avant-garde but who cannot pretend to understand it. The point of this movie is that there is no point, and try though I did to respect this idea, it is ultimately a waste of time to make a movie to present.If this movie wins Best Picture, I will be very upset. This movie is not innovative, interesting, or remarkable. It is depressing and ugly.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Why do I keep falling for the Coen Brothers label?,"I swore off their movies with ""No Country For Old Men,"" saying that they used the same formula over and over since ""Barton Fink."" Yet, I once again thought, ""This one looks different.""Okay, it's different. No blood or crime sprees. No action of any sort. It's a long character study of a character that isn't very likable, and it doesn't seem that the directors want to present him as likable or redeemable or having any qualities whatsoever.The cameo characters are interesting, but they drift in and out of the movie without much impact at all. What does Llewyn learn from them? Why are they in his life? Reach for your popcorn and you'll miss their appearance at all, leaving nothing.It's a snapshot, much like a complex painting, one that makes you want to know what is driving the characters or how they came to interact, but you aren't given the opportunity to. It's a sorbet, giving just enough information to create a curiosity, but insufficient exploration to learn from knowing them.If you love the Coen Brothers and think they're geniuses who can do no wrong - and evidently much of the art-house crowd is precisely that sort of person - please do go find out what is inside Llewyn Davis. If you want to skip it, look on the back of the movie poster and you'll see the sum total of what is revealed in the actual movie.I too have a peculiar, slavish devotion to art-house cinema. I'm a sucker for off the beaten path, French language, noncommercial, etc. I've seen possibly all Coen Bros films since Barton Fink and they have many moments of brilliance. Perhaps they're now in their Fat Elvis days, riding on their former creativity, or more like their fat Marlon Brando days, clearly once artists but now just confusing author/directors who throw up a performance and expect paying audiences to go see it. Audiences like me. Don't be one of them.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
passionless,"This movie is like a rainy Sunday morning. Slow, mellow, lazy. And, like that morning, the best use of your time is sleeping through it. No kidding.I like most Cohen brother movies. They have their own pacing and usually stay entertaining to the end. Their humor can be surprising in its off-centered way. Their perspective can be almost myopic, but their characters are usually quirky and interesting enough to drive the story. But for some reason I just couldn't find a way to care about the protagonist of this movie. He was far too low key to ever really stir my interest. He was passionless and without drive. I did not share his pain or his triumphs... and that is the kiss of death for a character-driven movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Must be an east coast thing - as a singer/musician, I could not relate","The good: overall very good acting and camera work - with a little Fargo-like feel to it. The bad: the point of the movie seems to be that it is pointless. The Coen brothers have certainly succeeded in convincing me of the latter.The film at first leads us to sympathize with our flawed protagonist (hey, we've been conditioned to like the underdog) but gradually steers us toward overcoming this mistaken instinct, not with a bang but more of a drawn-out whimper. As they say, the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. That is where we end up with our protagonist. Unfortunately, that's also how I also feel about this film: ""meh"".John Goodman's character seemed out of place and contrived, a bit like most of the film. I expected better from the Coen brothers and it's sad to see them rewarded by most reviewers for this subpar, pointless film.Despite other laudatory reviews, this reminds me of that fable, The Emperor Wears No Clothes.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring story about a boring character tols in a boring way,"If it wasn't for the cars, I would have never guessed, that his movie is set in the 60s. The hair, the beards, the surrounding- every second I was expecting someone to put their smartphone out of the pocket. My 90s apartment where I grew up looked more like the 60s than this movie. The whole story with the cat was pointless. Actually the whole story was pointless. I should have known it at the start, when they had a scene with 5 minutes of this guy singing a mediocre song. If I wanted to listen to music, I could have spent my time on youtube. I have to say- I like simple movies, slow movies, artistic movies, movies about artists, I love 60s music, movies with 1 or 2 main characters- but this movie still didn't appeal to me. So how is that possible? With such a badly written character it is. With no interesting dialogue or emotions on this guy's blank face it is. It was like watching twilight for hipsters. Nothing happens- blank face- nothing happens- again blank face.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Meh film of little warmth and compassion,"I have just watched ILD and am disappointed. I generally love the Coen brothers, but this was decidedly lacking. Lacking in anything special, or anything particularly interesting. The film craftsmanship is typically good, well shot, well acted etc, but I did not care too much for the well being of our main character... whether he became homeless, lost the cat, lost his mind, I really did not care. For that, I blame the un likability of Llewyn. I wonder why he did not travel to see his 2 year old child? We go the point, him being a loser, early on, and nothing much else happened. I have seen slower paced films which i found far more engaging, for example, LOCKE, which is fantastic, and features simply a man in a car talking on the phone... for the WHOLE movie. That is way more powerful than this film, and I put that down to a lack of empathy one experiences when following the life of Lewyn Davis. His dilemmas, whether to quit or not, and whether to compromise his art to make money, are universal, but we don't really get INSIDE Lewyn Davis, certainly not enough to really care.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

IMO this is the worst and most pointless Coen Brothers film to date. Actually, this is the only bad film they've made. The story had no direction whatsoever.

Empty Amusement with a Flimsy Script,"Just saw ""Inside Llewyn Davis""...the Coen brothers' latest work. For me, this was barely an ""okay movie"". It's nothing I would ever urge anyone to see. It's empty amusement with a flimsy script. What may have seemed like a good idea in concept turns out to be merely ho-hum upon its execution. With all the music throughout, it's a huge disappointment to hear only mediocre technical recordings of the songs (And the key singers are marginal—especially Justin Timberlake.) Even as a made-for-TV effort it's tawdry. Sure, there are a few expected tricks of the cinematic trade here and there. But over all, this movie gives lip service to the period and the music culture of the time, and rides mainly on the reputation of the Coen brothers--which is why I wanted to see it. It would have been a total waste of time if it were not but to warn you.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you are a professional critic, you will probably love it, if not, there is a good chance you will hate it","I love many of the Coen Brothers movies including Fargo, No Country for Old Men and A Serious Man. They all look like masterpieces compared to this movie.I go to a movie to be entertained and this movie, except for the songs, had almost no entertainment value.If a movie has both a bad story and bad acting, it generally gets bad reviews from the professional critics and nobody goes to see it.If a movie has a bad story but good acting it might get good reviews for the acting, which for many professional reviewers overshadows the need for a good story and entertainment value.To me there is almost no story, except to portray a person devoid of common sense who continues to pursue a dream of becoming a singer while his experiences say that dream is nothing more than a dream. Even when he appears to be heading for a real job as a seaman, his past mistakes in judgment make that very difficult to achieve. Thinking ahead is not part of his mentality.I strongly recommend skipping this movie. Look on Metacritic.com for the user reviews. Currently they are 13 positive, 11 mixed, and 13 negative. But the critic's rating is 92 out of 100. In this case the users were much wiser than the critics.If you want to see a good character study movie, with both a good story and excellent acting, go to see Nebraska. I am no fan of Bruce Dern, but he is outstanding in this movie and you will get your money's worth.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Wow - where was the plot or script-writers here?,"The scene was set very well and some fine actors were in place for what could have been a fine movie with some sort of story or message to be projected to the masses.Instead, we had a movie which went nowhere and came full square back to a deja vu recreation of a previous scene for no reason that I can fathom. Indeed, the earlier scene could very easily have been simply re-run? I thought the reels had been accidentally inserted from earlier in the film? I'm sure those crafty Coen brother's had some message to convey to us all, but do you know, I don't even want to know what it was.I seemed to recall reading somewhere that this may be their last movie collaboration? Enjoy your retirement guys and don't come back!3 out of 10 and that's only for the cinematography and the fine cast who tried to inject life into a life-less project.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
There's nothing inside Llewyn Davis worth seeing,"There are two problems that the Coen Brothers had to overcome in this movie:(1) In any movie with a ""difficult"" protagonist, the screenwriters have to figure out some way to make that character sympathetic. For other movies, the way to do that is to convince the audience that the protagonist is a genius. ""Sure, he's a jerk, but look at what a great artist/musician/actor he is!"" Take, for instance, Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in.""Judy."" Sure, she was difficult and moody and unpredictable and thoughtlessly cruel and most of her problems were self-inflicted, but as a viewer you forgave all of that because she was also an undeniably fantastic performer.Llewyn Davis, on the other hand? Not so much. He's just a mediocre performer living on the edges of the 1960s folk scene. That's not enough to give him carte blanche to act like a dick to everyone around him. Sure, people in the movie say he's a genius, but there's very little actual evidence of that. Which brings us to:(2) There are lots of movies that revolve around the protagonist being a great genius, but when it comes time to display the protagonist's genius, the actual product falls far short. I think there's only one movie, for example, where the characters are supposed to have written a great song which actually turns out to be a pretty good song (""That Thing You Do"").. More often, though, it's like ""Punchline,"" a movie about comedians who we're supposed to think are funny but who aren't.In this movie, we keep hearing about how talented Llewyn Davis is, but when it comes time for him to demonstrate that talent, we get mediocrity rather than genius. It's like if everyone in the movie spoke glowingly about how tall Llewyn Davis is, and then we find out that he's played by Danny DeVito.And those are two really big problems, If you can't convince the audience that there's something to admire about the central character, something that redeems him, then all you're left with is a whinging, pathetic man-child who can't get his life together and who blames everyone else for his failures. Why would I want to watch that?",2.0,Anonymous,Music
What Do You Call a Guitarist without a Girlfriend?  Homeless,"This screenplay seems to extend that joke to a full length film. I'm not sure if the not-so-great music in the film was supposed to be source of heart , or if it was supposed to reflect the losing formula of the character. There seems to be an intention to setup the audience for a moment of character growth for the struggling musician, only to have him turn it down, and continue struggling. These type of depressing films can work if we can sympathise with the main character. Oscar Isaac certainly is a likable actor, but we cannot sympathise at points where he acts like a jerk. I think of a lead character in a film as your friend. Because he's your friend, you will be interested in following his story. But when your friend rejects your advice and starts acting like a jerk around you, you start losing interest in his story.What Coen brothers films are famous for are their side characters. Here we are treated to some fun moments, and strangely unfunny moments. By the third act, the screenplay's intentions become glaringly apparent, we the audience get to experience firsthand the rough life you go through when you are trying to survive when you are homeless. It is a serious subject, and there a multitude of real stories where in a bad economy, people become lost in finding their place in the world. The main reaction I had was that there were moments I could relate to personally, as a person who suffers from depression, so the screenplay successfully accomplishes it's purpose.This film rates far better than ""A Serious Man"", another Coen brothers test that does it's best to defy audience's expectations with things like character development, and a traditional ending. I could appreciate this outing for the reason of the deliberate mood painted in poignant scenes. The expression of depression is well articulated. Going on a road trip with catatonic passengers. Fatally striking a cat with your car. Losing your job. Losing your girlfriend. Your music being rejected. Getting screwed with your old job. Losing your valuables. Like a top ten checklist of anxieties that can keep you up at night. The fact we can find humour in spots shows potential for sympathy, but on the whole I was left not wanting anything to do with a story that had no real heart or insight, like a traditional ending. I guess it was because I still believe an audience deserves some expectations fulfilled when paying to see your film.I'm sure the screenwriter knows the difference. In ""No Country For Old Men"", the screenplay gives you the traditional character arc resolutions in the third act, albeit presented in a idiosyncratic way. Here, Llewyn gives little clue about where he is going, and leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Started nowhere, went nowhere","The only redeeming factor of the film was the music. I love folk music and the songs in this were simply beautiful. However, it lacked a storyline, very much. By the end of the film I felt let down and confused that this was the ending we were given. Nothing had happened and it ended exactly how it started (literally, exactly the same scene, just different camera angles). Throughout the film there were several potential roads the leading man could have taken but he didn't. As I said, the only redeeming factor was the music. The film consisted of several good songs strung together by a lacking, dry storyline and a lot of unnecessary swearing. I'm glad I didn't pay for a ticket for this film, as I have an unlimited card for my local cinema. If I had paid to see it I would have felt immensely let down.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a joyless meditation on some very meaningful music.","1960s folk music had a message and often expressed hope and sometimes even joy. It's too bad that ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (R, 1:45), a movie about a fictional folk singer in the early 60s doesn't seem to understand that.Oscar Isaac plays the title character, a singer with talent who can't quite catch a break. Even when he seems on the verge of something good happening to him, it either doesn't pan out or he blows it up. He keeps on trying to succeed, in spite of it all, but as an audience member, I was hard pressed to root for him. You see, Llewyn is completely self-absorbed and joyless. He floats from couch to couch in New York City, staying with friends until he wears out his welcome and has to move on to the next temporary bed, but rarely expresses gratitude. He even manages to alienate some of the few friends he has. He's also constantly trying to borrow money, insulting friends and family in the process.You'd think that, as hard as he works and as much as he sacrifices for his art that he would have a passion for it, but none is apparent. He never seems to get any pleasure from performing his own music and even gets angry when he is asked to sing a song for friends. The only true friend he has is a cat that keeps popping up in the film, but Llewyn is ambivalent towards the animal, especially when it needs him the most. Things start looking up for Llewyn when he comes into a little cash, which he uses to pay for his share of the gas in a car pool going to Chicago, where he hopes to get a job, but the film doesn't offer a resolution to that part of the story. There doesn't seem to be resolution to much of anything in Llewyn's life, or in this movie.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" features some good covers of original 60s folk music and a bit of new music but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this movie. Oscar Isaac's performance is uninspired (although he does sing several of the songs in the soundtrack) and some great actors (including Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham) are wasted in this film. They're given little to do and don't seem to want to be there. How can a celebration of 60s folk music be so short on celebration? Joel and Ethan Coen, who, as with most of their movies, share writing and directing credits, made their similarly-themed ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" somewhat entertaining, but seem to have had all their fun with that one. There sure isn't any on display in this depressing exercise. It seems to me that almost as bad as actually being Inside Llewyn Davis is being inside a theater showing ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".To be fair, I should point out that some other moviegoers seemed to enjoy this movie very much, although I'm at a loss to understand why. Somehow, this film snagged Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor – Comedy or Musical. I didn't realize that 2013 was such a slow movie year. The film also received a nomination for Best Original Song, but I agree with that one. The scene showing the recording of the whimsical ditty ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" and some of the other music is what's keeping me from giving this flick an ""F"". The most I can give this cinematic dud is a ""D"".",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Didn't Work For Me,"Of the dozen or so Coen brother's movies I've seen, this is my least favorite. The plot can best be described as meandering. It follows the depressing life of an aspiring folk singer, Llewyn Davis, over a period of a few days back in the early sixties. The soundtrack seems to be more important than the plot and boy, what a soundtrack, one depressing folk song after the other.Meanwhile, when he's not singing, we get to see Mr Davis alienate one friend or family member after another. Llewyn has no home and very little money. He depends entirely on the kindness of strangers and acquaintances who aren't angry with him at the moment. He's a jerk who makes fun of other singers while they're performing and who we learn has impregnated two women, paying both times for them to about the fetuses. We also learn his former partner in a duo committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, probably to get away fro Llewyn.I give if 4 stars for the cinematography and the dreary atmosphere it creates.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Credit the cat!,"Other reviewers have suggested that people don't like this film because there's not enough action and pointed out that it's not an action movie. If I wanted to watch an action movie, I wouldn't pick one about a singer-songwriter wandering about 1960s New York. One guy does his girlfriend a disservice by implying she's simply too low-brow to appreciate it, that it doesn't have enough action for her. It's not that she only likes action movies, it's that she doesn't like bad movies. People have written that it's darkly comedic. It isn't. There's nothing funny about this movie. The protagonist, admittedly he's not supposed to be likable, is aimless in a charmless way and really rude to his two benefactors, simply for the chance to flex his artistic temperament. As usual, the Coens have stuck in John Goodman as a completely over the top caricature. They like to stretch credulity. He must surely tire of these roles (like in Death Sentence) but it's all money in the bank I guess. Carey Mulligan does her usual hard-to-like girlfriend act. Justin Timberlake is worth watching as a wholesome folk singer and Garrett Hedlund is wasted as the enigmatic Johnny Five.The Coen brothers still think swearing is hilarious when it hasn't been funny since the beginning of Four Weddings and a Funeral. And Hugh Grant was charming.The cat is by far the best thing in it and doesn't even get credited in the cast. Sensibly, he spends all his time trying to disassociate himself from this ideas vacuum of a movie and disappear from the frame. The cat should get an award, the rest was awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
So what?,"I love the Coen Brothers films, I've seen them all, I love films about people stories...usually I love them, I didn't this time. This time I didn't get it, at all. A very bad week of a looser. So? I had worse weeks in my life than this guy, believe me, do I think those weeks are worth doing a movie about it? No I don't, not really. Yet more, what about the abrupt ending? It plunges the whole film into ""ineffectual story"". I was so looking forward to see this film and I was so very disappointed that, when the film ended I had a moment of serious disbelieve and perplexity. What was the point of this film? Would somebody please enlighten me. The Coens' style is there, but there is nothing else worth watching. Sometimes the ordinary/extraordinary everyday life makes good stories to tell, not this time, nothing interesting in this film to communicate, nothing interesting to watch. In my opinion the worse film the Coen Brothers made, by far and I've been kind because I love them. OK, one bad slip, nothing serious.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Unrewarding,"Generally a fan of Coen brothers films, but this one really missed the mark for me. It was tediously indulgent and the film lacked any characters that you could actually warm to, making sitting through the whole thing laborious. Whether it is the screenplay or the acting/direction, you have a lead character that you simply don't want to get anywhere because he doesn't deserve it. You sit there hoping he is going to get the life kicked out of him in the club so the film can be over.Carey Mulligan and the cat probably put in the most credible performances.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Tell Me Who You Love,"Well, actually no-one in this film. I loved the music though and was the last to leave the cinema - so mesmerised was I. The music took me to a tranquil place in my soul - a place I hadn't visited for ages. It gripped me and I felt so peaceful. But the story? Lame. The characters? Ugly and dull. Totally charmless. I am sure everyone wore beige. I know the Coen Brothers do weird, are weird, that is the hallmark of their films but the protagonist has little appeal unless he's singing. He is either a depressive (please get some help) or was born without a personality (so sorry). Either way, should such a charmless character appear in every scene? In similar fashion to the overrated quietly but definitely depressing and thanks-for-edging-me-ever-nearer-towards-killing-myself-Nebraska, this film is emotionally flat - the opposite of exciting (or as exciting as a hen farting).Unlike the Nebraska protagonist, Llewyn hasn't lost his mind, he has one, I just wasn't emotionally invested in it. He is another loser, and with a personality like his, he will carry on losing. Like his guitar he takes it wherever he goes so no surprise as he courts rejection for the duration. So, as I was saying, everyone's ugly, wears beige or black, the moggy who is orange lends a splash of colour to this otherwise monochrome film. If you go to the cinema, like me, for escapism, this film won't cut it for you. I don't think Llewyn smiles once. Not even ironically or from spite. No smiles here. I don't think anyone actually laughs or smiles in the whole film and that makes for a very dull film in my book. The whole experience was a curious one though (typical Coen Bros), I was bored and depressed for the most part but the music floored me with its beauty. If you're all grown up and miss your dope smoking days, you will be quietly reminded of that mellow high as the music in this film will stir that feeling in your soul but an emotionally moving film this is not.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This emperor has no clothes.,"Some have called it melancholy, I would say dull, lifeless and uninspiring. I'm a big fan of the directors, however this is at best a generous 5/10. The brothers' more recent movies have only offered minority appeal, I'd ask that they start issuing guidance warnings. e.g. 'This movie will only appeal to mid fifties Jewish males who want to laugh at their own shortcomings; once or twice in 90 minutes.'. For a good example of how to do melancholy and still create an appealing and inspiring movie, check out Von Trier's Melancholia. That is a masterpiece. This film is to my mind a little bit of the emperor with no clothes phenomena. Meaning, people feel obliged to praise it because of the directors; not because of the film itself. It may be moody, beautifully filmed and acted. It's still no excuse for such a lack luster overall package.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Not their best,"I'm a big Coen brothers fan. I also knew Dave Van Ronk and the Village scene in the 60s. While I have no problem with the story, I thought the casting and production was terribly lacking. In those excellent films about recording artists, there is an effort to capture the quality and ""voice"", if I may, of the singer. For example, ""Ray"", and ""The Buddy Holly Story"", others come to mind.. Even if you had never seen or heard those performers before, you would recognize them if you did after watching those films.That is not the case here. Oscar Isaac as as much like Dave Van Ronk as Cher is like Aretha Franklin. To me, knowing and sitting with Dave Van Ronk, that is a great disservice to his unique and captivating talent. If this film was just about the folk scene in N.Y. in the 60s, it would be a valuable contribution to the Coen Brothers body of work. But making it about a particular performer, and then ignoring that performer's style, voice, and ability.. it really didn't work for me. (The Clancy Brothers was just abysmal. I can't fault T Bone as I know he had nothing to do with casting; but knowing T Bone's work, I can't help but think he was cringing at these performances.) If you are a Coen Brothers fan and know little of the topic, watch the film. If you are a folk music fan and know the work of the people represented in this film.. perhaps you might want to grit your teeth before wading in.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

So much more depth about the power of music and what if does to those that believe in it and play it. I do t have a lot to say I'm now typing tower the minimum.. I say I u want to to see it get it from redbox. Ur not wasting much money and at least the music is good. The movie feels longer then what it is. T bone Burnett does it again.

What?  No focus on the folk movement's politics?,"A story about a struggling folk singer in Greenwich Village in the early '60s would have to make for a good movie, especially in the hands of the Coen brothers. Somehow, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" doesn't end up as such. The problem is mainly that Llewyn Davis remains a loser and doesn't learn anything from his experiences. But more importantly there's no focus on the folk movement's politics. Their anti-war, pro-Civil Rights stances should be a major focus of any movie about them. This movie is mainly about the main character's crashing on friends' couches while finding time to sing. In the end I was not impressed with it. I guess that I hold the Coens to very high standards, and so when they disappoint, they REALLY disappoint. I don't recommend it.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Blowing with the wind,"Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a guy with a Welsh name who is not going anywhere in the New York folk scene of 1961.Luck is not on his side, the audience do not connect with him and he is full of self loathing. He couch surfs with friends or people he has just met and he can be very rude to people.The film opens with Llewyn singing beautifully in a club, he then gets beaten up outside. By the end of the movie we find out why he was beaten up in this bittersweet tale.Llewyn Davis is in a bit of a mess. His singing partner killed himself. He might had got another woman pregnant. His latest record is not selling and he is on the verge of giving up music. He is lumbered with a cat that has escaped from a house he stayed at, then that goes missing.The Coen brothers give us an initially interesting character study which ultimately falls flat. Isaac gives a beautiful performance. The film has a blue wintery palette. It signifies Llewyn's cold personality and his frosty relationship with life.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
No buzz - good intro to Mr Van Ronk though,"Sadly lacking in buzz this movie. Might it be possible that Greenwich Village in 1961 was an exciting place to be? No sense of that here. Instead a series of cliché characters; light and misplaced spoofing of ""folk"" types - oh what a laugh! with their arran jumpers singing their ""dated"" shanties - This is film-making by numbers and less than I would expect of the Coen Brothers. We've got that cigarette trick. It's 1961 - everybody smokes. Look at them in the Gaslight Cafe. They are all smoking. How quaint! - and heavy-handed. Redeeming features - Sylvia Gauder. Carey Mulligan is good too. Effective plot loop. A mild sense of thwarted artistic endeavour. In general though it's too knowing and measured.Final positive - good to have the introduction to the music of Mr Van Ronk. His rendering of House of the Rising Sun sublime - on Spotify (from Washington Square).",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Avoid if unless you are a huge folk music fan,"I found this movie tedious in the extreme with no story, characters who had little appeal and repetitive music. Unless you happen to love this kind of music you won't be entertained in the least and will regret the time you invested. I'm avoiding the Cohen's movies from now on. The pace of the story was slow to say the least. Most of it consists mainly of lead trying to find somewhere to sleep for the night, driving around and singing or listened to others sing folk songs. These songs mostly sound the same and are depressing. The highlight of the whole thing is a chase for a missing ginger Tom. I really can't think where on earth the positive reviews come from.

"Joel and Ethan, I want my money back","It is hard to believe the same guys who made ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Fargo,"" and several other of the greatest things to touch celluloid could be responsible for this. They should be at the height of their abilities, not misfiring so badly.This is a movie about a jerk, and not in the Steve Martin sense. Davis isn't an anti-hero who does things you secretly wish you could do or has some justification that allows you to understand--if not sympathize--with his behavior. He does not remind you of your quirky friend or relative that is hard to take sometimes but has qualities that make his company tolerable. No, Davis is someone you want to see beat down in the hardest possible way. When you learn early in the film that Davis's partner offed himself, I started to think: I don't blame him. I would too if I had to spend time with this guy. Then I remembered I had paid for the privilege of doing so. At least I enjoyed my popcorn.Movies where there is no compelling plot are called ""character studies."" This isn't even that. It is like ""Men Behaving Badly,"" that goes on too long. Davis's performances and music are not even the best in the film, so you can't call him brilliant but flawed. Just moderately talented but unlikable.90% of the screenplay consists of the words f**k, s**t, and a**h*l*. I'm not a prude about foul language, but its just lazy writing if this is the meat of your dialog rather than the spice.What makes it worse is that the early 60's folk scene is such an interesting time with incredible characters and stories.

Coen Brothers Flop,"Easily the worst Coen brothers movie ever conceived and made. The first hurdle you will need to overcome is that this movie has no look or feel of the 60's whatsoever. Music is quite good at times but that's about all there is to enjoy here and those scenes are too widespread. The main character Oscar Isaac is an idiot who uses people and can't even watch a cat properly. The entire cast is given parts and lines that insult the viewer by going to extremes to make a point. The dialogue was cringe worthy and I'm not exaggerating. Carey Mulligan's part is a one dimensional nag who takes no responsibility for her own actions but acts superior putting others down. There's an irony here. The Coens have made a typical mainstream movie to appeal the dumbed down populace, forgoing their edgy themes and unique film structure including wildly imaginative and unforgettable characters. Instead we get scene after scene of mind achingly dull and contrived situations with characters you would like to injure if given a chance. If you can get past John Goodman's ridiculous role then you could probably watch anything under the sun. The main character of this movie in a sense has done the same thing. He supposedly sees himself as a good musician, and he may very well be. I actually really liked the songs he played. But the way he preaches about the business he's in and the overblown role he has in it rings pathetically hollow/fake. A thoroughly unenjoyable annoying film that does not please, satisfy, or go anywhere. Just recalling this movie makes me want to write a not so nice letter to the Coens, and John Goodman as well. He took a role that was poorly conceived to begin with and turned it into a disaster. When he entered what was already a mess of a film my interest plummeted. Bunch of arrogant pretentious fools wandering aimlessly accomplishing nothing. Really brilliant.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Everyone I know that's a Coen Brothers fan has their favorites and their disappointments. I loved Burn After Reading, A Serious Man, Miller's Crossing, Oh Brother Where Art Though, The Hudsucker Proxy, Fargo, Raising Arizona, The Man Who wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty & The Big Lewbowski. Movies like No Country for Old Men or Blood Simple and Barton Fink I recognize as quality films but not my personal taste. In terms of drama or Dark Comedy.
Then there are bad films that get credit because it's a Coen Bros Film. I walked out of the theater after 30 minutes, There remakes have been horrendous Specifically The Lady Killers, & True Grit..Then just overwhelming disappointment with Hail Caesar. The more I go over the chronology they have not put out a noteworthy film A serious Man...and I saw a review paralleling this excuse for a film with A serious Man...
A film with a continuous solid story line, phenomenal comedic moments, and excellent dialogue to this film?
Anyone that loved this movie isn't any different than the Woody Allen lunatics that feel every movie he made was brilliant and if not, then misunderstood.

Fails To Entertain,"So I think this movie is saying that terrible people can be capable of beautiful art. It spends its time following around a folk singer bumming through Manhattan. He gets his friend's girlfriend pregnant, he sleeps at other peoples' apartments, he treats people poorly, and then he gets on stage and sings nicely. That's it. When the movie ended, I decided I hadn't really cared about anything I'd watched, and I wasn't especially taken by its message, either. Are the filmmakers trying to excuse themselves for something they've done by making a movie about the redeeming qualities of art? It's kind of like what Woody Allen seemed to be saying with Deconstructing Harry. But the bottom line was that there weren't any very entertaining moments.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Prepare for a whole lot of nothing.,"I was genuinely excited about watching this. I mean, everything about it seemed so interesting. I had my fingers crossed that it would be something really great. So, I finally watched it and... it was unbelievably disappointing, maybe my expectations were too high i guess... But still, it was really underwhelming.The thing is, the story doesn't work. No character arc, no ending and basically, nothing happens at all to anybody. The story just goes nowhere - it just goes here and there with nothing interesting ever happening. Nothing much seemed to take place throughout the entire film. It left me uninterested because it was just so pointless. I was constantly waiting for something, anything really, to grab my attention but it never did. I'm actually surprised that I made it all the way through without turning it off.The characters were just so unlikable and one-dimensional, even the main guy Llewyn. He was such a self-destructive loser, an a-hole that it was hard to care about him at all. Llewyn stayed the same guy from start to finish - a self-involved mope who didn't seem to want to change. There were several potentials he could have taken to improve his situation but he didn't. I wish they would have made him a little more sympathetic or given him some character growth, just so his story wasn't so bleak but I guess that's the point of the whole story, though.Let's set aside the negatives and focus on the positives. All of the actors were great, Oscar Isaac on the other hand, did a great job. That guy can sing! Seriously, He got a great voice and I loved all his musical performances throughout the movie and about the songs, many of them were so soothing and relaxing to listen to, it was really nice. Some of them were stuck in my mind. I couldn't shake them off. They played on repeat, like a broken record, in my head. Basically the only thing keeping me awake during this movie. The cinematography was simply outstanding, completely set the right atmosphere the whole time. It was gorgeous, loved the mood. Nothing else too add, just tired as hell, more tired than a newborn.While this was sounds controversial, I'm just being honest here. I don't wanna pretend that I liked it, because, well, I didn't. However, I don't think it wasn't that bad either. There's a lot to unpack here, maybe I'm missing something, maybe if I give it another chance, I might actually appreciate it more. Things might change, who knows, maybe.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Stuck in the middle of nowhere,"Well this is my first review, and the reason I'm writing it is I'm really disappointed with this movie.I've seen all Coen's bros works and I can tell you this is the worst, by far. It's not just that folk music's not everybody's cup of tea, is just that apart from the mellifluous folk songs (which I admit I hate) there is nothing. The main character is nor good or bad: things just happen to him, the most going the wrong way, but no tragedies either. And you can just have a laugh or two, but the movie is not going deeper than that.Many say this movie is close to ""A serious man"", but while there we assisted to the personal crisis of a man's beliefs and values, here the main character is going nowhere, is stuck in the middle of nowhere: you leave him exactly the way you found him and knowing little more about him and about what he really feels. In facts, he shows no values or believes at all, good or evil ones. I'd say more: while you can easily watch and enjoy ""A serious man"" without knowing anything about Jewish culture and traditions, it's really hard to enjoy ""Inside Llewin Davis"" without liking folk or indie rock music. Because this movie is definitely a musical one, seen that there are more tunes here that in ""The sound of music"".So being this not one of Coen's ""serious"" movies, of course not one of Coen's ""funny"" movies, the plot being not the reason to watch it and being the photography the only enjoyable thing, I should say this is one to avoid, suitable just for Coen maniacs and indie rock freaks.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Disappointing and over-rated,"The title character is a struggling folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village in the early 1960s. His many troubles lead him to bum favours off many people. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is directed by the Coen brothers.This film has a handicap like other recent films such as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Blue Jasmine"" - the main character is very unlikeable. The other films have various strengths to overcome and rise above this handicap but this is not the case with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".Though Oscar Isaac does well in the main role, his character is hard to take for various reasons. Despite his desperate situation, he lives in the delusion that he is superior to those who don't share his bohemian lifestyle aspirations. He also shows little or no gratitude to those who do great favours for him.As his journey includes negative karma hitting home (in typical Coen schadenfreude fashion) with only a few moments of humour and warmth, this makes for difficult viewing. He's not all bad. Some scenes do show signs of a deeper humanness but they are too few. The other characters don't fare much better. The only characters that might generate empathy are cats.With little humour or charm to lighten the ride, thankfully the music is the most uplifting part of this film. Isaac is a superb singer and he performs great songs beautifully as do the film's other musicians. The film could also be given credit for using cinematography and other aspects to recreate an era long gone.There are living folk singers who remember the time and place depicted in this film. They have criticized this movie for failing to convey the warmth and friendliness that were a part of this scene.

"ambling, watchable movie","Historically I have enjoyed the Coen Brothers comedies and have been underwhelmed by their dramas. I didn't know which one this was before I watched it, but I'd say it's either a fitfully amusing drama or a dour, not especially funny comedy. Whichever it is, I found it watchable, but not really engrossing.I didn't hate the character as my girlfriend did (she found him repellent in every way and hated the movie). Sure, Llewyn is aimless and drifting, uncharismatic, a bit of a user, and prone to violent outbursts, but as someone who used to play in folk clubs I had some sympathy for his frustration. And really, most of the characters in the movie aren't likable, so in the film's world he's not really that bad.This is a musical, as the movie's songs are generally sung all the way through. It's mainly traditional songs sung pretty well, but there's not much excitement to it and the songs often feel long. I also feel that, in order to emphasize the end, they insist on only pretty, serious singing, although there were rawrer singers at that time like Pete Seeger and Rambling Jack Elliot. It felt like the movie wanted to make an untrue point for reasons of its own.My girlfriend almost decided to give up on this one, stuck with it because John Goodman was interesting in a fairly small part, and then felt it was too late to stop. I never particularly felt like turning it off, but I was never especially engrossed in the story. I wouldn't recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Yawn.,"I guess everyone expects a masterpiece from Coen brothers. In most cases it is true. This one, however, is not one of such. Story (story?) is pretty weak and I guess only an orange cat stands out. The main character does not. Now, to be honest, cinematography and cast performances are extraordinary. Coen brothers know how to make a movie, even if it is back-grounded with such a shallow story (story?). To me this movie has neither a beginning nor an end. It is just an excerpt from a life of a musician (and an orange cat). Long line of brief conversations and wandering around. Depressing at its best moments. Probably this would mean something to an American who was struggling to find his/her place on the stage in the depicted period, but to majority of the audience it's simply boring. Slow paced cat movie with some singing and guitar playing. Well made, though. Someone may even call it ""artistic"". But that's it. Nothing to write home about.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Even most of the interactions end up making sense.Now never along the movie I felt any empathy towards the main character, justifying some of the attitudes on the death of his partner is too much of a long shot for me and a common thing in movies somehow that not being mentally/emotionally well is a freebie to be kind of a jerk to others, he ends up just being rude in some moments of the movie, and if there was a context for him to be like that with some of the characters than the build up could have been better and only once it was understandable for me his behavior. It seems the character is never really in its own story, maybe it was what it was intended but the execution might have been better in my opinion.TL:DR not the worst movie I have ever seen, neither it was the biggest masterpiece ever made, if you like folkish music it can at least entertain you for a while.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Scenes which should invoke emotions seems silly and most of the character defining moments are just kinda dull. I would almost say that the whole movie plot would work better adding intentional comedy and make the movie more silly intentionally.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coens' Coldest,"Maybe I just didn't get it. Maybe somewhere in the hour and forty-five minutes of Inside Llewyn Davis was a masterpiece that I overlooked. I know for sure, though, that my overall impression of it finally rested on overlong, meandering, boring, pointless, and pretentious.Llewyn Davis (a very good Oscar Isaac) is a loser. Most characters in the film have another word for it, but we will go with loser. He's stuck in a dead-end situation: trying to make a living as a folk singer in the over-crowded Greenwich Village scene of 1961. He has some serious talent, but he also fails to connect with his audience on a personal level, a sentiment pointed out to him throughout the movie. He is surrounded by others who seem to be much better human beings and perfectly capable performers, but Llewyn consistently dismisses them all as beneath him. Until he needs to crash on their respective couches.You see, Llewyn is basically homeless. And penniless. There are no royalties coming in from his last record, recorded as part of a folk duo. His partner committed suicide, and now Llewyn is stuck pushing a solo record to no avail. He has recently had sex with best friend Jim's (Justin Timberlake) girlfriend Jean (an equally unpleasant Carey Mulligan), and the baby she carries may or may not belong to Llewyn. They casually trade insults at each other while nonchalantly discussing the abortion they both decide she must undergo.Once Llewyn runs out of open couches, he hits the road to Chicago, where he hopes to land a gig at a prominent club. He is joined by arrogant and condescending jazz man Roland Turner (John Goodman) and his quiet drifter of a valet, Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund). This sequence is where Inside Llewyn Davis, which starts strong against all odds, slows to a grinding and infuriating stand-still. The 20-25 minutes depicted of the mostly-silent car ride to Chicago serves little purpose for the overall story. Neither Turner nor Johnny Five matter in the long run, and they certainly don't teach us any more about our main character than we already know.Yet, we continue on with Llewyn. He is consistently kicked around by life, and he consistently kicks around everyone who tries to help him out. He rejects an offer to join a trio, presumably because he is either too hurt by his partner's suicide or simply too headstrong to share the spotlight, or both. He cares more about finding a runaway cat that he inadvertently let slip out than he does consoling the woman who may be bearing his child. And that pretty much sums up Inside Llewyn Davis. There is no arc to the story; indeed, the Coen brothers choose to tell a circular narrative, where one of the final scenes chronologically is presented at the front of the picture. By the time we come full circle, it is hard to care too much for Llewyn's fate.Yet even here, the brothers Coen refuse to conform to such silly things as closure or resolution. If you've seen the final minutes of their Oscar-winner No Country for Old Men you'll have a feel for the type of ending they employ here. Like No Country, the Coens try to make Llewyn's week-long odyssey an existential search of some sort. Unlike No Country, there are no characters that anchor us in anything real or emotional. Inside Llewyn Davis is as cold and distant as the wintry drive from New York to Chicago, and ultimately one of the biggest letdowns of the awards season.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Contrived Coen Creation,"Inside Llewyn Davis is a depressing comedy, a glimpse into a struggling folk singer's life during one week in the 1960's.The first half of the movie is slow as Llewyn ping pongs around the Village and New York, causing disruption everywhere he goes. Oscar Isaac unflinchingly plays the dislikeable title character; a sincere to a fault, because it impedes upon his ability to be successful, freeloading folk singer newly solo due to the suicide of his duo partner Mike. Frustrated, dejected and broke, he leaves on a road trip to Chicago and the story's components converge to a chaotic culmination one expects from an Ethan and Joel Coen film.Teeming with talent and thoroughly Coen, the movie is full of quirky characters of a beatnik persuasion. Unfortunately, with the rare exception, most portrayals are forgettable – Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, and Garret Hedlund included. Justin Timberlake is ultimately the least successful of the bunch and his casting is a misstep. His acting is an out of place self-aware parody of a folk singer from the 1960′s. With the exception of Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, whom most know as the love interest of Lena Dunham's character in Girls, is hilariously sincere and scene stealing in the minor role of Al Cody.Inside Llewyn Davis contains all the successful ingredients typical of a Coen Brothers motion picture but is lacking the charm that typically enamors viewers. It is artificially bleak, reliant upon post-production, and fundamentally contrived.Our website contains more movie and film reviews.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A journey with no destination,"The concept is well-known, a young and aspiring artist who wants to make it big. In Barton Fink, it was Hollywood. In Inside Llewyn Davis, it's the '60s folk scene in Greenwich Village. The land of opportunity, you might say, but not quite. For every Bob Dylan, there is a dozen of Llewyn Davis. Poor, homeless, facing the merciless winter and an endless wave of bad luck (incuding among others a missing cat, a hitch-hiking that goes wrong, unexpected pregnancies and births, a suicide).In the end, the narrative comes full circle and so does the journey of Llewyn Davis, who is trapped in a lonely, existential nightmare without any way to escape, unable to fulfill his dream, but unable to leave it behind as well. He is a fascinating figure nonetheless. The sum of his character traits should make him rather unlikable, deep down he isn't that interested in making a career or establishing any sort of personal relationship with another human being, he lacks the drive and settles for the easy solution, but somehow the audience roots for him.Great job, as usual, in capturing the atmosphere of the era and the artistic movement. And of course the accompanying music should be appreciated by any fan of the genre - not me.Nice balance between drama and comedy, with healthy doses of subtle yet highly effective humour despite the overall dark content.Fantastic performance by Oscar Isaac.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Ballad of Llewyn Davis,"The Coen Brothers' 'Inside Llewyn Davis' follows struggling musician Llewyn Davis, a one-hit wonder that 'faded into oblivion' after the suicide of his singing partner. He's been performing at gigs, as second fiddle , if he's lucky enough but Davis is about to reach that point of realization that his dreams will only be a dream and the lack of stability in his life (no home, no job, no real friends and not even a proper family) will only push him further into darkness.The film falls on the lines of 'A Single Man'. Here the viewer is accompanied by some fine music and some suitably awful songs. Moreover, the director duo also create a gloomy but equally intriguing atmosphere set in 1961. It's also darkly comic. All the other people Llewyn meets throughout the film are losers too. The only difference is that Llewyn has pretty much lost everything except his love for music while the others lead a relatively more secure life that is equally, if not more, empty.Oscar Isaac finally gets a role that allows him to showcase his abilities as an actor. He is well supported by John Goodman and Cary Mulligan. The only bad performance comes from Justin Timberlake. He is awful but thankfully he's only there for a limited time.Whimsical and atmospheric, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' works as both a character study and mood piece. It's lyrical in style and dark in tone but subtle in humour.",,Anonymous,Music
Excellent movie,"British SF drama ""Ex Machina"" led me here because of charismatic actor Oscar Isaac who was quite unforgettable, so I decided to check out what else he did. It turned out he was not a newcomer, but had already been awarded for his work in this movie directed by Cohen brothers. ""Inside Llewyn Davis""is re-creation of New York's Greewich Village music scene in early 1960s but not as seen trough just some any nostalgic, rose-tinted glasses - where others might have chosen to present it as a sunny beehive full of pot, enthusiasm and brotherhood, we see it here as a struggle between young musicians and industry that mercilessly exploits them. ""I don't see any money here"" says famous producer (F. Murray Abraham) after one heartbreaking audition and just like folk club's owner Max Casella, he doesn't care for music or the facts that musicians are obviously hungry and wet, money talks and folk music might just be the next trend. I happened to like the atmosphere shown here: cold, windy and rainy streets where the snow beats upon starving musicians, underground and coffee bars as the places to warm up, hunt for a friends with couch (or floor) to spend the night... it all feels very realistic and possible, very far removed from idealistic vision of love & peace, camaraderie and togetherness. This is a struggle and constant compromise between art and commercialism (see hilarious studio recording of novelty song that is obviously prostitution but brings some money in).Main character is Oscar Isaac and he is brave enough to be unlikable. That he might be great talent is almost besides the point, he refuses to be nice to people, insults them and lash out of frustration when hosts expect him to sing after dinner. Time and time again we quietly root for him, though odds are really against him and at the very end, on the same night when he is supposed to finally get a break, we get a glimpse of another performer, a certain guy from Minnesota and this is when we understand Isaac might be just another hopeful who perhaps never made it. For every successful star, there were thousands who slipped in oblivion or simply gave up the fight with the windmills. The rest of the cast is mostly used as cameo roles (excellent John Goodman, unexpected Justin Timberlake and sweetly green Stark Sands) and there are lot of people who find inclusion of the cat as something symbolical, though I am a bit wary of searching for deep meanings since the movie is quite heavy already.",,Anonymous,Music
Can the Coens ever go mediocre (Ans: Never!!!),"Well, finally got to watch this one on the big screen.A pure breath of fresh air, though I do confess, some of the happenings, esp. the aspect with the Deja Vu, left me nonplussed. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd like to have known what transpired before Llewyn goes 'Au revoir' - know what I'm saying?The movie itself is narrated like a saga (the name of the cat holds a clue to one of the Coen bros' references), and has the Coen bros. style all over, albeit subtle. Carey Mulligan is fanta-fabulous in 3 of her scenes, and Oscar Isaac IS Llewyn. He croons with the best of them, and acts his socks off, and being snubbed at the awards must have been immensely painful. I've enjoyed watching him in Drive, Sucker Punch etc., but this shows how far his range can actually expand to.My pick for the Best Movie of 2013.My fav tracks - 500 miles, Hang me O hang me, Please Mr. Kennedy, Fare thee well.......",,Anonymous,Music

Snubbed by Oscar,"I will never understand the Academy Awards. Even if I live to be 100 years old and study their choices every day I will never ever in my life understand the Oscars. I just don't get what their process is. Who are these people and how do they choose? I am pretty much convinced at this point that their number one interest as far as choosing nominees in the big categories (picture, director, actor, actress, writing) is that it should be a movie that grossed a lot of money since the Oscars really are about Hollywood advertising themselves to the masses. Great films get snubbed every year. Oscar turned in a great performance in this movie and it should easily have been nominated for writing, directing and or picture, but it was overlooked. This isn't the best film every but it's definitely better than some of the movies they did choose. The other problem is they give nods to people who they snubbed previously and realize they shouldn't have (i.e. Martin Scorcese for his movie Wolf, Leo Dicaprio for acting since he has never won, even though Wolf isn't nearly as good a movie as this). Oh well maybe next year!",,Anonymous,Music
Didn't Get It,"I'm not sure what all the talk was about this movie. I love the Coen Brothers, but I just didn't get this one. I kept waiting for it to click, like so many of their movies, but this one I just kept waiting and waiting and it never clicked. Maybe it was over my head? Maybe I need to watch it again, but I really don't want to.",,Anonymous,Music
An interesting one-man show,"Oscar Isaac is great, whose performances in this film is pivotal. The whole film centers around his titular role and the character development is pretty successful. The plot is disposable but quite consistent. It is like an anthology film. The music is not bad. Oscar Isaac gives both great musical performances and emotional performances.",,Anonymous,Music
