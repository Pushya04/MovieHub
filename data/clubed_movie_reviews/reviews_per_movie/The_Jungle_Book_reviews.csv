The jungle book,"The Jungle Book, one of Disney's ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. I'll admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my fav's though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the fun-loving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and won't rest 'till he kills him.Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the ""bear"" necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that we've all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disney's most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldn't be surprised if he was Scar's inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you haven't seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, it's worth the money. It's a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, it's a good time.

"BAGHEERA: ""It's Not funny!"" I agree (to an extent) but that is Not all I think of this film trusst me!","From the very first minute that Walt Disney conceived of ""The Jungle Book"" he promised for the sakes of general audiences that he'd absolutely Pile Rudyard Kipling's classic book with energetic, toe-tapping, show-stopping music and unforgettable crazy songs though many people around him had doubts for the original novel was apparently quite serious. Throughout his entire career he had proved so many critics and members of his crew wrong, that he Could enhance the familiar yet ageing qualities of the original tellings of many of the world's most beloved classic books by putting his own magical, musical, charming, ambitious nature into them and would then transfer his versions onto film. Not once had he failed to prove the world and the world's opinions wrong in all his life and ""The Jungle Book"" was no exception. It's got to be his own happiest, most carefree, most musical adventure movie to date! I haven't read the book yet because I don't even have it though I do have a shortened Ladybird book of it but I haven't read that so I can't judge any inaccuracies or changes to the story but I'm positive there are some alterations - all for the best, of course. I must say that Mowgli is quite rebellious here and impudent. He's always running away when things don't go his way, I've noticed he hits and threatens a lot of his friends and yet they still like him! Baloo is - as everyone sees him - so lovable and kind. For the first time in a Disney film, Sterling Holloway provides the voice for a villain - the murderous Kaa the python snake. For a happy-go-lucky cartoon, I think it's unpleasant how a bonkers snake could randomly get a little boy into his deadly coyles (at night at one point), hypnotize him and prepare to eat him! But at least Mowgli gets the last laugh by causing the python to have a knotted tail and shifting him off his tree. My favourite dance number has got to be with King Louis of the Apes in the ancient ruins (""I Wanna Be Like You"") and how all the crazy dancing sends the ruins tumbling. My second favourite is ""Bare Necessities"". In my opinion, the part where the mildly poor comedy comes in most of all is with Colonol Haithi and his elephants and his whiny wife; poor Verna Felton had Winifred the elephant as her final role on film. Colonol Haithi is supposed to be a no-nonsense, snooty leader but my eyes (and ears come to think of it) tell me that he is just a totally absurd loud-mouth. If there is any character in this film who won't stand for any nonsense it's Bagheera! I know that all he really wants is for Mowgli to be safe and therefore return to the man-village but he was certainly a miserable old busybody after the King Louis scene. He had the cheek to break up that special bond between Mowgli and Baloo that so many people have grown to love! Charming! Recently, I bought the twin DVD release of the Platinum Edition of ""The Jungle Book"" from Woolworths and it was just amazing! Better than most Disney DVDs today (even though they're not bad themselves)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
this movie's a legend,"It isn't completely faithful to the book, but for a good reason. The book has bits that you can't have in an animation. The animation is beautiful, the backgrounds rich in colour, and the characters beautifully drawn. The story is a very simple one, yet effective, and allows the songs and characters to take force. The songs and music by the Sherman Brothers perfectly match the breeziness of the film, with classics such as "" Bare Neccessities"" and ""Wanna Be like you"". Unlike some people, I liked the vulture barbershop, excellent harmonies. And what a talented voice-cast. Phil Harris was hilarious as Baloo, and Sebastian Cabot was brooding as Bagheera. Reitherman's son was good as Mowgli, and Louis Prima(who's not black so the racist overtones idea is ridiculous) was a riot as Louis. The real star was the perfectly cast George Sanders as the frightening and calculating Shere Khan. This is fantastic, if a little short, and avoid the sequel! 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animated feature of Disney's golden era - and what a killer soundtrack!,"There aren't many animated Disney films I don't like, basically every single one of them until the end of the seventies was amazing. But for me, this is the one which stands out.Sadly, Disney himself never got to see the finished film (he died during the production), but this is one he would have been proud of. Crafted beautifully and with attention to every little detail, from the way the different animal species move to the colorful jungle backgrounds.Wolfgang Reitherman has directed some of the studio's best - but here he has created his masterpiece. Outstanding animation, fantastic characters - and what a killer soundtrack.A joy for every generation to discover anew (my 9-year old nephew currently has a bit of a Shere Khan fixation), I guess I will never outgrow this timeless classic. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Compulsory viewing,"In case you're wondering, I'm 25 and my favourite films of all time include Heat, Once Upon a Time in the West and Apocalypse Now. This is just a pointer to how, considering the film I'm writing about, eclectic a true film fan's taste has to be. I'll start with one statement: this film should be compulsory viewing for every child. If, at the end of this film, you're face is not permanently disfigured from smiling, there's something wrong with you. Everything about this film is enjoyable. The characters so loving, the songs so memorable; everything is so uplifting. I first saw this as a child and right then I loved it, but not until you reach a certain age do you realise how much a film can affect you. Every character has something about them that you cannot fail to love. Baloo and King Louie are obvious - they are there for light relief, but even the sinister Kaa the snake and Sheer Khan the tiger are lovable in their own ways. Mainly I put this down to the voice cast and the way they portray their characters. Everybody with a good knowledge of film knows that Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in Toy Story and that Mike Myers was Shrek, but who knows who provided the voice of Baloo? It shouldn't matter and, as is the case with The Jungle Book, it doesn't. The characters are what is important. Character and plot are the only things that matter in great films and this film has that theory at its bedrock. If you have a child, sit them down to watch this and I guarantee they will be transfixed. I'm 25 and I make sure I watch this every 12 months. Age wise I'm an adult, but I'm still a child when I see this on screen, and that's the way it should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well Done Disney Animation,"This was the last cartoon feature Disney was directly involved with before his death, and it is one of his better films. The animation appears a bit dated, in large part because it appears to use the Xeroxing method, but that doesn't detract from the great story Disney had created, or the voice actors who add life to this movie. The film's standout is obviously Phil Harris as Baloo the Bear. A veteran of old time radio, such as ""The Jack Benny Show,"" Harris brought his comic talents to the fore and provided a very lively portrayal of happy-go-lucky, free-spirited lovable oaf, which is a welcome contrast to the cute anthropomorphic animals Disney had a penchant for in ""Bambi,"" ""Cinderlla,"" and ""Dumbo."" The guy who does the voice of King Louie is also great, as is Sterling Holloway as the goofy villain Kaa; you might remember Holloway better as the original Winnie the Pooh. The Sherman Brothers did very well with lots of good songs, such as ""I Want to be Like You"" and ""Bare Necessities"" This is a great animated film for the whole family to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's Most Memorable Movies,"The Jungle Book is one of Disney's most memorable animated movies. It's based on the ""Mowgli"" stories by Rudyard Kipling (who also wrote the famous Just So Stories). Like in most Disney films, Mowgli is an orphan. Bagheera the panther find him and he is raised by a family of wolves. That is until Shere Khan the tiger comes back to the jungle...One thing I love about The Jungle Book is the villains. In most Disney movies you have one villain, sometimes with stupid and funny sidekicks who get bossed around all the time. But The Jungle Book offers three villains all who want Mowgli all for themselves. There is King Louie the king of the monkeys. He kidnaps Mowgli but doesn't really want to harm him, which perhaps makes him the least cruelest of the three. All he wants is to be like man as he puts it in the wonderful song that will want to make you get up and dance: ""I Wanna Be Like You"". More specifically he wants to know the secret on how to make fire. Then there's Shere Khan, the tiger who comes back to the jungle and is the reason that Bagheera and the wolves (and eventually Baloo) want to take him back to the ""man village"". Shere Khan is very swift and cruel but also very calm about his cruelty and not the least bit temperamental. However his characteristics do change at his last screen appearance, and frankly I'd be freaking out to if I had a burning branch stuck to my tail (heck I'd freak out if I just had a tail). Shere Khan hates mankind and of course Mowgli is man. Last but definitely not least (my favorite of the three)- Kaa, the snake, and a very big one I might add. See- King Louie wants to be like Mowgli, Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli and Kaa wants to... eat Mowgli. He has a very big mouth which would enable him to eat Mowgli but it does him bad too- he talks to much and then never gets the chance to eat Mowgli.Other than these three memorable villains there's Mowgli himself, the man-cub (who by the way was voiced by Bruce Reitherman, son of the director of this film- and many other Disney greats: Wolfgang Reitherman). There's the elephants, the vultures (who are actually nice and quite humorous too), Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther. Songs include King Louie's (who was voiced by Louie Parma) ""I Wanna Be Like You"". Kaa's ""Trust in Me"" (which no one should... trust in Kaa that is). And of course Baloo's ""The Bare Necessities"".As for the racist overtone- that's one of the silliest things I've heard. The Jungle Book can be enjoyed by anyone of any age (...and any race).",,Anonymous,Animation
fun collection of characters,"Bagheera the black panther finds a baby boy in a basket. He brings him to be raised by mother wolf. Years later, the tiger Shere Kahn returns to their part of the jungle and threatens to kill the man-cub. The pack decides to send the man-cub back to a man-village with the help of Bagheera. The boy isn't happy to leave the jungle. On the way, he encounters elephants led by Colonel Hathi, orangutans, Kaa the python and the irresponsible fun-loving bear Baloo.It's a fun collection of memorable animal characters. The plot is a little random but I don't think that matters too much in this movie. Compared to its other Disney cohorts, this ranks slightly lower than the classics. The story just isn't that compelling. On the other hand, 'The Bare Necessities' is a great song and there is a childlike joy that permeates much of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is what springs to mind when I think Classic Disney,"The thing that usually makes me a hard sell with Disney movies is that they're synonymous with musicals Something like ""Beauty and the Beast"" overcomes this with no problem. At the other end of the spectrum is (ugh) ""The Lion King"". And then, there's ""The Jungle Book"", which is the gold standard, if you ask me. These are the kinds of songs you find yourself humming in the halls at work; I mean, really, can you think of a more pleasing ear worm than ""The Bare Necessities""?It's not just the outstanding soundtrack, but the general upbeat mood this movie strikes. To this day, I love the back-and-forth between Baloo and Bagheera, and King Louie's sequence has to be some of the most fun you can have with one of these movies. Throw in the Beatles vultures and you've got an array of memorable characters.The whole thing's just a treat.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Great Movie For Kids,"Watching this as a middle-aged adult, I found out, was a far cry from seeing this as a very young adult, or as a kid. When I last saw it about 10 years ago, it was okay but nothing like I had remembered. It not only wasn't as funny as I had remembered, but it dragged a bit.It's still a nice, harmless film in which even the villains - the snake and tiger - weren't too evil or frightening. Thus, little kids should be okay with this. Actually, they should love this film.The movie is known for its theme song, ""The Bare Necessitites,"" a catchy tune that is still fun to hear. Phil Harris, as """"Baloo,"" does a great job with that song. There are other fine songs here as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Kipling stories were 200 per cent better,"Like someone else who wrote a review of this film, I saw this at a drive in way back in the late 1960s and I, too, was displeased. I was only a kid, but kids know good art and bad art. It was too commercialized, and I sensed this. So what if Louis Prima sang some of the numbers? I did not know Louis Prima from Adam because I was not a sophisticated grown up. All I knew was the movie lacked heart.The only good that came of my seeing this film was becoming interested in reading the original works by Rudyard Kipling. The difference was like night and day between the deep thoughts expressed in Kipling's stories of Mowgli and the Disney version. It also kind of soured me on all subsequent Disney movies, which even Pocahontas could not fully cure.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

An animated classic with some great songs,"This classic Disney animation, based on the story by Rudyard Kipling, tells the story of Mowgli; a young boy who was raised by wolves after being found in the Indian jungle as a baby. He has been with the wolves for ten years when news of Shere Khan, the man-hating tiger's, return to that part of the jungle reaches the pack. It is decided that for Mowgli's safety he must be returned to the man-village; Bagheera, a panther, volunteers to take him. On the way they meet various dangers as well as some friendly creatures; most notably a sloth bear named Baloo.This film is a lot of fun with a combination of a simple but solid story; enjoyable characters and a variety of catchy songs. 'The Bare Necessities' and 'I Wanna Be Like You' may be the best known of the songs but the others are pretty good too; especially 'Trust In Me', sung by Kaa the hypnotic python. The story contains elements that are mildly threatening but these are balanced by the comedy and songs. The characters are great; I particularly liked Baloo and the way he was portrayed with a John Wayne like drawl; and Kaa's hypnotic stare and hissing voice. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all top notch. One or two gags might have dated a little... today's children might not spot that a quartet of vultures are based on The Beatles but that doesn't matter as the characters are still funny. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic film to viewers of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What racist overtones? Don't jump to conclusions....,"It may interest readers of these reviews that the voice actor who played King Louie is not in fact black.If you follow this helpful link right here at imdb ( http://us.imdb.com/Name?Prima,%20Louis ), you'd find that Louis Prima is in fact white, and was quite well known at the time for his musical repertoire, of which the song ""I Wanna Be Like You"" is a prime example. I don't think he was chosen for that role because of how 'black' he sounded, but rather for his musical abilities, and how that fit into the character of King Louie.As with all the other voice actors chosen for this film, Walt Disney made perfect choices.... so much so that the film works perfectly: animation, voices and story all mesh together perfectly to make one of his best films, precisely because it *is* so simple, yet effective.No need for fancy computer graphics here.",,Anonymous,Animation
Cute little movie,"There's not a lot to this 75 minute movie. The plot is rambling, and in spite of its brevity, it drags a little in the middle. But overall it's quite entertaining. The best scene is Louis Prima singing I Want to Be Just Like You (I knew the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy version, and was surprised to learn it was a Disney song).The acting is very solid, except for whoever voices the kid. The animation is pretty good, although Disney wasn't at its best design-wise in the 60s (or 70s). It's amusing and has a couple of nice songs.I was a kid when this came out, so there's a chance I saw it at the time, but if so, it didn't stick with me. And it won't stick with me this time.

It doesn't get any better than this.I give this one 10/10 without a second thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superb character animation,"The tiger, the panther, the snake and the orang-utan may be the best animated animals the screen has seen - and the bear isn't bad, either.  In a way it's the last great fling of Disney's old veteran animators.  (Most of them were still some distance from retirement, but never again did they fire so magnificently, all at once.)  Anyone who appreciates fine character animation HAS to see this.  Despite the rough outlines favoured by Wolfgang Reitherman (he presided over some extreme cheese-paring after Walt Disney's death), there's also a sumptuous feel to this film, at least while they stay in the jungle.The lack of a story is a problem.  ""Flabby"" is the word that comes to mind. It's really just the story of Baloo and Mowgli bumming around in the jungle. Now and then something happens.  At one point Mowgli is pinched by some monkeys, and taken to some old ruins, just so that the orang-utan can stage a musical number.  It's a pretty good musical number - did I mention that the orang-utan is skillfully animated? - but that doesn't disguise the fact that it's unmotivated.  After enough running time has passed the incidents stop and the film ends.It's enjoyable enough, and worth seeing for visual reasons, but be warned.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Most Disney films get better with age .... most,"As a kid, I loved this film. The Jungle Book was one of the first films I ever saw and is probably one the reasons I decided to pursue a career in films and I will always be fond of that. However, today, as a film, it's OK. That's not bad or good; it is just OK.For one thing, the film is very slow, which for an animated film can be quite tedious at times. My second (and probably biggest) problem with the film is that it simply plays it too safe; I can't help but wish that if this film had come out during the era of the Disney Renaissance (Aladdin, The Lion King etc.) then a few more risks would have been taken, e.g. I felt the climax between Mowgli and Shere Khan was very underplayed and could have been a lot more tense and dramatic, for example, it would have been a lot more powerful if Mowgli had defeated his enemy for good and killed Shere Khan (in the manor that heroes normally defeat their villains in Disney films) or some of the characters could have been a bit more menacing such as Kaa or Louis. I also feel that film tired much too hard to make comedic moments through out the film. The songs themselves did not really measure up to the Disney standard (with the exceptions of The Bear Necessities and I wanna be like you) and felt that they where very dumbed down. I also felt the animation was somewhat lacking and again, I felt could have benefited had this film been made during Disney's golden age in the 1990's.The film did have some positives as well, the best bit of the film is Shere Khan, and he's just a great villain. George Saunders gets the balance between Khan's sophisticated demeanor and his bloodthirsty intentions, the contrast is very effective and in my opinion, Shere Khan is one of the most memorable villains in Disney history. Baloo the bear was also a lot of fun, and it was really a shame when he appeared to have been killed at the end. Mowgli and the other characters are OK, and they all do their part.Overall, I won't say I don't like the film or it's not worth watching because I can't imagine that anybody watching it would hate it. However, I can't see anyone today putting it at the top of their film watching priorities. With two film versions of The Jungle Book coming up (one by Disney, the other by Warner Bros.) I will be very interested to see how they deal with their adaptations.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Best Disney Film Ever!,"When I was a little boy growing up in St. Louis, I loved the Jungle Book. I used to watch it every day. You hear that? EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!

The only one that I believe comes close is Aladdin (And no, I haven't forgotten about The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King). The musical score is probably the best ever. The Bare Necessities, I Wanna Be Like You, Trust In Me, I could go on and on. I wish Disney would make films like they did in 1967 rather than today (I mean Atlantis: The Lost Empire? Please!!!).

"While it's not up to the standards of many of the earlier Disney films, it is quite enjoyable.","I noticed one reviewer who called this film 'the best animated of the golden era'. Hmmm. I beg to differ. While I LIKE the film, the single biggest weakness is its animation. It's good but not at all of the same quality as earlier artistic triumphs such as ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"" and ""Peter Pan"" (among many others). So don't try to tell me that ""The Jungle Book"" is Disney animation at its best. It's a pared down form of animation--done with copy machines like ""101 Dalmatians"". I am NOT complaining about the use of Xerox machines instead of hand-drawing every scene but it did tend to make the films look a bit rougher. After all, Disney had to save money as production costs were skyrocketing and the public seemed to be embracing cheaper animation (hence the rise of UPA and Hanna-Barbara Studios).As for the rest of the film, it has two big things going for it. First, the songs are mostly very, very good. You cannot hear ""Bare Necessities"" without bouncing along with the tune and several other songs are just plain fun. And, this brings me to the second reason- -the movie, over all, IS fun. You simply cannot watch it without smiling and enjoying yourself. Well done overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A musical adventure in the jungle,"The Jungle Book was the last movie produced by Walt Disney before his death. This movie is more colourful and more adapted for the vision of a child.
Infact this was the Walt Disney's intent.
When I was a kid I liked this movie. I liked the casting, I liked how they drew the jungle and of course, I liked the songs. The songs are made by Sherman brothers and Terry Gilkyson. Particularly ""Bare Necessities"" was so catchy. I rewatched this movie, but sadly I didn't like it in the same way I usually did when I was a child. I found a lot of defects. There were a lot of recycled scenes and they were distracting. Sometimes this scenes are recycled from other Disney's movies.
The movie itself was ok, but I think the story could be deeper and more interesting. In the book Mougli and the other characters had more developments.
Now let's talk about what I loved of this movie. The first thing was the villain, because I liked how intimidating and elegant he was. The second thing I loved was Kaa who was funny and enjoyable. And the third thing I liked from the movie were the songs. Personally I recommend this movie even if it's not like the book. It kept me entertained as a little kid and I'm sure it will keep your kids entertained as well. Check it out and enjoy this musical adventure in the jungle.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest masterpiece I've ever seen.,"When I was a child of eight I saw Bambi for the first time and I left the theatre with tears in my eyes. Many years later I saw The Jungle Book  and again I had tears in my eyes, but this time of laughing. This is the funniest and most entertaining cartoon I ever saw. And so beautifully drawn. It's a masterpiece. The music is fine. Lots of fun for young and old! Hans Dullaart. Netherlands",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I can imagine making a film out of Rudyard Kipling's treasure is very hard work...,"Genre: Cartoon, based on Rudyard Kipling's book, jungle.Main characters: Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman), Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), Baloo (Phil Harris) and Shere Khan (George Sanders).What happens: A panther called Bagheera finds a little ""mancub"" in a basket in a broken boat. Bagheera knows that the baby would perish without any care. He then decides to take the boy to the wolf pack...My thoughts: For the young, this will be a pleasurable film. They will instantly fall in love with the characters and be excited for them all, watching this film over and over again, maybe enjoying it a little more each time. Then, as they grow older, they may prefer other films and find some parts of this a little ""eerie"" as I did (of course, some may not pay attention to the weirdly spooky music which appears at times). They may get scared of Shere Khan. Then, they may read the book and realise what a floppy mess of the book this is. They may not like it for a long while afterwards, constantly reading the beautiful book instead. Then, at golden teenager hood, they may slightly go back into this film again, watching it more often than usual, reading the book as well. For the rest, I do not know. All this happened to me and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to at least one person in the world (for one thing, SOO many people have watched this).This film is better for you to watch if you're in a VERY good mood. Otherwise, it kind of gives a flop. Luckily for me, I do not find it as spooky as I did for a few years and I like parts. I see Colonel Haiti as a tribute to Rudyard Kipling, as he enjoyed writing books about the army. Mowgli in this is basically a spoilt little young boy, not noble unlike in the books. Baloo will be likely not to impress those who have read the books as he is a bit silly. Although him teaching Mowgli happens in the book and he is a goodie through and through (although in the book Baloo teaches Mowgli the laws of the jungle). Bagheera, as the film starts, is very likable but then his performance fails into about twenty minutes of the film as he starts to become fed up with Mowgli. The wolves are good, although they have a much bigger part in Rudyard Kipling's work and the mother wolf in the book is fiercer than her mate, unlike in this film. Kaa has the character of Tabaqui the jackal's and he is not a nice character (although Sterling Holloway does a good job, I have to admit). Shere Khan is much more evil than in the book and he is more of a ""main character"". King Louie is pointless really, I do not see why Wolfgang Reitherman had to put in a dancing Orangutang that wanted to make fire. I am very grateful for the Beatles vultures, they CERTAINLY do not appear in the books and they are good in this.The title of this film is not very good to the book, it would be better being called something like ""Adventure of Mowgli"" or ""Story of Mowgli"". In ""The Jungle Book"" many more characters appear beside our ones here.Recommended to: People who HAVE NOT read the book (after you've watched the film please read it!), very young children and maybe grown-ups.6 and a half out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Brilliant Song, Brilliant Animals, Brilliant Film","What can I say about The Jungle Book? It probably has the best songs of any Disney movie, it's full of wonderful animals such as Baloo the Bear and King Louie the ape and it has a great little character in Mowgli who was raised in the jungle (so I guess he's related to Tarzan).This is a great story throughout and the songs were just wonderful. When I first watched this film I couldn't get the songs out of my head and just kept humming them to myself time after time.There's plenty of creatures for fans of animals from snakes to elephants to a big bad tiger called Shere Khan (one of the best Disney villains ever).For those who haven't seen The Jungle Book, may I suggest viewing it as soon as possible?",,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's Best,"""The Jungle Book"" is definitely a classic.  This was the last one to be produced under Walt Disney himself, and it kept the animation department alive after him.

It's something I appreciate about old Disney pictures, especially this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

During his stay at the hospital, Disney sent Andrew life sized caricature's of the characters in the Jungle Book. Once Andrew recuperated he donated the caricature's to the children's burn unit.

Certainly a Disney classic but perhaps not one of the best,"""The Jungle Book"" was the last animated feature that Walt Disney worked on before his death, and the film's immense success probably helped prove there was an audience for Disney animation. The character animation is superb; it's no wonder why so many of today's top animators cite this as being among their favourite films. The laid-back, episodic nature of the story (far removed from Kipling's highly strung original, which Disney actually advised his staff NOT to read) allows for some delightfully entertaining scenes; the encounters with King Louie and the Liverpudlian vultures spring to mind. The characters also have a certain warmth about them that hasn't been seen in many Disney films before or since. The score is equally wonderful, and a good number of the songs - ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and ""The Bare Necessities"" in particular - have become standards.Having said that, I can't help but find ""The Jungle Book"" to be rather slight, and perhaps even overrated. As far as I'm concerned, the aforementioned individual elements seem better than the film as a whole. In particular, the lack of structure is as much a curse as it is a blessing; for every engaging scene or two, there can be a truly boring scene. Regardless of these inferior aspects, ""The Jungle Book"" is a good film that rightly deserves the label of ""Disney classic"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Genuinely Witty, Most Memorable Classic  Disney Animation.","This is not my very favorite, but it IS among the very best of Disney's animated classics. With unforgettable characters, endearing dialog, and an irascible wit that permeates throughout, Wolfgang Reitherman's The Jungle Book features some of the best animation, voice parts, and story in the Disney vaults.The original songs are still as enigmatic as ever, and so are the characters. This is one of my very favorites, although not the top. That position belongs to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the Jungle Book presses a very close second.If you have kids, are a kid at heart, or collect Disney features, this is a must have in the collection. It is a beautiful coming of age movie, for both boys and girls.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This time it's the sound, not the pictures","Generally acknowledged as the end of Disney's golden age (it's the last animated feature Walt supervised before he died), and the more modern, streamlined style successfully introduced in 101 DALMATIANS is starting to look bland and (gasp!) a bit cheap.  Fortunately, THE JUNGLE BOOK features just about the greatest voice cast the studio ever assembled, and for once it's the human performances in the recording studio that really make the movie; perhaps only Robin Williams as the Genie in ALADDIN has created as forceful impression on the screen without ever being seen in the flesh.The Sherman Brothers, perhaps still aflame with inspiration from MARY POPPINS, contribute their second-best song score, although the tune everyone remembers, ""The Bare Necessities"", was an interpolation by pop songwriter Terry Gilkyson.  (And for an example of how fast and completely the Shermans cooled, see the same year's megaflop THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE.  How could the same guys who wrote so cleverly for magical nannies and anthropomorphic animals turn so dim when it came to writing for actual humans?)  Phil Harris, a huge radio star who didn't have the same success in films, is completely wonderful as Baloo, the sybaritic bear -- a kind of jungle Hoagy Carmichael or ursine Dean Martin, his rascally warmth transcends sentimentality.  Sterling Holloway, Disney's erstwhile lovable Pooh, is equally perfect as a sibilant snake, hissing the excellent ""Trust in Me"". When the masterful George Sanders speaks, he supplies all the grandeur and menace the animation can't quite muster; too bad he only gets one line to sing (if you don't believe Sanders had one of the most impressive and underutilized singing voices in film history, rent CALL ME MADAM sometime.) The ultimate showstopper, of course, is lounge legend and professional wildman Louis Prima as the Orangutan king, infusing the inspired ""I Wanna Be Like You"" with his anarchic humor and fevered swing sensibility.  By the time this becomes a scat ""cutting contest"" with Harris (Baloo, in the best non-Disney, Bugs Bunny tradition, has disguised himself as a female Orangutan to distract the king), the number has risen to a level of jazz-inflected ecstasy achieved by only the best movie and stage musicals.The low point, and an unfortunate omen of what would follow up until THE LITTLE MERMAID breathed new life into the form, occurs at a critical juncture late in the action.  The boy Mowgli, now wandering the jungle alone, encounters a trio of Cockney buzzards.  One of them is clearly modeled after Ringo Starr, and I remember vividly thinking, watching the original theatrical release at age nine, how exciting and cool it was to see a Disney movie acknowledging my then-idols, The Beatles.  But when they launch into song, it's immediately clear that Prima was as ""far out"" as Uncle Walt would ever get.  Instead of the anticipated rock 'n' roll pastiche, the mop-topped birds sing in insipid barber-shop harmonies. Luckily, the movie winds up so quickly afterward that the harm isn't fatal. In spite of its flaws, it's hard to imagine a child, or even many adults, who won't find sufficient pleasure in THE JUNGLE BOOK.A note on the stereo sound mix on the laserdisc (and, I assume, the DVD): it's grand.  As in so many technical departments, the Disney sound engineers staked out the cutting edge of movie technology, and the happy result is a 1967 release that sounds as fresh and vibrant as if it were recorded last week.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Extremely Hilarious,"The Jungle Book is one of my favorite films from my childhood. I still literally laugh out loud every time I watch this movie. This is my favorite version of the story because it's too funny and all the characters are likable - even the evil Shere Khan I like.Mowgli is a cute ""man cub"", quite a brave little boy especially to stand up to Shere Khan and Kaa.Bagheera - Is a lovable panther. He's a well grounded, down to earth, sensible character type - but he knows how to have fun too. A very enduring toon.King Louie is just insanely fun, so are his band of monkeys. I love their catchy tune ""I Wanna Be Like You"". I am like Baloo, ""Oh man what a beat"". ""I'm gone man - solid gone"". Yes it's a groovy little tune.And Baloo is the best - ""Bare Necessities"" all that jazz. I would love to have a (cartoon) bear friend like him because he could liven up any boring day - just like this Disney classic film: The Jungle Book.Simply worded: This film rocks!

"A bit rough, isn't it?","When I saw this movie first, I enjoyed it. It was funny, the animation was good and the songs was enjoyable. Yet I must say that the movie is very roughly based on the actual book by Rudyard Kipling, which is far better than the movie.If it stood to me, the actual story is far from a children's basic bedtime story. Many important factors was excluded from the movie, which I am very disappointed of. Kaa, who originally was a wise old python and one of Mowgli's best friends, was turned into a greasy bad guy, helping out Shere Khan. It's almost like he took over the role of Tabaqui the jackal, who didn't appear in the movie at all. Akela, Raksha and the rest of the wolves, did hardly have any part in the movie, unlike in the book. Also, the originally smart, bold and righteous Bagheera was completely out of character, and so was Baloo the bear. From a strict old teacher of the wolf pups, he turned into a carefree goof ball without any connection to the Seonee Pack at all. I suppose that the added character King Louie, only was a comic relief.Of course, this is meant to be a children's movie, but still I was very disappointed when I saw it as child. I just wish Disney had followed the book more properly.I can recommend this movie to people who just wants to have mere fun out of it (because this is a classic Disney movie, with a lot of fun!), but fans of the book shouldn't get their hopes up.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's vault-dwellers that probably looks better in the memory banks than it does on-screen.,"He well-worn tale of an abandoned infant, found and raised in the wild by a caring society of jungle creatures. In this specific case, it's a pack of wolves who look after the boy, though they quickly fade away when an elder insists the child (now half-grown) be returned to human civilization. A fatherly panther and carefree bear seem much more attached, guiding him through danger and belting out various songs as they progress through the densest bits of occupied brush. The pieces are here for another true Disney classic - excellent character designs, cheerful music, superb voice acting - but the plot is watery and overly simple, while the animation largely isn't up to snuff. In contrast to the studio's famous knack for experimentation, The Jungle Book's visuals are a dull, two-dimensional affair with all manner of seams and shortcuts left in view. It's a workmanlike effort, smooth but not especially interesting, which leans on the studio's name more than it adds to it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ignore the cynics - this is classic Disney,"The last time I watched The Jungle Book, I thought for about half a second that King Louie was a rather uncomfortable stereotype.  Given that white racists love the phrase `Get back to the jungle' and make comparisons to monkeys, a scatting orang-utan who desperately wants to be like a man seemed like either a dated character who'd never heard of political correctness, or a deliberately racist one who sat rather awkwardly among the otherwise saccharine sentiments.  But after reversing my lobotomy, I realised just how much I was talking out of my a**e, because Mowgli, who this awful, shameful black stereotype sings to, isn't white.  There's that theory shot to pieces. Add to that the fact that Baloo the bear scats alongside Louie, and that bears haven't been given the racist association that monkeys have been saddled with, and it becomes pretty obvious that people are reading into Louie a perversion that simply isn't there.  After all, if Louie is a racist character, then every British viewer should be disgusted to find that the villainous, murderous, savage Sher Khan is given an English accent despite living in a jungle in the middle of India.  My point being: shut up.The same point goes for people who've complained that the female character who attracts Mowgli is desperately sexist because her song shows that her only ambitions are to be a wife to a handsome man and a cook to her children.  That argument ignores not only that this was a movie made in the 1960s, where a career girl was still far from the norm, but that it wasn't set in the present day anyway!  If Mowgli had spotted a girl on her way to the office where she'd compete with the best male executives on an equal salary, the movie would have entered a fantasy land less realistic than the one in which a bear can sing.In truth, The Jungle Book boasts the kind of charm and innocence and magic that we used to associate with Disney ourselves, before the company began telling us about its charm and innocence and magic in every advert for every video it rams down our throats.  It's this genuine Disneyism that makes The Jungle Book a classic despite its wafer-thin plot.  Mowgli, a man-cub raised in the jungle by a family of wolves, is to be returned to the man-village to keep him safe from Sher Khan, a tiger whose fear of man's gun and fire, and whose links with the notorious Combat 18, make him a dangerous addition to the local population.  From there, the movie spends the remainder of its running time wandering around the jungle rather aimlessly, and its episodic structure means the movie sags at times while soaring at others.Every scene with Baloo is a winner, and the King Louie episode is perhaps the most entertaining, but these are dragged down slightly by two rather repetitive scenes with Kaa the Snake, whose career hit its nadir with his infamous appearance with Britney Spears at the MTV Awards.  Your enjoyment of the two scenes with the Dawn Patrol depends entirely on how funny you find a forgetful elephant, and on how well you can forgive Colonel Hathi's crypto-fascist, militaristic obsession.  The lowest point is the sequence with the Beatles-lookalike vultures, managing to include the poorest characterisations, the least memorable song, and the most half-assed of ideas.  The vultures are clearly a nod to the Fab Four, but only one speaks with a Liverpudlian accent, and when they break into song, it's in the style of a barbershop quartet and not a rock and roll group.  The homage is therefore compromised and becomes pointless.But The Jungle Book is more than the sum of its parts.  Its highlights may be unevenly distributed, but nothing can argue with the fact that I didn't stop smiling through the whole thing.  Baloo is the absolute star of the film, one of the great Disney characters that ranks alongside Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket and Mulan's Mushu, and it's his presence that accounts for most of the film's immense charm.  He has the best song, the best lines, and the best scenes, and his loveable slobbiness can't be praised highly enough. Even his entrance, where he strolls onto screen singing `Well it's a doo-be-de-doo, yes it's a doo-be-de-doo' is inexplicably hilarious!  I know it's not the greatest line of dialogue in the history of cinema, but it makes me laugh every time I hear it.This is simply classic Disney.  Great characters, great songs, stunning animation, and a heart to shame most of the vacuous 90s output this generation has had to suffer.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Jungle book, a good movie but not a great one.","Now before you die hards spew fire at me for giving this movie three stars let me explain myself. Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid children's film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for children's films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own.

Great job Disney!,"The Jungle Book is based off a book. Like HOND, I refuse to read it. The movie is awesome and I would like to keep it that way.What I like about this movie is the music. It's light-hearted and very upbeat compared to most Disney classics. The Bare Necessities is great, one of my favorite Disney songs. I wanna be like you is NOT RACIST! It's just a fun, upbeat song about an orange monkey wanting to be someone else who he is not. Kind of like middle school when most girls think they look terrible and they want to change for the better or worse. It can't be considered racist. Trust in Me is the worst villain song ever. Kaa just sounds so weird (I think Winnie the Pooh sounds awesome, but they have the same voice actor). The score is very good especially at the climax!Here's the million dollar question: did The Jungle Book deserve a possible nomination of The Acadamy's Best Picture award? Some will say no because it's an animated film (umm... take a look at Beauty and the Beast (first animated film nominated) and The Lion King (won Best Picture at the Golden Globes), but they are from the 90's). I would say yes! Some of those films that were nominated sucked! The Jungle Book would get that award if the Acadamy didn't turn it down. So this is my POV about 1968's (maybe 1967) Best Picture Award.What an awesome movie! My parents used to show me this movie all the time and we danced to the music and booed at Kaa!

The Jungle Movie,"This adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's popular jungle-themed tome keeps it all light and ditches anything deeper than superficial. One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant.

Nothing too bad but hardly a Disney classic or must-see in my book.,"Out of all the Disney animated movies, this is one of the few I did not grew up watching with. Don't tell anyone else but I think it was because me brother was scared of Baloo. A singing and dancing huge bear was more than he could handle and the sight of it was more than enough reason to never purchase this movie. But I must say I did not missed much with it. ""The Jungle Book"" is an average Disney entry, with average animations, average songs, average characters and a very average main plot line.The lack of story and character development really disturbed me. Basically the movie is an adventure movie, in which the main character has to travel from point A to B and on his way he meets all sort of different characters. And this was something that just didn't worked out too well for me. First of all the movie because of this way of storytelling never really flowed well enough and I can actually imaging some kids getting easily bored with this movie, especially now days. But second of all, it made the movie look too much like it was hanging together from its coincidences. All of the events and characters pop up at random and also often disappear out of the story pretty fast again. Because of this the movie never finds the right pace and also never has the time to develop anything or any of its characters properly enough.So this wasn't really a movie I could ever feel involved with but it of course isn't a bad one. You can still get plenty enjoyment out of watching this movie, since it definitely has its moments. It can be a funny and charming movie at times and even though they don't get developed properly enough; the movie still has some memorable characters in it.But a character that the movie is lacking is a good main villain. I know that the movie was more about its traveling and adventurous elements but it would had made the movie so much more interesting and powerful in my opinion, if the movie had a clear main villain and treat in it. The movie now instead has like 3 small villains, who pop up every now and then.Animation-wise this also isn't Disney's greatest moment. It's not like it's bad looking or anything but it's all very average, for normal Disney standards. This goes for the backgrounds, as well as all of the characters animations and looks. Seemed to me like they spend more this time on studying the movement and behavior of the animals, rather than spending time on creating a good and distinctive look.The only thing the movie does stand out with is with its voice cast. Everyone seemed perfectly picked for the part and the movie actually used some big known Hollywood names as well, such as George Sanders.I don't mean to sound harsh, since I still actually for most part still enjoyed watching it. It just isn't really a Disney classic in my book.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

An amazing Disney movie with just one minor flaw: it's not long enough,"""The Jungle Book"" encompasses everything that I always wanted to see in an old hand-drawn animated film by Walt Disney. I saw many of Disney's masterpieces in my childhood, and now recently, I have begun to start watching them again several years since I last saw them. Take ""The Jungle Book"" for instance. It was one of my favorite Disney movies in my childhood, and yet I hadn't seen it in years until just a few moments ago. And now that I'm older and know more about the movie, I appreciate it and enjoy it even more than I believe I ever did as a kid.First off, there is the absolute amazing animation done by Disney's studio. If I'm not mistaken, they were still using hand-drawn animation when they made ""The Jungle Book"" and if my guess is correct, it was masterful. It's amazing that artists could be so talented, so precise, and yet so creative at the same time to make things look so vivid and realistic. And they also bring depth and characterization to their 2-Dimensional characters with only a script to base their work off. All of the characters in ""The Jungle Book"" are amazingly created and fitted into the story, adapted with talented actors to perform the voices. And Disney used authenticity with several voices. The voice of Mowgli was performed by an actor of about the same age as the character. The other voices of the heedful Bagheera, the take-it-easy Baloo, sinister and even more so comical Kaa, and then Shere Khan, one of the most memorable Disney villains of all. George Sanders provided a perfect, purring and cold-hearted voice for the character, ultimately increasing the effect of the tiger to make up for his lack of screen time. Lines such as ""you're trying my patience"" and ""You should know that everyone runs from Shere Khan"" always make me think in my mind: this was perfect! After Shere Khan, my favorite character is Kaa the python with the hypnotic gaze. And he's not a frightening villain, but a funny one and therefore, a lovable villain.There is one minor flaw in ""The Jungle Book"" which I find in a lot other Disney movies. Everything it this film is perfect, except for the fact that its running length is just not equal to its entertainment. In other words, it's about ten or twenty minutes too short. But I suppose this is justifiable for its age. Movies at its time weren't all that long and hand-drawn movies take a long time to put together because of the hand-drawn animation. Yet, this did not impact my enjoyment on the film as I watched it. The bottom line for this review is that ""The Jungle Book"" is one of the finest, if not the finest, of all of Walt Disney's films. It's too bad he didn't live long enough to see this one go to theaters and see the audiences cherish and love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely Worth it,"I first saw this movie as a child when it was first released in the cinemas and then read the book and then, again saw the movie when it was re - released in the 1990's.Bagheera, the panther,roaming in the jungles of India, hears a cry of a baby that has been abandoned and upon reaching the ares, he sees that it is a human baby - man cub. He calls upon all those living nearby, including some wolves to see what can be done to take care of the man cub. They all agree on looking after him but they fear that one day, Shere Khan, the tiger will find out and come after the man cub, whom they have named ""Mowgli."". One day, they all get together, after being informed that Shere Khan is nearby and they decide to send Mowgli to the man village and Bagheera, the panther should take him back.

Jungle Book - Classic Disney,"This has to be one of my favourite Disney movie, ahead of Lion King and Toy Story. I have very fond memories of this classic. Disney's movies these days lack the magic of classics like Jungle Book, 3 or 4 years they would be forgotten. Even the sequel of Jungle Book was woeful and tired and was an insult to the original.This Disney movie had everything. Classic songs, my favourite is the Bare Nessecities, Memorable characters and a decent story.The story of Jungle Book goes like this, Mowgli is abandoned by his Mother as a child and was brought up by Bagheera. Years pass and Mowgli is now a young boy when Bagheera hears that man hater Sher Khan is returning to the jungle. It is decided that the jungle is now unsafe and Mowgli must go to the city to live with his own people. Mowgli and Bagheera start their journey through the jungle where they meet Baloo, who can I say is my favourite character. Baloo refuses to let Mowgli return to the village but goes along with them anyway, cue lots of memorable songs and heaps of fun.On their travels they bump into several interesting characters (Kaa, King Louie, Haathi etc). In the end what happens is Mowgli falls in love and leaves the jungle(please forgive me if I have missed anything). Pure Disney Gold that will live forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining despite its flaws,"The Jungle Book is one of Disney's most well-known films before the Renaissance. It's based on Kipling's classic collection of short stories, and even though this adaptation isn't exactly true to the book it is quite entertaining.If you're not familiar with The Jungle Book, it's like this: An orphan child is raised by two wolves, who call him Mowgli (""The Frog""). As he matures, he is guided in the ways of the jungle by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther. But he must avoid the despicable Shere Khan (and, in this version, Kaa) if he wants to survive.The characters in Disney's Jungle Book are a mixed bag. For me, Bagheera (played brilliantly by Family Affair's Sebastian Cabot) and Shere Khan (George Sanders) are the standouts; they're very close to what Kipling wrote. Mowgli is rightfully curious but his use of 60s slang like ""yeah man"" is hardly endearing. Baloo is probably the most famous character from Disney's adaptation, and although his laid-back persona is a far cry from the book, he's still likable. While I don't mind changing Baloo's character, Kaa, my favorite character from the book, might as well not even exist in this movie. Disney changed him from a sage into an old kook. Though he is scarier in the book, he's a far deeper character that actually befriends Mowgli. Here, he simply tries to strangle and eat the kid, a difference of night and day.The musical numbers are creative and enjoyable, with memorable hits like ""Bare Necessities"" and the elephant march. The tune for ""I Wanna Be Like You"" is catchy, but the dance number? I seriously wish I'd never seen that.Overall, The Jungle Book is a decent movie. But without that ""I Wanna Be Like You"" dance segment and the terrible rewriting of Kaa, it'd be much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
True Disney Classic,"I grew up watching The Jungle Book since I was 5 years old. It gave me the best part of my childhood in my lifetime. The animated film based on the original book, always keep me happy and entertained due to its brilliant music, amazing voice acting, smooth old school animation, and its simple yet enjoyable plot. The characters in the movie are charming and appealing, and the music is on tune on every song they played.

"Forty years old, and the animation still holds up today","I'm afraid I cannot comment on the English and original voice-track, for I have not been able to summon a copy (for free) of it without Danish dubbing(as is the custom here... we dub what children would watch, but apart from that, thankfully, we leave the sound as is... I am opposed to the idea, the audio track is part of the original, it's part of the finished product that the film-makers put together, possibly even a part, significant or otherwise, of the director's vision), but for any Dane reading this who hasn't already seen it... some of the voice acting isn't too bad, and it features Ove Sprogøe, in at least one, possibly several, parts(including Bagheera). I have not seen the sequel, and I don't believe I've seen any of the Disney sequels to their animated features, save for Jaffar Returns(and I was a kid, less trustworthy judgment). I haven't read the book, either. Or seen any of the other versions of the story, including the 94 version(not that I'd want to, Sommers isn't exactly my favorite director... he helps furnish the bottom of that list). But enough of that, on to the film. The animation still holds up remarkably well. It's dynamic, dramatic and comic, when it tries to be any of the three. There did seem to be some reused footage(in a film that doesn't even reach a full hour and a half, no less), but that can be forgiven. The songs are catchy enough. Shere Khan makes a pretty cool villain. The plot is fine, though some of the developments have simple writing. At one point, our heroes are fortunate enough that an opponent takes the trouble to sing his plan while they are close enough to overhear it... not sure even Bond could get away with that one, but maybe middle-aged to old men with dreams of world domination or destruction make dreadful performing artists. The humor contains slapstick. Editing and shot composition are well done. I recommend this to fans of Disney cartoons, but from what I have heard of what it's like, *not* Rudyard Kipling's novel. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Jungle Book,"Review By Kamal KBrilliant animation that's pretty impressive for the 1960s.Likable and memorable characters, especially Baloo, King Louie and Mowgli. Amazing musical numbers, such as Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You.Shere Khan is an unforgettable antagonist and George Sanders does an outstanding job voicing him.Very nice grasp to the source material with some of its own creative adjustments to make it more for Disney's standards. Baloo and Mowgli share a very heartwarming relationship with each other.The ending is incredible as Mowgli finally accepts to be apart of the Man-Village but still has a close relationship with the animals in the jungle.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jungle Fever,"'The Jungle Book' is another colourful Disney classic. What really makes this one so lovable is its charismatic and funny characters. The story is straightforward and could have used some more development and depth. The animation is good but very two dimensional (the characters do not have shadows). Yet, the vibrant exotic colours of the animals and background stand out. The background sound could have used fascinating sounds of the jungle but instead what we get here is silence. Yet, in spite of all the flaws, I loved it. Balu and Bageera are awesome. They're like Mowgli's parents, Baloo being the fun parent and Bageera being the rather disciplined one. Of course there are the hilarious orangutans, the manipulative snake, the singing vultures, the military and the evil Shere Khan. I'm slightly disappointed that the adorable rhinoceros character was not included (check the deleted scenes). The songs are fun too. My favourite one is the Orangutan number. Overall, 'The Jungle Book' is a lighthearted movie with lots of entertainment and amusement.",,Anonymous,Animation

"""I'm gone, man, solid gone!!""","Walt Disney's surprisingly flat animated retelling of the Rudyard Kipling books has a practical panther and a devil-may-care bear attempting to return 10-year-old man-cub Mowgli back to his people, continually thwarted by various comical characters and the villainous Shere Khan (majestically voiced by George Sanders). Only two good songs (the Oscar-nominated ""The Bare Necessities"", and Kaa the Snake's ""Trust in Me"") highlight the music score, and though there's fine voice-work from Sebastian Cabot and Sterling Holloway and some lovely background detail, much of the slapstick is short on inspiration. Phil Harris gives his Baloo lots of groovy flourish, but he's an 'oobie-doobie' product of his time. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One Of The Great Disney Pictures (Mainly For The Music & Voice Acting),"Though made in 1967, ""The Jungle Book"" still holds up as good as ever today (and probably forever) because of its incredibly catchy tunes and crazy-good voice acting.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees ""man-cub"" Mowgli (voice of Bruce Reitherman) adopted by panther Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot) in the jungle. When the threat of Bengal tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) and his hatred of all things human comes to the jungle, however, Bagheera resolves to place Mowgli in the ""man-village"" once and for all. Along the way, however, they encounter a crazy cast of characters that includes the singing bear Baloo (Phil Harris), an orangutan king (Louis Prima), and a slithering snake named Kaa (Sterling Holloway).Though the storyline is filled with enough emotion to never truly get old, the hallmarks of this movie are easily its jazz-based soundtrack and one-of-a-kind voice acting. Every song is catchy in a toe-tapping kind of way, the slow ones add even more emotional depth to the story, and the voices behind the characters are so distinct that they seem to just bring them to life!I watched ""The Jungle Book"" over and over and over again as a child, and can still say that I enjoy it today. It is completely family-friendly and can be watched by even the youngest of children. If you haven't shown this one to your children or younger family members/friends yet, it is a must to get them acquainted with this unique jungle world!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still great family fun.,"My Take: A fine treat for the whole family.I can honestly say I enjoyed my childhood, if not to say it was definitely the best years of my life (I could go on with describing what made it such a treat, but then again I wouldn't have much time to talk about this movie). So I guess it's safe to say I remember much of it, especially one of the key moments of it. Particularly, I remember what movies I tuned in as a kid. Yes, I used to sit down on the sofa and pop in a VHS of JURASSIC PARK and at least one or two (okay, maybe three) of the LAND BEFORE TIME video sequels. But before other than the VHS, there's the Laserdisc, and other than THE LAND BEFORE TIME, there was THE JUNGLE BOOK.Recalling it know, however, I have a few minimal afterthoughts. While I can honestly say THE LAND BEFORE TIME (only the first one!) eventually emerged as a contemporary classic on my book, THE JUNGLE BOOK was a fine family entertainment, but quite not up to being the classic I presumed. Still, if entertainment is what you wish it will have when you give it a quick rerun, it sure won't disappoint. From the voice casting to the animation, down to the beat of ""Bear Necessities"", THE JUNGLE BOOK is fine family fun.Based on the story by Rudyard Kipling (with a purely Disney twist on it of course), jungle boy Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman) is accompanied by Bagheera the black panther (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) and the wacky, groovy Baloo the bear (voiced with glee by Phil Harris) to head for the fabled ""Man-village"" which they believe is where he belongs. Mowgli, reluctant to leave, prefers to stay and groove it with Baloo, while the man-hungry tiger Shere Khan (voiced with menace by George Sanders) and a slimy serpent named Kaa (a familiar voice by Sterling Holloway) looks at him as supper.It didn't look to me like a classic as it used to be, but it's fine entertainment nonetheless. A fast-paced, often funny adventure for the young and old.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
stick with the 1994 movie,"For the most part, ""The Jungle Book"" is another situation where Disney took a classic novel and padded it with songs. I liked the 1994 movie because it focused on colonialism. This version piques my interest nowadays because of who provided the voices: Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima and Sterling Holloway to name a few. To add to that, the vultures were a semi-tribute to the Beatles; I wouldn't have expected Disney to do a tribute to them.But for the most part, I think that Rudyard Kipling (happy birthday, Rudyard!) wouldn't really approve of how they sanitized the story*. If we accept it as brief entertainment, then it's OK. Is it racist how they portray East Indians? Maybe, but as long as we understand that, then it's OK. After all, there are lots of bare necessities out there.*As another example of Disney sanitizing a classic story, there's ""Cinderella"". In the original story, the stepsisters mutilated their own feet to fit them into the glass slipper.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Memorable film with strong characters and outstanding music,"Disney's animated, musical version of Rudyard Kipling's stories.For me it is the characters that are the most engaging due to their entertainment value. The likes of Baloo, Baghera, King Louis, Shere Khan, Kaa, Hathi, and the vultures all contribute a great mix of personalities. This is thanks largely to some great voice performances and the humorous tone of the dialogue and action.The plot is pretty thin, with some typical Disney tropes like the protagonist who doesn't belong and the apparent death of a beloved character before a miraculous resurrection.I think what most people remember are the songs, some of which become instantly hummable on hearing for the first time and feel somewhat iconic now.As with all Disney animations, the quality of the visuals are fantastic. The artists brought the jungle and animals to life with great personality.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I Can Sing ""Bare Necessities"" All Day Long!","Disney's The Jungle Book is a lovable, high-spirited adventure that all ages will enjoy. Like many Disney films from before 1970, this is considered a classic in the eyes of many. Personally, it does not reach the heights of top-tier Disney animation classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but it remains a movie everyone should see. Rudyard Kipling's story is a bit on the dark side, so Walt Disney took the basics and gave the film a light-hearted energy suitable for children. When the fantastic song ""Bare Necessities"" appeared, it is an example of light-heartedness that Disney was striving for. Still, there are some darker moments when it comes to the snake, Kaa and of course, Shere Khan the tiger. The hand-drawn animation is excellent, and it is obvious that care was taken into creating the animated characters. The voicecast is well represented with the characters. Disney chose some marketable names which was extremely rare in 1967. He felt that George Sanders was the right voice for Shere Khan. He even went as far to have the tiger designed based on Sanders's appearance. There are reasons why the film struggles to make Disney's best animated films. Most of the reasons relate to character deficiencies and a very basic story that could have used some fat. If you notice the movements of the orangutans, you will know what I mean by character deficiencies. On a lighter note, the vultures were originally planned to appear as The Beatles. That would have been really cool!After The Sword in the Stone was released, story artist Bill Peet told Disney that its time for the studio to create more interesting animal characters and suggested Kipling's The Jungle Book as the next project. He agreed and took a hands-on approach because of the prior's film mixed reaction. Peet wanted to follow the more sinister tone of the book, but Disney disagreed and removed Peet from the project. We do have Peet to thank for creating Louie, the king of the monkeys. In the end, Disney wanted a lighter, character-driven story with more gags, an emotional core, and just a fun atmosphere. This would also be the last project that Disney would ever work on before his death. The film was released shortly after his death. I think, for the most part, they succeeded in following Disney's vision for the project. Every scene with Baloo the bear is enough to warm your heart. Same with Louie the Monkey King and those awesome, marching elephants.Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) was abandoned in the jungle as a baby and was raised by a pack of wolves. As Mowgli grows older, the wise panther named Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot) believes that Mowgli needs to be returned to the humans. Baloo the bear (Phil Harris) opposes the idea and takes Mowgli under his wings teaching him there is no better life than living in the jungle. Bagheera is under the realization that Mowgli does have enemies such as Kaa the snake (Sterling Holloway) and more importantly, Shere Khan (George Sanders) who despises all humans. Over the course of time, Mowgli may have encounters with his enemies as he really does not want to leave the jungle. What could persuade him? Perhaps a human girl from the nearby village.Disney wanted a more recognizable cast. The name that stands out is George Sanders. His voice makes for a frightening encounter. The rest of the cast would mostly be familiar to people from the 1960's. Phil Harris was a wisecracking comedian and actually shocked the crew when announced he was hired. He improvised his lines because the scripted lines were not natural to him. Louis Prima played foil very well to Mowgli. Speaking of which, the director's son, Bruce Reitherman was casted as the voice of Mowgli as he had some experience with voice roles in previous Disney features. It was very rare to use names that people recognized in the 60's, but it worked well here. I am not sure anyone could replace George Sanders as the voice of Shere Khan.Overall, I really liked The Jungle Book. It is a simple story with a basic plot, but the movie is all about its three-dimensional characters. Some of them are inspired characters with lighter touches than in Kipling's book. Baloo is such a lovable bear and his rendition of ""Bare Necessities"" is probably my favorite scene. I can never stop singing that song. I had issues with several of the characters such as the orangutans. At times, the plot can be overly simple but that is what Disney wanted. The animation is colorful and well-designed, and I liked the look of the jungle. Disney eliminated the darker elements of Kipling's book and created something more family friendly. Not my favorite Disney movie, but still worth a watch.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Last Gasp,"The Jungle Book is, for me, the last gasp of classic Disney. It's the last Disney movie until the latter half of the eighties that I would qualify as the least bit good, yet, it also suffers from many of the problems of the seventies films. This may also be the first case of mass celebrity voice casting, which works fine here but would set a horrible precedent for American animation that lasts to this day. Thankfully, while it's not quite the sum of those parts, many of its parts are highly entertaining...masterful even.As Disney himself was now fully committed to other projects, and died before the film could be completed, this is easily the most episodic and scattershot of the Disney projects under his rule. It takes Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli stories, strips them of its issues on human nature, ignores all the later stuff, and instead uses them as a vague suggestion to set up a bunch of characters and fun situations. It particularly hurts the character of Bagheera, whose commitment to getting the child home doesn't make quite as much sense, and Shere Khan's delayed entrance, though well foreshadowed, doesn't have quite the weight or the mythic sort of relationship with Mowgli. Mowgli himself is the cute little scamp Disney requires by this point, which has its value but isn't' as interesting as if they'd made better use of his whole ""raised by wolves"" thing like in the book. Not Disney's forte, perhaps, but one reason why this isn't as good as Princess Mononoke to me (strange comparison, I know).Animation wise, thoughts are liable to be mixed on this one. There's more shortcuts here than in any previous Disney movie. Reused animation aplenty, funky relationships with the cels and the backgrounds, lots of the kind of stuff director Wolfgang Reitherman would abuse in the seventies. There's one bit in particular that's a straight lift from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.What at least mostly makes up for this, however, is the fact that this is a tour-de-force of master animators doing some of the best work of their career. Ollie Johnston and Milt Kahl do a great bit with Bagheera trying to get Mowgli into a tree that has no real plot significance but which is a masterpiece of timing. Bear Necessities is an iconic number, but would it be so memorable without Ollie Johnston's fantastic work on Baloo? Johnston also does a remarkable job with Baloo's more emotional moments, such as the scene where he tells Mowgli that he has to leave the jungle. John Lounsbery gives a wonderful feeling of weight and caricature to the elephants, arguably his masterpiece. King Louie works mostly because of his animation by Frank Thomas and Kahl, which is so intricately composed and full of personality that it looks easy (even though it's a monstrous bitch to pull off something like that, especially with his hyperactive movement). However, my favorite bit is the restrained yet perfectly controlled, Picasso-influenced work on Shere Khan by Milt Kahl. It's not the most bombastic of these pieces, but his graceful movement combined with his sinister presence (George Sanders' voice work helps quite a bit). The exchange between him and Johnston's Kaa is brilliant animated acting between two of the greatest animators who ever lived.Yet, while all these moments are wonderful to watch, there comes a point toward the end where things seem to just fall apart. Three Beatles-influenced Vultures sing a silly barbershop toon that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie. This scene was finished after Disney's death, and hints at the kind of goofiness that would undo the next few Disney pictures.Overall, The Jungle Book is problematic, but remains an enjoyable picture if one can get past its rough edges. It's the last gasp of the golden age. That's right, folks, my next few reviews are going to be pretty negative, but since very few Disney picture are completely bad and some great work does go into even some of the worst of them, I'll point those elements out too. The Jungle Book, to me, is the mildest example, since the good elements still make this movie work, but the practices of this film never really worked again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Jungle Book,"The Jungle Book, a simple story with a strong showing of music and animation. Let down by a bit of repetition, lack of variety, and some dull moments. Besides that this is a great Disney animation classic, if only for the music this is already worth watching.The art here is stunning, the landscapes are colorful but feel real enough for a jungle. Some of the larger paintings and the nighttime painting are just stunning. Directing was great, movement was easy to follow and scenes got the time they needed and didn't overstay their welcome most of the time. And I say most because there are some dull moments, specifically when even the background sound effects are non existent and it's just voice overs. It really lost some of it's pacing in those moments. Luckily the music that follows after quickly reignites the energy.Music and sound, regarding sound effects this movie lacks a bit, there just isn't much there and it makes the world feel a little less alive than it should. Music is obviously fantastic. The first time Bare Necessities comes on it's instant goosebumps for me. It's led in so nicely and then becomes to catchy. Wanna Be Like You is good too but a lot more free-flowing. Besides that we have the Vulture song which is alright. But it did feel like we were one song short in this movie, especially the amount of times they reuse Bare Necessities.Animation is another standout, really really good honestly. Compared to the Aristocrats that I saw a couple days ago Jungle Book just has so much more life and energy to it.Overall a fun movie, but besides the music it won't leave a lasting impression on me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Greatest Disney of em all.,"Quire simply put this is animated story telling at its purest and best. This is a joy from start to finish. The story of Mogli the boy brought up by wolves forced to flee the jungle might not be as grand as the normal Disney fare and as a result actually feels like a smaller film, but that is by no means a bad thing. Instead what we have here is attention to character and this is achieved with excellence. Every character here is beautifully created all with their own nuances and traits. We have the main animal characters of Baloo and Bhaghera who are a superb odd couple duo and they and supported by a fantastic supporting cast including the magnificent King Louie and Khaa the snake. With the menacing villain Shea Khan casting a shadow over precedings we get a series of superb set pieces all set to the greatest tunes ever in a Disney film.

Go watch!,"An entertaining watch.'The Jungle Book' is ideal family viewing, with its warm characters and catchy music. The plot isn't the deepest, shown by the lesser conclusion, though on the whole you can't help but smile throughout.Mowgli, despite being the protagonist, isn't one of the best; Bruce Reitherman is solid if unspectacular. The real stars of the film are Baloo (Phil Harris) and Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), as well as side characters Kaa (Sterling Holloway) and King Louie (Louis Prima). George Sanders does good as Shere Khan, but it is surprising that he isn't seen until the final act.This arguably features Disney's greatest songs from this era of their productions. ""The Bare Necessities"" is the standout for me, but ""Colonel Hathi's March"" and ""I Wan'na Be like You"" are terrific too. All sing-a-long worthy.The film is a largely just for fun 78 minutes, which is why the more serious finale doesn't avoid falling flat a little bit.

"should likely appeal to kids right now, and adults grew up with it","The Jungle Book was of a nice crop of Disney films I would watch numerous times as a kid, to the point where I would have not even the songs, but full passages of dialog, memorized to heart. It's the last film Walt Disney himself was involved in, and it shows, sort of. But it also shows Disney moving along on its legs into its quiet, and under-appreciated, period of films in the immediately post-Disney's death world of the 70's.If you read the book it's not much like this one aside from the same characters and some plot points. But what it is is a film that survives well on its own feats of strength- catchy songs (including the very popular ""Bare Necessities, though Louis Prima's song is the best of the bunch and the Vulture's song the funniest), and a lot of fun action thrown in with some good, everlasting pathos. Obviously, kids wont need to take lessons on how to escape from the monkeys or from a Bengal Tiger.It does carry enough of parts from real life that kids can take as piece of mind; the coming-of-age idea is in there with the ""man-village"" to be sure. And throughout the film itself is a technical knockout, with great visuals and animation, colorful characters (in more ways than one), and spectacular voice talent that's rarely gotten this good in just pure ensemble form. I mean, where else will you get Clint Howard as a baby elephant and Sterling Holloway as a snake? Phil Harris is also indispensable and about as memorable as possibly can be here.Maybe its best quality is that it isn't too much stuck in its time and place (save for the vultures being like the Beatles crosses with Marty- ""what do you wanna do""). It's all in an exuberant, only-out-to-entertain-you style and in solid storytelling that the film is successful, as a family film and as just a terrific piece of entertainment in and of itself. Probably among the best in that crossover period of Disney's from the traditional ""9 Old Men"" animation period and its later renaissance.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The outstanding voices are George Sanders for Sher Kahn the tiger, which is such a full and powerful voice (you can almost feel the tiger's presence when he speaks), Sebastian Cabott for the panther Bagherra that is in your face always, Phil Harris for that rascal bear Bahlu, and Louis Prima for the orangutan King Louie, with there marvelous beat and song throughout the palace scenes. And of course, there is Moglie's voice, which is fitting and pleasant, but not stellar like almost all the others. The ending is still befitting in today's world, 40 years later!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Jungle Book,"This has probably the most perfect balance of story and soundtrack of any film I've ever seen - animated or otherwise. Adapting Rudyard Kipling's tale of ""Mowgli"" the child abandoned in the Indian jungle, but rescued and raised by a family of wolves. ""Bagheera"", the sagacious panther realises as the boy starts to grow to manhood, that he ought to return to his own kind but ""Baloo"", the avuncular bear thinks otherwise and so takes our young man-cub on some fun adventures in the jungle - including some near-misses with the wonderfully menacing, sardonic tiger ""Shere Khan"" and ""Kaa"" the hypnotic python. The voice cast - especially Phil Harris as the bear and George Sanders as the tiger are great; Louis Prima as ""Louie"" the King of the Apes provides us with one of the best songs ever to feature in a Disney film - and the Sherman brothers provide a great slew more of them for us to enjoy, too. The detail in the animations and the humour in the script are super - this really is a must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A kid raised in the jungle travels to the man village,"In this movie a boy who has been raised in the jungle and lived with the animals, must now leave to join his own ""people."" The story centers around a panther (Bahgeera) and a bear (Baloo) who agree to take the boy to the man-village, and an assortment of other creatures with their own agendas. The beach-bum bear and the up-tight panther's verbal sparring is classic. The social commentary (that went over my head when I was a kid) is funny too. The Jazzy orangatang (King Louis) ""I've reached the top and had to stop"" and the bored vultures ""I dunno, whata' you wanna do?"" are great. I saw this movie when I was a kid, and loved it. My sister and I got the LP and we played it all the time. Now, decades later, I find myself singing (or humming) the songs to this movie.

I have some thicc nostalgia goggles for this one,"If I didn't mention that I saw a surprising lack of classic Disney films as a kid in my Snow White review, this would be a good time to bring it up, because this is one that I watched a hell of a lot when I was eight or so. So remember the nostalgia goggles might be on a bit with this one.I enjoyed it much more than Snow White, because the characters, soundtrack, and voice acting are a huge improvement across the board. I don't think I could recall a single voice in Snow White other than maybe the evil queen, the characters are literally all defined by their names and not much else, and all but one of the songs has completely left my mind by now.There's a huge step up here, because the casting is perfect, every character is so memorable, and the soundtrack's been engraved in my mind ever since I first watched it.It also struck me that Mowgli could easily come across as really, really annoying at the start of the film, but he doesn't because his behaviour is easily understandable. Because Bagheera is frankly way too bossy.I can't say anything improved much on the directing front, there isn't all that much imagination to the cinematography, and for as much as I enjoyed it, it is still rather simple, but the fact is I still enjoyed it.I also enjoyed picking up on the fact that King Louie is very much into dominatrixes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are wonderful songs an animation that knows no peer. This was produced in the Disney heyday and sparkles from beginning to end. There are other versions that put more fang into the story.

They would make a movie, then take bits and pieces of it that worked and use those in future films. Never noticed it as a kid but now I find it fascinating.Also, seriously?

Man Cub O' Man Cub: Where for Art Thou Man Cub,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend if you've seen any other version or are looking for a writing analysis.During a lot of the movie, I was kind of in nostalgia mode, remember things I saw / felt when I was a kid, just sort of enjoying the way back machine experience.It wasn't until almost the very last scene that it clicked how good the writing is in this. I know this is known for the excellent animation styling, the catchy tunes, and charming coming of age semantics, but this uses several strong formulas that have been used since Aesop's fables.And that's what made me realize the writing quality, I felt as if I was watching an on fable with moral lessons of consequence. Up until that point I was mentally preparing how this 1967 animation is actually a perfect metaphor for 2020 entitled child entering the real world: never being told no, even to the threat of great, potentially lethal, loss because even in the face of danger, they've been taught that they deserve, even in the logic that it can't be true on both sides though both believe that. Hmmm, that sounds a lot like religious war.Digressing back to the writing: Mowgli embodies naivety, narcissism, entitlement, whatever you would like to call as he's a victim / ward of extreme chances of compassion: he just happens to luck into survival wherever he goes. While Tarzan makes more sense, this is character development for the series of situations (each one their own potential fable) with the main character shifting to and fro from Bagera to Mowgli to Balloo, each one being taught lessons as the adventure continues.With the representation of the jungle and the adversities that Mowgli faces, Mowgli slowly learns what Bagera and Baloo both know: most people are only interested in their own interests, but sometimes those that have enough can be in a position to help others. The xenoism (racism) that Sher Khan has for Mowgli as a human is enough for these predators give up his companionship to help him to the man-village.The really odd lesson is that Mowgli embraces the self-interest needed in the jungle, despite dialogue to the contrary.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Timeless Classic,"The Jungle Book to this day remains one of my favorite animation films from Disney because I watch it a lot as a kid.The film is just one of those films that is like a fine wine only get better with age and that is what is rare for animation films these days.The Jungle Book has everything you would want in a animated film and this is quite rewarding from start to finish.You got a strong story as Mowgli our main protagonist along with Bagheera must go home to the Man Village before Shere Khan the main antagonist returns to the jungle.Unfortunately Mowgli is not willing to return to his home that's when he meets Baloo.The Jungle Book features a collection of classic characters like Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, Mowgli and Shere Khan. Each character has a lot of special to the story of the film.The Jungle Book also features superb animation that is very well timed and great backgrounds you can tell Disney took the time to make sure the animation is done right. You can really appreciate the attention to detail in this film.The voice acting is phenomenal. The cast really brought these characters to life and you can really enjoy the film for that.Also the music is pure classic with my two favorite songs being ""The Bear Necessities"" which I used to get up and move along with the song because Baloo made the song a hit ""I wanna be like you"" Is my other favorite for the beats and the lyrics it just goes to show how you can make great music in a film.The Jungle Book has it all, wonderful animation, timeless characters and superb story telling, humor, action and drama there is no way you can go wrong with the Jungle BookI give The Jungle Book an 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Jungle Book has open it's page once again...,"I've always loved Disney movies, but just some of them becomes ""classics"" and others becomes embarrassing childhood memories. So was the case with ""The Jungle Book"". I loved this film a kid and saw it several times. But I found it childish and senseless when I became older.I recently saw this movie again and still liked it. It's enjoyable and one of Disney's funniest features ever.The mood is at times a little bit darker comparing to the other Disney features from the 60's, certainly because of the jungle settings, but the film mixture well the darks and funny moments. The film biggest strength is the enjoyable characters. Now my favorites are the elephants, the monkeys and especially the vultures. Shere Khan is a great villain. Kaa is also funny sometimes, but his song is extremely boring. Bagheera is the only main character that I don't like, while Baloo was my favorite character as a child, by the way.The animation is great. Of course not so stunning like ""Tarzan"", considering that this picture was made in 1967, but the jungle is beautifully drawn. The dialog is successful and the songs are very catchy (and have became one of Disney's most memorable tunes). But I didn't like the score.HERE COMES SOMETHIN THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILER: The story doesn't have the same scholastic lessons and logical structure like for example ""Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" and that's why I found this movie senseless for a while... It's also a shame that the greatest characters doesn't get enough screen time. But it doesn't ruin the movie.PS: Have you noticed that ""The Jungle Book"", ""Lion King"" and ""Tarzan"" (who all have jungle settings) have a rainy sequence after the big climax?)SPOILERS OVER.""Jungle Book"" is a enjoyable picture with good moments and the climax in the movie is one of my favorites.

My fave Disney film,"I have to say, I'm not overly fond of the whole ""Disney Magic"" sacred cow. For every classic (Snow White, Pinnochio) there are three or four Disney features that range from mediocre (Fox and the Hound, Lion King) to godawful (the horribly annoying Winnie the Pooh, Mu Lan).  But this one is completely enjoyable for me, and is one of the few movies that my daughter and I anjoy equally (one of the others, by the way, is the Marx bros.

If you don't bob your head whenever you hear ""I Wanna Be Like You"", then there is no hope for you.By the way, in answer to a review below dealing with racial stereotypes in this movie:  I understand your point, but you should note that King Louie is played by Louis Prima, a white man.

One of life's Bare Necessities!,"The Jungle Book (1967) -I'm my honest and humble opinion, Disney made some real doozies of films in the earlier days. 'Pinocchio' (1940) was terrifying, 'Dumbo' (1941) was depressing, 'Bambi' (1942) really boring and don't get me started on the trip that was 'Fantasia' (1940), but there is no way that anyone can say anything bad about this superb interpretation of Rudyard Kipling's most famous work.The musical numbers with there upbeat and fun rhythms and lyrics could only put a smile on my face and even the scary bit was toned down by 4 vultures who looked and sounded remarkably like a Liverpudlian quartet from the 60's.Who doesn't love 'I Wanna Be Like You' and 'Bare Necessities'? Even the Elephant's song was catchy.It really was and still is one of Disney's best, despite and perhaps because it doesn't have 21st century technology applied to it and it wasn't CGI'd to perfection. They really don't make them like this anymore, which I actually think is a real shame. It had so much heart and soul and it has always been a sheer pleasure to watch.I thought that it helped that Baloo had always reminded me of my Grandad. Both were great characters with strength and humour and big ol' tickers filling their chests.And I can't imagine anyone but Phil Harris voicing Baloo. That tone was spot on and all bears must surely speak like that?Overall the voice acting was very good from everybody.I particularly liked Shere Khan's vocals, because George Sanders gave him so much class and sophistication, but also the character had such a presence too, despite not being in it for as long as the others.Nostalgic for us oldies, but still valid for the newer generations too.I've never actually seen any of the remakes or alternative versions of the story and I don't think that I really want to or need to.

"Saw it as a child, then as a teenager, and now as a reviewer-the impact remains the same!","The Jungle Book (1967) :
Brief Review -Saw it as a child, then as a teenager, and now as a reviewer-the impact remains the same! Disney's transition era did not have great classics like the 30s, 40s and 50s, but surely it gave some nostalgic movies. The Jungle Book is by far one of the most popular animated flicks from Disney's transition era. I mean, who doesn't know about this movie? Who isn't aware of its characters-Mowgli, Bagheera, Baloo, and Shere Khan? Almost everyone knows it, and that's enough to describe its popularity across the globe. I remember watching this movie as a child and how much I loved it. Then, I saw it again in my college days and liked it just the same. Now, I saw it again as a reviewer, and by now, I have been through thousands of classic movies, including many animated classics from the old days, and yet, the impact of The Jungle Book remains just the same! The 2016 live-action remake did improve a few things, especially the drama and action. Rest, the original remains superior when it comes to the story, music, cuteness, and characters. The climax here is much better than the 2016 remake because we have a bit of a sad ending turned into a happy one. In this movie, Mowgli leaves the jungle, while the live-action remake sees him becoming a part of the jungle family. The perspective deferred both times, and both have valid reasons for it. I might have felt a little low because Tarzan (1999), or the 1932 movie, has done much better with a similar story by including humans, whereas TJB's main motive back in the 60s was perfect for its time. Time changes many things, but not memories and nostalgia. The Jungle Book (1967) will forever remain a part of my childhood memories, as well as my nostalgia as a grown up movie buff. I can't explain why, but I think it's one of those ""basic necessities"" for any movie buff, no matter what age group he belongs to.

The Book of the Jungle,The Jungle Book is a classic Disney film from the 60's. It follows Mawgli's journey as a kid who was raised by wolves who gets thrusted into adventuring in the jungle when the panther Bagheera tries to convince him to leave before the villainous tiger Shere Khan arrives. It is loosely based on the 1894 book of the same name. It takes place in the jungles of India. Disney films tend to take place in many different countries and this one is India. It does seem to be similar to the Disney Renaissance film Tarzan. I don't remember watching Tarzan but I know what it's about. Both seem to be about humans who grew up in the jungle by animals. Though the animals they're raised by are different and they're different ages. The films could be more family friendly than the stories they're based on.I believe I have watched bits and pieces of the live action remake years ago.

Some of the tricks and shots are quite outstanding.Voices are spot-on. So many good voice-performances it is hard to pick a stand-out.

And a whole new generation was introduced to the characters in the 1990s through the cartoon series ""Tailspin"".What is most interesting is how Ka is voiced by the same man who did Winnie the Pooh, and there is very little difference in how he presents them (beyond extending the hiss sound for Ka).

Does not hold up without the rose-tinted glasses,"I rewatched this movie with my friend today after first seeing it as a kid over 20 years ago, and oh boy, it does not hold up once you take off the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.It has one catchy song that we've all come to know and love-which is probably the main reason anyone remembers this movie at all-and the animation is as smooth and impressive as that of any Disney animated classic from the same era.But when it comes to the story and characters, there's not much good that I could say. The entire movie is basically one giant, LSD-fueled trip where the characters are haphazardly jumping from one nonsensical dance routine into the next, singing about this and that.I'm not even sure if I would call it ""ground-breaking for the time"" because there are other animated classics from the same time that manage to tell much better stories with far more interesting characters. For example, I just recently watched The AristoCats (1970) and it offered ten times the entertainment value of The Jungle Book.I realize that ragging on an animated classic that's going to be celebrating its 60th anniversary in two years' time is a bit silly, but I think my issues with this movie only highlight how far the film industry has come over the past few decades.Anyway, if you're like me and you wanted to rewatch this for the nostalgia, I'd probably give it a pass if I were you.

Walt Disney's Flawed yet Memorable Swan Song,"If there's any film that truly marked the end of an era, it would have to be Walt Disney's film adaptation of The Jungle Book, as it was the last feature made under his involvement before he passed away almost a year before it was released. When it did come out, not only was it a critical and commercial success, but it helped spark the company to move forward in animated features, and more than 50 years later, it's gone through ups and downs to become the animation powerhouse we remember it as. But as for the movie itself, while its legacy remains as strong as ever, I wouldn't place it among the studio's strongest efforts.Now the film's main storyline involving the little human boy Mowgli being forced to go back to the man-village is well remembered, not because of Mowgli himself, but because of the bizarre characters he encounters along the way. From the snooty cynical panther Bagheera trying to do what's best for Mowgli in spite of their differences, to the upbeat slacker bear Baloo showing him the fun of living carefree in the jungle, to the crazed scat-singing King Louie, so on and so forth. What's funny is that these characters have been cherished by audiences for decades for their exuberant personalities and specified voice actors whom the crew based off to form them, from the hip Phil Harris, to the stuffy Sebastian Cabot, to the energetic Louis Prima, to even the pompous George Sanders. However, the one that people care about the least is Mowgli himself, as he's the most forgettable and annoying character in the whole feature due to his whiny demeanor and obnoxious personality. Similar to Walt's Alice in Wonderland from the 50s, the main protagonist is so bland that everyone else around them sticks out way better.Another strong quality of the feature are the musical numbers by the Sherman Brothers, as even the ones that don't carry the story forward are entertaining enough on their own. Some are utilized as character exposition like Colonel Haiti's March, I Wanna Be Like You, and My Own Home, whereas others show both the positive and negative sides of the jungle like Trust in Me and the Oscar-nominated Bare Necessities. Speaking of Bare Necessities, it was the only song written by Terry Gilkyson, as it spawned from an previous version of the movie that wasn't produced. That leads into how distinctive the movie was from the original Rudyard Kipling novel, down to where Walt told the head story writer on the film Larry Clemmons to not even read the book. Whether or not the original draft of the movie would have been better is certainly debatable, but Disney's reputation with their animated films has often consisted of going in altered directions from literature with their own twist, and considering this film was uncle Walt's swan song, none can deny the charm it displays with what it offers differently.As for the overall visuals, some of Walt's finest animators really put their ""all"" into each character. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston once stated that presenting emotions onto the fun loving Baloo proved to be difficult after Walt had died, and yet they managed to pull it off very well through subtle gestures. However, as fun and expressive as the animals are in the movie (seriously, Milt Kahl really hammed up Shere Kahn), Mowgli's more realistic animation is somewhat of a weird contrast, although that may be due to inconsistent rotoscoping and minimal facial variation. On the other hand, the backgrounds are gorgeously painted and composited within each shot, as they feel like 18th century British literature images brought to animation. In addition to some scratchy looking effect work that blend well with the environments, the Xerox-handled characters stick out distinctly from the backgrounds to give better contrast to their flat albeit bold features. Even though Walt himself never cared for the Xerox process, it certainly gave the animated movies for the next decade a unique style to say the least.So is The Jungle Book the greatest Disney film of all time? At least in my eyes, not exactly. However, even with its straight forward narrative, uninteresting main protagonist and deviations from its original source material, what the movie does offer on its own is very entertaining in its own right. Even for the next century, there's high doubt we'll forget about the charming animal characters and timeless songs that left an impact after a legend's death. Of course the Rudyard Kipling novel will go down in history as a classic too, but this feature will always remind the world why Walt Disney's passing meant so much to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The final animated film with which Walt Disney had direct involvement, it's not great, but it is undeniably fun and memorable.","Set in the jungles of India, Bagheera the panther (Sebastian Cabot) finds a wrecked boat with a baby ""man-cub"" aboard. Taking pity on the man-cub, Bagheera brings him to a family of wolves who adopt him and accept him as their own. 10 years later, the baby now named Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is beloved by his family and recognized as a wolf. When Shere Khan the tiger(George Sanders) returns to the Jungle, the pack comes to the decision that for the safety of the pack and Mowgli's own safety, Mowgli must leave the jungle and return to the Man-village. Bagheera volunteers to escort Mowgli to the man village, but Mowgli is resistant vehemently voicing his desire to remain in the jungle. Mowgi finds a friend in Baloo the bear (Phil Harris) who volunteers himself to train Mowgli in the ""bear necessities"" and adopts him as his cub, much to the annoyance of Bagheera, but over the course of the film Mowgli encounters misadventures with an absurdly long python named Kaa (Sterling Holloway), a pompous elephant colonel, a civilization of monkeys who wish to obtain the power of fire aka ""man's red flower"", and of course the cold, calculating tiger Shere Khan who hates man with a vengeance.Adapted from the 1894 novel The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, the film was suggested as a follow up to Sword in the Stone by story artist, Bill Peet. Peet's original draft was much more faithful to the Kipling writings including characters such as Buldeo the Hunter, and the treasure of the ruins taken from the Second Jungle Book. After Sword in the Stone disappointed at the box office, Disney took a more active participation in the animated film division than he had for One Hundred and One Dalmatians or Sword in the Stone and insisted the dark tone be revised to something ""lighter"", which became a subject of contention between Peet and Disney resulting in Peet leaving the studio in 1964. The new writing team was given instructions not to read the original Kipling book and instead keep the story simple and develop the characters. When the film was released it became a massive box office hit while also serving as a bitter sweet farewell to Walt Disney himself as this was the final animated film with which he'd have direct involvement. While The Jungle Book doesn't have the ambition or reach the greatness of the Disney pantheon, it's undeniably fun.The biggest asset for The Jungle Book is definitely in the characters and performances. Phil Harris in what would be the first of three vocal performances in Disney animated films is perfect as the carefree ""go with the flow"" Baloo, and his improvised dialogue brings the character to life energizing the scene every time he's on. The film features other great characters such as King Louis as voiced by Louis Prima whose self-described ""king of the swingers"" jazzy performance brings to life a engaging character and also a catchy earworm of a musical number with ""I Wan'na be like you"". Sterling Holloway is also good playing Kaa the python who's voice as the snake lends itself both to subtle threat but also very humorous undermining as his attempts to eat Mowgli are routinely interrupted through bad luck, the animation used on Kaa is great with some truly amazing and humorous visuals based around how absurdly long he is. Bagheera is the serious minded ""stick in the mud"" and works as a great foil with his seriousness serving as a perfect counter point to the sillier characters, but it's George Sanders as Shere Khan the tiger whose heavy, upper-class English accent and smooth, bass voice gives the character a level of menace, charm, and sophistication that coupled with the build up to his eventual appearance make him a memorable antagonist. The music by the Sherman Brothers is as expected catchy and energized and will be rattling around inside your mind for a good long while.The Jungle book is rich in character, but unfortunately there are some notable drawbacks. Mowgli is not all that engaging as a protagonist and comes off less as a character and more a McGuffin who exists simply to move the plot along. Throughout the film's running time Mowgli is routinely kidnapped or in some kind of peril, and is only saved either by his friends or through convenient distractions or luck. Having read the original drafts, Mowgli originally had more character with the struggle between his identity as it relates to the world of man versus the world of the jungle well conveyed with a substantially different climax which involved both Shere Khan and deleted antagonist Buldeo the hunter that allowed Mowgli to conquer both worlds, but Mowgli doesn't have much agency as a protagonist and just wanders from one situation to another. Even the one time where Mowgli exhibits agency in the story is treated more for humor than character. There's also some characters that feel rather underwhelming with a quartet of vultures who are parodies of London Mod rockers, such as The Beatles who sing a barbershop quartet song and it's definitely the most dated part of the film. The characters of the Elephants who are lead by Colonel Hathi voiced by J. Pat O'Malley also feel more in line with something one would expect to see in a sitcom like Dad's Army and come off as odd. With that said, I didn't really mind these shortcomings as much as I did with Sword in the Stone because there is more energy and character on display here and even with a lacking central protagonist I still had fun with it.The Jungle Book is exactly what it promises, fun. While the film sidesteps the themes and characterization from the Kipling source works, it creates characters and personalities that are memorable and energized. While not every character is fully fleshed out and others feel rather underwhelming, The Jungle Book is a fun sit with an irresistible energy and hummable songs that linger well past the viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Some song-and-dance scenes stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of their peers; the rest, not so much.","'The Jungle Book (1967)' has an odd sort of structure, or lack of it, which leads to a lax pace and utter absence of urgency that's evocative of an overall aimless experience. In the end, it's a somewhat lazy - and, indeed, somewhat lazily put-together (see the multiple pieces of readily apparent reused animation, sometimes just minutes apart) - slumber through extended but unexciting set-piece after set-piece that actually seems in dire need of a proper 'story' - that is, one with character arcs, proper conflict, rising tension and generally more traditional 'beats' - regardless of how closely it follows the events of its source material. The picture isn't devoid of merit, however, as it is a traditionally animated Disney movie and, no matter how stuffy or stiff it seems or how obvious its 'corner cutting' is, there's always a general sense of an unshakable charm, a feeling that the flick is a free-flowing story-book come-to-life like most of the studio's attempts usually are. A couple of song-and-dance scenes stand out not for their narrative merits - or even, particularity, their musical ones (though the songs themselves, sung solo, are certainly good and have stood the test of time) - but for their lively animation and cheerful choreography. These pop off the screen as sequences that deviate from the rest of the movie's slightly 'lower rent' status and easily align themselves shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best of their peers, to the point that they feel like the only reason you'd ever actually watch the movie. Ultimately, there's little here. It's a decent if dull picture that plays it by-the-book and only has a couple of scenes that really stand out, as well as the odd quirk indicative of the style and time. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Was it old age or nicotine frenzy?,"""The Jungle Book"" was the last film of any kind to have Walt's personal guidance and overall stamp on it. He was very specific on precisely what he wanted to do with it, and his notes and instructions on it were massive. Then just before it was finished, he died of lung cancer (he was a heavy smoker) and the rest of his staff was left with the painful task of completing it without him. Fortunately, they had all his notes he had left behind and bent over backwards to be sure it was exactly as he had envisioned.Now I would very much love to say that the end result to all that talent, dedication and determination to stick to Walt's intentions was proved worth it in the resulting film, but I can't.""The Jungle Book"" is the weakest and most odious of all of Walt's animated features.The plot is not exactly the best in the world (plot: Bagheera is taking Mowgli back to human civilization, that's it). The film is basically a string of animated music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot, structurally making it the only animated movie in history to resemble Prince's ""Purple Rain"". Many have complained that it is really Disney's animated ""Robin Hood"" that is the weaker film because it has virtually no plot at all--and that is true in terms of the story, but at least ""Robin Hood"" had genuinely catchy songs from start to finish, boasts truly inspired character design and has memorable, likeable characters with fully-developed personalities and emotions. ""Robin Hood"" is considered a staple on TV and in the hearts of Disney fans everywhere for those very reasons, not to mention far more memorable. In sharp contrast, none of the characters in this version of ""The Jungle Book"" appeal very much--although, of course, Baloo is a lot of fun (Phil Harris is perfect for this role), and Bill Peet's idea of putting in a song called ""Bear Necessities"" was a stroke of genius, especially since it basically could have been fit in a stricter version of the story. Maybe if Peet (who was also responsible for the wonderful animated version of ""101 Dalmations"") had stayed on with the staff instead of leaving after Walt's upsetting him one time too many there would have been more of such moments. The fact that all the other characters are so cardboard is completely inexcusable considering the richness of the source material.But the biggest and weirdest problem with this movie is how it thoroughly mangles the original classic and considers itself clever for doing so. It would normally be thought that the rest of the staff screwed things up after Walt's death, but no: Walt originally INTENDED the final result to be like this! According to the original artists who worked on it, he brought in Kipling's book and said, ""Here's 'The Jungle Book'. The first thing I want you to do is to not read it.""Bizarre errors of judgement are present all over this film, weird and odd errors which a younger Walt would never have allowed in, say, a masterpiece like Pinocchio or Fantasia or Peter Pan. Even the animated ""Sword in The Stone"" can be excused from this fact because the original T. H. White books, which ""Stone"" was based on, were every bit as goofy as Walt's version. Was it old age or nicotine frenzy?An excellent example of strange ideas inserted into the film getting more messed up than they originally were: the puzzling vultures with moptops and Liverpudlian accents. Disney had decided for some strange reason that they would originally be charicatures of The Beatles and was going to invite The Beatles themselves to voice them and perform a song for them (now believe me, it isn't The Beatles themselves I object to here--I adore them!). But at the very last minute, Walt decided to have the vultures sing like a barbershop quarter instead because he decided that The Beatles were merely a flash in the pan and wouldn't remain very popular for another year or two (THIS is ""great genius""??!). Now while it can be argued that this was all Walt's opinion and that he had the right to correct what he felt was a mistake, it nevertheless begs the question: if Walt was so convinced that the old idea was a bad one in the first place, then WHY DID HE LEAVE IT IN AND MERELY EDIT IT INTO ONE THAT WORKED WORSE INSTEAD OF REMOVING THE WHOLE PORTION THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE IN THE PAST? The resulting scene, rather than being ""corrected"", is instead even more confusing and bewildering than it might have been in the first place. Walt's instincts must have really been exhausted for some reason or other... did Mary Poppins take that much out of him?Judgement like this abounds all throughout ""The Jungle Book"", and while its soundtrack boasts gorgeously hypnotic orchestration and three thoroughly wonderful songs (""Bear Necessities"", ""I Wan'Na Be Like You"" and especially ""My Own Home""), the others are simply awful. (The most annoying one of all is the one from the previously-mentioned section, ""That's What Friends Are For"".)The film as a whole moves on in a droning, sleepy pace, never once picking up its molasses-running speed. You keep hoping it will pick up, but it never does.All of these points I've mentioned, and many more, have all been pointed out over and over again since its release by not just paid critics, but also by animation fans and especially Kipling admirers, who rightfully feel that this movie is an appalling travesty and a dreadful mockery to the original stories, but none of this criticism has affected its performance at the box office and as a home video release--in this respect it has been a shocking success.I have no idea how pleasing this is in the long run, though: ""The Jungle Book"" remains the only Disney animated film I ever saw as a child which, on all three occasions when I saw it at different ages while growing up, bored me to the point of nearly putting me to sleep.",,Anonymous,Animation

Rudyard Kipling Would've Loved This Film,"The Jungle Book was the last animated film overseen personally by Walt Disney before his death in 1966. It's a beloved animated classic with interesting and long-lasting characters we all remember. Of course, there's Mowgli, Bagheera and Baloo, but who cannot forget Kaa, Shere Khan and Colonel Hahti? They had great moments.Phil Harris was perfect as the voice of Baloo. He would later voice Little John, another bear in Robin Hood (1973). And Sterling Holloway was excellent as the voice of Kaa, he would later voice Winnie the Pooh.The animation was crisp for 1967, very beautiful colors.

"A Well-Designed, But Cut-Rate, Animated Classic","The well-worn tale of an abandoned infant, found and raised in the wild by a caring society of jungle creatures. In this specific case, it's a pack of wolves who look after the boy, though they quickly fade away when an elder insists the child (now half-grown) be returned to human civilization. A fatherly panther and carefree bear seem much more attached, guiding him through danger and belting out various songs as they progress through the densest bits of occupied brush.The pieces are here for another true Disney classic - excellent character designs, cheerful music, superb voice acting - but the plot is watery and overly simple, while the animation largely isn't up to snuff. In contrast to the studio's famous knack for experimentation, The Jungle Book's visuals are a dull, two-dimensional affair with all manner of seams and shortcuts left in view. It's a workmanlike effort, smooth but not especially interesting, which leans on the studio's name more than it adds to it.

"Too Juvenile, Innocent & Sugarcoated For My Taste.","Disney's adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's legendary book of the same name does filter out the dark tone of its source material in an effort to make it more family friendly and certainly was a cinematic gem of its time but looking back now, it's a tad too juvenile, simple & innocent for my taste.The story of The Jungle Book follows Mowgli, a feral child raised by a family of wolves who is being escorted by Bagheera the panther to his own kind & for his own safety as Shere Khan has returned to the jungle. On their way, they meet Baloo the Bear who takes the young kid under his wing.Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, this is one of those lighthearted, sugarcoated musicals that are in tune with Disney's early animated classics & is clearly aimed at kids. The hand-drawn animation is admirable but the plot becomes repetitive after a while, is slow despite its 78 minutes runtime & nothing interesting ever happens in it.The songs aren't catchy, the dance numbers are distracting, and the overly juvenile portrait makes it a tedious film to sit through. Leaving me bored for the most part & unmoved by everything it had in store, The Jungle Book is a film that very much belongs to its era and the only way I can imagine it working today is on the strength of nostalgia.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Simple Family Fun,","The Jungle Book is a great movie with a well written storyline and a stellar voice cast. Its filled with very lovable characters, which I think is the main highlight, the relationship between Mowgli and Baloo is very sweet, Shere Khan is a great villain and King Louie is simply a delight to watch. As far as plot goes, it is very weak in comparison to other Disney classics, its extremely straight forward, lacking any extra layers to make it a more compelling story, its simply following a boy who lives in a jungle, eventually being threatened by a tiger, and is eventually saved. The musical numbers are terrific, with the likes of ""Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" always being a pleasure to hear, they are catchy, upbeat and will leave you in a good mood. Though its story may be weak for todays standards, The Jungle Book is a fun, light hearted animation that the whole family can enjoy.A boy who lives in the jungle with his animal companions is threatened by a ferocious tiger.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's underrated Jungle classic,"This is one of Disney's underrated films, and also the last that he himself supervised; he died around that time. It is a favorite in my family, and it always will be.The film is based on Rudyard Kipling's classic book, and I'm not one to compare with bonafide fans of the original book, but I love this film and the animated film version from Russia, even though I do love the original stories. Also, I love movies and stories that are set in Asia, being that the film is set in India.I love the main-title theme. It sets off the mood of the jungle. I love that scene at the beginning where Bagheera ""delivers"" baby Mowgli to the wolf family like the stork. I also love the scene with the monkey whacking Baloo (who thought the monkey was Mowgli) on the nose; that's funny.Overall, this is a very entertaining film and a song-filled celebration of friendship, fun, and adventure set in a lush and colourful world, though I am still shocked by the negativity towards it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Charming,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I have a project to try to watch all of the Disney films, so far my favorite has been Cinderella, but I have to say that this film is a bit more enjoyable. There's only one part that slightly mars the overall experience and dates the film but I'll talk about that in a moment. The animation of the characters allows them to have more personality then in a lot of the disney animated films of the time. The background also has a depth that is lacking from other contemporary disney Productions. The color of the animation works well and give a charm to the whole thing. It's just a Charming movie. The reactions of Mowgli to what happens, and his last scene of the film just shows the heart of it. Of course Baloo nearly steals the whole movie of by being such an exuberant character but he is balanced out by other personalities, most notably Bhagira and Shere Khan. Another great thing about the film is that it is a great adaptation of a classic book. It's not a literal adaptation of the Jungle Book, but it takes a hopeful strain from that book and tells a simple, story. All of the characters motivations are clear and understandable. Mowgli's friends want to protect him from shere Khan. Shere Khan doesn't want man in the forest because he has experience with human Hunters, and King Louie wants to harness the power of fire for his own purposes. I really liked the film, talk about a few problems with it. The first is a really small detail, but orangutans never lived in India. It makes sense for the purpose of this story because it seems more natural that an ape would want to be a human rather than a monkey a monkey, it's not realistic. Like a lot of other Disney films this one starts out with a warning that you will watch some racist content, and I while I do think that this is one of the rare occasions where disney is being over cautious. The characters character's are based on the mannerisms of their actors and king Louie's mannerisms are based on Louis Prima who is not African-American but Italian-American. The problem I had it with the film and it's a very small problem is the characterization of the vultures, they are clearly meant to refer to the Beatles, and those characters were written with them in mind but John Lennon decided that he didn't want to appear in any animation, which is kind of a tragedy because I think if the animators had used their personalities like with the other actors the characters would have been much more interesting and not parodies. At the time everyone would have known who the Beatles are and I think as the years go by the cultural impact of the Beatles has diminished to the point where the the joke Falls flat. But that's the only problem I have with this film, it's great and full of charm. You've never watched it I would definitely recommend it..",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Twizard Rating: 90,"The Jungle Book is one of those movies that we seem to remember in glimpses. We know the musical numbers and all the characters, but unless we've seen it as an adult, we can't quite remember exactly what happens.But we know it's iconic. We know it's a Disney classic. However, this film may have benefited from being a tad bit longer. There are too many characters we'd love to see more of and so many chances to build up the depths of our leads.Although I do like this movie a great deal for nostalgia's sake, I wouldn't constitute it as one of Disney's best. The songs are top notch, and the characters are memorable, but it's missing a lot of heart compared to the studio's gems of the same era.When Mowgli leaves his wolf family at the beginning of the film, there is no heartfelt goodbye. These are the creatures who raised him, and he barely bats an eye as Bagheera leads him on his way to the ""man village"" to escape the tiger, Shere Khan, who's trying to kill him. And without giving anything away, there are also a couple of key scenes towards the end that should have given us a little more sentiment.Which leads me to the voice of Mowgli. The kid playing him has no feel or emotion. It sounds as though he's simply reading the lines (or having them read to him) straight off the paper. It's our main character, and his voice lacks any true conviction.Granted, this was released in 1967, a year that marks, for many, the beginning of Disney's ""dark period"". It's still a beloved movie, and rightfully so. It's filled with some iconic scenes. The one with King Louie, for example. It's so good, you wish you had been treated with just a few more glimpses of the antihero.It's the darker, more twisted, tone that drives this film the most between the catchy musical sequences. It encompasses the jungle-feel very precisely, and transcends through from Rudyard Kipling's original source material, despite Walt trying to prevent it. Everywhere Mowgli turns, there's someone out to kill him.I know it sounds like I'm berating this film a lot, but I actually love The Jungle Book. It's one that I watched often as a kid and one that still makes me smile as I watch it as an adult. Luckily, this film won't face many new critics as mostly everyone has seen it by the time they are old enough to care.

"The last of the animated features produced by Walt Disney, and it's a good one","This is one of many Disney flicks I remember from my childhood, but unlike many of them, I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing. From an early age, I was familiar with two of its songs, ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wan'na Be Like You"". I first heard those on an album of songs from animated Disney movies, and then saw where they came from. I also saw the live action 1994 film of the same name on the big screen. I've watched a bunch of full-length Disney cartoons again in recent years, some produced by Walt Disney himself and some made after his death. It took me a while to get around to ""The Jungle Book"", but I finally rented it a few days ago, and as usual with these movies, I still found this one entertaining after all these years.In the jungles of India, a panther named Bagheera finds a human baby boy (or ""man cub"") in a boat wreck, far from the nearest human village. He takes the boy to a pack of wolves for the parents to raise him with their newborn cubs. The boy's name is Mowgli, and he lives in the jungle for the next ten years. The wolves then learn that Shere Khan, a human-hating tiger, is back in the jungle, and Mowgli will have to be returned to the ""man village"" to be safe! Bagheera volunteers to take him back, but Mowgli is reluctant, as he wants to stay in the jungle. On the way, they encounter creatures that make the journey more challenging, and after the two of them separate due to the human boy's resistance, Mowgli meets a bear named Baloo. This laid back bear teaches him about living a care-free lifestyle, and he now wants to live with him, but Shere Khan is still a major threat, especially after he learns that there's a human in the jungle!Like many other Disney movies, one thing that helps this film's entertainment level is the animation, most notably the backgrounds here. You obviously can't expect the computer generated backgrounds we see today, but the backgrounds here are still beautiful with the faded colours, especially the green. The story isn't the most interesting one I've ever seen, at least not early in the film, and for a while, I kind of wondered if it was enough to carry the film. Fortunately, I think it gets better along the way, and is often suspenseful, without being too scary. There are also a number of memorable characters, including the lovable Baloo (I might have been introduced to him as a little kid with ""TaleSpin""), Kaa the Snake, King Louie the Ape, Shere Khan, and the vultures based on the Beatles. A lot of the characters provide comic relief. The voice acting is mostly good, with the exception of Bruce Reitherman as Mowgli. The songs are not the best to ever be featured in an animated Disney film, but they are acceptable.This was the last animated feature, of many, that Walt Disney produced in his career, and it came into theatres nearly a year after his death. It was apparently a box office success, which it deserved to be. It showed that Disney's movie franchise was still going strong thirty years after the release of the flick that started it, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". I'm not familiar with the source material (a collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling), which is usually the case with me and these Disney adaptations, but judging this version of ""The Jungle Book"" just as a film, I think it's good family entertainment, and obviously many would agree with me. There may be more for kids in the film than there is for adults, but many adults could enjoy it as well (that can be said about any good Disney movie), adults who still like animated family adventures.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Timeless.,"This movie is one of the most remarkable of my childhood and I am sure it was part of the childhood of hundreds of other children. It tells the story of a human child who is found and raised by animals in the middle of the Indian jungle, living there until being forced to return to the human village due to the hatred that Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger, fed to humans due to the hunt. It is a light adaptation of a famous novel of the Victorian era. Visually, it is a magnificent movie, using the luxuriant Indian forest to brighten the screen. The animations were very well done and the colors are great, just like most of the sound effects. Its one of the animations of the Disney's golden age that more focuses on song, with several being created for it. Most of them have been in the ears of generations, like ""Wanna be like you"" or ""Bare Neccessities"". There are some critics who advocate the idea that the use of black jazz rhythms at a moment when many monkeys appear is a symptom of racism or prejudice. I don't know to what extent that was the intention but I feel it is something to be devalued. After all, the film has been done for decades and, especially in recent years, social censorship points out all that can, even slightly and unintentionally, have racist connotations, in a nonsense witch hunt that is as dangerous as the racism itself. Controversy aside, it's a timeless movie that will definitely continue to make the delights of kids and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Huge Disney classic with some of the best songs,"This movie follows the trend of the era with raw drawings (not as much as the two previous films though), but the animation steps up with some marvelous work, mostly on humanoid characters, namely Mowgli and the apes. The apes showcase two other strong points of this film.One is characters. The slightly unhappy episodic nature of the movie is lifted by the charming characters that populate the screen. With the exception of the vultures, all of them are memorable. And this is probably linked to the other big plus of the movie: music.The Jungle Book is arguably the Disney feature most packed with hit songs, all thanks to the Sherman brothers. Every character comes with their song, with the exception of Shere Khan, a true villain too serious for that. And almost every song is a masterpiece, all but one: once again the vultures'.I must add that the final encounter/song of the movie is rather sexist for today's standards.

This movie succeeds in it's simple goal to bypass all that and just entertain you.The story is inspired by the classic books written by Rudyard Kipling. We follow the man-cub Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman in an appealing performance) as he treks from the jungle to the man-village. Along the way he encounters a strange parade of figures including the sniveling Kaa (voiced by the great Sterling Holloway), the evil Shere Khan (George Sanders) and the rambunctious King Louie (Louis Prima, who gets the film's best song).His two parental figures are Baloo the Bear and the sage Bagaheera. They are voiced by Phil Harris and Sebastian Cabot and their chemistry together really makes the triangle of Mowgli, the bear and the panther really work. It is probably the most dysfunctional family ever seen in a Disney film.Everything else works just fine. The songs are cute and catchy, the characters interact well with each other, the setting is stylish and the ending is a departure from the clichéd happy ending. This one feels more ambiguous but altogether more satisfying.Although there are some things that will make P.C. nuts squawk (the alleged racism) and the animation buffs cringe (the reused animation) that doesn't change the fact that ""The Jungle Book"" is fun, unique, jolly, and full of heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still my favorite Disney flick,"After seeing what Walt Disney's studios have given us throughout the millenium, The Jungle Book remains as my most favorite. There's no over-the-top animation that we are used to seeing nowdays, just a plain simple story of a little orphan boy who wants to stay in the jungle.All the characters are memorable and the songs and music is catchy.

Best Animated Disney Film,"With my grandfather, watched many Disney films, including Mary Poppins, Three Caballeros, and Jungle Book. Jungle Book is the only Platinum Disney DVD that i bought for myself. The others ones i had were gifts. No other Disney film gives me that happy feeling like Jungle Book. The voices were great, and the songs worked perfectly. This was Walt's last animated picture, and was in my opinion, his best. He shrived for character and personality, not story. In fact, i love the characters so much, that i forget what the story is sometimes. This was Disney at its best. Animators proved that the Disney spirit still lived on. Jungle Book is not as well designed as Lion King or the other ""Disney Renaissance"" films, but this was a carefree funny family movie. 10/10, best animated movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I heartily recommend it and I'm 76 years young. I remember Phil Harris (Baloo) with fondness; Louis Prima (The Monkey King)- an excellent musician; George Sanders (Shere Khan) - the most wonderful villain ever; Sterling Holloway (Kaa) - a snake of the highest order. Such a wonderful selection of voices for the characters and personalities. NObody 'swings' like Baloo. I especially loved Mowgli's expressions upon meeting the girl-man-child. The animators got his 'stunned' expression perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Jungle VIP Returns!,"Walt Disney's animated classic, ""The Jungle Book,"" gets the platinum treatment on its latest appearance on DVD. This wonderful tale, fully restored with vibrant colors and excellent audio, tells the story of Mowgli, a man-cub, and his black panther father-figure, Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), as the latter attempts to get the boy back to the man-village where he belongs before the wicked and mighty tiger, Shere Khan (George Sanders), can get his claws into him. Along the way they meet up with the one and only jungle VIP, King Louie (wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima), Kaa the python (Sterling Holloway), everybody's favorite bear, Baloo (Phil Harris) and some wisecracking vultures. This platinum edition features an excellent digital restoration, a number of excellent documentaries, games, a visit with ""Rocky the Rhino,"" who found his way to the cutting room floor, and plenty of other extras. There's also a passable Jonas Brothers cover of Louis Prima's ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" that's sure to attract the attention of pre-teen girls the world over. This particular DVD is also a Disney Movie Rewards disc, meaning that you can gain points for purchasing it. While some squabble over the aspect ratio of the film, I think that the story, music, and characters are far too valuable to pass up because of this. If you don't own ""The Jungle Book"" and consider yourself a Disney fan, make sure you buy this disc before Disney takes it away again. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is NOT Kipling.,"Disney's ""The Jungle Book"" was an epic dissapointment for me. I love animation and am normally very pleased with the studio's films (I find now that they get about one right per decade). But ""The Jungle Book"" is a complete contradiction of the original text. I love the voices selected for the characters, no question, and the animation is superb. The introduction perfectly catches the book's feel, with the narrative by Bagheera. The characters are well balanced (although I must declare that I really do find Phil Harris to be funny).. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the story is that Disney instructed the supervisors of this film NOT to read the book while making the film. It shows. The plot is without the complications of the book, the characters make brief appearances (Kaa, Hathi, etc..) and then vanish. Maybe I'm just upset because they left out Ming the Bat. I don't know. They also decided to turn it into a pseudo-jazz musical.. I don't know about that either. I just prefer the book. There's too much sugar in the Disney version, the songs aren't GREAT, and the two human characters are irritating little prigs. I dunno about this movie, maybe I'd have more fun with it if I hadn't read the book. Pinocchio was anything BUT Collodi, but that's a good thing. This is just plain wrong.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Not an Epic, But Iconic Nonetheless","In recent years, Disney has become associated with epic-scale storytelling with films like Frozen and The Lion King - big stories, big scenery, big songs. This film - the last Walt Disney personally supervised - is much more small-scale. It has a simple plot - a panther attempts to return a boy raised by wolves to his own kind before he draws the attention of a human-hating tiger. And yet, that thin premise becomes a clothesline from which to hang some utterly delightful characters - a stuffy elephant General, a scat-singing monkey king, a hypnotic snake, and the aforementioned tiger, who is clearly the template for the later villain Scar. And then, there's the heart of the film - the laid-back, hippie/beatnik bear Baloo and the uptight panther Bagheera. Their Odd Couple chemistry drives the film and provides plenty of laughs. No grand premise? No problem! Sure, there's some peripheral details that seem a tad dated - like the Beatle haircuts on the vultures and some of Baloo's hipster lingo - but that won't stop today's kids from enjoying the film. If this was a part of your childhood, you'll take great pleasure in revisiting it - and sharing it with the next generation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Walt Disney's Last Movie,"This was the final movie Walt Disney has created before his death. And what he has made was worth the swan song. The Jungle Book is a really fun movie that I think would be worth being in the jungle. While it may play safe due to how it's not much faithful to the story it was based on, it wouldn't stop from having funny characters that serve a lot of likability, a decent plot we can follow, and very catchy songs worth remembering, along with fantastic animation. Maybe Disney himself would've done better if he does make the movie a lot more faithful rather than cutting off some of those scenes, but I can forgive him for the fun he has made. I think this movie will be worth watching for anyone that wants to watch a film to have fun. I won't consider this the biggest classic, but I do think Disney did a good job the best he can to adapt the story of Mowgli. Walt Disney may have done some things that may make him seem like a horrible man, but we will never forget movies like this one we can admire on growing up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's very best,"Listed as number 19 in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, The Jungle Book is one of the House of Mouse's most beloved films. Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, Disney demanded a sure-fire hit after the underwhelming response to The Sword in the Stone (1963) and removed any hints of the darkness of Kipling's text in favour of a more child-friendly experience. The last movie to be produced by Walt before his death in 1966, the result is one of the most effortlessly charming films he ever presided over. Featuring possibly the most memorable and catchy song in Disney's history (Bare Necessities), he at least he went out on a high note.Mowgli (voiced by director Wolfgang Reitherman's son, Bruce) is a young orphan boy who, after being discovered in the deep jungle in a basket by Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot), is raised for the next 10 years in a wolf pack. After learning that the monstrous, man-eating tiger Shere Khan (a wonderful George Sanders) has returned to the jungle, the pack decide that Mowgli must be taken to the nearby 'man-village' to be with own people for his own safety. Bagheera volunteers to escort him to safety, but he soon becomes frustrated with Mowgli's insistence on staying in the jungle and leaves him the hands of Baloo (Phil Harris), a laid-back bear who promises Mowgli to never take him to the man-village.With animation far below the standard set by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and a group of insufferable vultures modelled on the Beatles, The Jungle Book remains great despite its flaws by being so damn heart-warming. The final scene, as Mowgli gazes upon one of his own kind for the first time, is truly wonderful in its unsentimental simplicity. The music, by the Sherman Brothers and Terry Gilkyson, is one of Disney's best soundtracks, with Louis Prima's jazzy I Wanna Be Like You proving particularly toe-tapping. Cabot and Harris are fun as Mowgli's bickering escorts, but Sanders and Sterling Holloway - as the hypnotising Kaa the Snake - steal the show as the bad guys. One of Disney's very best.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The King of the Jungle,"Criticising The Jungle Book - or Disney's most popular film titles generally - is probably seen as close to heresy in some quarters. After all, it's just for kids, right? Wrong - it's the things that are 'just for kids' which are often the most insidious. It's where layers of misty-eyed memories and nostalgia prevent a clear assessment of what's on offer, or how dated or questionable a favourite story can be. Fear of 'reading too much into it' often precludes critical engagement.The Jungle Book has many strengths (and the rating I have given it echoes that feeling). Its characterisation is bold and colourful. Sherman and Gilkyson's songs are justifiably classics. Bruns' music is evocative and apt. The plot is well paced and structured. If the animation is not outstanding (particularly when compared to the triumphs of Fantasia and Snow White) it remains perfectly adequate. And yet, and yet...Why the hesitation? Elements of racism in the movie are certainly stumbling blocks. Louis Prima, although Italian, sings like a black and to modern eyes at least his monkey-man routine should be taken less lightly than it usually is. Baloo speaks for himself, jive daddy talk and all in comfortably stereotypical fashion. Creatures with dignity and power, in contrast, like Shere Khan or Bagheera, tend to have upper class 'English' accents implying disapproving class and authority.Then there is the question of women - or rather the absence or them. Mowgli one of the long line of orphans in Disney animations (an honourable exception being 101 Dalmations which, constrained by an original, actually has both surviving mother and father figures for the main characters). Sadly Mowgli is one who merely encounters one potential father figure after another. When a female of his own species finally appears, at the end of the film, she is diminutive, housework orientated and apart from singing, singularly bereft of conversation. For the Disney animators, the whole forest is a male playground, one created for jokey bonding and Mowgli's rite of passage, in a scheme that is especially peculiar to the studio. The only exception to this rule of thumb is Colonel Hathi's wife, and remains in vaguely mutinous isolation, happy to support Mowgli in his quest.Disney's cutsie anthropomorphism is such a common occurrence in his output that it seems natural and all of a piece here. Indeed so used are we to this way of showing nature, that sometimes we forget what we know must be the truth. This is a world, like all of the studio's others, where animals are treated either as objects or, more reassuringly as 'people' with no species life of their own. Its the ideal jungle for Uncle Walt: no creature need be considered at all except in human terms, and everything knows its place. Nature, normally 'red in tooth and claw', sings a comic song for its living, and then is divided into a facetious social system of character actors, ugly and sweet, cunning and charmingly dozy.And what of Mowgli's journey, his travelling from place to place, from animal kingdom to man-village and from childhood to the brink of manhood? At first sight it seems to be a rite of passage, a period of trial bringing him to maturity. But Mowgli actually learns very little. All Baloo teaches him is how to eat fruit without worrying about the little unnecessary issues in life. His fight with Shere Khan springs more from ignorance and stubbornness than any acquired sense of self preservation or knowledge. Mowgli make some temporary friendships, grows dewy eyed at his first sight of a female.. and that's about it. As a moral journey, it is a failure. (A similar vagueness attends Pinnochio's 'education' where any benefits of experience are overruled by the Good Fairy's largesse) If The Jungle Book intends to provide a lesson of some sort during Mowgli's procession through the undergrowth, then it fails.Millions have enjoyed Disney's classic before and will do so in future. But at least if we face some of the issues raised, and take a critical look at a characteristic reworking of the source material, it will make the walk through the jungle more interesting.",,Anonymous,Animation

Simply Amazing.,"The Jungle Book is a Disney adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's collection of short stories. The story starts of with a back story of our main character named ""Mowgli"". We also meet the black panther known as ""Bagheera"". The plot is that a child has been found in the jungle and has been delivered to a family of wolves to be taken care of, but time passes and the other animals begin to see that he does not belong in the jungle, and that he belongs with the other men in the village. This idea soon becomes interrupted when another one of the main characters ""Baloo"" he flips Mowgli's world upside down and gives him a new feel on life. After talking to Baloo, Mowgli then decides that he wants to stay in the jungle and never leave his new friend. Disney brings a wonderful twist to the writings of Kipling, the animation is rustic and delivers that old time charm. The characters really do grow on you and you start to develop a connection to them as the story progresses further. The musical numbers in this movie are truly magical, and range among the greatest of Disney. From beginning to end the songs just get better and better. This movie is for audiences of all ages and is really a masterpiece to behold. Overall, this movie delivers a steady plot with lovable characters and memorable music.

Twizard Rating: 90,"The Jungle Book is one of those movies that we seem to remember in
glimpses. We know the musical numbers and all the characters, but
unless we've seen it as an adult, we can't quite remember exactly what
happens.But we know it's iconic. We know it's a Disney classic. However, this
film may have benefited from being a tad bit longer. There are too many
characters we'd love to see more of and so many chances to build up the
depths of our leads.Although I do like this movie a great deal for nostalgia's sake, I
wouldn't constitute it as one of Disney's best. The songs are top
notch, and the characters are memorable, but it's missing a lot of
heart compared to the studio's gems of the same era.When Mowgli leaves his wolf family at the beginning of the film, there
is no heartfelt goodbye. These are the creatures who raised him, and he
barely bats an eye as Bagheera leads him on his way to the ""man
village"" to escape the tiger, Shere Khan, who's trying to kill him. And
without giving anything away, there are also a couple of key scenes
towards the end that should have given us a little more sentiment.Which leads me to the voice of Mowgli. The kid playing him has no feel
or emotion. It sounds as though he's simply reading the lines (or
having them read to him) straight off the paper. It's our main
character, and his voice lacks any true conviction.Granted, this was released in 1967, a year that marks, for many, the
beginning of Disney's ""dark period"". It's still a beloved movie, and
rightfully so. It's filled with some iconic scenes. The one with King
Louie, for example. It's so good, you wish you had been treated with
just a few more glimpses of the antihero.It's the darker, more twisted, tone that drives this film the most
between the catchy musical sequences. It encompasses the jungle-feel
very precisely, and transcends through from Rudyard Kipling's original
source material, despite Walt trying to prevent it. Everywhere Mowgli
turns, there's someone out to kill him.I know it sounds like I'm berating this film a lot, but I actually love
The Jungle Book. It's one that I watched often as a kid and one that
still makes me smile as I watch it as an adult. Luckily, this film
won't face many new critics as mostly everyone has seen it by the time
they are old enough to care. That's one of the beautiful things about
these old epitomes of animation.Twizard Rating: 90",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Walt Disney Classic that Created My Fifth Grade Memories,"I gotta say this is a true Walt Disney Classic. I was obsessed with this movie back in fifth grade and into my middle school years. This 1967 movie is my favorite version of The Jungle Book. I discovered the book when I was very little but I didn't know any of the character names except for Mowgli. However, when I read the book again years later, I learned all their names. I gotta say Mowgli is very relatable because he's about to experience change that he's nervous about. However, he ends up embracing the change at the end of the movie. I have a comfort zone myself and sometimes have to step outside of it. Mowgli loves the jungle very much that he doesn't want to leave it as we know. There's a village across the jungle known as The Man Village and that's where Bagheera the Panther persuades him to be as Shere Khan the bloodthirsty and man eating tiger is a threat to him. I can't decide who my favorite character is but I'd definitely choose either Mowgli, Baloo, or Bagheera. I love Baloo because of his fun loving and carefree characteristics. I also think that this movie takes place during the dark ages because none of the humans go to school and are working in the village. Especially Mowgli since he was raised by wolves in the jungle. I presume he learned basic grammer from the wolves. I also feel bad for Mowgli as he barely has any clothes expect a red underwear. Bagheera was right about Mowgli not being able to survive in the jungle as Shere Khan isn't the only dangerous animal in the jungle. Kaa the Python is also a dangerous animal as he tried to devour Mowgli after hypnotizing him. I gotta say Kaa is creepy as most snakes are and I for one do not trust him whatsoever. Furthermore, another way I can relate to Mowgli is admiration for nice girls. For Example, Mowgli instantly liked a girl coming from The Man Village. I also have admiration for nice girls I meet. I was very charismatic with girls back in high school and I have friends that are girls. Whenever I think of this movie, it brings back memories from fifth grade since I watched this movie a lot back then.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's simple that's it needed to be,"Disney in general has made numerous films that are deeply layered with themes that first time viewers may not recognize. It's one of the reasons why Disney is so successful at making films. They also have their fair share of poor writing too but the entirety of them is not as voluminous as the ones many people remember and enjoy. Even with this though, Disney has also made films that weren't as richly textured and scaled up to a more complex level of understanding. That is not to say that the movies that are simpler are lower on an intellectual basis, no. Instead, they are just as influential if not more because of just how simple they are compared to Disney's other laminous movies. It would seem most of these particular types of films would go back to Disney's classical period of all their hand drawn animated features that everyone considers classics today. Of this group of films, the film that best represents the one note feature is this movie. It doesn't explore much other than one plot and that's fine.The movie is based off of the ""Mowgli Stories"" written by Rudyard Kipling. Audiences are introduced to Mowgli, an orphaned boy in the middle of the jungle who is found and observed by Bagheera the panther as he's raised by a wolf pack. After 10 years word gets out that Shere Khan the tiger is returning to kill Mowgli, so Bagheera decides to try and bring Mowgli back to the man village. The problem is, Mowgli won't go because he loves the jungle and all of his friends are there. Helping solidify his belief that the jungle is where he belongs is Baloo the bear. A lackadaisical beanbag that loves to just enjoy his surroundings. Adapted by the writers of Bambi (1942), Peter Pan (1953), Robin Hood (1973) and 101 Dalmatians (1960), it's obvious to why mostly everything about what goes on in this feature film is so amiable. The characters and the voice actors that play the characters are exceptionally fun and likable to watch on screen.Of the cast, the only one who is still living is Bruce Reitherman who voiced Mowlgi. At the time he was only 12 and his voice matches the look of Mowlgi well. Today Reitherman has filled other filmmaking positions but mostly has appeared as himself for various documentaries. Voicing Bagheera was Sebastian Cabot, who speaks from time to time but also narrates. Some might recognize him as the narrator to all the classic Whinnie the Pooh tales as well. Phil Harris as the lazy bear Baloo doesn't stray far from his natural voice but nonetheless has made Baloo one the more memorable characters from this period in the mouse house's filmography. Shere Khan the tiger played by George Sanders was amazing. Naturally the voice matches the presence of Khan and although he's the antagonist, there's a lot to like about him too. There's also appearances from Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake, Louis Prima as King Louie of the Apes and J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi the Elephant.There's really only one thing that should be addressed and that's the fact of how sexism plays a small role. It's difficult to say without giving it away but there's a moment where it plays a turning point for a character. Fine, it's understandable but at the same time more than just one character could've played a part to help serve their purpose for the turning point. This was a different time when the movie was made but it seems a bit one sided. This is it though, the animation still has the Disney classic look to it and it's important to know that animating is a very time consuming task so kudos to those who worked on that part of the film. There are a number of other discrepancies that don't make sense like why is called the jungle book when it really doesn't have to do with a book except the intro. Or how is that Kaa can hypnotize his victims with his eyes so easily. At this point, these are questions that are just asking for too much, so it's not needed.The songs are also very catchy. With lyrics written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert M. Sherman, the same song writers from The Parent Trap (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963) and Mary Poppins (1964), how could one not see why the songs in this film are so timeless. It's hard to find anybody who doesn't enjoy or at least tap a toe for ""Bare Necessities"", ""I Wanna Be Like You"" or ""We're Your Friends"". For the film score, George Bruns composed the music. Bruns also composed the film scores to 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Love Bug (1968), Herbie Rides Again (1974) and Robin Hood (1973). For this feature, the music again calls back to the classic Disney sound of orchestras from that time. There are a lot of strings, trumpets and drums. Plus considering the setting is in the jungle, it suitably fits. If still works, then there's obviously no reason to knock it then.The writing is very simplistic and that is all the story needed. It does suffer from one apparent sin at a certain point in a story arc but the voice acting, animation and music make it difficult to really fault it at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, it tells the story of Mowgli, a small boy abandoned in the jungle and raised by wild wolves and various other jungle animals, including a panther, a bear and some vultures.What sets The Jungle Book apart from the other Disney films of the same era is the overall quality of all of its parts. Granted, the animation style is still a bit rough thanks to the Xerox method used to essentially copy and paste certain frames so as to cut corners. But it is a lot better than in the other films they made with it, plus the characters designs are a lot better than was the norm. The songs by the Sherman Brothers are some of the most memorable Disney has ever done and are only surpassed by those in Mary Poppins.Plus the story and the characters are a lot of fun, and the whole narrative flows absolutely without a hitch, depicting Mowgli's journey out of the jungle as they find out that Shere Khan, the tiger, is returning and is sure to kill any human he comes across.If I had to name one flaw, I'd say that the villain is something of a letdown in the end. At first he's great, and I totally understand why he's considered one of the strongest Disney villains. Plus it's great that he has something of a competitor in Kaa, the python. But the final confrontation with him and Mowgli was an extreme disappointment, not going to lie. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.But, aside from that, The Jungle Book is a great deal of fun. Do check out this born classic, you're not going to regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
First Class Family Entertainment,"The Jungle Book is the first movie that I saw in a theater.I was seven in 1967 and I can still remember being totally captivated by the movie and leaving the theater as if returning from another world.I later watched it several times with my own son starting when he was five years old. I enjoyed it as much as he did, and there is a lot to enjoy about this movie. The story is engaging, the animation is impressive, the music is great, and the characters are charming.This is unquestionably a classic film that has and will endure. It is excellent entertainment for the whole family; worth watching over and over with your children and grand children.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
watch out for the many  inferior knockoff versions out there,"simply put,this animated film is lots of fun.with great catch songs,fun action,and it's funny.the characters are also colourful.the voice talents are great,as well.i can't imagine more appropriate voices for the characters.the whole family can enjoy this gem.unfortunately there are a few different inferior versions of this film out that have capitalized on the Jungle Book name but they don't compare to the Disney version.if you haven't seen it yet,i'd recommend it highly.you can't go wrong,in my opinion.just make sure it's the Disney version and not one of the many other cheap knock off versions.for me,Disney's The Jungle Book is a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
classics,"After watching the new Jungle book, I also wanted to remind myself the first movie. It is much less action (well the new one is kind of horror..). Definitely its is muh more suitable for children. More humorous and less serious, but the main story remains. And the great animation is admirable considering the age of the movie..",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The last movie of Walt Disney,"This is undoubtedly one of Walt Disney's best classics (and the last one too), the story is very good, the characters are so, and the fact that the film is a bit educational (since the animals are very similar to real life). Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just awesome!,"Everything is just right! The plot, the drawings, the animations, the music. It couldn't be done any better!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
sing-along beautiful animation,"In one of Walt Disney's classics, Bagheera the panther offers to take Mowgli, a young boy, to the man village before the evil tiger Shere Khan gets to him.This family adventure is a classic, made so by a beautiful sentimental plot about human emotions, including loyalty, sensitivity and most importantly love. And these human emotions are decoded through the animals of the jungle.With the enchanting and fun loving actions of Baloo the bear and the honest and hard actions of Bagheera, do audiences get that true feel of the human spirit, and the facts of life, to have fun, but to face the truth as well, which is also reflected in some of the most catchy and enjoyable songs ever created for a Disney picture.""The Bear Necessities"", ""Trust in me"" and ""That's what friends are for"" are the brightest gems to have ever been written and are beautifully directed and told through humorous and delightful techniques by the team.Though the plot can be a little slow at times, the characters are all joys to watch, particularly the bad guys Khan and Kaa, who light up the film in their own dark way. Khan's dialogue is perhaps the best ever written for an animated villain and even in my adult years I find him chilling to watch.The film explores the depths of the jungle with a keen interest in different animals, which are explored in a comic fashion from the forgettable elephant to the bored vultures, the Jungle Book simply has everything.From an excellent plot, to the wonderful sing-along songs, it is a true landmark in the animation genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it more than I thought I would,"I don't remember whether I watched it as a kid, but these days I always put it off cause I didn't think I'd find it fun. And then I did. It's really funny, warm, with an incredible soundtrack too, I really loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A childhood favorite of mine, cranked out by Walt Disney, the man himself!","I grew up with this movie, and I still love it. Here's why:1. The animation, done by six of Disney's Nine Old Men, is absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully crafted. Every background shows a lot of depth, detail and richness, and all the character movements are extremely fluid and expressive. Bonus points for all of it being hand-drawn!2. So many great, enjoyable characters! Mowgli the Man-Cub is such a charming, irresistible boy. Baloo the Bear is so humorous and fun-loving, how can anyone not love him? Bagheera the Panther is very appealingly wise, loyal and reasonable. King Louie the Orangutan is so unbelievably fun and entertaining, that he's one of the most unforgettable characters in the movie. And of course, Shere Khan the Tiger is a very memorable villain, with a lot of personality!3. Great voice-acting! Bruce Reitherman's energetic, happy-go-lucky voice performance as Mowgli was excellent. Phil Harris really brought out the enjoyable laid-back nature in Baloo. Sebastian Cabot was appropriately sarcastic and strict as Bagheera. Sterling Holloway (the original voice of Winnie the Pooh) was definitely the right choice for Kaa the Snake, because he could really capture that ""sneaky snake"" vibe in his performance. George Sanders did a fantastic job voicing Shere Khan, and really brought out the beast in him. Louis Prima really showed his trademark wacky and fun attitude as the voice of King Louie.3. The music! George Bruns's magnificent score is VERY Indian-sounding and really depicts the mood in every scene. Also, all the songs are astoundingly catchy to listen to (especially Baloo and Mowgli's iconic song ""The Bare Necessities"" and King Louie's delightfully jazzy ""I Wanna Be Like You"").4. So many well-timed funny moments, such as Kaa falling out of the tree!5. The final battle is epic, especially the part where Mowgli scares off Shere Khan by tying a flaming branch to his tail.6. A wonderful ending, in which Mowgli finally decides to go to the Man Village, where he rightfully belongs.In short, this movie is an absolute masterpiece! It's a shame that Disney himself died before the movie was released and never got to see it for himself. But if only he'd hung for 1 more year, he'd have been very proud of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's memorable films and definitely the last film he ever worked on.,"OK guys, here's what I'm going to do. This is definitely one of Disney's last films. Me and my friend Harry loved it. We were quoting all the lines all the way through and I've said it before and I'll say it again, it is so much fun. The songs are memorable, The March Song, I Wanna Be Like You, Trust In Me, That's What Friends Are For and the one The Bare Necessities. My favorite part about this film is Baloo singing The Bare Necessities. There are all that I really love like I Wanna Be Like You and The March Song. The music sounds the same much like from Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, The Sword in the Stone and others. I even found the opening music creepy when I was a kid, well not that creepy. The villain is brilliant and he's name is Shere Khan and he hates men and do whatever it to kill Mowgli. Bagheera has all the loyalty he can get. By the way, Bagheera is not just a cat he's a panther, a black panther and he sure reminds me of the pink panther. Well that's it, that's The Jungle Book the last Disney classic he had ever made. You'll enjoy the characters, the animation and the catchiest songs ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Abearsolutley necessity to watch this movie!,"What can we say about the Jungle Book, every song is a single along kids karaoke classic, the animation is just amazing, its a wonderful story about adventure and friendship that we love to sit down and watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the kids. They enjoy it just as much as we do and we remember sitting around on those same lazy Sunday afternoons watching it with our parents. What's more anybody who was in the cub scout movement knows the story because all the troupe leaders took their names from the story.This film brings tears to my eyes just thinking of all the happy memories I can associate it with. Wherever life leads you as you get older, if you feel down watch this film and it will cheer you up guaranteed!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my Favorites from Growing Up,"This is a movie that was a staple of my childhood. My sister and I would watch this one regularly. Looking back, I'm not sure if it was because of the animals being main characters or the songs, but this one was fun. Now I tried to get my daughter, Mackenzie, to sit down and watch this with me, but she got bored halfway through. It was only the music that kept attracting her attention.I knew that this was based on stories, but I can never remember the author. It looks like the jungle book stories are from Rudyard Kipling and they're following the boy of Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman). He is the man cub that was raised by wolves thanks to Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot).When Mowgli is around ten, he's said that he must leave the jungle. This is hard for him since that is all he knows. The reason though is that Shere Khan (voiced by George Sanders), a tiger, hates men and will kill him. The wolfpack cannot protect him. Mowgli doesn't understand. Bagheera tries to explain it to him during their journey to a village of people. It is on this journey that he meets Baloo (voiced by Phil Harris), who wants Mowgli to be a bear like him. There are run ins with Kaa (voiced by Sterling Holloway), a snake who wants to eat him, or King Louie (voiced by Louis Prima), who will allow him to live amongst the monkeys if he teaches him the secret of 'man's red fire'. Shere Khan learns of the boy and is also on the prowl.What I'll say is that this is still a fun movie. It moves a good pace of introducing Mowgli, how he ends up in the jungle and then him needing to return to the land of people. We get fun characters along the way. Ones I haven't said are Col. Hathi (voiced by J. Pat O'Malley) and his brigand of elephants, including a baby voiced by Clint Howard. There are also vultures who want to help. The musical numbers from Baloo and King Louie are fun. This also gets tense as Shere Khan gets ever closer to the boy.I'll then end this out with filmmaking. If you know me, I'm a sucker for this old school, hand drawn animation. Watching my DVD on a 4K TV with a player that upscales made this look great. This is one that I hope my daughter comes around on so we can share that experience.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic!,"the songs, the characters, the story. this movie has it all. there is such heart and love and adventure in this story and it has a great message about animals and humans and their relationship together.

"A feel-good classic adventure, Walt Disney's last film","Another Disney classic, this is a feel-good adventure that had me smiling the whole time, even though there are some moments of danger. The plot is a bit disjointed and episodic, but the songs and the general charm more than make up for that. The animation is fine, not as wonderful as in the early Golden Age of Disney but the character design is excellent. It has some of the more memorable Disney characters, and the animals are very expressive, as usual. This was the last movie in which Walt Disney was directly involved, and he died before it was finished. Rating: 9/10",,Anonymous,Animation
Love this film!,"Watching this as a much older man then when i first viewed it all those years ago as a young child, I found I was taken back to that magical place again, and I have to admit I cried at the end when Mowgli has to join the humansIt still as funny as I had remembered, and th animation was still amazing to look at, even more vibrant than before.It's a remarkable film in which even the villains - the snake and tiger - weren't too evil or frightening. Thus, little kids should be okay with this.The movie;s main song,is ""The Bare Necessitites,"" a catchy tune that is still fun to hear but my favourite song in the whole is the song the snake sings'trust in me' i still know the lyrics to this day, and I just love the lisping character voice.Go buy it, go rent it and enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Animation
