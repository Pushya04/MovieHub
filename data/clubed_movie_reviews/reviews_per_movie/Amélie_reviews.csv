Finds its charm in the little things,"'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film.We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Incredibly Adorable & Phenomenally Fantastic...,"If ever there was a film to make you smile, grin and beam from ear to ear with such great style, as a delightful Amelie, shows immense tenacity, helping those who need a break with joy and glee!One of the most enjoyable films you'll ever have the pleasure to devour.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Colorful and vibrant and charming!!!,"I have mixed feeling about Amelie. Stunning and exquisite cinematography, colors, clothing, environment, music, set, mood, everything about the movie. Except the plot/dialogue. Which bored me in the middle.This movie took me into another world. The setting and environment , is something else. I feel like i want to experience it someday. In Paris, with the vibrant colors, clothes, cafe, the neighborhood. Also the little details in the movie. Enjoyed this aspect of the movie.However, the story i didn't like. Except for the happy ending. The movie was scattered and random, you don't know where it's going to the point it feels like the story is pointless. A lot of unnecessary scenes and took a lot of random turns until you finally saw the big picture. She has something missing in her that she wanted to find, instead of helping others. Also a lot of contradictions, one time she's good one time she's revengeful another she's shy and another time she is not. Well, then she ""a kind hearted introvert"" wants to find love, she loves a person deeplu without knowing anything about him except that he works at a porn shop and does some nonsense (the picture booth). Sure. A lot of unrealistic stuff all around.Anyways, i did enjoy the movie but enjoyed the picturesque aspect of it more than the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A hilarious, warm movie in a world all its own.","Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo."" These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.Here is a film so original, so funny, and so warm that it left me with smiling for hours and the people on the sidewalk thinking I was crazy. Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.The film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.Amélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.As she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.Amélie's conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie's inner struggle seriously, but it's never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, ""Amélie"" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Alien: Resurrection"", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year.I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can't wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year's best picture and is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
She makes ME fall in love too!,"To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films ""Amelie"" (and I will stick to ""Amelie"" since ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing ""Amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""Alien 4"" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry ""Amelie"" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about ""Amelie"". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, ""Amelie"" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It's my favorite movie of all time...,"Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie PoulainFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.I consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie's mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie's apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director's choice, so I don't hold her responsible for that.Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie's pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key's silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn't been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie's heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old's man face, a close-up of Amélie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.In my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This Movie can CHANGE your life :-),"A year ago, if someone would have asked me ""What is your favorite movie ?"" , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.Since June, I have but one answer: 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' !!! It is simply unique in his kind.  And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'.  It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way.  Audrey's performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.This movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!a 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is rated so highly cause it deserves it,"A slice of heaven right here on earth, ""Amelie"" is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie.Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character.  A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street.Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked ""Are you a congenital shmuck""?But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course.Just beautiful.  10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What is left to say about this glorious joy ride?,"I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Audrey Tautou is magical,"Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life.""You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?""Hmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Is Amelie French for Overrated,"Amelie: 6/10: Sweet, light and sometimes a little irritating this strangely adult fable starts out very strong and sinks under the weight of it's too cute for words protagonist and her self made predicament. Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body.Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime café)It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little to long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it)Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in café.It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose.It is only in her pursuit of love that Amelie fails as both a person and a movie. Just like most twelve-year-old girls.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Why do people like this movie???,"I hate to be one of those negative people, but I hate this movie with an incredible fiery passion. I think it's very possibly the most overrated film of all time. I watched it a while back expecting to see something amazing but I was disappointed beyond words. The main character is very possibly the most annoying movie creation of all time. She's really cutesy and pale and she doesn't say anything. She's like a cross between Shirley Temple and a mime. By the end of the movie you just want to reach into the screen and choke her. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the movie has no point whatsoever. And just for record, I'm not just saying this because I'm an idiot American who can't appreciate French cinema--I actually love French films (my favs are The Girl On The Bridge, La Haine, and Leon: The Professional). But this one just makes me want to pull my hair out.

A nice little film,"Rating: ***1/2 out of ****What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wold"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Cotton Candy, not the real stuff","I cannot understand why so many users are raving about this film.  Yes, it is original.  Yes, the lead actress is cute and holds your attention. Yes, the other characters are bizarre and sometimes funny.But REALLY !!!! This is one of the highest rated films on imdb?  I have been a movie geek for almost 50 years, and this did NOT even remotely jump out at me as an all-time great film.  It is enjoyable fluff, nothing more.  Did it make me feel good about life?  No. I already was OK when I watched it, and it didn't move me, touch me in any real way. I expected so much more, from all the reviews.  I was disappointed.It is like cotton candy as opposed to homemade chocolate.  French cinema has produced much better than this.  Jules & Jim, Z, 400 Blows, Manon of the Spring, to name a few.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just plain weird...and I mean that in a good way.,"Considering that there are a bazillion reviews for this film already, I really don't think it's that important that I do an in-depth review of this film. It is already well in the top 100 films on IMDb, so it's obviously a very good film.Instead of the usual view of the film, I'll talk about it from a psychological perspective. Amélie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an Avoidant Personality. This means that she's so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from them--particularly anyone who could become intimate. In other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperation--hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. So, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help others--but always at a distance and anonymously. Most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strange--but ultimately very helpful and kind. In one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passive-aggressive actions. Fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also Avoidant (his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others)...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?!Aside from the psychological aspects of the film, I really appreciated the look of the film. The odd 1930s style of Amélie's clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors (with lots of sepia tones), the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks (such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life) all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget.Overall, a delight. Oddly, however, despite the very high rating, I think that Audrey Tautou mas made better films, such as HE LOVES ME...HE LOVES ME NOT and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very forgettable romance flick.,"I loved the style of it. This film is very colourful, the editing is interesting, the music and camera work is great.
For the story I'm not too fond. The protagonist girl is playing with other characters, to some she sets traps, to some she plays with their feelings and minds, to some he gives clues and mystery. It's all a game for her.
I wouldn't call this a romance movie at all, more like bland adventure movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A stylish movie but the story was dull,"While watching this movie, I felt like watching an art gallery or interior magazine. I could tell the filmmaker was very particular about the visuals and colors. But storytelling was not so impressive. This was one of the high-rated movies but it's overrated to me. So I gave 5 stars and just one time is enough to watch this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wittily observed and quirky romance that's imaginative and sweet,"Amélie grows up a slightly introverted child as a result of her unusual parents.  When she grows up she has her own unusual habits and quirks. When she finds a hidden box of childhood toys in her house she decides to track down the owner and return it to him.  Seeing the happiness that she brings to him she resolves to work in secret to make other people happy.  However can she be happy herself?I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I'd heard others raving on the boards about it but didn't even know the most basic of plot details about it, I didn't even know who the director was.  When the opening credits rolled and I saw that it was Jeunet as director I immediately realised that this may not be as straightforward as I had thought.  Almost immediately, the different humour comes through in lots of ways - from little things like the way the cameras moves up to the full script.  The plot doesn't totally work and some of the strands are a little unclear, but overall the film really works well as an alternative romance that is as sweet as it is quirky.The influence of Jeunet is the main reason the film works as well as it does.  He tones down his usual darker style and delivers something just as different and unusual but much lighter and refreshing.  As writer he does a great job coming up with imaginative characters and situations.  The other reason it works so well is through the performance of Tautou; she is such a wide eyed innocent - sweet without being sickly and likable without taking away from her quirkiness.  The support cast are all good and features a few Jeunet regulars but really it is Tautou's film and she carries it well thanks to the great work of the director.Overall this is a surprisingly sweet film that took me by surprise and was sweetly charming and lovely without falling into cliché - it was different and quirky in a refreshingly enjoyable way.  If you come to this expecting one of `the greatest films ever made' then you may be a little surprised because the film is quite unassuming and is best enjoyed when you come to it fresh.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Two hours of euphoria,"I've never ever felt so good after seeing a movie, and I'm not even a romantic.

There are few truly perfect films in the world. This is one of them.,"Anyone who has previously seen a film of acclaimed French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet should not be at all surprised with the utterly resplendent, outstanding imagination that fills every moment of this one. What is surprising nonetheless is the absolute breadth and depth of that imagination, and its wit, charm, and warmth. Every last trace of 'Amélie' overflows with it, to the point that to run down a list of all the ways in which the pictures dazzles is essentially to break down how pictures get made. Jeunet's bewitching shot composition, and his keen orchestration of every scene; Bruno Delbonnel's enchanting, wonderfully dynamic cinematography, practically a living character unto itself; Hervé Schneid's impeccable editing; fantastic, colorful production design, art direction, and costume design; lovely hair and makeup work; fabulously whimsical characters, dialogue, and scene writing to build a quirky, off-beat narrative with equally whimsical humor; supremely nuanced performances to realize those ever so unique characters; seamless, fanciful, seamless effects both practical and special; Yann Tiersen's splendidly inviting, rich original music; flawless sound design... Am I missing anything? Is there any way in which this film is less than perfect?And still, for all the cheeky, smart, fantastical idiosyncrasies that the feature can boast, it is but a complement to its unyielding soulfulness. Glaringly few are those movies that are unfailingly characterized by so much positivity, that can truly be said to be altogether life-affirming. There is drama here, but it is surely just about as light as as drama can get, with the result that the end product is exquisitely entertaining, satisfying, and rewarding, as precious few titles can claim to be. It's no wonder why 'Amélie' has garnered such acclaim and so many accolades, for it is without a doubt the best movie Jeunet has made in an already incredible career defined by exceptional visual design; one of the best movies to ever come out of France; one of the best movies of the twenty-first century; and possibly one of the best movies made since the advent of the medium. What other motion picture has ever burst with so much unremitting joie de vivre? How many other motion pictures have ever been so worthy?I don't know how to lavish still more praise on this without betraying spoilers. I'm almost ashamed to admit that when this first saw release, I overlooked it in my ignorance of what it was about. I don't think I'd have been able to appreciate it as much twenty-two years ago as I do now, though, and regardless, the wait was absolutely worth it. No matter who you are, 'Amélie' is a must-see modern classic, and that's all there is to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Brilliant Colors,"If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see.Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. As the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps. There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG.""In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

dreamy and wonderful,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet.

Whimsical,"Amélie caused a stir when it was released and you should have a look to see why. The eccentric characters are as delightful as the zappy quirky tone. From the storyline, to the cinematography to the soundtrack, it's stylistically interesting. Was blown away.Essentially, it's a meditation on life. A young woman sets out to fix the problems of others as a way of ignoring the fact that she herself is damaged. One of the most memorable aspects is the wondrous central performance of Audrey Tautou.The most remarkable fantasy of this movie is the Paris that Jean-Pierre Jeunet conjures up. It is supposed to be modern Paris, at the time of Princess Diana's death, but could be the Paris of 50 years before. The twisted realism makes Wes Anderson films seem quite ordinary.Conclusion: Impossible to resist, heartily recommend.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Beautiful, but empty","I can't agree that this is the ""most charming movie ever made,"" but it is one of the most beautiful. If you watch it, pay attention to the photography. Nearly every frame is a watercolor painting come to life, even the most mundane scenes.Take, for instance, the snippet where Amelie encounters the man playing the record player in the subway.

It is a feast for the eyes!The colors and compositions are astounding, which is a good thing because I found the characters and plot somewhat empty.

A Whimsical Sojourn into Parisian Wonderland,"Oh là là! Amélie is an enchanting tale that captures the essence of life's hidden treasures through the Montmartre neighborhood of Paris. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, this film is a visual symphony of colors, emotions, and the poetic charm of Paris. It's a delightful exploration of the magical moments that often go unnoticed in our everyday lives.At the heart of the story is Amélie, a shy and imaginative young woman who finds solace in simple pleasures. Just as she revels in skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin, Amélie discovers her own unique way of bringing happiness to others, setting off a chain of heartwarming events.The characters in the film are as diverse and colorful as the patrons of the Café des 2 Moulins. Each person has a story to tell, and Amélie weaves them together in a tapestry of human connection. But what sets the film apart is its ability to evoke profound emotions while celebrating the beauty of life's little joys, much like her own appreciation for cracking crème brûlée with a spoon. The film captures the essence of love, longing, and the delightful quirks that make each of us unique.Cinematographically, the film is a visual marvel, with shots that immerse you in the enchanting streets and landmarks of Paris. The film's use of color and light evokes the same sense of wonder A experience when Amélie wanders through the streets of Montmartre, discovering the little wonders hidden in plain sight.So, if you seek a film that embraces the enchanting side of life, Amélie is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to a world of whimsy and wonder. It leaves you with a warm, hopeful feeling, much like the moments when she brings joy to those around her. Let's embrace it with an open heart and a desire to rediscover the magic in your own life. The film reminds us that, much like the charming neighborhood in Montmartre, the world is full of delightful moments waiting to be cherished. C'est magnifique!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not a fan,"It is very possible that I don't have the intellect or the ability to appreciate cinematic masterpieces.  However, free speech enables me to voice my less than enthuasitic endorsement of Jeunet's ""Amelie"".Jenuet's ""Amelie"" is one of those feel-good movies that makes people dream into believing anything is possible.  Its very ""nice"" and a commendable deed indeed; however, Jenuet fails to deliver ... I would have much appreciated subtelty in depicting the everyday Parisians ... not an aggressive, preachy, in your face romanticism that seems to lack genuine warmth.I was not a huge fan of Jeunet's style - his love for hurried camerawork, frequent character zoomins and other visual imagery (the key in her pocket when she makes a duplicate) was distracting and served to just underline the lack of genuine warmth.The saving grace of the movie is the obviously talented Audrey Tautou who plays the role of the outsider to the T.  Her understanding of the role prevents the movie from becoming another fuzzy role of a girl we root for as she changes the world.I am not a cynic - but I did get bored with the method employed by Jeunet. After a while, the movie just kept on dragging.  Tautou does a good job; and, I did like the colours used in each frame which gave the movie more life than it really had.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Annoying,"A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Charming but...,"This was a charming movie with delightful simple characters, but somehow it left me a little cold. It has some interesting devices, like the narrator's slice of life pictures, and Amelie's projects are fun to watch. I also enjoyed the quirky characters that fill the story. But to me there was little emotional depth to the film and I'm afraid I kept waiting for something more involving.On the whole a good way to spend an evening, but alas, unless I missed the point, very light entertainment and not especially memorable.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonder and expression,"Amelie marries childlike wonder and artistic expression. Its only consistent criticism is that the film is too whimsical, optimistic, or clean. However, these qualities are ideal for its theme of finding magic in the smallest aspects of everyday life. The plot may be playful, but it's grounded by tragic backstories. There is an impenetrable innocence in Amelie and its protagonist, but that merely coats an undertone of sadness. Deep down, Amelie is lonely and strives to make others happy to find her own fulfillment. Therefore, when Amelie is closely examined, it is actually quite bittersweet and her journey towards self-care is rather cathartic.Meanwhile, the craft of Amelie is triumphant. Its regional music sets a perfect mood, the special effects are surreal yet measured, and the production has a distinct color scheme. Amelie's editing is mellow with bursts of flashy techniques (such as match cuts and montages). The sound design is magnified, highlighting the film's imaginative nature. Finally, the cinematography is divine. Color, movement, shot variety, and composition are utilized beautifully, creating living art and intuitive storytelling. Visually, Amelie is deeply emotional because its images are so exact. Overall, it is clear why Jean-Pierre Jeunet's masterpiece is universally loved.Writing: 10/10

The camera work in this movie was phenomenal and really contributed to the whimsical feel of the movie. The characters were also very well developed and fascinating. None of them were too perfect; they all contained very human-like flaws. Another noteworthy aspect of this movie is how they portray the backstories of characters to the audience.

The grocer, who makes you wish something bad happens to him every time he appears, is the typical boss who hates the employee, maybe that's why when that ""something bad"" happens it's inexplicably satisfying.Lively film, full of colors, with passionate music - in fact Yann Tiersen did an excellent job here.

The worst part is when people go on trying to defend it, saying that the character is simply misunderstood and that since the film is french, it offers a different perspective. Do we have to remind people that foreign films also have the ability to suck as much as American films?

Utterly brilliant French comedy,"If there is one French (or should I say European) director who is capable of showing that original and fresh movies absolutely do not have to come from Hollywood, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is the one to go...Starting at the first shot showing a beautiful old street in Paris and the first extremely funny 15 minutes setting the characters and the location (à la Magnolia) to the surreal end of the movie; everything is perfectly thought out and shot. You will see incredible camera work and editing you would normally expect from oscar nominated pictures. Even the special effects are some of the best this year (coming all from a French sfx company) and most of all they fit perfectly into the story; as opposite to many modern Hollywood movies.The story is about a young naive woman who discovers during the movie what love is. So much for the story, I don't want to spoil anything because this is a movie which works best if you know nothing about it. Amélie, the main character is superbly performed by Audrey Tautou, who really manages to get the way how she thinks and feels during the movie to the spectator. The rest of the cast is rather unknown outside France besides Mathieu Kassovitz (actor and director of the controversial ""La haine; Hate"") and Dominique Pinon (the guy in the wheel chair in Alien Resurrection) who is often casted by Jeunet.Jean-Pierre Jeunet whose previous movies includes ""Delicatessen"", ""The City Of The Lost Children"" (my all-time favorite movie) and ""Alien Resurrection"" is back again to deliver a romantic comedy different than anything made before. He succeeds in producing a comedy which is not only funny but also visually; musically and plot wise most interesting. Part of Jeunet's trademark is that the story is filled with tons and tons of ideas, metaphors and subtle details, more than normally 5 movies have to offer, which makes it almost impossible to get everything the first time you see the movie.I'm really interested in how this movie will succeed at the box office because it is unfortunately a very difficult movie to advertise due to its strange plot and characters. Even a trailer can't possibly do the movie justice, because the story is too wicked to summarize.Don't be afraid to see this movie because it's a French one or you will miss one of the most impressive movies this year...9,5 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Heart-warming and unique!!,"I fell in love with ""Amelie"" from the first minute, from the first second of the movie.A totally captivating, intriguing and innocent film...colorful and bright,unusual,unique,imaginative and magical, so so sweet like honey and so romantic...It's a film for all the dreamers all over the world...So heart-warming,shows how the world can be changed by little random acts of kindness... Some times the smallest things can make a big difference...And what a wonderful dreamy music by Yenn Tiersen!!!The first time i watched ""Amelie"" was almost 10years ago!

"A Monumental, Creative Story","Amelie might just be the closest thing to a perfect movie. The movie Amelie shows you how destiny takes its toll on everyone and anything and the true meaning of value.Besides Amelie being a great movie, there is beautiful scenery included in the film only adding to the masterpiece that it already is. It can truly inspire you and makes you fall in love with Amelie herself as she takes you on a riveting journey to find what she really wants, LOVE. The film is very abstract and although it is not everyone's taste, it'll delight you from beginning to end while cheering on Amelie. The acting in this movie all come together extremely Well and make the motion picture great.There is nothing really left to say besides the fact that Amelie is a masterpiece that will stick with you for the rest of your life as it keeps you thinking and deciding just like the character Amelie did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
9.5/10 - Clearly the best movie I've seen in years!,"To me, it was the ""Movie to End All Movies""- at least for a while. I don't think I want to see any other big screen offerings after seeing ""Amelie"". All the new flicks are just on the ""opposite pole"" of this one. ""Amelie"" is a work of art, not business. It is simply cliche-free - none of the standard movie stereotypes are present in that beautifully surreal world of Amelie. I'll not spoil the movie by trying to say what it is about- just go and see it. At the worst, you won't be disappointed. This was the ONLY movie I ever saw that had audience still sitting when the closing titles ended! Some people even gave it a standing ovation.I am gonna boycott other movie offerings for at least a month to show my respect for the producer of Amelie :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Whimsical Journey Through Parisian Dreams,"Watching ""Amélie"" was like stepping into a whimsical painting that comes to life, where every frame bursts with color and charm. From the very first scene, I was captivated by the vibrant portrayal of Paris, a city that feels both familiar and fantastical. The film's unique storytelling style, filled with quirky characters and delightful moments, made me feel like I was on a journey through a modern-day fairy tale.Audrey Tautou's performance as Amélie is nothing short of enchanting. She embodies the character with such grace and innocence that I found myself rooting for her from the start. Amélie's simple yet profound mission to spread joy through small acts of kindness resonated deeply with me. It reminded me of the power of little gestures in our own lives, and how they can create ripples of happiness in the world around us.One of my favorite scenes was when Amélie decides to return a lost treasure to its owner. The way the film captures her anticipation and excitement is infectious. It's a moment that encapsulates the essence of the film: the beauty of human connection and the joy of giving. The film's humor, often subtle and whimsical, had me chuckling throughout, especially in scenes where Amélie's mischievous nature shines through.The cinematography is a feast for the eyes. Each shot feels meticulously crafted, with a dreamlike quality that enhances the story's magical realism. The use of vibrant colors and playful camera angles made me feel as if I was experiencing Paris through Amélie's imaginative lens. It's a visual treat that complements the enchanting narrative perfectly.As Amélie navigates her own journey of self-discovery and love, I found myself reflecting on my own life. The film encourages viewers to embrace their quirks and seek out the beauty in everyday moments. It's a reminder that happiness often lies in the simplest of things-a shared smile, a kind gesture, or a moment of connection with another person.In the end, ""Amélie"" is not just a film; it's an experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It left me with a warm glow and a renewed appreciation for the little joys in life. I walked away feeling inspired to be a little more like Amélie-finding magic in the mundane and spreading kindness wherever I go. This film is a delightful gem that I would recommend to anyone looking for a heartwarming escape into a world filled with whimsy and wonder.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Needed now more than ever,"Released just two months after America's 9/11, Amelie is a celebration of the kind of soft power diplomacy that brings people together in the face of tragedy to heal rather than harm.From deflating her landlady's growing bitterness at being abandoned by her lover to coercing her father to travel to reconciling a stranger with his daughter to forcing the grocer to acknowledge just how susceptible everyone is to mental illness, Amelie affirms that diplomacy is not dead - It just requires some creative communication channels.But for all its twee scenarios and fourth wall breaking meant to draw the viewer into a false sense of security, this is no fairy tale of happily ever afters as we see with Georgette. There are real stakes to taking a diplomatic approach, especially in affairs of the heart. After all, it's the politics of love that make the world go round, and the politics of hate that stop it. But as Amelie shows us, there's always a better way to be found as long as we communicate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Un peu leger! (Somewhat shallow),"When this movie first came out, I was still living in Paris, my home town. There was a lot of positive buzz about the movie. As French critiques are usually not tender, I was expecting to see something great. I must say I was disappointed. Point taken, the movie is really pretty and cute, and happily creative. But I was expecting some more depth to it, as any REALLY good comedy should have. The problem with this movie is that it embraces an overly rosy, advertisement-like view of life. There is no question that it succeeds in this exercise, but you get out of there with the numbness of an empty mind.The aesthetics of the movie is very close to what I consider to be one of the best commercials EVER, namely the 1993 CNP (a French insurance company) TV commercial by Lars von Trier (yes, the one!). That commercial represented a little boy first carrying his violin, then growing older, marrying, having kids, and the next generation, and so on. All the people in the commercial are very happy and the grain and the light and the colors of the movie are strikingly close to those used in Amelie. Also the very alert pace of the action (no time to get bored!) is common between the CNP commercial and Amelie.Now, why is this comparison a critique for Amelie? As I have said, I consider that commercial to be really wonderful, but AS a commercial. I have no criticism against a commercial being really sleek and cute and happily creative. But a good movie cannot stop there! So if you see Amelie, as I see it, i.e. as a sophisticated version of a commercial, promoting Paris, the happy life and so on, you cannot possibly give it the highest value as a cinematographic work of art. It deserves at most a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amélie changed my perspective towards LIFE....,"There comes a movie in your life that just grows on you and, eventually, becomes something more. Amélie is one of those movies.After having watched it on my telly, I realized this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is so personal, so enriching, so playful and yet, so sweet that I can't help but fall in love with Amélie. To me, it seemed a movie capable of inspiring someone to feel good about their life, no matter whatever trouble they are in. During the whole course of the movie, one thing that no one will fail to notice is the sheer importance of imagination and fantasy in one's life and how it makes everything so interesting around us. Amélie lives in an apartment in Montmartre and earns her living by working as a waitress for Café des 2 Moulins. This is another aspect of the movie, where we are left wondering how can she manage to live in her apartment on the meager income of a waitress?! This is yet another instance of the fabulous life of Amélie Poulain, I guess, dripping and soaking in fantasy ever so amazingly and beautifully.The colors of the movie are very beautiful; with red, green and yellow catching your eye. The acting is excellent and I can imagine no one capable of portraying Amelie better than Audrey Tautou; she is just PERFECT. She IS Amélie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece here; a story so pure to its very core and the directing just exceptional.I LOVE the way Amélie lives her life and how she imagines herself, and the people around her, in a ridiculous and yet, completely interesting way. I LOVE the way she decides to and improves the life of the people around her helping them in the most ingenious way anyone could imagine. The love affair between Amélie and Nino has to be the one of the most special relationships captured in a movie and it oozes romantic vibes that will make you want to fall in love. The scenes where she wept, I wanted to hug her and console her. The scenes where she was mischievous, I wanted to join her.To be honest, I was falling in LOVE with her. I wanted to be a part of her magical world. And when the movie ended, the feeling I went through could be most closely associated with the feeling one gets when one departs from a best friend.This World needs a lot of Amélies to appreciate its surreal beauty rather than its materiality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Either one likes it or they don't,"And I didn't.The scenery is fine and I actually enjoyed the surrealism, but just couldn't get past the plot and main character.Is this really what we want people doing who have no idea what they want in their own lives ... to go around and jump into other people's lives whether those people want it or not?What we have is an early-20s, female, socially adolescent do-gooder who resorts to match-making, forced coincidence and, yes, even trespassing, illegal entry (and a potential arson charge, to boot) to fill her internal emptiness because she can't find a man.  And when she does find someone, she doesn't know what to do.To some, it's a great movie.  Not to me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Actually I don't really have words to describe this extraordinary movie! Moreover Paris is even more beautiful thanks to this movie - although Paris didn't need it to be amazing! Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is very original: all the colors are in harmony each other and with the story and the characters... Ah the characters! How interesting and warm they are!

STALKER,"OK, everyone seemed so impressed with this film that I decided to check it out.  Then after reflecting on the absolute blubbering and swooning that most people did about this film I decided to register with IMDB and just see if there might be anyone in agreement with me?  Sure the film making is wonderful.  Sure it's sort of non-banal escapism.  Sure it's ""not like anything else seen before,"" but it seems that what almost everyone reviewing this film is enamored is the ""cute factor"" and ignoring what is screamingly obvious.  The lead character, is apparently a cute, little stalker of a girl, with a plucky, yet dogged tenacity, and a sheepish grin.  Sure, no one is murdered in a particularly heinous fashion, and the musical score never once makes you bristle and feel like what she is doing is out of line, but take Audrey Tautou out of the lead and give it to someone like oh say, Roseanne Barr-Arnold, and the tenor of the film gets really dark really quickly. Or just reverse the sexes of the lead actors in the film for that matter.  It's seems odd to me that the newest criminal blight DE jour is stalking, (and not just the headline grabbing celebrity stalking,) and everyone is up in arms if an ex-lover, romantic, ""admirer"", or frequent passerby (stalker by today's standards) so much as breathes out of line in regards to their said ""target"" and they are immediately banished to the fringes of society or locked away.  But put a happy little face on it and some devilishly cute eyes and perhaps some long sexy legs and everyone is ready to forgive her stalking actions and attribute it to delightful eccentricity and / or whimsy.  This movie is definitely a mixed message. In the present political climate, it's best to take heed of what messages you take in and not to take them at face value but to look deeper and see what the real message is.  The screamingly apparent message of this movie is that if you are cute and sprite-ful, you can be a stalker, win the target of your obsession, and get away with it.  And the funniest thing is, everyone seems to have ignored the fact that that is THE major theme in this film, and because of the stylistic film making, they have just fallen head over heels in love with it and completely ignored the face value substance of the film. If stalking is cute, change the laws in your state.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very very very rare film experience,"Enough ideas for ten films. You watch, and your smile gets larger and bigger with every frame.  It's main purpose is to cause happiness; about life, about being alive. When something humorous happens (all that's most of the time), and you think, That was great, and then 20 minutes later it sneaks back in as an unexpected theme, developed, larger, more meaningful, more charged. Amélie's eyes: you can dive into them and swim around for days. Every face, every character, well cast, sharply defined. Like a Kubrick, a master of a totally different universe who has his own unique, recognizable style and vision, not just a multi-camera editor or anonymous hired hand.  He's thought it out, and wants to engage the audience.  A craftsman with a vision.  Who's got that now in international cinema? All special effects are for a purpose: not to wow you, but move you.

"A rare gift of a movie, appealing to our appreciative, childish selves","Watching Amelie was for me like standing by a kindred spirit. It was so refreshing to watch the escapades and be able to identify with someone who appreciates the small things, is a small light of sensitivity and innocent good will, but also a lively and enthusiastic spark, a creative bringer of joy (and occasionally retribution) to others.  The scene of Bretodeau's reunion with his childhood treasure box was priceless.  As was Amelie's standing alone in the train station, having missed her chance to connect with Nino, or her melting into a flood of water, when Nino leaves the restaurant.  Or her walking the blind man across the street and flooding him with sensations of the marketplace. Or her imagined arrival of Nino prior to the moving bead curtain, .... Ah, such magic moments of moviedom.  Even to see one such moment in a movie is a fine thing, but Amelie had so many. Also, the many secondary characters all came alive as one could sense their stories and life's paths, that they had suffered, but could smile still.  Little joys amidst hurts. Overall, a finer movie experience is hard to find. Amelie has an innovative script, beautiful cinematography, lots of silliness, heartfelt yearnings, and love finally found between people you can actually like and care for.  And its a movie that seems to laugh at itself, too.  :^)   Bravo! Magnifique!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Le Fabuleux film de Jean-Pierre Jeunet,"Maybe I'm still under the impression but I think that I've just seen one of the best ""love story"" movies ever made.The movie is done in Jeunet's great and original way. It has fabulous story, which is narrated perfectly, great direction and acting.

Good,"At the end of the film, when Amelia opened the door, many people would sigh: Oh, French! However, if only relying on this little bit of romance, 'Angel Loves Beauty' is difficult to stand out among the many romantic French movies and become a pretentious alternative classic. In fact, the focus of this movie is not on love. The film explores a more significant theme than love, which is loneliness. After all, loneliness often exists, but love does not; Loneliness is eternal, love is accidental; Loneliness is fate, love is a miracle. Even if you are not at all interested in the love in the film, you can still watch it with great interest. We can completely view the entire film as a collection of bizarre characters and pranks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Original by over-hyped,"I saw this film last night, and I think a second viewing might well be worth it. What is good about the film is its originality, the method of filming, the lighting effects, the background music and certain items of the script.What is bad is its length - the plot doesn't justify 2h10 of film. The whole thing could have easily been locked into 90 minute stint. The other thing is that Paris as portrayed in the film does not really exist as such - it is far more violent, dirty and crowded than the film would suggest.The film has to be taken as a fairy tale in an imaginary city and in no way connected to present-day reality. But it will no doubt nourish the illusions of foreigners to Paris about the city !Too much hype has been created over the film - true it is a visual feast and the use of dominant yellow tones ( like Oh Brother ) and a great deal of wind lend a special atmosphere but the plot is overstretched.Without doubt, the same plot shot by Americans would have had far better results. Over all though, definitely worth a viewing but not if you're feeling too tired.

Amelie: 7/10,"If you've ever done something good for someone else just for the fun of it, then you can easily relate to Amèlie, the main character in Amèlie. She's innocent, naïve, and shy. But she finds an old box of `treasures' hidden in her flat and decides to return it to the boy who left it there fifty years ago. The `boy' is Bretodeau (Maurice Bénichou), and Amèlie (Audrey Tautou) decides that if Bretodeau is glad, then she will continue to do good deeds for those around her. He is ecstatic, so Amèlie keeps her end of the deal.Amèlie is sweetly touching, but goes for the low-key effect and really does feel like a foreign film. A lot of times, I forget during the course and it seems like the actors are saying the subtitled English words. Not this time. I'm thinking of Run Lola Run in specific. That seemed to be a quality American film (haha, right?).Amèlie decides to return a photo album to Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz). She completes her deed but ends up falling in love (surprise surprise). When Amèlie was delivering the album to Nino (and other times), I was surprised on how complex her schemes were. She didn't explode with talent like that throughout the film, so it surprised me.Tautou is very good as Amèlie, I love her smile. She displayed emotions very well. Kassovitz was also fabulous; people like that need to get more work that comes out here in the U.S. Everyone else involved in the picture is very gifted (including Rufus, who plays Amèlie's father) and talented. Pictures like this don't come out very often.Movies like Amèlie are sure to be crowd-pleasers. Which it is. Its crowd-pleasing attitude was taken with a little arrogance, but it still managed to keep a goofy smile on your face for 122 minutes. Speaking of the runtime, I found it very hard to sit through, for some reason. I enjoyed all of it, but seemed unnecessary. If one of the subplots about Amèlie's escapades were taken out, it would have been better.It also had a good amount of humor. I loved the beginning, when we learn about Amèlie's childhood, and we learn what everyone's likes and dislikes were. It seemed ridiculous yet true. Some of the humor, and the whole movie, faltered during the last hour-the rather quick pace of the first hour slowed down a lot and brought down my experience of the film.Amèlie is a gentle yet entertaining non-Hollywood film that's a sure crowd-pleaser.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sexual situations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I will always take my hat off in front of a creative soul and i will always worship guys who can find the proper esthetical path for their imagination. This is why i love the city of the lost children. But somehow jeunet´s conversion to light is maybe not so inspired. Of course i was seduced by all those simptomps of a grate imagination and by all those small details á la tex avery, i was amused by most of the characters and i am far from saying that i am disappointet by jeunet (as i could say about his co-national besson, but this is not the right place for that), i still fancy his studied images and his fetishism for color, but this movie gives me somehow the impresion that a highly spirited guy is trying to express himself in a language he is not quite proficient in. He is making compromises and uses supportive structures to make a message go through. The most annoying of them, i will be the devil´s advocate, is the way amelie looks in the camera, hence at us, whenever she has an idea or somehow wants to make an appeal to our comprehensive capabilities, like those extremely annoying conversation-lovers who do not waste any opportunity to act with two fingers from both of their hands, somewhere at the level of the ears, nobing with the head in the same time, all this just to express more or less, undoubtfully, that they are just using quotation marks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A celebration of passive aggression.,"This movie is extremely static. It is a character study hitched to a romance. What is seen visually is more often than not an illustration for the voice over narration. It is very close to a book-on-tape. The title character is atrocious. She hasn't enough strength of character to confront a loud-mouth unless it is from the back of a crowd. Don Diego de la Vega could have risen to the challenge without donning his Zorro suit. I don't know when unlawful entry becomes burglary. None of the petty crimes she commits are ennobling or endearing. Amelie is a sad case, which makes the love story rather frightening.

Amelie is a real feel-good film, though not in the stereotypical Hollywood style. Its full of mystery, humour, and moments that make you think 'I wish I'd thought of that!' - for example, the way she sends Nico on a wild-goose-chase in the park at the Montmartre carousel. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie, a simple girl on the surface but with astonishing inventiveness, bewildering all around her.As a director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a unique style. He seems to make great use of colour - some would say to unnecessary extremes, but for me it gives the film a sunshiny feel, whatever the weather in the film. He also likes to zoom about with his camera's, but again this all adds to the way the film completely draws you into its own world, just as Amelie draws Nico into her world without them actually really meeting. A few nice special effects top it off, and there are a few little details that you probably won't see the first couple of times you watch it.I'm no film expert, but I loved this film, its my favourite of all time (so far, anyway), and I'm in danger of wearing out my DVD. There are some people who don't see what all the fuss is about: for them it's too sickly-sweet, or they see Amelie as a meddler or nosy-parker, but I think they've just somehow missed the essence of the film, poor things ;) Don't read too many detailed reviews before watching it, or you could spoil the surprises. Just get the video and watch it. And then watch it again. And again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love it!!!!!,"Amazing movie telling how you should take a chance and get what you want instead of sitting back and letting everything slip away! If the story does not move you in some way, even the most miniscule amount, I do not know what can. Audrey Tatou is great as the shy girl out to make her small world in Montmartre a better place by finding little ways to make someone's day, but forgetting to look after her own happiness in the process. Mathieu Kassovitz is adorable as Nino the eccentric collector. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is excellent at what he does and I cannot wait to see his new partnership with Audrey Tatou in ""The Long Engagement""!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
AMAZING!!!,"this must be one of THE BEST movies I have seen in the past couple of years. It managed to demonstrate the technical side of today's high-tech movie making (excellent job on digital sound and CG effects), while preserving the artistic qualities. Amazing cinematography, plot and acting. This movie made me laugh my ass off. A comedy and romance all in one. I saw it twice in 2 days and will see it again.Wish all movies were less Holleywood-hype and more quality, like this one.

"cute, but can you say over-rated?","this might be another case where the massive hype surrounding the movie raised my expectations so much that the end product, even though it was entertaining, funny and touching was hardly as good as i expected it to be.audrey tatou has done a wonderful job playing the role of the shy and introverted amelie, her magical discovery and how it changes her life are smartly portrayed. the movie's narration and style are delightful and the movie constantly entertains with its funny touches. having said that a lot of the scenes are very predictable and cliched, particularly the episode with the grocer. funny yes, but cliched.the movie honestly is wonderful and cute, but thats about all. i fail to see how this is one of the greatest movies of all time. top 10 most definitely not. another case where, on a rare occassion, the american audience has been exposed to a non-hollywood style movie they go totally gaga. last year's crouching tiger being another case in point. sad but true.amelie though is a nice movie, but nothing great for people exposed to other wonderful movies from around the world.a cute but disappointing 7!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An easily underestimated movie...,"I have loved this film for some years now and I never wrote a comment about this movie, today I have heard all kind of opinions about this film and I have heard what critics have to say about it. This film is loved by many people, but it is easily underestimated, specially by those who want films to give them deep philosophical lessons and impressive point of views of our society. A film doesn't need to be deep to be a masterpiece, if Amelie would try to be more deep than it already is it would ultimately become a worse movie, this movie is not about taking things seriously, this film is about giving people an experience, a pure cinematic experience and it does such a rare thing as having the vast maiority of people who went to see this in the theater leave the theater more happy than when they entered. It is such a powerful experience many couldn't stop smiling for a week walking around in the streets thinking about the film and looking like a fool! I am quite sure this has never happened in the same collective way to any other movie than Amelie......in movie history! That is why this film is unique, that is why this film changes the life of people like the tagline says. It is because it enters straight to the hearth of people and people begin to ask themselves about their own reality and why they can't feel the same way in our universe as in Amelie's universe. A film doesn't need deep messages about humanity to change the way we see life, love, humanity...This is such a simple, universal film everyone can understand. The movie is perfect in every way and it is quite wonderful the way things worked out. Because I am quite sure the director alone couldn't make this movie, how good the direction might be I think there are 2 other factors almost as important, Audrey Tautou and Yann Tiersen. From the beginning Emily Watson was supposed to play Amelie, before she became pregnant. Watson is a great actress but never do I think it would have worked, mainly because Tautou IS Amelie in this movie and Amelie is FRENCH, Watson is not. The angelic Amelie has since become almost a symbol for France and tourists visits the cafe and makes Amelie tours around the city, the prize of the apartments in the neighborhood has sky-rocketed thanks to this movie! Yann Tiersen is also extremely important.Originally Jeunet had someone else working for the movie, but one time he heard one of Yann Tiersen's songs in his car and fast he ran to buy all albums from Yann Tiersen and decided he should make the music for the film. Yann Tiersen had anyway only 15 days to make music for the film and said he didn't have time, Jeunet proposed he could include some of Yann's old songs into the movie and the result was 9 old and 9 new absolutely wonderful, heavenly beautiful tracks all completely perfect for this film. Nostalgic, happy, sad, energetic tracks who together with the cinematography set the right mood for the film.Another great thing about this movie are the colors, always mixing between strong red and green colors which makes you feel you are in a world which only could exist in your dreams, the most beautiful ones you ever had. You could go on about everything which is perfect in this movie, the simple odd characters you so easily feel sympathy for and they are presented in a way only Jeunet could present a character. The odd Jeunet humor we have seen before in Delicatessen and City of the lost children, a humor which only exists in his universe. The simple plot is effective and right not to be more complicated than it needs to be and it has a beautiful message we don't often see in movies: generosity. There is also romance in this movie, but no relationship dramas, dialog, grand romantic scenes ala Titanic. No, this romantic trip is as beautiful and simple as our best memories about love and happiness.Everything in the movie represents the best things about life, love and France. Yes, it is so french and it is so good in being french that you feel like you are french or at least wants to be sometimes when you are watching this film. Everything from Montmarte (a character in its own in the movie), Audrey Tautou to Yann Tiersen is so french, maybe I should add it is a beautiful, positive point of view of french culture without being idealistic (all people have many problems and no one has a perfect life), never becoming uninteresting or boring. I hope only those who have seen the film reads this, because I don't want people to get over-hyped about this movie, it is a simple beautiful movie with the ability to conquer the hearth of people, nothing more than that. That is why I waited long time to write about the film, I knew I couldn't stop myself from making this movie sound like the best film of all time. Because, it was the best film for me, but will it do the same for you? I hope it will, enjoy the movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"One of my ""10 best films ever""","This is one of those French movies where complications accrue until you just can't figure out how things can be resolved yet you just -know- (based upon the exquisite performance by Audrey Tautou and spot-on direction by Jeneut) that the ending will satisfy.The first time I saw this film, I turned to my wife and said ""I know I'm going to love this movie"" and that was about 30 seconds into the film.I cannot write enough good things about Amelie. All the actors and actresses are perfect, the story has you smiling and rooting for Amelie, the direction is flawless, the mystery of the guy who has his picture taken at every photo-booth in the city (only to throw away the photos) had me stumped.Frankly, if you want to know how to make a great film, study this movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"At best, a fun film","Amelie is an over-the-top exercise in style with a Hallmark card message. Be nice for the sake of being nice.  The last third of the film is much too long and predictable.  The film relies on zooming in on the cute smile of its lead so much that I found it annoying.  Still, I like Jeunet's use of colors.  It sucks for me that I keep going to his films looking for whatever Marc Caro has got that made Delicatessen and City of Lost Children so enthralling.But, it's an okay film.     Just    an    okay    film.  It's saccharine sweet, not profound.  It's a simple Disneyesque blast of sentimentality.  It goes against the very oddball spirit of the film to claim it's profound or enlightening.  I gotta admit, compared to A Beautiful Mind and Pearl Harbor, Amelie must look like revolutionary `genius' with its relative lack of tired formula.  But compared to the movies playing at the same theaters as Amelie in 2001, it was merely okay.  I'd put this in the same league as Run Lola Run - fun.  If MTV would go back to playing music videos again, people might stop overrating this sort of camerawork.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Fabuleux Watching of Amelie!,"If any friend of mine ever asked me to recommend a film as an introduction to world, or 'foreign' cinema, I always went for this glorious Gallic romantic fantasy.Not only is the storytelling intelligent and engaging, the artistic design is crammed full of fascinating detail, brilliantly stylised in bold colours and full of directorial flourishes.To my mind, Audrey Tautou is absolutely perfect, not just as her cheeky impish match-making and good Samaritan but as also as an advert for a modern Femme du Paris. The whole project might as well have been co- produced by Tourism France as it covers what us foreigners feel we think Paris IS but in a modernised and fresh way. Nothing overtly quaint but still employing the best bits of what makes France individual, elegant and great.Re-watching the DVD after some seven years I found the whole escapade still refreshing, uplifting but not in a sugar-coated way and dazzling in its effects, which I'm sure were pioneering back almost ten years ago, when it was made. The final freedom-on-a-moped escapade is absolutely and wonderfully youthful and brilliantly done.What, though I feel is one of the film's strongest points is how every age group is not only represented but championed and integrated and that every character has enough 'stuff' so that not only do we care for each of them but also the whole community in which they live and thrive, as a whole. That is a major achievement. That 'Amelie' is still in IMDb's top 50, as voted by us, must make it a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Spirit-lifting..,"Another one that deservedly goes straight to my top-movies list! A soul- refilling experience that restores your faith in life and people... a reality check of life's little pleasures.Audrey Tautou played Amelie to perfection that I can't really digest her performance in any other movie; she is and will always remain the doe- eyed, innocent and lovable Amelie to me. The rest of the cast are quite perfect for their roles as well.There isn't much to be said about the movie which traces the life of a simple 23-year-old French waitress with a wild imagination; however, each and every detail counts and adds something to this colorful visual painting and the experience as a whole. Direction and cinematography are simply beautiful!One more thing: Yann Tiersen's extremely becoming and salient music is like God's final touches on earth! Funny, gripping and spirit-lifting, this is a movie you will never get tired of watching over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I Don't Think a More Perfect Film Has Ever Been Made,"At the time of this writing, this film is ranked on IMDb as the 31st greatest film ever made. This is a sad under-ranking. This film is not only the greatest movie ever made, it shouldn't have to compete with such films as the Lord of the Rings, which will be forgotten 10 years from now. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has painted a timeless classic for the modern era.The plot is simplistic: a girl with a vivid imagination sets out to better the lives of those around her, and seeks true love. The twists come in the form of numerous asides, where we see flashes from other people's lives. While these branches and untapped subplots are unrelated, they serve as a reinforcement reminding us of Amelie's healthy imagination.The acting is all wonderful, as the film has a comic element that is very French. I do not know if Americans could have made this. While watching the way the characters interact with each other, I was reminded of my younger days in college, reading Beaumarchais' ""The Marriage of Figaro"". French literature has a rich history of comic genius (from at least the days of Voltaire's ""Candide"" if not sooner) and this film translates that energy from page to screen. At the same time, there is a serious existentialist tilt to this: how do we, as insignificant people, affect the world? This point is accentuated more by the fact that Amelie stands alone in the world despite being surrounded by so many people -- much like the girl in Renoir's painting (more on this shortly).Audrey Tautou is particularly charming, in an alluringly beautiful way, but also innocently childlike in her grace and style. While more Americans probably know her today as the woman from ""The DaVinci Code"", this will always remain her best film (be that a blessing or a curse). One cannot help but like the character of Amelie -- she quite simply is flawless in her imperfect humanity.The directing? Amazing! Angles, lighting and most of all colors (every color is pushed to the max as if the whole universal was designed by Crayola) are used to make a surreal and inviting world, where even death seems welcome and fun. The few characters who die do not do so in a way that makes us upset or sad, although the timing and manner is most tragic. The greens are the most vibrant, I think... even permeating into the other colors. But rather than blur things with its leaking, it only makes them more fluid and lifelike.And even the subplots are fascinating: Amelie toys with a prospective lover, sends a garden gnome on a trip around the world, searches for a mystery man in red shoes, defends a young imbecile, makes unsuspecting patrons fall in love and helps a sheltered painter find the vision of Renoir.The painter (known as Raymond Dufayel or The Glass Man and played by Serge Merlin) is a crucial central character. He is somewhat of a Sisyphean being, trying over and over again to complete the same task without fully succeeding. But he is also a mentor like Socrates (encouraging the youth to stand up against society) and a surrogate father figure. While Amelie has a father, their relationship is very spartan and business-like; her real interaction comes from Dufayel who guides her in metaphors and allusions.This film also manages to do something very difficult -- make the obscene benign. While the film does have a sexual element and some off-color jokes (one pornographic and another about abortion), we never feel the film has an adult quality to it. Everything seems innocent and pure -- even in the middle of the adult toy store. That must be a very difficult thing to capture as I know of no other film which has done so.I will lay my reputation on the line and say this is the most perfect film ever created by human hands. From beginning to end this film speaks a subtle truth, and shows us that everyone has good points and bad points, flaws and great attributes. I know of no other film that treats its characters as both epic and unbearably human. And this is why ""Amelie"" stands out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amelie,"Amelie is a lighthearted, eccentric and whimsical movie from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.A far cry from the previous movie he made in 1997, Alien Resurrection.The movie gives thumbnail sketches of its main characters and particularly of Amelie's childhood. She had a cold, distant father. Her neurotic mother who died when a suicide jumper from the top of Notre Dame cathedral landed on her.Now 23 years of age and left home. Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) works in a cafe in Paris. She is rather anonymous and shy.On the night of Princess Diana's death, she comes across a box with toys and photos hidden in her apartment. Amelie sets out to find the owner who is now an old man.This allows Amelie to devise stratagems to do good deeds for others in a covert manner. It is another expression of her loneliness as she does not wants other to know about these small acts of kindness.However Amelie's stratagem for Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz) gets a little too complicated. He is another eccentric dreamer who Amelie believes could be her soul mate but she lacks the courage to talk to him directly.Amelie has a strong bold colourful visual style. There is no doubt that the director has left his mark in the film.However the film goes up a notch or two because of Audrey Tautou. She is frothy and fun, she brings Amelie to life. However it not always sweetness and light. There is also a hint of malice. Just watch what she does with that greengrocer who always makes fun of his disabled assistant.The movie is an offbeat fantasy aimed at adults. It tackles themes of loneliness, emotional aloofness and even failure. The characters Amelie meets are a stalker who keeps coming to the cafe to pester his ex girlfriend. A reclusive painter. Nino works in a sex shop and is a ghost in a fairground ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Might be the sweetest film ever made...,"Amélie is just divine. Few movies are as lovely as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's (""Delicatessen"") fable about this French Pollyanna (Audrey Tautou) who decides to do good for everybody around her after an uncommon discovery. We accompany her in a journey through a colorful Paris, searching for love while trying to help sad souls. Jeunet's peculiar humor and touch of melancholy, Bruno Delbonnel's gorgeous cinematography and Yann Tiersen's unforgettable musical score (I will never get over him not being nominated for an Oscar for this work - he should've won!) work together to make Amélie's story one with a happy ending.Curiosity: Jeunet wrote the movie especially for Emily Watson (whose performance in ""Breaking the Waves"" is the most brilliant I've ever seen). Watson is a better actress than Tautou, but I'm glad she turned it down. Audrey was pitch-perfect as Amélie - her innocent, exotic beauty, her soft voice and her huge black eyes are unforgettable - a perfect example of the clichéd term ""born to play that role"". I can't imagine anyone else playing a better Amélie. Jeunet and Tautou created one of the loveliest film heroines of all time, and we got the ultimate French feel good movie - proof that they're not only good at psychological pieces and art-house experiments. The French can just speak to the heart when they want. Remember: Truffaut (the great poet) and Godard (the fabulous madman) broke through at the same time. Jeunet and Tautou made another fabulous feature together in 2004, ""A Very Long Engagement"", with Jodie Foster in a small but memorable part. A partnership made in heaven, that I wouldn't mind seeing again.10/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing gorgeous film,"I wanted to watch this film for a long time but when I booked a trip to Europe last year (Paris being one of the destinations) I decided to wait til I came back to watch it.Man I am so glad I did. The film is beautifully set in Montmartre (where I stayed) and watching the gorgeousness of the story unfold, I was also experiencing travellers remorse seeing all the spots that I had visited weeks before.Even though the storyline is somewhat fantasy it still takes the story of Amelie and her loneliness seriously. It's such a well executed movie and I honestly put it up in one of my top 10 of all time. The soundtrack by Yann Tiersen is also noteworthy and beautiful.Enjoy the small things in life, like Amelie Poulain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A big fat dollop of saccharine Gallic fairy floss,"Two of my friends had told me how much they had enjoyed this movie, so it was a big surprise to find how much I disliked it. The main character, played by Audrey Tatou with the most off- putting mannerisms, was so artificially sweet and coy it made me want to puke. Almost the entire ridiculous story was riddled with self-conscious cuteness. I say 'almost' only because after forcing myself to watch it for almost an hour in the hope of some improvement I couldn't stand it anymore and switched it off.In summary, if you admire sugar-coated dross you'll love this movie; if you don't, then steer well clear of it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Postmodern approach to the Postmodern life,"Anyone interested in film/literature theories would approve of this French director's view, that life is mostly composed of haphazard events and insignificant incidents. ""Amelie"" is brilliant as a film, since it dives into that aspect of life which is regularly overlooked but always pivotal: details. How people's destinies are decided by funny accidents; moreover, how the narrator of the film spies and comments on everything makes us constantly aware of the fictionality of the film. This film is a great fictional work which is ridiculously honest about its fictionality, yet feels so real... maybe exactly because of this modest yet genius approach. This is definitely a creative outlook and a refined one which suits the postmodern era we're living in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Emotional experience,"Watched on DVD.From the opening scene I knew I was about to love Amélie. I think it's one of the only good rom-coms ever made and I have to give it credit for that.I adore everything from the meta fourth wall breaking to the incredible stylised cinematography and shot composition. This whole film is very stylised and it just works. The colour palette is also unique to this film and I like how life can still be injected into something so bleak. This element of the film is also something interpretable so I like that. It could show that the world is a bleak place unless you seek out what you love, or it could show that the world is a bleak place so you should make the most of what you love, or it could mean an abundance of other things.Audrey Tautou is brilliant and fits the character perfectly, I can't see anybody else playing Amélie, she has the perfect look which almost does more for the character than her great performances. She has great chemistry with both Mathieu Kassovitz and Michel Robin, even though the dynamic between their characters is so drastically different.The music is so fantastic, if you want an example on how to use music in film looks no further than Amélie. Each scene is improved by the music, it breathes life into every desaturated image and the beautiful leitmotifs which I talk about all yo much are great too. I really enjoyed the instrumentation, the use of accordion is really interesting and made the film feel alive, it also complimented the subdued piano and delicate strings flawlessly.All of this is great, but there's something that gave me a love for this film that I wouldn't have gotten if I didn't go on a walk while listening to the poetic score after my viewing. During my walk I was thinking about Amélie relentlessly searching for her mystery man, her true love, and for a moment I was consumed by my thoughts, I felt like I was purpose and that I would stop at nothing to find it, in that moment life felt worth living.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

New wave,"So twenty years have passed since the premiere of this picture. In 2001, she instantly became popular, especially in our country. And, finally, the film ""Amelie"" can be viewed on the big screen, in honor of the significant date. There is only one question: has the work retained its relevance, and most importantly, its charm? I think yes.""Amelie"" is the story of perhaps the most unusual girl on the movie screens. She is inventive, smart, but looks at the world through the eyes of a perfect child. She is trying to know love, and she is also trying to influence the lives of people around. The world for her is a kind of amusement park, in the best possible way. And the image that Audrey Tautou embodied will remain forever in the hearts of the audience, and has already migrated to film schools.Jean-Pierre Genet has developed an absolutely unique style, it can be seen in every frame. From signature greenish color grading to bold and simple visual metaphors and rhymes. Everything around the heroes is alive: photographs, toys, and even garden gnomes! And sometimes the main character will turn into a puddle on the floor, unable to contain her overwhelming emotions anymore.Amelie is an endlessly charming movie that has long been a classic.

The little girl and the big city.,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet has the reputation of making very special movies as: Delicatessen (1991) or Alien:The Resurrection (1997). Here, I got the impression that he learned a lot of Truffaut and Godard and he was certainly terribly influenced by them. He took the most commercial parts of their movies and made than a mixture of his own. After all he is a Frenchman.  The over-sentimentality of this movie functions as an escape-goat for the terrible life in our big cities nowadays. Traffic-jams, noise, violence on the streets, loneliness, poverty of the clandestine immigrants living at night and giving a sense of insecurity to the towns. Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a girl that never could survive by the way she acts and interferes with the lives of other people. She lives in an artificial surrounding with resemblance of the Paris of the 1950's where everybody knew each other and when there was still a certain family-life. This movie is not showing the reality: it is showing how we would like the world around us. That is the reason of its huge success.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
ADHDmelie,"Watching Amelie for the first time as an adult and the central message feels a great deal clearer than it used to. I took it to be a quirky romance - but really it seems to be telling a story of a neurodiverse person finding focus in a world which doesn't quite fit you. It's dark enough around the edges to subvert any real schmaltz that might creep in and its lame American imitators litter the TV and filmscape of the decades that follow - which I think shows just how influential it ended up being. The only detractors are some logical holes, a little bit of bagginess and perhaps how distractingly Audrey Tatou resembles Mr. Bean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

number one,"the truth is one of the best movies I have seen, the color, the script, acting, editing and especially the music .... my god... this is art in the style of Amelie. Actually my taste in music composition was strongly influenced by this film. The way you see the world according Amelie's how it should all look and above all the little details that begin a work and lead to a unique history and to never forget. Let's talk about color, strong hue of green and red, two basic contrasting colors; matching all along story, the special treatment given to the tonality, lighting match with the whole concept of the mind of Amelie, Amelie world that is different from what appears but is simply a way of seeing life.

Self-righteous Parisian refuses to live her own life,"While the cinematography is well appreciated the storyline leaves me for want. When I watch a movie I expect to be able to relate to one character, or at least find a character so villainous that the movie helps me to understand and breakdown societies concepts of good and evil, especially in the real world. I watched this movie on the recommendation of many others and cannot cipher why they would put me through such agony? I prefer movies with a bit more depth. I watch a variety of movies and can appreciate many different styles, but it seems like the director is trying to emulate older French directors like Godard, and fails miserably.

STALKER!,"OK, everyone seemed so impressed with this film that I decided to check it out.  Then after reflecting on the absolute blubbering and swooning that most people did about this film I decided to register with IMDB and just see if there might be anyone in agreement with me?  Sure the film making is wonderful.  Sure it's sort of non-banal escapism.  Sure it's ""not like anything else seen before,"" but it seems that what almost everyone reviewing this film is enamored is the ""cute factor"" and ignoring what is screamingly obvious.  The lead character, is apparently a cute, little stalker of a girl, with a plucky, yet dogged tenacity, and a sheepish grin.  Sure, no one is murdered in a particularly heinous fashion, and the musical score never once makes you bristle and feel like what she is doing is out of line, but take Audrey Tautou out of the lead and give it to someone like oh say, Roseanne Barr-Arnold, and the tenor of the film gets really dark really quickly. Or just reverse the sexes of the lead actors in the film for that matter.  It's seems odd to me that the newest criminal blight de jour is stalking, (and not just the headline grabbing celebrity stalking,) and everyone is up in arms if an ex-lover, romantic, ""admirer"", or frequent passerby (stalker by today's standards) so much as breathes out of line in regards to their said ""target"" and they are immediately banished to the fringes of society or locked away.  But put a happy little face on it and some devilishly cute eyes and perhaps some long sexy legs and everyone is ready to forgive her stalking actions and attribute it to delightful eccentricity and / or whimsy.  This movie is definitely a mixed message. In the present political climate, it's best to take heed of what messages you take in and not to take them at face value but to look deeper and see what the real message is.  The screamingly apparent message of this movie is that if you are cute and sprite-ful, you can be a stalker, win the target of your obsession, and get away with it.  And the funniest thing is, everyone seems to have ignored the fact that that is THE major theme in this film, and because of the stylistic film making, they have just fallen head over heels in love with it and completely ignored the face value substance of the film. If stalking is cute, change the laws in your state.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Sacre bleu! C'est magnifique!,"Amelie promised to be quirky, cute and charming, and I think it succeeded. It mayn't be to everybody's tastes, but I really liked the film mainly for its irresistible and playful charm. The film may be a little too long, but what does compensate are a number of things.Firstly, the visuals are a feast to the eyes. The visuals alone make it feel as though you'd just walked into a fairytale. The settings are colourful, the costumes lush, the editing crisp and the cinematography fluid with some inventive zooms. Secondly, the music score is wonderful, romantic, charming and sweet. I will say I have been on holiday four times to France, one thing that always sticks out as a highlight, asides from the beauty of the countryside and the majesty of the Parisian buildings is the true romanticism of the music itself. I love it, and I love France! Also, I love French, I enjoyed learning it, speaking it, reading it, I wasn't particularly great at it but it interested me. Hearing those charming french words caress my ears filled me with delight, it really helped that the script sparkled like bubbles on a glass of champagne. The story is ceaselessly charming and inventive, and I was surprised how quickly the film went as well. Finally I loved the performances, whether it was Mathieu Kassowitz's handsome loner, Rufus as Amelie's father or Yolande Moreau as Madeleine. But Audrey Tautou was the epitome of grace and charm as Amelie, the Montmartre waitress whose selfless ""joie de vivre"" leads her to improve the lives of her friends and neighbours. Tautou has natural charm, allure and a lovely face with an enchanting smile, and in my opinion Amelie is very iconic as a film character, annoying to some but enchanting to others. Overall, I loved Amelie, it was wonderful to watch, Tautou was enchanting and it was charming. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great story and visual style. A movie to fall in love with.,"This movie is great from the inside as well from the outside. The story is heartwarming and the visual style makes it a feast to look at. But the biggest power of the movie is the main character played by Audrey Tautou. She knows to enchant you with her big beautiful eyes and her naive antics. It all makes you fall in love with this movie.They simply don't make movies like this in Hollywood. This movie shows the beauty in little every day things and how certain little events and decisions can changes somebody's life completely in a positive way.The movie is supported by a wonderful dreamy visual style. I think this movie is what ""Big Fish"" should had been like. Don't get me wrong I still really like and enjoy ""Big Fish"" and Tim Burton's visual style but all the little things that ""Big Fish"" still lacked and needed to be great are present in ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"". A reason why European is often more wonderful to look at, it's purer, has less unneeded sidetracks and the way of storytelling is more enjoyable and less predictable.""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is an unique one of a kind small little masterpiece. OK it sometimes is a bit 'too much' and the movie still has some loose ends and moments that don't always make completely sense but the visual style, story and Audrey Tautou are what make you forgive this tiny little flaws.Watch this movie and let yourself be carried away by it.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Charming tale of a girl who lives amid a world of eccentrics...,"Charming, eccentric tale of a girl who wants to enrich the lives of others around her--all of whom seem to be oddities of the first order. AUDREY TAUTOU is charming in the title role as a girl who lives with her eccentric father in a house and neighborhood teaming with strange characters.Her motives about enriching the lives of others is hammered home from the very start, after the tragic death of her mother. Her do-gooder nature is triggered by the discovery of a neighbor's mementos of forty years ago hidden behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to track down the owner and if he's properly touched by the return of his boyhood treasures, she'll go on doing good work for the rest of her life to make others happy.On this rather flimsy premise, the film is a series of vignettes in her life while she tries to fulfill her mission in strange ways. It's quirky, richly imaginative and rather clever from the very start, narrated with style and exquisitely photographed.For Amelie, life is a series of small pleasures. So is the film. Aside from some bawdy situations (the French, you know), it stays mostly on track to deliver a good deal of charm and sentiment. One never knows where the story is going, especially when she falls in love with a young man with an odd addiction who turns out to be her Prince Charming.Summing up: Quirky, richly imaginative, but as far-fetched as a famous French fairytale that begins with ""C"".

This movie of course casts her as a young vivacious Parisian who sets up relationships between people, and then begins looking into her own potential love life.I swear that I can't find anything bad to say about this movie; it was done perfectly in every way. Jean-Pierre Jeunet would later cast Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon in the equally good - if gut-wrenchingly violent - ""Very Long Engagement"".

charming and whimsical,Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a Parisian waitress. She doesn't have a boyfriend living a rather solitary life finding joy in small pleasures. Her distant and cold doctor father diagnosed her with a heart problem. She's forced to be home-school by her nervous mother. She finds a tin box hidden in her wall and goes on a journey to find the boy who left it there.This movie exudes charm. Paris has a magical veneer. I love all of the whimsy.

Less than charming,"Amelie is a young woman stuck (probably for life) in the latency phase of childhood. How does this play out? She longs to do good deeds; she occasionally feels mischievous. She visits her dad, who is still quirky. She has little or no interest in sex or in her peers - other than in a childish sort of outsider-looking-in way. She is a gamine, an imp, and has innocent hopes toward sainthood. For heaven's sake, she does not even carry a purse, a bag, or anything as she scampers through Paris; that is how light she is.

"Precious and hollow, although pretty good for its style","The pros:it's cute and fresh and ultimately achieves what it means to achieve. Audrey Tautou fulfills her role just right as the pathologically introverted and naive young lady who longs for contact and love.it pays close attention to detail and looks to establish a tight proximity with the viewer with very realistic details of the daily life, subtle observations and depictions of how people act and react (say, that guy in the restaurant with his recorder and unusually blunt remarks about the people surrounding him)The cons:ultimately it's too hollow. It's a film that's pretty much based on nothing real and settles for being pure fantasy too overtly. It sets out to conduct a purely romantic plot that is, in the end, more fiction than anything, which is disappointing when it clearly looks to carry a certain realism about itself. There's no moral at all conveyed through the whole story, if not ""seize the opportunity"" but that's hardly worth 2 hours.it's too Manichean (there are only beautiful angels and horrible demons) and caricatured, for instance Jamel Debbouze's character vs his boss in the film who's a monster. It's too easy to set up your development when you've got such polarity in the characters, there's little worth to such a paradigm of exaggeratedly sweet and exaggeratedly evil individuals.there's a very pernicious meanness about the film: Amélie's way of dealing with the fruit seller is just vengeful, and mean, she fights evil with evil of her own when she's supposed to set the example as the lovable protagonist.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Audrey Tautou as Amelie is perfect (her talent was already perceivable in ""Venus Beaute (Institut)"" despite her small part in the movie), and Jeunet's touch is there - maybe a bit too much actually, given how reminiscent it is of his cinematography on the City Of Lost Children (not to say identical).There are also numerous cultural references for which I'm dying to see how they were translated into other languages, and the surprising presence of comedians who are well-known to the French audience to add to the fun (Yolande Moreau, Jamel Debbouze, Ticky Holgado, ...).On the commented version of the DVD (at least the French pressing), Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes references to Frank Capra (the scene in the bar between Amelie and Nino), Wim Wenders (the man and the box in the phone booth) and Sergio Leone (the shot of Amelie in the train station) - the problem is that the same kind of scenes shot by these directors have an intensity that is light-years away from what I felt watching ""Amelie Poulain"". The commentary is actually concluded by the filmmaker stating that he couldn't care less for the anachronisms in the film.Overall, you get an arty comedy directed to mass audiences with a very thin plot that everyone can understand without thinking too hard, and a good cast performing below their usual abilities. The whole wrapped up in a fairytailish package that, even if it is cute and without much pretense, still keeps me wondering if it is uplifting enough to come out of the movie theater with a big smile on your face, and the will to change the world like so many people seem to experience after watching this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amazing,"Not many movies can make me look at the world an entirely different way after watching it. Amelie is one of those.The plot revolves around a young French waitress named Amelie (hence the title) who, after an incident involving Princess Diana, a bathroom tile and a perfume bottle cap, decides to enrich the lives of those around her.The result is a hilarious and wonderful story as Amelie (brilliantly portrayed by Audrey Tautou, who made me an instant fan of hers) continues to make the lives of her colleagues and friends happier.However, she becomes so busy doing this that she forgets about her own happiness. She falls in love with a strange young man called Nino, and plays small games to catch his attention, but always ends up backing out just when she has the chance to finally confront him.With beautiful cinematography and an Oscar-worthy screenplay which was cruelly stolen by Gosford Park, Amelie is a must-see... as soon as you can! You will not regret watching this, and you will walk away with a big, cheesy grin on your face for the next week.10/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
clever but disjointed,"Amelie is a film that features splashes of cleverness but doesn't have enough structure to sustain it.  The lead actress is very appealing, with a large eye-to-skull ratio for the suitable gamin look, but often she merely looks blankly and lets the audience impose their feelings onto her performance.  Visually, the film is a treat, with one eye-popping visual after another.  But what does it all mean?  I don't know. It's a very good film, but top 20 all time?

A bad sign for French cinema,"I've heard numerous people go on about how ""Amelie"" represents a ""revival of French cinema."" If this is true, then the future of French film looks a lot dimmer than even the most pessimistic Francophile could have guessed.Like ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children,"" ""Amelie"" is a stunningly made film, with wonderful music and some awe-inspiring visuals. But this is supposed to be a narrative-driven film, and the film falls flat here.The plot could basically be described as Jane Austen's ""Emma"" meets Dreyer's ""Gertrud"" meets a theme park ride, as a succession of episodes follows Amelie's search for true love, in the process helping others in their own quests, blah blah blah. If this doesn't sound like enough to maintain a 130-minute film, you're right, and even though the actors try their best, the movie runs out of tricks after just half-an-hour and plods along for the remainder in an entirely predictable pattern you've seen a million times in hackneyed Hollywood romances.This pedestrian storyline takes place against a complete fantasy world with absolutely no resemblance to the ""real"" world, but unlike ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children,"" Jeunet tries to ground it somehow in reality, setting it in both a specific location (the Montmarte district of Paris) and at a specific time (1997, around the same time as Princess Di's death, which in Jeunet's Disneyfied Montmarte is the only world event of any significance). This renders the entire ""fairy tale"" approach (complete with wistful narrator) moot -- ""once upon a time"" has no meaning when the storyteller goes to such lengths to place his tale in an actual place and time.So why the colorful, gussied-up, theme-park aesthetic that dominates the film? It appears that Jeunet simply does so for the purposes of nostalgia, to harken back to the ""gay Paree"" image that in all likelihood never existed and certainly doesn't today. Whereas the real Montmarte is heavily populated by impoverished immigrants, Jeunet's is as white as a Republican Party convention, and the one token minority character, an Arab, is as French as de Gaulle. Sanitation problems don't exist in this Montmarte, nor for that matter do fast-food restaurants, chain stores, or any other symbols of modern society. Even the beggars are happy and content. Intentionally or not, there is something quite reactionary about the world view Jeunet presents us with, and the occasional pseudo-documentary flourish doesn't change one jot the fact that nothing in the film is ""real.""Jeunet has dismissed this criticism, saying that his film is not about the social problems of today but about the struggles and triumphs of ""the little guy."" How can you not like that? But in the real world, ""the little guys"" are impoverished, overwhelmingly non-white workers living in abject squalor, more concerned with where their next meal is coming from than with finding ""true love."" These people don't exist for Jeunet, so his smarmy claim of sticking up for those who can't stick up for themselves is a self-serving fraud.To sum up, ""Ameile"" is a visually gorgeous film with some fine performances, all of which are negated by the insipid and unoriginal purposes they're used for. If Jeunet had the guts to take the premise and set it in something at least approximating the real world, this would've been an interesting stylistic experiment, along the lines of Godard's ""neo-realist musical"" ""A Woman Is a Woman."" But Jeunet (who despises both the directors of the nouvelle vague and the neo-realist movement) seems to have prostrated himself before commerical success, and in the process produced a work little better than the mega-budget, star-driven garbage pumped out on a routine basis by Hollywood. French cinema can do better than this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A beautifully exceptional film,"Amelie is one of those rare chick flicks that I can honestly and proudly say I enjoyed.

You can't help but fall in love with Amelie. Her innocence is not contrived and her love is something that needs to be tapped.Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece with this vivid and beautiful film. His famous attention to detail and his desire to make a technically perfect movie is something film school students should take note of. His ability to make a heart warming story but keep it devoid of any sap or saccharine was the true mark of this brilliant film. Each scene must have been a canvas to Jeunet, and the beauty of France is portrayed perfectly in this film.Years from now, people will understand the greatness of this movie for what it is instead of looking at it as yet another foreign film.

10 years of Amélie,"May 31, 2011. It has been ten years since ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" was first screened in France. Being such imaginative work of writer-director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children), Amélie has become one of the most iconic films of contemporary French cinema, an obligatory reference to the magical atmosphere of Paris. The film is presented with a beautiful and dynamic visual approach (great camera work by Bruno Delbonnel and meticulous editing), reaffirming Audrey Tatou's character's French identity with an amusing score for piano and accordion by Yann Tiersen.Following an optimistic and innocent-spirited script, the film follows life of Amélie, a girl who finds satisfaction in helping others without realizing that it is she who needs it the most. While the film could be described as a French romantic comedy, it is also a gorgeous depiction of Paris, its people, music, cafés, metro stations, parks, etc, a representation that gets it right by not showing the overused and worn-out emblematic views of the city.At first glance, the plot is simple yet pleasantly naive, woven like a fantasy tale guided by an omniscient narrator. It does retain a logical order and proves complex. Though it is sometimes predictable, it is much entertaining. The characters, as in other films by Jeunet, are mostly eccentric and evolve throughout the film, often through small but curious and optimistic mundane stories, developed in parallel to that of Amelie.Bruno Delbonnel's camera flies freely through scenarios, shooting well structured scenes that recall beautifully drawn pictures or artistic photographs with balanced composition and color. This unique visual work has characterized the work of Delbonnel with Jeunet, probably only bested by ""A Very Long Engagement"". The colors were digitally enhanced for an added charm to the already attractive world if Amélie, intentionally highlighting green and red hues that characterize the films palette. Blue items are often found on each environment, symbolically representing protagonist's mood.Acting may seem somewhat exaggerated if no background is provided. However, they bring life to the eclectic collection of exotic characters who populate the world of Amélie (and for that matter, that of Jeunet), specially Dominique Pinon, who has collaborated on a recurring basis with the director. Audrey Tatou manages to build a believable character: a naturally naive, tender and warm-hearted girl who cares about others but is utterly alone.The soundtrack by musician and composer Yann Tiersen is one of the film's greatest features. It reaffirms its French roots with melodic tunes, partly cheerful or nostalgic which have by now become classic movies themes (Valse d'Amelie, Le Moulin), composed for accordion, piano, violin and xylophone, along with other instruments. The musical selection includes songs from previous albums by Tiersen as well as some specifically composed for the film.The film was well received by most critics (mostly European) who called it ""positive and inspiring"", ""visually beautiful"" but received little attention by the audience during commercial distribution outside of France, which may be explained by issues with distribution and publicity. Nonetheless, it received a total of 102 nominations from several competitions worldwide, winning 51 prizes.The film reached a broader audience after its VHS and DVD release, earning a well-deserved cult movie status after a few years. May 2011's Blu-ray release commemorates its tenth anniversary (the American version seems like the best to me, having DTSMasterAudio and 1080). Additionally, the film will be screened once more a some theaters in France for those fortunate enough who can see this beautiful film the way it should be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

a contemporary Jules et Jim in tone and atmosphere,"Amelie's matter-of-fact voice-over, alternating fluid observations with absurd yet simple statements, is so typical of the best French movies. It is a method used in a lot of their best romantic dramas and romantic comedies and creates a breezy, spontaneous flow to the movie. French romances are indebted to classics like Max Ophuls' La Ronde and Francois Truffaut's Jules et Jim for this ingenious device. It then allows the movie to sail forth with uninhibited joy, freshness and surprise.I believe the French make the best romantic and feelgood movies. Hollywood's artificial, contrived attempts to create films of this type pale in comparison. They could learn a lot by looking at the way the French make these films. The audience is allowed to get more emotive, more involved because they are intrigued to see what will happen next. There is no rigid structure with films like Amelie. They are just allowed to drift blithely and sublimely like a balloon happily floating through the sky. The Americans, by comparison, use helium balloons.There are also complaints by people saying Amelie was too long. I for one was sad when it ended. I really regretted it when the subtitles came up. I do not know how anyone can get bored of such a riveting, fast-paced, consistently imaginative, life-affirming romantic comedy as Amelie. It leaves you feeling happy and at one with life when you leave the cinema. It makes you appreciate beauty, love, happiness, and the generosity of the human spirit. It just celebrates humanity in its joyous, inimitable French style.If you love this movie then it is worth going out to get Jules et Jim, a truly sublime yet slightly more serious French romance.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Amélie Poulain: ""It's better to help people than garden gnomes.""","It is not that I don't like 'Amelie' and don't appreciate its charm and whimsy - I am yet to see the streets of Montmartre, Paris as magic as in the movie, and I've been to Paris and found it the most beautiful place in the world. It is that I don't find it fabulous, amazing, and original enough to grant its status of one of the greatest movies ever made according the multiple top lists. One of the IMDb reviewers described ""Amelie"" the best: ""sweet, sweet, sweet"" - and that triple sweetness was a bit too much for my taste, I guess. I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent.

While many folks always take the blue path in life, there is much comedy even in the darkest hours.In fact, when I originally saw Amelie, I was in a dark mood following the death of my 9 year old son after a two year battle with leukemia ... and Amelie set me on the road to recovery ... especially by allowing me to pull great practical jokes again.Afterall, what is life without practical jokes?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Like Paris: Outstanding among the beautiful...,"It's been a long time since a movie has satisfied both the issue and the city it was filmed in (especially if this city is Paris).

This is exactly the feeling i had while watching credits. This is a wonderful example of how much more weight a movie can carry by being well thought out than by devouring a vast budget (Amelie's was only about 13 million $). Everything from the acuteness the characters are elaborated with to the small details that keep occurring throughout the movie seems to fit quite perfect.

It has become a habit of mine whenever you feel like low, depressed or anything for any cause..just watch this gem flick. I guarantee your full mood swing!!1st of all, its detailing...yes, that makes the wonder. when first watched, one usually tends to its story & all..but at the 2nd,3rd viewing you can watch closely to the other detail. here, every detail of it makes this film very special.. being introvert, Amelie's each habit, her feeling for small tiny thing, & obviously her each strategy for all kind of her work is shown by flawless detailing. not only that, each person of the hotel where Amelie works, her father, her love interest(the awkward man & his photo capturing) even the glass man's work has been given same importance.Also unusual starting & ending dialogue makes this film that desired effect. & there comes the visualization of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet for making this film such a beautiful experience....hands down. Remember the scene where Amelie starts to apprehend the reason why her man dint come at right time?? The 2nd reason where her imagination of incident travels throughout the whole world including afghan, Tajikistan etc & ultimately becoming a mujaheddin...ohh what kind of imagination one needs to think like that??2nd, the cinematography..I don't have to give any proof... academy authority gave that.(though it dint win!..well that's luck).... we get to see the whole world & Paris through the eyes & fantasy of Amelie...this film brings the life to the world of Amelie through the colors, excellent camera-work & some appropriate special effect.3rd, the acting, no doubt Audrey Totou has been greatly applauded fr her acting in this film..... as a sweet innocent, childish girl, i cant imagine anyone but her can do justice to this role... I have no problem to confess that I almost fall in love when I first saw it.... but not only Audrey, the whole cast manages to make the most out of it such that each comes alive as much as Amelie.4th, the aspect i was affected most from it- the music.....I dunno how many times I have listened to the background score since the first time...& it never gets old at all!!... my love for Amelie grows through that.. seriously the background score uplifts the film into a totally new level..without it I don't think the story telling would be that much effective.... each music is appropriate & relevant for each used portion.... just listen to this amazing score...it will last in your mind as long as the movie does..may be more..I m sure.Some of you can tell that it is unrealistic film...sure it is..but the movie is not aimed for being practical... it is the feel-good movie of all time.. being very childish & imaginative young girl as Amelie, this is the exact fantasy movie which will be lasting in my heart long time...few movies affected me like that... it can make you real happy & that is the charm of this MASTERPIECE!!...........",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe,"This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camerawork are key elements to this.In the second part Amelie lives on her own in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of ""Delicatessen"", except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like a absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates.Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Not as good as I'd heard it was, but still interesting and original!","I really recommend this film to you. While I wouldn't put it in my top 250 films ever, it's very interesting and original, and reading subtitles for a change is very fun.The cinematography is very nice-it is mainly what is so original about this film other than some other tidbits. It's really the definition of beautiful.The acting (though I read the subtitles) can still come clear through the foreign language, and you can still sense the changes in emotions, and sense good and bad actors regardless fo their language.The screenplay is brilliant.

Both interesting and insufferable,"This film gets seven stars for its unique, dynamic and quirky storytelling style. It has many rapid cuts that show us the quirks and backstory of every character. Small diversions turn into full blown montages. The visual design is very striking and colourful, adding to a romantic and fantastical tone. However, ... this was far too fantastical. Any resemblance to real lives is negated by the overwhelmingly annoying, twee, smug, nosy, immature, obsessive, delusional protagonist.

Take off those orange colored glasses please,"This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it.Amalie (Audrey Tautou) has the demeanor of a spoiled little girl who grew up thinking she was ever so cute. She seems to be saying, ""Look at me, can you resist me?"" And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, ""You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?"" Ugh.But the thing that really bugs me about this movie is Amelie's conceit. She presumes to know what will make others happy and meddles in their lives. Among the things this adorable girl does is break and enter an apartment to do mean things to its owner's possessions, send false letters, short out people's TV's at peak moments, lie to people about who loves them, make anonymous phone calls without having the integrity to speak with the callee, and steal one of her father's prize possessions.I know that we are supposed to accept the fantasy nature of this film where photos talk, statues wink, and people always answer public phones, but my patience for this kind of thing wore thin very fast. We are told, shown actually, that Amelie's mother was killed by a suicidal person jumping off of Notre Dame and landing on her. How are are we supposed to react to that? Is it supposed to be funny? Wasn't to me.Then there is the agonizing game that Amelie plays with the guy she falls for. She gives him hints and, given the opportunity to make contact, shies away. You just want to shake her and tell her to just talk to the guy for heaven's sake. Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex. What kind of message is that?The whole movie is filmed through some kind of orange filter that I suppose is meant to cast some sort of romantic candle-lit effect over the proceedings, but for me it was just one more barrier that prevented me from getting close to this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Whimsical Masterpiece of Joy,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain,"" commonly known as ""Amélie,"" is a delightful and enchanting cinematic gem that effortlessly weaves magic into the everyday. Released in 2001, this French romantic comedy captures the heart and imagination of audiences with its whimsical storytelling, vibrant characters, and visually stunning cinematography.Audrey Tautou shines in the titular role as Amélie Poulain, a shy and imaginative young woman who, after discovering a hidden treasure in her apartment, embarks on a mission to spread joy and happiness to those around her in the Montmartre neighborhood of Paris. The film unfolds as a series of charming vignettes, each centered around Amélie's quirky and endearing interactions with the people in her community.Jeunet's direction is a masterclass in visual storytelling, utilizing a rich color palette and imaginative cinematography to create a dreamlike atmosphere. The film's whimsical tone is enhanced by Yann Tiersen's enchanting musical score, which perfectly complements the magical and romantic elements of the story.""Amélie"" is a celebration of life's simple pleasures, and Jeunet's screenplay, co-written with Guillaume Laurant, is a testament to the power of kindness and human connection. The characters are beautifully crafted, each with their own quirks and dreams, contributing to the film's rich tapestry of emotions.The film's unique narrative style, with its occasional use of voiceover and playful use of visual effects, adds to the overall charm and originality. Amélie's internal world is artfully juxtaposed with the external reality of Paris, creating a delightful contrast that resonates with viewers.Beyond its visual and narrative brilliance, ""Amélie"" has a universal appeal, transcending language and culture. Its themes of love, connection, and the pursuit of happiness resonate with audiences worldwide, making it a timeless classic that continues to enchant new generations of viewers.With its whimsy, charm, and timeless message of embracing life's small joys, ""Amélie"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place among the most beloved films of all time. A rating of 10 reflects the film's excellence in storytelling, performances, and its enduring ability to evoke pure joy and wonder.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cutie Pie in Clunky Shoes,"The French have done it again!  Not since their bread, fries, and delicious toast have they produced such an enchanting morsel as Amelie.  With a heart warming story, technical expertise, perfect music, and a lead actress who puts the pix in pixie, all of the aspects of great film making are meshed in seemless symmetry- and that's in contrast to the pretentious nonsense some of those French are famous for.  If you want to be thoroughly charmed for two hours, and the E! channel is not working, then go see Amelie, you'll be glad you did, and if you aren't, then you are a heartless cynic who should just go back to watching crap like the West Wing.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ridiculously overrated,"This movie just can't have such a high rating when true works of art crave to surpass 7! An artificial feel-good atmosphere, some decent humorous lines, charming characters and an original directing are not enough to bring a good film to masterpiece level. From start to finish, this movie is sophomoric, pseudo-intellectual and fuzzy. Or else, ""The Alchemist"" on celluloid.

An interesting effort that is enjoyable but highly overrated nonetheless.,"Amelie tells the story of a young girl's quest to make the world a better place by bringing people together. Rather than presenting us with grand narratives and extensive plot-devices, Jeunet starts off by focusing on the little things. It's refreshing to see a movie dedicated to detail and everyday life. For instance, every character is outlined by a micro-history catalogueing his or her likes and dislikes, which leads to some amusing scenes. Furthermore, Amelie's vivid imagination is captured by a terrific art-department and very dynamic camera-movements. However, as soon as Jeunet feels compelled to shift focus from setting up his environment to constructing a plot, he loses that which sets Amelie apart from other films. To be perfectly honest it's relatively tiresome to watch Amelie looking for and finding the love of her life. The strongest element in the movie is it's ability to steer away from (predictable) plot lines but unfortunately Jeunet eventually feels the necessity to conform to classic narrative. We are left with a movie that is enjoyable but highly overrated to be sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Title character wasn't compelling,"After a snappy beginning, Amelie became unbearably boring.  The title character was the principal problem.

What did everyone else see in this movie?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Times are tough for dreamers""","I had never intended on this. It was hard enough getting me to rent the movie in the first place. I've never really been into foreign language films. It's not because I'm small-minded or anything, it's just that I find it very difficult to appreciate the visual techniques and conventions that a director uses in a movie when I have to pay attention to these damn subtitles. But I heard so much about this film, and about the director that I had to swallow all of my concerns and just sit down and watch this movie. You know what? One of the best minor decisions I've ever made. That's what this movie's about. The little things, the small everyday pleasures that very few people care to notice. But Jean Pierre did, and that's how he came to make this wonderful film, told through the eyes of one beautiful little dreamer named, Amelie.For Amelie, life cannot be without enjoyment, even if it is somewhat less than others. As a child, Amelie was rarely loved, and as a compromise to her lack of companionship, she resorted to her imagination. This way of living became very regular to her, eventually becoming a major part of her identity. Now in her adult years, we get a glimpse of what her life is like. Half the time she is working, in a café called Montmartre, and the rest she is contemplating over her trailing thoughts of what goes on around her, like for instance how many people are having an orgasm in the instant she thinks of it. But then one day she finds a hidden treasure box in her apartment. She feels compelled to return the box to its owner, and upon delivery she receives a dignifying feeling of harmony and peace. From this day she continues to try and help those close to her who are in need of a change. And in her attendance to others she learns a great deal about herself, especially through the consolation of her neighbor, nicknamed the Glass Man.This is a beautiful little tale about changing for the better, after all life is about change, and it's important that we follow along with this change, otherwise your just keeping yourself locked up. That's why we get the impression that Amelie feels somewhat isolated from everyone else, she's not just different, she's afraid to face reality, to take a chance with love. Hence why when she does meet her possible match she continues to test him, lay out obstacles and leaves clues for him, all to see if he's not going to end up breaking her heart. Amelie touches people, and they begin to touch her also, and when I was watching this movie I also felt touched myself.Amelie is a peculiar, but charming, very lovable character, and actress Audrey Tautou portrays her with just as much sentimentality and curiosity as the character is intended to be. Another thing I really enjoyed about her is that she's both innocent, and at the same time a little bit devious. The pranks she pulls on that grouchy old store clerk picking on the bag boy is so funny, and very deserving, because I really didn't like that big bully (course there were a few occasions where I thought the guy was going to kill himself, and that made me feel a bit guilty).Jean Pierre's stimulating direction captures the world of Amelie very well. Everything, the bright colours, the cinematography, the overall feel and atmosphere of the film was made perfectly to give us a strong perspective on how she sees the world. It's ruled by her child like imagination, full of life and random ideas, like a beautiful dream.Le fabuleux destin d' Amelie Poulain, will long remain one of my most favourite foreign language films as it remains Jean Pierre's greatest piece. Its wonderful visuals create a fantastical world seen through the eyes of such a delightful character played by such a talented actress. I'm not going to go so far as to call this movie perfect, but it certainly deserves the rating I'm giving it, a solid 9.0 out of 10, a film to remember, and to watch again for another time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An entrancing piece of cinema,"Amelie is one of those films that draws you in and has you hooked from near enough the first frame.It is quirky, arty, funny, wholesome, heartwarming, farcical, joyful.

All of the supporting roles are great but it is Tautou as the titular Amelie who steals the show.The style of the film is very niche and odd, so I can see how it might not work for some but I loved it.

This French Cinema's innovative characterisation and unique storytelling may be not be Outstanding but enough for a Classic tag.,"Amélie (2001) :
Brief Review -This French Cinema's innovative characterisation and unique storytelling may be not be Outstanding but enough for a Classic tag. Amélie is story a girl who spent her childhood alon thinking about world in abnormal way. Now in teenage she decides to give a push and an aim to the boring life by helping people and in the meantime she founds love of her life. This is a simple storyline and like i said it is not outstanding stuff or something and i hope you agree. But i must mention and admire the innovative characterisation of the film and the unique way of storytelling. The world in the movie is normal, it isn't fascinating and all but it is just that is has been shown from different point of view and makes us look at it from different perspective. I always have problem to praise the dialogues of non-English films because subtitles is something that disturbs cinematic experience. Améili therefore looks a dry beck in dialogue writing. Audrey Tautou is magnificent as Améilie. She looks innocent, naive and cute throughout the film and make you fall in love with her. All the other cast members are fine too. Amélie is just another different attempt to look at an ordinary writing, may be it works for some and some people might find it underwhelming due to high expectations. There's no denying on Amélie's writing and overall film being regular or maybe less but i would like to mention the characterisation again for its being highly innovative and connectable. Jean Pierre Jeunet has made a very entertaining and thoughtful film but lack of intellectual elements bothers a lot especially in the climax. But his unique storytelling style is worthy to make it a Must watch film as the cinematography and editing is not typical and non regular from regular films. This is really interesting to see if not the story. Améilie carries a high reputation on IMDb which surely makes it over-rated but then i am not against the Classic Tag. It is just that some films are great but known as Greater and Amélie is that Great film.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Wordly cynicism be damned,"Many, many people reflect on this film and find it fluffy, cartoonish, and wildly unrealistic.  While the fact that this is mainly an emotional film (as all good films are) necessitates a certain degree of hyperbole, I disagree that it is all that unrealistic and charge that Amelie's detractors are those who are unrealistic.  The simple, undeniable truth of this film IS the only simple, undeniable truth: that of human emotion.  Amelie is a person unable to separate how she feels about the world from how she interacts with it.  This translates into behavior which is often brave, sometimes crazy, and always lovable.  In this sense, then, Amelie is not a superhuman or a saint (for she is also painfully aware of her shortcomings and petty vanities), but a person who has the courage to actually be herself and let her emotions, no matter how fanciful or ""unrealistic"" they may be, shape her world and the world of the others around her.  Simply put, every single person could be Amelie if he or she wanted to, except for our cynical and bitter insistence that people like Amelie don't exist.The main conflict, of course, comes when Amelie falters and cannot allow herself to follow through in this fashion in pursuing her own true love. Truly, if ever the dangers of worldly cynicism (or ""realism"" as we are fond of calling it these days) have been shown more accurately in a film, I would love to see that film.So, if the above description appeals to you, you will love the film.  If it doesn't, then you need to see it even more- the message is there not for the romantics who believed in this stuff all along, but for the cynics who maintain against all evidence to the contrary that the world is a rational place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Heartwarming, delightful, Amelie HAS changed my life!","I first saw ""Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain"", or ""Amelie"" on the day of its release. I have seen it in the cinema four times since, and bought the box-set upon its release here in France. Needless to say in this case that this is a film you can not get tired of. Filmed and arranged in a style that can only be described as ingenious, Jean-Pierre Jeunet combines love, friendship, comedy, mystery and magic in this exceptional film which has featured in cinemas all over France for over eight months, even after its DVD release. The story of Amelie, set in Montmartre, Paris is realistically filmed, and although a happy film, it still features the realities of Paris today:- the people who ask  for money in the Metro, the pornographic shops on boulevard de Clichy, the lonely people alone in their appartments, and the alley cats! A wonderful plot, which unfolds progressivley throughout the film, and leaves one feeling warm and happy, with the help of the delightful music composed by Yann Tiersen of course.

I don't particularly see it that way.I really cant stress to you enough how beautiful this film looks. Paris is supposedly the most beautiful place on earth and going along with all the colors and paintings that this film has it creates a great atmosphere for a film. Audrey Tautou is about as likable as an actress as you can get even with her limited dialogue. But even though I really felt for all the people's lives she was changing, I didn't actually feel for Amelie.The story is cool and will definitely connect with many people but not everything fit together as much as say 'Big Fish' did.

Amelie.,"I'm usually incredibly apprehensive about watching Foreign films, but after hearing the 4th person recommend Amelie I decided I might as well see why everybody thought I would enjoy it. I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a quirky, uniquely wonderful film. One of the main reasons people recommended this movie to me was because I was a big Pushing Daises fan, and Amelie and Pushing Daises both share that colorful, whimsical feel. The awkward love story and the awkward characters and plot lines are everything I could ask for in a film. Audrey Tatou gives an amazing performance, and it's difficult not to fall in love with her by the end of the film. Amelie is one of those films that changes your perception of things, and truly makes such trivial things seem so much more beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A lovely experience,"It is undeniable that Amelie radiates positive energy. It is one of the few movies that I smile feeling happy while watching.
The movie centers on Amelie, with a few subplots, all revolving around the theme of love and happiness. Amelie has a good heart; she cares for people's feelings and proactively helps them without their awareness. Amelie can love, and when she does, she tries her best to get the response she seeks. The plot is thus simple and easy to follow, with no twist and little suspense.
What captivates the audience is the feel-good vibe felt throughout the whole movie. This is achieved by excellent cinematography, good music, and a superb performance by Audrey Tautou. It is impossible to ignore the lovely way Amelie behaves herself, and it is quite hard to capture all her charm in words. My humble description stays at her cute look, her happy little smiles when seeing others' happiness, and her adorable uncertainty facing the love of her life.

Dreamer's ultimate movie... and Paris,"This is by far my favorite movie. Though usually I prefer horror, thriller and suspense (in other words: if no one is getting killed, I am apt to get bored).

Anyone who has fallen in love with Paris, anyone who is a dreamer, anyone who has known true loneliness and detachment from the daily world we live in: you will love it and you will want to live it. I even love the soundtrack. I see the beauty in the film, because I recognize the characters and the way Amelie views life around her. Depending on whether or not you have the dreamer inside you: you will be enchanted, or it will leave you cold (Dutch expression). As for the dreamers: get a bottle of French wine, keep the remote handy (if you don't speak French you will be re-playing like mad, as the visuals sometimes make you forget to read the subs), lie back on the couch, and dive into Paris, romance and the funny things that add up to what we all know as: life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

she didn't and she won't change my life,"This movie is at number 14 in the top 250. It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002. All around the world, Amélie Poulain elated millions of people. The question I ask myself is this one: why did this film make millions of people so happy? I saw it last year at the cinema; it's not that I didn't like it, it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly. A naive girl whose name is Amélie Poulain discovers what her destiny is: make people happy. She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man (Mathieu Kassovitz). I think it's a lacklustre and dull film. The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot. The main thema of the movie, which is for Amélie to make people happy, is more sketched out than really explored. Moreover, the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing. Above all, several sides of the film didn't please me, especially its humor. The movie wants to be funny but according to me, the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe. There is something that I don't like in the Amélie Poulain's character; I think she is dope, a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second!!!). Besides, the actors aren't very great. I mean that they aren't very well defined. We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them, their tastes or hates are only tics (like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer). On the other hand, some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie, I think about Amélie's father who loves his garden gnome, or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting ""le déjeuner des canotiers"". To sum up: Amélie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Angels have names too: this one's called Amélie,"Romantic comedies rarely make it to anyone's serious top ten list, as movies of that kind cater to specific expectations and do not attempt to be anything else. But of course there's the exception to the rule: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie. It's the movie about the search for happiness, about small things, about dreams tucked neatly under the surface of reality which want out, also a training video for wanna-be mortal angels: Amélie is the ultimate reminder of carpe diem, to seize the day and play an active role in the fortune of others and one's self, providing instructions on how to glue together broken personalities. Recounted in voice-overs, embedded in fantastic music that is as French as it can be, the movie is filmed with an incredible love for detail and quirkiness a viewer can handle in two hours: Learn fascinating facts about nothing particularly important, appreciate how different things happen at the same time all around Paris, meet traveling garden-gnomes, horses riding in the Tour de France.Audrey Tautou was born for the role of jaunty Amélie, and she would work again with Jeunet in ""Un long dimanche de fiançailles"" - however, you cannot copy the magic of the first film. Jeunet always takes risks with ideas, sometimes going too far in a direction the audience isn't ready to go with him. He should receive his merits for trying, though. Because every now and then idea, story, actors, combined with the incomparable image laden style Jeunet puts on the screen, come together, and the result is a film as breathtaking as Amélie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Beautiful....,"What a beautiful movie, it's a complete artists canvas filled with beautiful colours and shapes. Its fluid and living camera work swirls round like the air. The filters they use are gorgeous, one long advert. Amelie is herself beautiful as is the charming story.

Exquisitely touching and moving... 11 out of 10!,"An exciting event happened two nights ago: a new movie title entered my Top 10 list of all times: ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"".  I've seen hundreds of movies from all over the world during my short 40 years life experience, but few moved me and put me back instantly in my child's happy and careless life as Amélie.  The last movie to enter this special list was ""La Vita è bella"".Seen on opening night in Montréal with the two persons who have the most important place in my life, we looked at each other when the lights went on at the end and we all wished only one thing: to remain seated and live this experience immediately all over again.  I cannot wait to own this precious gem on DVD and use it as an antidepressant to life difficulties and gray moments.I do not want to reveal anything from the movie since too much has already been written here and by critics.  I just wanted to share my excitement with other moviegoers and my pride in telling everyone that - at last! - the French movie industry produced one of the best movies in my mother tongue. Fresh, imaginative, breathtakingly beautiful and impeccably played.  A movie that makes you smile, laugh, cry and feel so alive without the need of violence, cruelty, vulgarity and using just a bit of sex in good taste.  I hope the Americans will learn more about ""necessary"" cinema when they'll discover this masterpiece in a few weeks and that they will be clever enough to award it the Best Foreign Film Oscar on March 24, 2002.As many other IMDb users wrote, you feel so light and joyful when you go back in your real life after seeing Amélie that you really want to kiss everyone on the street and begin seeing the world differently.  A must-see for permanent unhappy and selfish people on this planet.  From now on, I will always enjoy going in a Photomaton and might leave a few pictures there...  If I'm lucky enough, Amélie and Nino might find them and invite me for a trip in their surreal exciting world!P.S.: I simply don't understand the people who find that 2 hours or so is too lengthy for Amélie's fabulous destiny...  It could even be longer and I would not mind at all.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the film editor applied the perfect pacing and have a wonderful sense of rhythm in telling us about Amélie's original dreams and magical accomplishments.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Don't know how you cannot enjoy this delight!,"Amelie is sugary sweet in its approach to life, those around us and the pleasures of things that go around us. For some it might be a bit of an unrealistic view on how life can be but really - who cares? This is a film that focuses on the good things in life, but also touches on the regrets some of us hold dear to us. Plotwise it is essentially a love story - though a weird sort of one that deals more with the chase rather than the ending kiss - and is an adventure of delights waiting to unfold.Audrey Tautou is perfect as the angel faced Amelie who is a somewhat oddball and takes delight in the small things in life - putting her hand in a sack of grain, cracking creme brule or skimming stones on water. She decides to turn people's lives for the better and ends up doing things such as matchmaking her colleague with a broken hearted stalker, punishing the nasty fruit and vegetable store owner for mistreating an employee and at the same time, falls in love with a guy who is almost as weird in her in terms of his pastimes.So what is the main purpose of this character? Quite simply - she is a misfit in society essentially. But she is well liked and pretty, but isn't entirely sure where her life is heading. She is a girl who is not sure about love and is sort of afraid of it, and thus seeks pleasure in making other people happy but forgets about herself.There are a lot of themes in this film and metaphors you can interpret which makes Amelie more than just sweet candy which is why it has mass appeal. It has a lot of humour, good performances and some funny visual effects. But in its essence, it is a film about not holding back in life and looking at all the fine things that life can bring us.Amelie is delight from start to finish. For some it might be a bit too sweet and you think you've overdosed on a lot of lollies but for the two hours it worth, it's well worth it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Charming. But not THAT charming.,"Amélie is a playful, whimsical film, very quirky. Maybe a little too quirky for its own good. It has acquired a reputation as being among the most charming and inspiring films ever. That is overselling things quite a bit. Yes, the movie has its charms. It will probably leave you with a smile on your face. But the truth is it's just a cute little film, a pleasant diversion but really nothing more than that. Audrey Tautou does an excellent job in portraying the title character, it's easy to fall in love with Amélie Poulain. But this young woman will frustrate you too. She sets out to do good, to bring happiness to others. That's nice. But she goes about it in such a roundabout way, nothing is ever straightforward. At times you really do wish the character, and the film, would just get on with it. Amélie doing things in her own very unique way is what gives the film much of its charm. But there comes a point where it's all a bit much.Amélie Poulain had a very sheltered childhood, she had no friends and unsurprisingly that has made her into a very socially awkward woman. She finds a man she might be interested in but is way too frightened to even introduce herself to him. Instead she concocts an elaborate scheme to make a tenuous connection with him. If there is one thing Amélie is good at it's concocting elaborate schemes. But will she ever overcome her fears and embrace the possibilities of love? Who knows? In the meantime she'll help others, spreading happiness the way only she can. The whole thing is very sweet, to the point the film almost drowns in sweetness. Tautou charms you all the way through but, charming though she is, she can't prevent the film from getting bogged down a bit. As Amélie's schemes play themselves out you get the sense the film is going in circles, not moving forward. It is a film of great imagination but imagination can only carry a film so far. There's not quite enough substance to pay off all the imagination. It all adds up to a reasonably entertaining, charming film. Not one of the most charming films ever, certainly not one of the most inspiring. But a film that should leave you feeling at the very least happy that you've seen it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the best French films I've seen in recent times,"I was blown away by Amelie even though there was substantial hype and hoopla surrounding the film. What is Amelie about? It is a great French movie combining the playful and eccentric nature so often deployed by period films when they're played out for fun. Audrey tatou is perfect for the titular character and the French capital has rarely looked as lovely. This film causes a stir when it was released in 2001 and you should have a look to see why. The dark comedic element, eccentric nature of the scenes and some great acting by Tatou should encourage you to do so.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Quirky, entertaining and fun","This is a colorful, different, whacky and fun movie. More like the adventures of a young female.

Pretty much what cinema is all about!,"What a wonderful film. I cannot honestly find one flaw!

Just do yourselves a favour and go and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Clever & touching.,"This movie is an embarrassment of riches, but could easily have been thirty minutes shorter. A story about a person doing good for the people around her with elements of fantasy and a love story at its center. This manipulations of Amelie are reminiscent of Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" although it's teeming with originality too. It's a mix of pleasant & ingratiating ideas. The pleasant ones are the reason to see it. The ingratiating ones border on the twee and sophomoric. I could have found half an hour to delete. For 'pleasant' it's a very hard sell. At a certain point you feel like Jeunet would strangle you if it made you like him more. I admire this movie more than I enjoy it. The cat and mouse things is a bit precious and goes on a bit too long. And I've never understood how if Matthieu is stroking Tatou's cheek in the funhouse, how can he not know it's her at Les deux Mouls? Her haircut is kind of distinctive from front or behind.It's miles beyond what Jeunet and Caro did in ""Delicatessan"" and ""City of Lost Children."" Two overwrought movies that are too clever for their own good and rapidly wear out their welcome. This is more directed. Some familiar elements from the other movies are mixed in with fresh ingredients here: Contrived cause and effect, special effects, eccentric camera work, twins, and innocent children.A commentary track by Jeunet is very nice. But it's a mystery why the special edition requires two dvds. There ain't much on it.The frizzy-haired gal behind the counter was Jean-Pierre Leauds hotty mother in the 400 Blows.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is not a movie!!!,"The first (and probably the only) movie that i gave less than 6 (3/10) from the top 250 movie list, and here is why:OK, first of all, I love Drama movies, specially movies that try to make you feel good through interesting human interactions between interesting characters. I just finished watching It's a Wonderful Life for the first time, and boy, did it make me feel good!!!Anyway, back tot this ""movie"". The problem is that it tries tooooooooo damn hard! The characters are weird and non-realistic, especially the annoying looking Amelie, the actions are all from an alien world and make the viewer find it even more difficult to relate to the characters (if that is even possible). ON top of that, it makes sure that you know it's a movie. You can see the director sitting there and the actors trying so hard to act, and that is the worst impression any movie can leave.This was my second movie I remember that i couldn't watch to the end (the other being Max Payne) cos I felt i want to kill someone while watching it. Now i can understand that some people might find it a really good movie, but a 8.5???? Oh come ooooonn!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing!,"When I had first seen the commercial for Amelie on TV, I decided I would see it in the theater, so until I could find time in my busy schedule I downloaded the trailer. Trailers always look good, Amelie's is no exception. When I watched the trailer for Pearl Harbor I thought the movie was going to be incredible, I have to say however, that it was a real disapointment. With this I began to worry that Amelie's trailer would turn into another Pear Harbor, in a sense. In no way was this the case, the movie was incredible, I couldn't believe it! I give it 5 stars. Amelie has become my new favorite movie - this is coming from a die hard StarWars fan. In two words: Wildly eccentric.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Simply Magic.,"I was recently in France on vacation.  Everyone was talking about how wonderful this movie was.  I didn't go see it, because i figured it would hit the States soon.  I own The City of Lost Children and Delicatessen.  I love the director's visuals and story telling.  I was not sure what to expect of this one.  It seemed quite different.  And it was.  But wonderfully so.  In taking fantastic events and placing them in a very ordinary world, it makes them even more magical. I'm in love with Amelie.

Realistic tale in a surrealistic style,"It's made in the same surrealistic style as Jeunet's earlier films, but has a storyline that is the most believable of them all. Jeunet still lets the camera get a bit to close to the characters, so that the lens slightly distort their features and let you study every pore of their skin. That's the surreal ingredience.But behind that, and beyond the unexpected turns of the events, lies a story about a young woman and here lonely life among her lonely neighbours. If it wasn't for the humour, the surprises and the surrealism this could easily turn into a sad story. Now it's instead a bittersweet tale of how life could be if we cared more for each other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It will likely go higher as it has all the ingredients of great movie-making: the direction is flawless, the actors are wonderful (especially Audrey Tautou as Amelie), the story is beautiful, imaginative, funny and touching, the photography and camera work are incredible. Did I mention that the music is fantastic too? This is as close to perfection as I've seen in any other movie, and it looks like the word is spreading: the theater was absolutely packed today, which I've never seen before for a french movie with subtitles.Just go see it for yourself.

Am I the only one who sees darker implications here?,"Everyone thinks this movie is so, um....sweet. I thought the sweetness was forced and deliberately so. Amelie skips along the surface of the world, doing good deeds to strangers whom she cannot even face or talk to. When she falls for a guy, she can't even talk to him. The whole thrust of the movie I took to be that Amelie needs to wake up from a dream world and she does so at the end, with its implications of sexuality. To really love someone is dangerous in this movie, as in the world: look at the man in the cafe who is frankly stalking his former girlfriend. His possesiveness ends up ruining his budding romance with the hypochondriac. This is the dangerous undertow of sexual love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Speechless,"I saw the movie second time today, and God forbid me from going to a movie on a Sunday evening.

It is and it was incredible, now I am back at home again, listening to the music of the movie, and remembering those beautiful brown eyes of Amélie Poulain. Thanks to my friend who suggested to go to this movie. The world might not be such a ""naive"" one as Amélie lýves in, but I wish it was. I prefer to live in such an imaginary world. Who cares if the movie has an effect of a ""lollipop"", life and people can be so bitter, some of us need their escape to find some ""sweetness"" and ""warmness"" in the movies... So millions and zillions of thanks to Jean Pierre Jeunet. A human being lives as long as they dream and imagine. The day I stop imagining and dreaming will be the day I will be dead. Even knowing those things may mostly happen in the movies, aren't most of us also dreaming of a ""love"" like that, and be pursued for? Let's be real, most of us do...

A psychiatric cocktail of lunacy,"Please do not be fooled: Amelie is sick in the head. The titular character has very palpable schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive dissorder and I believe some autism too.She behaves more like an alien in a flesh suit, than a person. The world she lives in is brightly overexposed, yellow, sacharine and tragically depressing.She belongs in a nuthouse, and the movie should be a documentary about her lunacy.

"Without Amélie, today's films are the scurf of yesterday's","Amélie is a film that I am happy I finally stumbled on. It has a healthy rating on IMDb and is among the top rated films of everything on the site which is awesome so my expectations were fairly high. I am glad I watched the movie. There was a few times in the film that I had to replay parts because I was so enthralled by what was going on screen that I could not keep up with the subtitles as a result of me watching the film instead of reading. The color in Amélie is akin to a Wes Anderson film and maybe Anderson took away some things from this film as he didn't quite hit his stride until the same year Amélie released. It was a fantastic year for this type of quirky film.There are many reasons to love Amélie. The major one is Audrey Tatou. She is strange but in a cute way yet frustrating way. Tatou does a fantastic job of delivering a lovable performance while playing a role that might have been designed for a different type of actress. She fit the role perfectly. Her interactions with the other characters are clever, witty and at times odd. One of the greatest parts of this movie is when she helps a blind man and explains everything she sees in a quick short way while still making it light hearted. That scene as well as many other parts of this movie forces you to think that Jean-Pierre Jeunet is light years ahead of everyone else. If this film were released today, it would most definitely receive some Oscar nominations and I believe that Tatou would win for best actress because she is that good in this role.There is so much more to say about this film but the best thing I can say to do would be to watch for yourself. Many parts of this movie are fantastic and you should be experience all of it for the first time without explanation or too much detail as it is hard to put into words how clever and beautiful this film is. From the daydreams to the book of ""family"" portraits, this movie is a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Magical fairytale,"It would be easy to list a whole string of superlatives about this film, but I sum it up as ""magical fairytale"". It has a very nostalgic feel with a ""chocolate box"" depiction of Paris. The characters are amazing, from Collignon the grumpy grocer who gets his come-uppance (not once but twice) to Joseph the cynical bar lizard, to the gentle and charming Amelie. None of them are unbelievable.Amelie is gorgeous but not in a supermodel way that makes one stop and stare (although she is very much my type ;-)). Everyone else is sort of average. You could bump into them any time.I need to mention the background music: it twinkles or is reflective and sombre, or uplifting according to Amelie's circumstances.I disagree with people who say this film should have been shorter. Maybe it would make the film ""tighter"", but as it stands it's really easy to soak up and still want more.I'm quite a fan of many French films, but I'd say this is the best I've seen now. IMHO it's better than ""A bout de souffle"", which is one of my top three favourites. I believe it will be the biggest French film of all time (I've no idea what currently is).It deserves more than 10/10. Go and see this film, twice. I did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The story, the characters, the surroundings, the cameramovements, the light, the scenery, the music, nothing, and I mean really nothing, has a bad side ... that's why this is a absolute 10 out 10 ten movie (a 10+ would be better).By the way, this morning I saw it for the third time.

Two hours to change your life,"""This movie will change your life"", that's what is said in trailer. I thought it was a bit pretentious ... before i watch it ! Don't be afraid of ghosts, Amelie Poulain will haunt you for days. I recommend you not to drive just after the film, because it could change your life in an unexpected way ! So how could a single movie change your life ? Well, it'll simply make you happy, and appreciate differently each little joy of life.This is the simple story of a young woman with a simple life (she is a barmaid), who decided one day to make people around her happy. She acts as a kind of guardian angel, a clever one. Anyway, she has a problem : she is very shy, so she can't take care herself of her own happiness. I won't tell you more about the story to preserve a bit of mystery.If you remember the two previous (except Alien 4) films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of lost children"", you'll find some strong similarities, and many actors of these movies are again present : Dominique Pinon, Rufus, Tiky Holgado, Serge Merlin, ... . Without Marc Caro, this movie lose the ""dark side"" of the previous ones : there is no violence, no death (except two, but amusing ones), the dominant colors are different. Yes, this film is a Romance, but not at all a naive and boring one, it is really full of details (you need to watch the movie several times to discover it), it's pure poetry. The music, light and simple, perfectly fits the story. One of the most important character of the film is Paris, not the touristy Paris but the charming, human and timeless one, and it contributes strongly to the enchanting atmosphere. Oops ! I nearly forgot to tell you that not only this film is touching and brilliant, but it is very funny ! Audrey Tautou is simply great as Amelie Poulain. Her smile and her big eyes could melt an iceberg, her mischievous voice make her a fairy. You'll undoubtedly love her. Other actors, like Dominique Pinon (what a great actor, so different roles each time, and so perfectly played !), Serge Merlin, Isabelle Nanty, Matthieu Kassowitz, and so many others are excellent. You are not forced to watch this movie, but it should be inhuman to ignore it, it should be refusing happiness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Delightful Escape into Life's Little Pleasures,"""Amélie"" is a whimsical and heartwarming film that beautifully celebrates the small pleasures in life and the relationships around us. The story follows the quirky and endearing Amélie Poulain, played by Audrey Tautou, as she starts a mission to bring happiness to those around her while discovering love and joy for herself.The film's cinematography is truly on another level, with vibrant colors, imaginative visuals, and captivating storytelling that draw you into Amélie's enchanting world. Each scene is meticulously crafted, creating a visually stunning experience that enhances the film's charming and magical atmosphere.One of the standout aspects of ""Amélie"" is its focus on the simple, everyday moments that often go unnoticed. From the satisfaction of skipping stones to the joy of cracking the caramelized top of a crème brûlée.The movie leaves you with a sense of warmth and upliftment.

Wonderful!,"I am not a person who believes in words very much, I think most of the time words can not express the depth and the intensity of feelings towards something or somebody. The world we live in is a cruel one. Everyone feels lonely from time to time, even in my country in which people stick their nose into others lives so often and for so much. What's wrong to go into a dream world, and a dream Paris, and meet with a very naive, charming person even if it is not for real.Some viewers wrote on their comments that they could not see what the movie was trying to tell although I think there may be several points that are very good to be reminded of. We as human being, especially getting to an older stage of our lives, and getting damages from the people or the incidents surrounding us, loose our innocence. Don't you sometimes dream about a world that is not so cruel, that you can touch another person and the other touches you in their own way? I loved the movie, it could not be any better. It touches your heart without making you feel deeply sad. Thanks a million times to Jean Pierre Jeunet who created a 2 hour escape into a beautiful dream world that also connects somehow to ours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good Movie,"Amélie is a film that gives us the receipt for a peculiar romance. It is filled with query humor and refreshing glimpse of isolation from reality. Amélie's physically and emotionally childhood lead her to an adulthood of loneliness and a lack of purpose. Unexpectedly she finds her life's calling. Through elaborate good deeds she finds herself a detached way to bring joy to others and herself. Finally she is force to abandon isolation and surrender to the vulnerability of love. Paris is an insightful locating for this film, it gives the viewer a foreshadowing of the happy ever after ending. However, it does not take any mystery away from the curves and bends of the plot. Paris is the city of romantic, but most of the film is shot inside of the confines of Amélie's apartment and the café she works at. Her physical and literal isolation are key elements to the tone of the film. Inside the confines of her apartments she finds Dominique Bretodeau box of treasures and sets out to help make other people happy, while unconsciously taking herself gradually out of isolation. Amélie's physically deprived childhood lead to her unusually disconnected nature, as well as her inability to function within the confines of common reality. Elements of the film demonstrate Amélie's reality compared to common reality. Common reality shows us what is plainly happening; Amélie sees Nino for the first time, the dreamlike world of the main character shows us the feeling of the scene, and the viewer can watch Amelia's heart glow and change in speed. A powerful object is the television, it is used as a window into her reality; it is a tool to show us how she is trapped, not only in physically isolation but also emotionally. Via the television she hears about the death of the princess, fantasies about how her death and hears the plea that pushes her to open her heart to Nino. One scene represents the fear Amélie has to be vulnerable, as she rides the spooky slow roller-coaster through the mass of things to find Nino, in his skeleton costume, sneaks up behind her. He lightly howls in her ear, she closers her eyes and let's go. Allowing herself to experience the thrill of the ride, the scene depicts the figurative nature of love. Mr. Dufayel seems to play a key figure in the plot, without him this movie would have continued on a frustrating path of the indecisive timid leading charter. The glass man, Mr. Dufayel, is the only person who recognizes Amélie's acquired ""good doer"" behaviors. He was also the only person to point out the crucial fact she was overlooking her own inadequacies. The glass man is a very interesting character in this film, he shares similar isolated tendencies much like Amélie's, however, his physical isolation is not made by his own choice. He's bone disorder keeps him isolated in his own home, however, he chooses to selectively distance himself from other people. Once he sees Amélie's similarities to himself he knows that it is vital to push her to pursue a more filling life than he himself has lead.Jean-Pierre Jeunet unexpected visual style added another layer to this film for me. I think it was very well shot, and the quirky characteristics of the main characters were made to live through the screen. I enjoyed the big close-ups of the main characters, this did a job of further confirming their emotions and feelings to the audience. Also I thought it was very refreshing when Amélie would break away from the narrative and talk directly to the camera. The writing was good; however, I think the numerous sub stories in the film make it a bit too long. The many other characters to enrich the plot, but I would have preferred under one hundred minutes. The films female lead centered storyline is unlike Hollywood writings, and has lead me to see I prefer this films style of writing much more than the latter. Romantic comedies all have happy endings, and Amélie is a romantic comedy that follows suit. One thing that makes it different is that is coils through the sub stories and gives us a very comprehensive view of the female lead before her love interest comes into the film. The main elements that I saw throughout this film that were being grouped together were people. I see groups of similarities between; her mother and father, Amélie and Mr. Dufayel, Georgetta and Joseph, and finally Mr.Collignon and Lucien. The grouping of the elements that happened at the same time on the same day, just in difference parts of a city. There are characters who are do gooders, like Amélie and Luicus, and people who need that extra push in life, like her father, the widowed neighbor, and the glass man. In this group of givers and takers the viewer watches as the people who Amélie does not think deserve what they receive face retribution. She finds her own mischievous way of obtaining justice against Mr. Collige. At the same time the writers avenge the discard of Mr. Bubbles as well as the unkind way Amélie was treated by killing off her mother. The events that happen in the real world compared to the events that are illusionary in Amélie's mind show the viewer a more enhanced view of reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Buuuuuum!,"First time I saw trailer for Amelie I said:"" This is something as stupid as it can be"". But one day I decided to rent the movie and I was surprised. I have never seen something like this. So colorful, amazing with great characters and unusual situations and above all fantastic music. Amelie as a character is very well described through lots of details and her behavior, feelings, situation can be compared with ordinary, live people. Cause this type of people exactly feels like Amelie feels. For those who love love stories this is the greatest film story made by this moment.

This film is fantastic!,"What is there to say about this film other than that it is across the board fantastic?  If ever there was a foreign language film deserving of the attention that it seems to be getting over here, then this is it.  2 hours that pass like 2 minutes, and you're walking out of the cinema feeling a whole lot better than when you went in.This follows the tale of the eponymous Amélie, who having had a solitary childhood, lives alone and keeps herself to herself.  Amélie however, has a big heart and sets about anonymously helping out the various people in her life and generally trying to `do good'.  But when it comes to applying this same help to herself, her shyness means she prefers to remain in her fantasy world, rather than acting to make her own life happier.This is a fantastically told, truly funny and heartwarming film.  And all this before even mentioning the inordinate beauty of Audrey Tautou (Amélie), who has the most amazing eyes and soul warming smile in the history of cinema / the World!Visually, the film excels, with a great look and style to it (unsurprising to anyone who has seen any of Monsieur Jeunet's previous films, from City Of Lost Children right down to Alien Resurrection), and is possibly as near a perfect movie as I have seen in ages.If you don't walk out of this film totally loving it then you have 2 facts to face: 1) you have no taste and 2) your heart is made of stone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good,"On Saturday morning, I chose to watch a disc. Angel Loves Beauty ""made me spend 2 beautiful hours in excitement and ecstasy.Audrey Tatum's smile captured me, her smile so bright and pure. When her smile bloomed brilliantly, it immediately made people think of being out of the dust, even the world lost its color.Of course, the film itself also brought me immense joy. Because the puzzle it set not only challenged my daily experience, but also challenged my thinking limitations. All the details, all the shots, all the plot, completely out of place.

Favourite Movie of All Time,"I adore Amélie. There's something so wonderful and hopeful about this film. I generally don't like romance, but this is a true exception. I have seen this more times than I know. Amélie is wonderful and quirky. All of the characters have their own fascinating charm. The colour scheme is lovely. I am a huge reader and subtitles make a film all the more interactive and fun for me - give me something to do. There are so many hilarious scenes and so many sad scenes. You really go through a gamete of emotions with this film. The soundtrack is in my incredibly biased opinion, the best I've ever heard. I listen to it regularly. It makes me feel sad and it makes me feel alive. I adore this more than I can ever hope to explain. This movie gets all the stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Bit disjointed but a lot of charm,"God do I wish I liked this movie as much as everyone else seems to like it. It's so SO SO SOOOOO close for me. Everythings there, characters, music, plot, creativity etc. It all just doesn't fully come together for me. The colour correction is really cool, and every time Amelie continues her scavenger hunt type quest to make peoples life better it's really cool. All the characters have some sort of quirk and their respective actors play them quite well. Amelie herself is played brilliantly considering most of the performance has to be non-verbal. If it all fit together a bit better I think this could have been a really great film to me but it just didn't happen. Although I will say I wasn't in a particularly wanting to watch a movie mood and this still entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What a joy!,"I saw this movie last night, and I don't think my feet have yet touched the ground!  What a silly, sweet, rueful little comedy--little used here affectionately, of course.  This is a film for anyone who has ever felt lonely, unloved, afraid to live.  Amelie helps so many around her, yet she seems unwilling (not unable) to help herself; it took me awhile to realize the depth of her fear.  For such a lighthearted movie to touch on so powerful an emotion reveals that ""Amelie"" isn't quite so simple as it initially seems.  Audrey Tautou is so physically perfect for the role, that she wouldn't even have to act--luckily for us, she knows how to turn hesitancy and slyness into a comic art form.  And Mathieu Kassovitz (grrr!) finds just the right tone; everything we hear about Nino from others is there, but he allows us to see much more than he lets others see.  They are a perfect match, and the joy in the movie is watching them pursue, back away, go forward, stumble away out of fear of contact. And the squeaky-clean faux-city the director creates is the perfect rarefied atmosphere for this little tale (in fact I find the movie fails only when it goes back to the country--the subplot involving Amelie's father and a ceramic gnome is an old joke, not deftly handled).  This is a keeper.  Go to see it if you're down; heck, go see it even if you are happy--it will merely lift you higher!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Star rating: 3 out of 5,"Amelie is an extraordinary film, and this makes the ordinariness of its conclusion profoundly unsatisfying.  Throughout the movie (known as Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain in its country of origin, France) the characters are presented as delightfully quirky - Amelie enjoys running her hands through sackfuls of grain; her father likes lining up his shoes and polishing them; Nino keeps an album of photos discarded by their owners - so the ending, where Amelie and Nino leap into bed together, just as would happen in any other movie, is a huge letdown.The premise is simple: one day Amelie Poulain finds a small box of 'treasures', which would appear to have been hidden by a small boy 40 years ago.  She decides to return the box to its owner, and if he is appreciative she will continue in her quest to help those around her.One of the strengths of the film is that - much like real life - nobody is 'normal'.  As well as being introduced to characters, we are also shown their idiosyncrasies and history. However, Amelie's running time of over two hours feels too long and one gets the impression that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has attempted to fit too much into what is a light-weight movie.It is also very funny in places, notably when Amelie takes revenge on an intolerant neighbour.  It is interesting how we can, after an interval of five years, look back on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and recall with a wry smile how completely it consumed our attention at the time. Overall this is a charming and whimsical film (even if at times it is a little too aware of its quaintness), and certainly deserving of a more fitting finale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Shove this romance down your throat,"Every single moment of this movie is calculated to be lovable. With a wink. I hate these movies that attack you with whimsy, and this is one of the most violent I've seen. Not only is it achingly cute but it's also ""naughty"" with wild offscreen sex and endearing porn shop employees. I don't understand why in these romantic comedies I'm supposed to care about whether two people who don't even know each other get together or not. I'd rather see Amelie as a movie where this couple gets together and then he gets to find out what a nutjob she is. Can you imagine living with this woman and her wacky schemes? There are a lot of clever little details, like the identity of the photo booth guy and the traveling gnome, but these don't take away the pain, they just dull it. ** out of ****",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Simply a fun, feel-good movie","It's a romantic comedy set in Paris in 1979 and August-September 1997. It follows the fantasies and experiences of a young woman who works as a waitress in a corner café.Amélie Poulain (Flora Guiet/Audrey Tautou) is the introverted only daughter of physician Raphaël (Rufus) and schoolmistress Amandine (Lorella Cravotta). Her mother tragically dies when Amélie is six, so she is raised by her overly protective and emotionally distant father. However, Amélie has an active imagination and mischievous spirit that follows her into adulthood. Extraordinary coincidences frequently occur that lead to further imaginings and mischiefs.As a young adult of 23, Amélie's adventures begin when she is startled by the death of Princess Diana. When she drops something in the kitchen on hearing the news, a tile comes loose behind which she finds a tin box that belonged to a little boy 40 years earlier. She decides to find the boy to see if having it returned makes him happy. When it does, she decides to make people around her happy as well.She then engages in happiness generation with many people, including an elderly neighbor who paints (Serge Merlin), an obnoxious greengrocer (Urbain Cancelier) and his brow-beaten assistant (Jamel Debbouze), fellow workers at the Café des Deux Moulins, including a fellow waitress (Clotilde Mollet) and tobacco clerk (Isabelle Nanty) and a male customer (Dominique Pinon) who harasses the female staff. And then there is the eccentric young man, Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who gathers and catalogs discarded photos at self-service photo booths when he's not working at the counter in a sex shop.Amélie imagines many possibilities for all her acquaintances, including her father, and tries to generate happiness with consequences for those who resist. And through it all, she finds love.""Amélie"" is simply a fun, feel-good movie. It's fast-paced and whimsical and makes no attempt to be taken seriously. You leave the theater smiling. Audrey Tautou is remarkable in portraying an alert and observant naïveté. Most secondary characters are also good, especially Kassovitz and Pinon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A surrealist feel good movie,"""Amélie"" is the ultimate feel good movie. During most of the film Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is busy repairing the unhappiness of other people, but what about herself?Unlike most of the feel good movies, ""Amélie"" is not in the first place a romance. The film is above all surrealist. Making surrealist movies was the specialty of director Jean Pierre Jeunet, who had made earlier films like ""Delicatessen"" (1991) and ""La cité des enfants perdus"" (1995). After ""Amélie"" his only successful film would be the wardrama ""Un long dimanche de fiancailles"" (2004).Watching ""Amélie"" I was struck by the bright colors, especially green and red (see poster). A few month ago I saw these colors also by ""Beanpole"" (2019, Kantemir Balagov). In this film the colors had a symbolic meaning. In ""Amélie"" they emphasize above all the consciously chosen artificiality of the film.I was amazed to see Mathieu Kassovitz as one of the actors. The director of the socially critical ""La Haine"" (1995) is here acting in a movie who's sole purpose is to give a few hours relief from daily worries. He is doing very well, but the big star of the film was the relatively unknown (at that time) actress Audrey Tautou as Amélie. In this film Audrey Tautou is a contemporary version of another Audrey: Audrey Hepburn. She has the right mix of beauty, naivety and androgyny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A strange mixture of genius and...,"... I don't really know what the other ingredient of the mixture is, but it is annoying.I must say, ""Amelie"" was one of the most unexpected disappointments in my life as a cinemaphile.I love French cinema in general (as opposed to Hollywood films - even the most acclaimed ones have at least one corny moment that makes me cringe). And the basic premise of this film was so much to my taste that I couldn't wait to see it.And sure enough: the photography and the overall cinematic ""style"" are gorgeous; so is the sense of humour of the first 30 minutes or so.But then, halfway through the film, ""Amelie"" simply lost me. I am not sure why. Maybe it was the overexerted ""fairy tale"" style which put me off it. (And that could be because the implicit message of ""fairy tales"" is that they are just that: fairy tales.)Perhaps the people who rave about it are starved for fairy tales in their lives. (No offence intended - please!) If this film made someone look at their life in a different light - good for them! I am glad.To me, it looked too far removed from the magic of true life to really make an impact - or even keep me in front of the screen.I feel ""Amelie"" is a missed opportunity for something that could have been truly, amazingly great.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the greatest of all times,"One of my favorite of all times:) Love the music and the plot. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. He had done a great job... Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper","Amélie is a film predicated off of a whimsical color pattern - consisting mostly of urine-yellows, pea-greens, and blood-reds - and an impossibly fantastical world with a unique presence at its core. It opens by defining the characters that surround our protagonist Amélie Poulain (the uniquely beautiful Audrey Tautou) by their strangest, most peculiar quirks; one character gets deep enjoyment out of using his fingers to elaborately dissect the hot carcus of a turkey and another character's greatest pleasure is emptying our her purse just to put everything back again. In the grand scheme, these quirks are fairly minor, but the fact that these are the traits screenwriter Guillaume Laurant wants us to immediately associate these characters with - not a job, a specific education, a personality trait, or a personal history - is, in itself, a tad subversive.With that, we finally meet Amélie, a woman who was kept largely sheltered as a child, being homeschooled by her now-dead mother and, as a result, learning to escape monotony and certain gloom by running away in the realms of her imagination. Working as a waittress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, France, Amélie has consistently led a fairly isolated life largely focused on herself, until one day, her motivations change in the blink of an eye. Upon hearing the breaking news report concerning the death of Princess Diana, she drops the cap to her perfume, which rolls and eventually dislodges a loose tile. Behind the tile is a small tin of trinkets, presumably belonging to a young child. Amélie decides it was something of her destiny to find this box and return it to the rightful owner, and before long, she finds her destiny of helping others panning out with another circumstance of a lost item.The significance and contents of said lost items are irrelevant; their purpose is to, in turn, provide Amélie with something she never had before and that something is a reason to exist and belong. Throughout her life, while not depressed nor particularly sad, Amélie's loneliness has been a constant thing she's had to battle in her day-to-day actions; it's been the typical daily occurrence of her to wake up, go to work, and relish in her alone time for years on end. These situations allow her to search for some kind of companionship, further develop her love for humankind, and find maybe even find a romantic partner.Of course, I'm making this sound a lot more extravagant than I think I should be. Amélie, through all its color and decorated mise-en- scene, is a drearily familiar story with its original element being the fact that it's captured in a realm of artificiality that, in turn, makes it appear far more compelling than it ever manages to naturally be. It reminds me of the lesser films of Wes Anderson, which weren't so much concerned about how many objects, costumes, and people could be fixed into one particular frame, or the general excitement of dialog as much as they were presentation and eccentric dialog.While the visuals in Amélie are colorful marbles, and the juxtaposition of characters with cinematographical color (the work of the great Bruno Delbonnel, who'd go on to work with the Coen brothers and Tim Burton in more recent years) is unmistakable, these efforts feel more geared to disguise the fact that Amélie is a relatively simple story with little in the way of remarkable themes. The presence of scenes ostensibly colored by way of a filter over the lens, canted angles (most notably during a scene showcasing a character named Bredoteau's most traumatic moment as a child), and lavish setpieces almost entirely blind us by whimsy and warmth until we realize the takeaway from the film is that of an empty candy wrapper.There's something to be said about Tautou, however, who remains an interesting screen presence throughout the film simply because of her presentation. Her jet-black hair, petite figure, frequently blood- red wardrobe and lipstick, and ghostly paleness make her protrude out in nearly every scene, even if the background is a pulsating hue of red - as it is in a scene when she reads a letter in a bathroom. In addition, scenes in the sex shop bring a fascinating level of warmth to a place often condemned and avoided for its almost inherent seaminess. But just like I find myself doing now, one winds up remembering Amélie for short, eye-catching scenes rather than a complete film with an impacting takeaway.Starring: Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz.

Best Film of 2001,"Amelie represents what is wonderful in film.  The story is entertaining and funny, including several brief anecdotes about the characters and what they think about as well as creative cinematography.  The actress who plays Amelie is adorable without being irritating and her adventures are a perfect example of the excitement in reality that everyone wants to experience. Jeunet is a master of buildup who has proven that while the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the lines which curve and bend make the trip much more interesting.  He is able to make the audience believe that strange and extraordinary things can happen in reality.

But I'm surprised at how people are calling it fresh, different, etc. The Little-Miss-Fixit protagonist goes back at least to Mary Pickford or Janet Gaynor, and her way of meddling anonymously to the betterment of other peoples' lives is a direct steal from 1960's ""Bells are Ringing,"" which itself was not exactly revolutionary. All the director has done is apply a slick veneer of TV-commercial techniques to a very old story, emphasizing trendy camerawork and fancy cutting. There are giggles throughout, and you'd have to be an awful curmudgeon not to like it, but less sugar might have actually made it tastier. Also, in its completely extraneous dirty jokes (the humping-in-the-loo sequence, the porn-shop scenes), it shows an all-too-willingness to stoop to cheap laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A little touch of innocence is always appreciated.,"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or Amélie, classified as Comedy and Drama, brings both categories in a different way, almost as innocent, a movie that can make you laugh or think for an entire night about how many details exist around us, and how so many of it we see, Amélie is exactly about this, how blindly innocent we are to not see everything around us, and still think that we do, not only the narrative of the film can enchant you in such deep romantic and funny attitudes, but everything in the movie, from the amazing performance by Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain) to the magnificent soundtrack by Yann Tiersen.Amélie Poulain sees everything around herself with so much attention, kind and innocent, on her own way of being, always trying to do the best to bring happiness to everyone around her, the narrative of the film involves you to go along with Amélie's point of view.Get a nice afternoon, sit down, relax and take 2 hours off from your thoughts about problems, job, school and everything else, and watch this movie, I promise you, you gonna feel nostalgic by something that you don't even know.

The magic keeps on flowing...,"8 months have passed since I had the unique opportunity to be one of the first persons to see a movie not like any other movie ever filmed before. Never a movie captured me before like this one, never a movie provoked such a positive emotional reaction inside me than this story about the little things in one's life.The story didn't need a superhero trying to save the world, neither did it need expensive special effects to attract people to go and see this wonderful movie and to be delighted in a absolute marvelous way.After returning several times to the theatre enjoying this movie a few times more, I couldn't wait to get the DVD in my hands and be able to see it at home as often as I possibly can. Finally my collector's edition DVD of Amélie Poulain arrived by mail and I couldn't resist opening it instantly and watching the movie in all its beauty on my home television.Now, after experiencing all the magical scenes over and over again, I'm sitting again before my computer screen, listening to the incredible soundtrack and writing my second review of this exceptional movie. I will not forget the extraordinaire experience I lived through when seeing this unique and refreshing movie for the first time.Above all the great things one can say about this truly life-changingcinematic masterpiece, there is just one negative thing I can point out about Amélie Poulain... this being that one has to wait maybe another 10 years to see a movie equally good in its story, characters and execution.This movie is as perfect as a movie can be, that's why I'm rating it with 10 out of 10.Thank you Jeunet for this one...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
2001 Film of the Year,"In a year of film that was enmeshed in mediocrity, there was one effulgent star that shined far brighter than the rest.  That film was Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, ""Amelie.""  Jeunet adeptly exacts excellence in all aspects of this film.  His use of colors and cinematography is magnificent, and the acting is first rate.  Audrey Tautou proves to be more than proficient at capturing the nuances of her character.  Every word she utters, and every face she makes, leave no doubt in your mind that she was born to play the part of Amelie.  Also, her surrounding cast are effective at both complimenting Amelie's character, and establishing themselves as part of this truly captivating tale.Further, director Jeunet proves his worth in the use of subtleties to help paint the larger picture.  I've actually seen this work of art twice, and the second viewing was actually much better than the first.  Many of the details that initially seemed inconsequential, actually turned out to be quite prophetic in the end.  Pay close attention to the details of Amelie's solitary childhood, and how it ushers in her inability to truly communicate with others.  This is just one example of Jeunet's effort in this carefully crafted work.  In short, he does a masterful job of tying together many details, and thus, artfully presenting a film that will leave you begging for more.Finally, the soundtrack is indeed the crowning jewel of ""Amelie.""  An already great film is enhanced much further by Yann Tiersen's stroke of genius.  Unfortunately, I was so enraptured with the film the first time, that the music was taken in more on a subconscious level.  Upon reading about the soundtrack, I made a concerted effort to pay more attention to the music the second time.  Thank goodness I made the effort, because the music adds to the film in grand fashion.If you haven't seen ""Amelie,"" run, don't walk to the theatre.

A piece of art,"The story of this film is about the life of a girl named Amélie Poulain who one day she meets a boy in a really strange way. During all the film, Amélie will try to find that boy again and learn what love is, but in a very unusual way. I would like to say that this film is a piece of art and that, without any doubts, it is my favourite film.Even though the film is telling a daily life story, it is not told in an usual way. The mechanism in which the film is based to tell the story and to show all the scenes seems awesome to me, everything happens like if we were looking at a production chain in a factory. Also, the fact that the story is that unusual and funny, make this even better as we do not expect at all what is going to happen again.Furthermore, the fact that the story is not told neither by Amélie nor by a normal narrator but by a narrator who knows more than us and predicts what is going to happen, is one of the best points of this film. At some points during the film, the narrator says what is going to happen in the next few seconds or even in other scenes so, it is funny to know more or less funny to be watching a movie which seems like a realistic novel where we are even inside the head of the characters. Also, at some points, Amélie interacts with the narrator, giving us a more unrealistic feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Light, easy-going, feel-good","Amélie Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet Starring Audrey TautouFor what its worth, Amélie is a good example of what feel-good movies are supposed to be. Light, joyful, and easygoing, one can only think of his or her childhood to imagine the feeling the protagonist, Amélie Poulain, radiates. From the opening credits itself, you would already expect Amélie to be different than most people. You will laugh at her and her parents' eccentricities, yet you'll feel melancholic after finding out that Amélie's heart problem is nothing more than the desire to be hugged. In the later scenes, you will feel that Amélie exudes a distinct aura; she seems to brighten up the place she goes to.Amélie's attitude and upbringing sets the events of the movie. She finds happiness in the simplest of things. Also, it is her gift to bring joy to others, regardless of how simple or complicated the joys appear. But she doesn't simply choose to help others; it appears to be her fate. The movie is very specific with certain moments in time, and at these moments something beautiful happens. It's as if the movie is telling us to live each moment in time to the fullest, because we will never know if this is the end.The lines were light and funny, and were well-performed by the cast. The film does not expound too much on lines--a thorough analysis of the lines is minimally required to understand the character's personality.Yet the only noticeable flaw in this movie is Amélie's character. She could not do to herself what she has done to others. She helps others realize the intricate beauty of life too much that she cannot see what the people she helped experience. This flaw ultimately balances Amélie's character and makes her much more appealing and appreciated.The cinematography of Amélie is wonderfully constructed--so much that many critics and fans consider the movie an moving artwork. Notable are the camera movements employed, such as zooming-in scenes in the introduction of Amélie's parents. And the Paris backdrop is, needless to say, beautiful.Amélie is a light-hearted, heart-filling wonder, and is worth every cent and minute spent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

(Interesting aside: Amelie is rated as 14th on the IMDb list of top 250 films; while Traffaut's Jules et Jim, the film Amelie watches everyone else watch, has been rated by only 1880 and is apparently not on the list.

Wholesome view of ones struggles and the fruition of finally taking the chance.,"Audrey Tautou plays Amelie, a young, kind and light-hearted girl who was determined, from an early age to help people. Everyone but herself. She actively tries to help her co-worker and pushes her to pursue the new guy in her life that is actively eyeing her. She also tries to help the old man, who is her neighbor.But when it comes to taking that very chance, a connection she feels with a sex store employee, she's not sure of and if she should take it. Does she take it in the end or not? Alas, in the colorful world she's in, everything's possible.The director uses Amelie's active and inner monologue, along with many of her flashbacks to her past and also thoughts, to pull us into Amelie's curious, albeit peculiar, happy and content little world. The colors are also uplifted and almost everything seems rather clean by design. This is Amelie's world and he wants us to be invested in it.With the little experience she has, she indeed tries to take that chance and teach, not only her peeps, but also us, the way to happiness and the importance of choice.The soundtrack possesses those stereotypical French music notes, which isn't a bad thing. It sure uplifts those fun and humorous upbeats and also those mellow and unsure moments.The famous ""Comptine d'un autre ete, l'apres midi"" music, makes its viewers feel that the road might seem heavy and difficult to purse, but if one takes the chance, who knows what it might bring them? Love, happiness, purpose. Among other things.The smaller actors are a welcome addition to its already impressive cast. Their comedic timing, curiousness and sillyness makes its viewers laugh, relax and be at ease.The new millenium opened with a happy and optimistic gem, that is surely one of the best films that all film lovers deserve to see, at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Movie for the Dreamers,"I have a message for all who might scoff at this movie.Yes, of course this movie is a fantasy, all movies are. If you want the run of the mill fantasy; your gritty, your bloody, or your just plain gruesome, you can have it. But don't knock a movie that has heart just because you have forgotten yours. If you are not touched by movie's end, if your heart does not palpitate in recognition of past memories reenacted on-screen, if you do empathize with Amelie's losses, her shyness, her utter humanity,I am afraid, you have lived your life in vain-or are otherwise very hardened. To not know the pain of solitude or the loss of a dear friend or the fear of becoming close to someone and letting them truly know you is a reflection on you, not the movie. If you cannot relate to this movie you are living your life in a box. Either that or you take life too literally.Also, you cynics, you must remember this is a movie. (A wonderful, excellent, quirky, and endearing film.) Yet, there is one requirement for viewing this film. You must be a dreamer. This is the movie for the underdogs who have never lost the courage to look up at the stars and thank God-or whomever-for the gift that they possess just by being alive. Amelie teaches us to be thankful for the little things, a child's laugh, a cat's purr, a blue sky, simple acts of kindness. And believe me, by reading these hateful reviews, these are things that we, as a culture and a world, need to be reminded of.Maybe next time you're watching a film you think is superior to the so-called fluff of Amelie, you could do a reality check and realize life imitates art but only for those who truly believe in beauty.To the dreamers: Don't let the cynics dissuade you, watch this film at all costs, Amelie will inspire you as only a kindred spirit can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"If you see one film in your life, see this one!","This is, without doubt, among the best films I have ever seen and in the direct aftermath of the attack of colour, surreality and bon-vivant (no pun intended) this film imbibes, I would have to say, it IS the best film I've ever seen. You don't have to know Paris to enjoy this film, but boy does it help! And if you don't want to go there after seeing it, there is something wrong with you!The pace is wonderful, the cinematography and colour are spectacular, the story, while at times is a little predictable (I found myself congratulating myself on knowing what was going to happen next in one instance but this just made the scene better!!), is so well thought and processed that you don't have time to find falities in it and the characters are just superb. I have to disagree with Diand. I thought the length of the movie was perfect. A story had to be told and it was given the time and place to be executed. There are the eccentricites of French cinema as only they can do (similar to the orgasm scene in Delicatessen) littered all over the place and they are gems.

Allow yourself to be immersed...If you don't skip a stone on a canal or lake, if you don't travel abroad, if you don't try and paint a picture and if you don't try and make someone else happy after seeing this film, then you've missed the point...Either that or you're dead!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I walked out grinning like an idiot.,"I am a hard-hearted cynic of the first degree.  I loathe children and see animals as potential footwear.  It takes a hell of a movie to make me care or even crack a smile, but man, if I didn't walk out of ""Amelie"" grinning like a complete and total buffoon.  ""Amelie"" is cinematic wizardry of the first order.Paris has never looked better as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet centers his story on an Oscar-worthy performance by Audrey Tautou.  So vulnerable, so cute, so unabashedly good, the emotions of the character of Amelie Poulin seep into the minds and hearts of the audience.  She is surrounded by quirky neighbors and co-workers that make up a few major strokes of ""Amelie's"" canvas.  Jeunet also populates his film with bizarre special effects that provide a better grasp of the interior of Amelie's world, making the entire movie a free-for-all funhouse of imagination and wit.Anything could happen, which is not something you could say for ninety-nine percent of the romantic comedies that are released in America.  Freddie Prinze Jr./Tom Hanks/Richard Gere falls in love with Jessica Biel/Meg Ryan/Julia Roberts, but doesn't really talk to her very much, before gunning to the airport to talk her off a plane before she goes to New York/San Francisco/Los Angeles for school/work/her fiance.  Here, time is taken, characters are developed, and a journey is made instead of stagnant scenes where the male hero talks to his insipid best friends.  ""Amelie"" is so full of brilliance and charm and full on verve that the pat and simple ending may not come for those who want it.**** out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amelie is dreadfully relatable and scheming and it is very easy to fall in love with her character. All of the characters'writing is wonderful. It's a very relaxing movie and not full of annoying drama, but it is something you must pay attention to.

Pointless Movie Masquerading as an Excellent One!,"Although it has a remarkable musical score, good reviews, good performances, a good-looking leading actress and a great speech by the narrator, the whole movie was a disappointment. It seemed an excellent movie, since most reviewers recommended it a lot saying that it deserves the highest possible accolade; nevertheless I consider them quite wrong, I never thought this movie would become so bad and pointless.I must stress that some of the piano music was interesting, but it didn't fit together with the whole plot. The music should have been more appropriate for this movie.After the movie ends, what do you feel? Did you feel satisfied? If you want to know my answer, well, it's that I didn't feel anything and I didn't feel satisfied at all. Perhaps the narrator made me follow the story without disliking it so much; however, his great speech couldn't make it any better. ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is one of the worst and most over-rated French movies I've ever seen. I can't believe most people liked it, nor did I think this movie should've been awarded an Oscar for best foreign picture. What are people thinking? It shouldn't have even received nods for academy awards. I'm glad it didn't win any. This is one of the few times I barely agree with the academy picks. I'm sure ""No man's land"" is better than this.When I read the news articles of this movie I discovered that the director of this immature and pointless movie said before the Academy awards ceremony that if he won an Oscar for this movie, he'd sleep with the statuette for a month. I'm not pretty sure if he said ""for a month"", I don't remember. In fact it doesn't matter how long he'd sleep with it, it matters that he said that. What does he think of life? Does he think that an academy award is a holy thing? He's as ridiculous and immature as his whole movie is"". Anyway I hope nobody is offended by this comment, I just said what I thought. I don't think the director should have said such things. An Oscar is something to be proud of, but it's not something to worship and sleep with. I assume it's the reason why he didn't get it. 3/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tragedy?,I was to see a film proving that you don't need a tragedy to make it good. That may cause some people to think it's not that deep but they should look again. If there is a tragedy it's those people's apathy toward humanitarian films like this. It's nice to see so many liked it.For me it also contained a nice subtle social commentary on celebrity. (all the fuss over Princess Diana humanitarian efforts when there are hundreds of other 'nobodys' out there doing the same thing). My favourite scene would have to be the man at the bar pouring his heart out while the bar tender makes a joke about the microwave.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sugar for the soul.,"I went to see this movie with some friends on a whim.  It was recommended to us by one of our French-speaking friends.  I was a little wary, but decided to immerse myself in the experience. From the opening of the movie, I could tell I was in for something different.  The images and the sounds were brilliant, whisking me away into a different world.  Character development was short and snappy, but very effective.  As each character is introduced, we hear little facts and intimate details about them.  Once you understand these details, you feel like you can really identify with these people.  They become more human and less cellophane.  The pace of the movie is sometimes difficult to follow, especially if you have to read the subtitles.  But it definitely is nice to hear the real actor's voices and intonations.  I really dislike how Hollywood tends to dubb movies for audience appeal.  Anyway, the plot is absolutely delightful!  The audience was laughing every few minutes, and every face was glued to the screen.  At the end, people applauded...twice! The last time that happened was when I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  This movie definitely ranks up there with that one.  But whereas ""Crouching Tiger..."" left you feeling somewhat unsure of what to feel, ""Amelie"" left me with deep satisfaction and a love for life and all its excentricities.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
YAAAAAWwwwwwny,"After suffering through this movie, I feel entitled to comment on this mess of a movie. OK, I admit the only reason why I watched it in the first place was because it was ranked high up on IMDb top250 list. I had however strong suspicions that this was not the kind of movie I'd like and I was very right for sure.The main problem with this movie is that none of the characters are real people. Nothing they say or do make any sense. Amelie, her mother and her father are all prototypes from a comic book. I suppose the way we see the characters portrayed in this movie is suppose to be witty and clever, but..oh.rrr..its very un-funny and reminds me why I (mostly) hate French comedies. It's all very dreamy and 'romantic' (but in a very bad, overcooked way).But If you like 'Life Is Beautiful (1998)', Ally McBeal and irritating self-centered main characters, then you probably like this one too (and obviously many of you do..so what can I say..)Go catch some 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' or (anything else for that matter) to flush this one out of your system.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Gradually she realizes her own life needs fixing, and a chance meeting leads to her most elaborate stratagem of all. This is a deeply wonderful movie, an illuminating mix of magic and pragmatism.

Unfortunately, it is also lonely, so Amelie plays at match-making, avenging, and discovering -- romping through her comfortable Paris with a warm heart and a devilish mind. Populated with characters as intricate and charming as our heroine, the movie is a whirl of emotions, characters, and layers of meaning set with cafe china and velvet boudoir curtains.

Simply the best French comedy since ever!,"Simply the best French comedy since ever and maybe the best movie in the history of cinema!

European cinema at its best,"I must confess that I rate movies I like pretty high, so for movies I love I miss the 11 for ranking. ""Die fabelhafte Welt der Amelie"" (as a F/BRD co-production it was directed in Paris but i think co-financed from Germany and after long waiting finally was dubbed in german) surprised me in many ways! First the movie was nearly sold out and so my place was terrible and in front at the edge. Nevertheless i was for 2 hours entertained like seldom before,a suicidal gold fish, garden dwarves on a voyage round the world and the imaging of a romantic and fabulous world...Jean-Pierre Jeunet - you know, this wired European who commited Alien 4 (in which at the end North-america is blown away) - is a wonderful creative director and I fell instantly with Audrey Tautou in love. I could just say ""Amelie"" will be a ""classic movie"" but imho this film is more! It has - well, call me crazy - a special magic that only few movies posses but for that i love cinema. The High-Score on imdb -currently 8.6 - didnt surprise me, ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is one of the most successful french movies, but please hollywood, dont even think of a remake! In only two sentences: What a wonderfully, magical tale. Charming actors, wonderful location, rivetting script, fantastic cinematography. . .",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Imaginative, Innovative, Smart, Beautiful...","This movie was an absolute breath of fresh air. It was a bright movie, in both senses of the word. It's colors and just at the edge of your imagination special effects, were just that... special. You felt like you were in the expansive mind of this amazing woman. At no time did I feel my intelligence was insulted, it just kept me with a wistful smile painted on my face. My gaze never left this world that was created. I was only aware of the subtitles for about 5 minutes in the beginning. I really would have never guessed that this movie was directed by the same man who turned out the bile that was Alien Resurrection. But I have gained new respect for the man. This movie has easily made it just about at the top of my 2001 list of greatest films. It is certainly one of the finest foreign films I have seen and it makes me want to run out and see it again as if this were opening day of Star Wars or something. In other words, it was a beautiful movie. Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great movie,"""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" is an awesome movie. I saw it in France when it was in general release over there, and again tonight in Berkeley, and I have to say it was even better the second time watching it. Audrey Tautou is brilliant. She charms the audience, and can make almost anyone fall in love with her. The camera work is excellent, especially in the last scene on the motorcycle, which is just perfectly filmed. The film is funny and clever, and amazingly sweet, the perfect date movie, or in fact, it's the perfect movie for almost any occasion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Charming film, but Amelie's childish world needs more juice to fill its running time satisfactorily.","This little film opens with that all that engaging quirkiness that the French have made particularly their own, and I settled down fully prepared to enjoy myself.   In the film the title character is a naïve young woman who marches to a decidedly different drummer, and we follow her as she unfurls her petals to the world around her.  Her schtick is to single out people she happens upon, and then to intervene gently and charmingly in their lives in order to better their lot.However, in spite of some clever humor, and the intoxicating Audrey Tautou  who plays the innocent and fey Amélie to perfection  after 45 minutes or so I felt a twinge of boredom which gradually blossomed in insistence, so that I found myself looking more and more at my watch while awaiting an end to the increasingly annoying world of Amélie's childish shenanigans.  To my mind Amélie's observations are more appropriate to a 10-year-old than a young adult (howsoever eccentric and naïve).Accordingly, while this is a pleasant movie generally, it has insufficient bumpf to fill its running time in a satisfying way, and, after a promising opening, the film ended leaving me with a mild sense of disappointment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amelie,"Its hard to describe how much I enjoyed 'Amelie' I felt as though I was sitting next to Monet, watching him as he effortly splashes beautiful watercolors across his canvas. It was so refreshing to watch a movie feeling like you were inside the mind of Amelie seeing everything in the vibrant colours as she viewed life with.Amelie is a beautifully realized and uplifting modern day fairy tale that owes much of its irresistible charm to the adorable charisma of its star Audrey Tautou.Amelie is a 2001 French film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet and Gullance Laurant; the film is a whimsical and somewhat idealised depiction of the contemporary Parisian life. It tells the story of a shy waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. Laurent and Jeunet use a kind of 'magical' realism to give the movie an almost dreamy effect.The atmosphere of the film is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who had composed 19 songs in 15 days for the film. The music continually changes from somehow being joyful to at the same time becoming sad and slow and sometimes fast and exciting. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes a part of the fabulous world of Amelie.Jeunet established the dream like atmosphere by mostly using greens and reds and sometimes adding blues to set the contrast. Sometimes the use of colour gets very obvious; like Amelies apartment for example it's almost completely red, the underground stations are kept in green and the green grocery stores stand out from the grey buildings behind. Also Audrey Tautou (Amelie) mostly wears either bright red or bright green.Besides Jeunet use of colour to bring light in the film, his masterful camera work and few special effects, just adds that touch of fantasy to the movie. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amelie flipping stones on the le canal in Paris. The camera shows a shot of her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another fantastic camera shot is seen when Nino is shown falling up the stairs chasing the yet to be discovered repair man. The camera shows the repair man driving off with Nino following close behind. Amelie then enters the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning around almost 180 degrees around shows her holding Nino's bag that he had just lost. Also when Amelie sits in front of the station we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are extremely effective supporting the dream like atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.The few special effects incorporated in the movie were effectively showing the audience what was happening that could not be seen. Jeunet decided to show the key in Amelies pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door. Jeunet uses digital effects showing the keys silhouette in a yellow light hidden in Amelies pocket. This technique is also used for showing Amelies heart beat faster and the blind man feeling happy after being guided by Amelie.Amelie is probably the most enjoyable movie I have seen this year, a mix of surreal images and good-natured, quirky charm that's both visually and emotionally intoxicating. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is endearing and effortlessly charming, much like the movie itself. When Amelie turns to the camera and smiles, it's terribly hard not to smile back.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny...moving...magical...did I mention funny?,"I've seen a lot of films in the last few months...Royal Tenebaums, Lord of the Rings, Man who wasn't there, Mulholland Drive, but Amelie has them all pretty much beaten for sheer entertainment value.  I was constantly in awe of the imagery more than anything, from the tiniest details on up, it was a carefully crafted film.  I spent a lot of the film laughing out loud...and occasionally I even found myself choked up.  It was a remarkable movie experience for me.  It makes other attempts at magical realism or fantasy sequences (such as Ally McBeal, for example) look like utter vomit.Junet has outdone himself.  This film has that third dimension that his other films always seem to lack. (not counting Alien: Resurrection, which only had one dimenstion to begin with).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You cant help but like Amelie,"If there is such a thing as a typical French film , Amelie is it . Quirky , dialogue heavy and never straight forward .Luckily i like the way the French make their films. This is no exception. Audrey Tautou is superb as the delightful Amelie , a woman who is happy seeing other people happy but is missing a certain something in her own life ...Love. This film looks and sounds great but it does lose it's way a little bit in the final third. You get a little frustrated that Amele is making extremely hard work of meeting her man but i suppose that's the way she is meant to be.

But i never managed to watch it completely because this movie is one of the most boring, annoying, meaningless piece of bullshit I ever saw. Is it meant to be some kind of an art film? Then go and watch ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a dream"" instead. The cinematography tries hard to be original, but it's no compare to a David Fincher movie (Fight Club rules!!!). The narration is annoying as hell in this movie, it's too fast and has no substance. The actor are everything else than believable.

An Incredible Achievement,"This is the kind of movie Hollywood could never make.Not that it doesn't have the financial capabilities, but quite frankly Hollywood could try and reverse engineer this film and try and figure out what made it tick and you'd have a couple $100 million directors sitting around like Area 51 engineers marveling a spacecraft, having no idea what makes it tick.The construction of this film is so meticulous in both its writing and its execution (direction and acting) that it may take several viewings to actually understand what an achievement it truly is.It's rare that a film contains this much originality in all aspects of its conception. It took me about 15 minutes into the film to truly grasp the scope of this work.  I haven't been this impressed since seeing Moulin Rouge earlier this year.After watching it I couldn't imagine what the US distributors were saying to themselves when they realized they had to actually market this.  It isn't really marketable.  Much like Moulin Rouge wasn't marketable, these are works of art that you have to SEE to understand.It would be my wholehearted opinion that if you feel American Cinema (if it can even be called that these days due to the Fear and lack of Creative Insight that grips the Hollywood Enablers) has slipped and is in dire need of direction from any and all willing participants, then this film is for you.  It's the sort of thing that can rebuild a Movie Lover's faith and make you happy to pay $9 again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A peculiar little film,"Looking for an extra dosage of quirk to liven up your day? Then look no further than Amélie, an odd little French film from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amélie is the title character of the story. She is a curious and naive young girl who takes a lot of enjoyment out of life's little pleasures. One night she finds a box full of knick knacks in her apartment that had been left there fifty years ago by a little boy. She tracks down this boy, who is now obviously a man, and returns the box to him. Upon seeing his reaction Amélie decides that she wants to devote her life to helping the people around her, only to discover that she has lost sight of helping herself. It is a strange little story that is fairly melancholy and leaves one with a fairly underwhelmed state of mind. At least that's how I felt.This is by no means a bad film. In fact it is very good, there just isn't a whole lot to it. It's fairly melancholy and low key, in its own uniquely quirky way. I enjoyed watching it for the most part, but nothing really stood out for me, or struck me as remarkable. By the end of the film I just sort of shrugged and said, OK. That was good, but nothing life changing. The film does have a lot of subtext and motifs that carry throughout the film, that all mainly relate back to enjoying the simpler things in life. The film takes life one step at a time and just sort of diddles along, not really amounting to much. I feel like all this is intentional, and thats why I don't really want to knock this film for doing this. I was just personally expecting more out of an interesting concept and the unique visual style that Jeunet uses in this film. But overall what is delivered is a simple film that is devoted to its message, and definitely has more intelligence than the average film. But again, it doesn't really amount to much and by the time it was over I was satisfied and amused, but not blown away or heavily impacted.However, what did truly astound me in a good way was this films visuals. The direction here is very quirky and very peculiar, but also very unique. There are all sorts of strange little quirks that Jeunet throws into the film visually. They aren't really things that can be explained in words, or without a lot of context, but everything that Jeunet does in this film works very well and gives the whole film a very fun and very frivolous atmosphere. I suppose the best adjective to describe the visuals would be artsy, as moments of this film are shot in a very stylistic way with a lot of uniqueness to the visual design, essentially making this film a work of contemporary art. It is something very unique, thus hard to put into words so you really have to see for yourself.Visually this film is excellent and everywhere else it is just sort of there. Everything this film does, it does well, but it doesn't seem to do much and nothing about the film amounts to a whole lot. To say this is a bad film or it is poorly made would be a grotesque lie. This is an overall very good film, but it isn't something I would ever watch again, and the only thing I can really see sticking with me would be the artistic flare the film applies so well to every scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Absolutely wonderful,"I found this to be one of the most creative, original, whimsical, and uplifting films I have ever seen.  Jean Jeunet seems to have taken a very personal idea and adapted it to show to the world.  I would not be surprised if he himself has an album of photomat pictures.  The film manages to make people feel as if they themselves experienced an Amelie intervention.Some people have commented that the style and length of the film does not carry over well to foreign audiences.  If feel that this is an extremely conceited idea.  A writer/director/producer should not have to consider the economics of the film being shown to an audience that speaks a different language when creating.  Anyone in those countries who would have a valid, intelligent opinion should be able to take the origin of the film into account.I give this film a 10/10, or 100/100.

EVERYONE must watch this film.,"This film has it all (apart from action, which is nonsense anyway); romance, comedy, drama... I consider it as one of the best films I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. Even if you are underage, sneak into the cinema and watch it carefully.I'm not going to spoil the film for you and write the entire story out, which most people tend to do whilst writing their comments out. After all, ""Le Fabueux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" doesn't have much of a plot anyway; it's just... nice. It may be a (very funny) comedy, but it is also very thoughtful at the same time. The director (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) has made the film flawless by choosing the perfect cast, perfect soundtrack and by using his natural ability to his greatest potential as a director.Now, let's start with the two main characters in ""Amelie""...Audrey Tautou plays the part of Amelie Poulain with ease and perfection. Tautou may not be the prettiest girl on the planet, but she definitely has the best eyes I've ever seen. She has this unique and unexplainable attraction and innocence which makes her the only person able to play the part of Amelie... it's really hard to explain. You've got to watch the film and see for yourselves.Mathieu Kassovitz plays Nino, the man who Amelie falls in love with. Kassovitz seems not to need to do too much for the part (all he has to do is to act a little spaced out), but since I'm not an actor I can't really comment. After all, I thought he had a (AGAIN!) unique presence which I can't (AGAIN!) explain.The other characters (you can look the names up yourselves) were equally as excellent as each other. They were all slightly strange in their actions(including Amelie's and Nino's) but I guess the director is trying to emphasize the fact that everyone is different and emotions are also very relevant in our behaviour...Yann Tiersen, the highly prolific and original multi-instrumentalist composer and performer who worked on the soundtracks of French movies like ""Alice et Martin"", also did the sountrack for ""Amelie"" (apart from two very old French songs written in the 1930's). In my opinion, the soundtrack made a significant difference to the film.It's really hard to say why I am so in love with this film... it just happens. Not many films are so unexplainable, but I guess that's probably a reason for my inspiration for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Every one of my friends will see this film! Marvelous!,"Amelie is most likely the best movie released this year. Charming and whimsical, it invokes a feeling of joy for finding the good in our lives. Make sure you have all that you need and don't drink too much prior to this film, because if you miss one part of this film you will inevitably miss a joke or punchline later in the movie. The mastery of Amelie is that nearly all the characters has just the right amount of character development, giving us enough insight into their lives to make each plot development poignant and fun. There are a lot of fantastical scenes where reality is bent a little, but I think most people have had the same kinds of thoughts and seen the same hallucinations at one point in their lives. Audrey Tatou is gourgeous and endearing at the same time with a grin that can't help but make you laugh. The payoff for this movie comes right near the end, and you feel every bit of emotion that can be wrung from it.

Coyote. Not to be malicious just this movie was so odd. It seems so many people like this movie and for the life of me I cannot understand why.

A blockbuster for the emotional dreamer,"This is a masterpiece. The movie starts at a frantic pace that makes you think it is going too fast.

You are left to wonder how much of the actors you are going to know before the movie is over. Well hold your brace! You will enter their EMOTIONS. And that is were this movie is incredibly well made. It is common feature for a long boring slow moving flick to let you enter emotions like sadness, love, hatred ... But this movie while slowing down in pace is still going about 90 miles/hour. And yet you begin to feel the rewards of knowing all the characters in depth. The movie fills your heart, fills your brain and atop of it makes you laugh with its crazyness that resembles a high speed dream of your own (a bit like Woody Allen in this respect). But on the opposite of Woody Allen style that strays away from the main story to get lost in details and escapes, this movie progressively focuses on the heroin and on her dream. Mix all this with alluring filming technics that shifts back and forth from 1950's still standing camera to today's ultrafast travelling (reminding Hidden Dragon, Crouching tiger) and you have a wonderful movie for people that mind their emotions.

"Lush, creative, quirky and wonderful","I find Amelie to be a wonderfully uplifting film, bursting with creativity and quirkiness and gorgeously richly textured.The fast-paced opening is inspired, introducing Amelie and others with a series of lightning quick snapshots of their lives and bullet point style key likes and dislikes. It sets a creative tone that is maintained without fatigue throughout the entire movie.

Never thought that i could fall in love with a movie,"I saw ""Amélie"" at the Fantasy Film-Festival. It was not planned, because i'm normally more interested in thriller-, horror-, scifi- or splatter-stuff. it was just a cancelled date, that brought me into the cinema, and what should i say, i never was so happy about a cancelled date. It's hard to describe, but ""Amélie"" made me a six year old boy again, that, first time in a cinema, watched with an open mouth and big eyes 'the wizard of oz'. I'm 33 years old and i saw tons of movies, but no one kicked me like ""Amélie"". I had the feeling not to watch a movie, it was more become a part of the wonderful world of Amélie Poulain, which definitely depends on Bruno Delbonnels incredible greatful camera-works and one of the best storyscripts written the last years. Jeunot and Laurant created lovely, bizarre, obscure and mischievous characters and they where filled with so much live by excellent and marvelous actors (specially Audrey Tautou, Matthieu Kassowitz and Dominique Pinon)that everything went perfect. It's a cineastic pleasure to watch garden-dwarfs travelling around the world, to learn what the production of crepes have in common with the production of vinyl-records or to enjoy how a goldfish survives suicide. And when Amélie takes care, that the hypochondric tabac-woman and the pessimistic regular become passion lovers and having wild sex at the cafe-toilet or she protected the small shophelper from his tyrannic chief by drivin him slowly insane, you don't know if you're tears coming from laughing or sentimental emotions. When i went out of the cinema, i walked like a feather and wanted to embrace the whole world.

This film should be used to teach film students what to cut...,"Not to make to fine a point -- this film is a egotistical failed attempt to create a new school of French film. Simply put : too much  footage (not related to the plot) exists -- and I am not covering the stock film content! This film also too many special effects tricks. This would be fine if the special effects were not so intrusive! If I had the appropriate connections to the French film industry, I would reissue this film with 30% less run time.

"Good visuals, but way too clichéd and boring story","I really wanted to like that film. I heard a lot of good things about it, plus it had a good presence in the Oscars in 2002(I don't know if anyone cares, but I think it's worth noting) so I finally watched it. And I realized it wasn't impressive. First thing that bothered me was the narrator. It was insufferable bad. I don't like that kind of narrator at all. It looked like I was reading a book instead of watching the film. The worst part is that it really wants to look like a book. The narrative is also weird. Also don't liked at all the stylized editing. It cuts the story way too much, and there is always a lot of things going on. Thankfully the editing is less frequently used.The themes used – introversion, charity – are certainly interesting, but the approach made in the film isn't appealing nor strong enough to make a big impression. In the end, is just a romance story of a 'late' girl that finds in the introversion and in the fantasy(her biggest allies) are now troubling and ruining her life. It certainly has a good message _ but, a good message don't means good film or whats ever. Even because this film is mostly bad executed, at least in it first half.But obviously, this film is fantastic technically. The cinematography is top notch, full of gorgeous moments, and the art direction is equally excellent. The abundant use of green suggests a sheltering aspect in the ambient, and also a weird nature in the atmosphere. The actress Audrey Tautou did very well and fitted almost that perfectly the introvert female protagonist. Really worth-noting. She seems that was born just to bring to life the Amelie character.But anyways, the story, while seems to be original, looks like it was told one million times before. We know that she is going to face her introvert problem and finally find her love. But while it's depiction of an introvert life seems top notch, it use isn't the best– it has no impact in the way it's told. Thankfully to –worth noting – the editing (an underrated aspect that is essential to any film). A better approach and this film could have been much better. Unfortunately the world isn't made by 'Ifs' and 'maybes' so it's fair to give it a 7.3/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Loved this movie,"To begin with; if you're the kind of movie-goer who balks at the prospect of enduring a two-hour film in which you have to read the dialogue via subtitles then this review is written for you. I am, I ashamedly confess, cut from the same cloth, and ten times more likely to sit through some slam-bang Hollywood garbage that I've seen a hundred times than some arty little French film, despite how good everyone says it is. It is through this stubborn philosophy that I almost missed out on probably the best film I have seen this year, and what has become one of my favourites of all-time. The intention of this review is to advise others not to make the same mistake and bypass this modern masterpiece.On paper, it seems unremarkable; the story of a little girl, Amelie, raised by un-loving parents in France, who spends her entire youth without companionship and, as a result, becomes over-imaginative in the extreme. Years later, she moves to the town of Montemart and, while leading a relatively lonely existence, she sets out to improve the lives of those around her in her own unique and special way, while trying to find the love she so desperately craves. Admittedly, the plot does (very) vaguely echo that of Jane Austens' novel 'Emma' (recently adapted for the screen for Gwyneth Paltrow, and modernised in Amy Heckerlings' 'Clueless') but, that aside, this is one of the most strikingly original and wonderful films ever made.It's a rare occurrence to describe a film as 'perfect', but no other term is appropriate to describe 'Amelie'. To begin with, its central performance from Audrey Tautou is astounding. Child-like, naive and impossibly adorable, it's hard to conceive any other actress in the role (interesting, given the fact that the film was originally written for British actress Emily Watson and the first script treatment was titled 'Emily'). It's difficult to recollect the last time a screen character had such an emotional resonance with an audience; you feel every high and low of the emotional roller-coaster Amelie endures during the story. However, it's not just a one-woman show, and the gifted set of supporting characters  especially Matthieu Kassovitz as love interest Nino and Serge Merlin as the mysterious 'Glass Man' - more than bring the film to life. Even the look of the film is strikingly wonderful, as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet paints the city of Montemart in vivid, lively colours, and animates Amelies' reality-bending imagination perfectly.I can honestly say that you won't find a more heart-warming, uplifting and flat-out enjoyable film anywhere, never mind in English. Do yourself a favour; don't miss out like I nearly did. Reach for your reading glasses and prepare to be amazed.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Made me smile, but doesn't deserve its depth of praise","An oddball finds happiness helping strangers, until she realises that there's something missing in her life too.Existing in a world entirely of her own, we experience a life through Amelie's eyes - an amusing and surreal experience. While feel-good in parts and accompanied with a more unique plot, I felt myself getting bored nearer the end. It was clear where the plot was heading early on.I'm confused to whether or not it's a rom-com. It seems to not be funny enough to be a comedy, and lacks the depth of relationships to deserve a romance label. Nor is it much of a drama. Amelie exists between all these genres in its own purgatory, delivering a bit of everything, but not enough to satiate your appetite of any.The film is shot in a Wes-Anderson-style, with narrators introducing larger-than-life characters with odd facts and framing characters with flat backgrounds perpendicular to the camera. Many will be a fan of this, but though I appreciate many Wes Anderson films, I didn't think the style worked particularly well here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
See it and judge for yourself,"A great little film. (although little might not be the best word, at more than 2 hours, it made me miss my train!)

"There is absolutely no need for this movie to be in the top 250 list, let alone in the top 30.","Having no sense of direction in her life but to do everything in the most desperately quirky way possible, main character Amélie (Audrey Tatou) sets out on a quest looking for something she cannot define, and does some cute good deeds and helps people along the way, even acting as a matchmaker. So goes the storyline of French romantic comedy ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"", supposedly the 29th best film of all time.It appears this is one of those films you either love or hate, but I'm hesitant to go to such extremes with Amélie. For being a French quirky romance story, this is a decent accomplishment with a few memorable scenes and performances (the ongoing garden gnome joke made me laugh). But somewhere along the line, Amélie transgressed the line between being this low-key Parisian comedy and became widely praised as art all over the world -- something that I find simply cringeworthy. The ""Oh, it's French and about romance and it makes no sense! Therefore it must be magical and full of deeper meaning."" -attitude totally sickens me.This film is so saccharine-sweet and cutesy that I find it is too much to take in one viewing. There is little or no magic in it, other than forced attempts to be whimsical which instead end up as desperately quirky. In short, Amélie is a romance story that tries too hard. Maybe I'm easy to please, but I find more romance in unlikely, simple everyday situations than cute-overload romance crammed into a picturesque Parisian café setting. It's too cliché.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"beautifully crafted film, thoroughly enjoyed.","This is really the third major motion picture from writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, following his magical film City Of Lost Children and 1991's Delicatessen. Amelie is the story of a young girl whose life changes when she comes across the hidden box of childhood memories of someone who lived in her apartment years ago. She sets out to find the mysterious owner of the box and when she does, her life changes in un-expected ways. The striking quality that enticed me throughout the film was the beautiful cinematography Jeunet employs in some of his scenes. There are many wonderful overhead shots that start behind the character and swim overhead in beautiful 360 degree wide angle shot to end near the characters feet or in their lap. Another rich quality that adds to the story is Jeunets use of silence. The film is scored with an emotional piano arrangement by Yann Tiersen, yet there are moments in the film when not a sound is heard, not a chord, or a breath exhaled. This use of silence offers a wonderful symmetry of drama and suspence to what the audience is viewing on the screen. Amelie is a gorgeous film with witty humor and a coy romantic story. Audrey Tauton's performance is exhilerating! She is undoubtably one of the most adorable faces in cinema today. Ironically the name should suggest a coy resemblance to Audrey Hepburn's charming demeanor that has entertained audiences for decades. Looking forward for more work from the talented team of Tauton and Jeunet.Hands down this was the best film to come out in 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An overwhelmingly romantic look at life,"Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a master of whimsical quirk and Amélie might be his ultimate achievement. It's a kind of neo-fairytale or modern storybook romance, heightened to such with its narration and its wonderful score by Yann Tiersen, simple and melodic, like a small band playing in a cafè on a sunny afternoon. It delves more than slightly into fantasy, as romance often does, but does so in a very refreshing and fun way. This is a world where gnomes travel and skeletons are somewhat sensual. At the same time, this is just the magic that can and does happen everyday.Audrey Tautou is impressingly adorable as title character Amélie Poulain, a young woman with the power and imagination to change the lives of just about everyone she comes into contact with. She lives in the moment, enjoying the ways she can bring smiles to the faces of her friends and right the wrongs that she witnesses. She's quiet and seemingly meek, but speaks volumes with her mischievous smile and loving eyes. She finds exciting adventure in what could be the most mundane situations, not taking any little thing for granted.The film is stuffed with intertwining stories small and large that Amélie drives along, and they are each as important as the next, no matter how much or how little the movie dwells on them. What truly brings happiness? Does the truth really matter if we never know it, when it's what we personally experience that moves us along, for better or for worse. How important is the smallest exchange we may have with a stranger? Sometimes you don't even realize just how much of an effect you have, because you're not seeing the situation from their eyes. But it's all important. The details are all meaningful.Visually, the film is mostly warm and lush with yellows and reds that pop like blood coursing through the heart. This is contrasted with an undertone of very vibrant greens and cool blues that create a fantastic atmosphere and make everything feel like an organic, natural setting. The color theory here is actually quite amazing, making the film special and nostalgic right from the beginning. It has a lightness, but is still emotional and will leave you with the inspirations of a hopeless romantic. It warms your heart, becoming overwhelming without being overbearing.Amélie is indeed pure romance. This is the romance of life and it's intricacies, even in it's darkest moments. The film allows you to enjoy even the smallest things that might usually be overlooked and gives importance to the playful particulars of life like the joy of peeling large strips of wallpaper or skipping the best stones along a canal. It shows how one small thing may unfold a series of events that can help you conquer your fears or lead you to where you need to be in life. It shows the perfect, imaginary life we live in our heads and how close to the real world it could actually be. And, of course, it shows true love, as easy or as hard as it might be to find, and just how close it might come to slipping right through your fingers if you're not looking at it from the right angle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Couldn't finish it...,"Quirky films sometimes win me over... sometimes they don't. An example of colorful ""Quirkiness"" that won me over completely is the wonderful television series Pushing Daisies. That is what I would compare this film most with in its style and tone... and yet I didn't like it.NOTE- I don't like reviewing films that I do not finish watching, but I only saw the first 50 minutes of this film. My Film Teacher played it for us on a big screen. I was very excited for it. When it began I was liking it... after 10 minutes I felt it was rubbing me the wrong way. After 20 minuets the story was mildly engaging and I wanted to see where it went... As it went on I kept wondering to myself if I should leave... I even watch the worst of films. I left because I just saw no indication of the film grabbing me. Yeah,I guess it's well-made for the filmmakers intentions, yet for all of its style it never amused me. The lead performance was very good, but the film as a whole felt too calculated. Hey, I love visual films, but the visuals in this one seemed to be too artificial to me. And again, I loved Pushing Daisies. Yet this film's plot and execution wasn't grabbing me and was making me a little bored, so I left. I don't plan on watching the rest of it any time soon, and I don't think I will ever like the film. I get what the filmmakers were trying to do, but I simply didn't find it appealing. Since I didn't finish it I don't want to give it a negative score, but quite simply, I don't see the fuss about this film. I give it a 5 as it stands now. Did I mention that the dialogue was just... dull? Not a bad film per say by the standards in which it was made, just a VERY uninteresting and dull one, even with all of its colors and visuals.EDIT- So I decided to watch it in its entirety, mark the date December 9th, 2011. Why do I want to mark the date? Well, because I fell in love with it. This time, I wasn't surrounded by my obnoxious film class, and I really took it differently. I mean, I love Pushing Daiises, so I knew this was a film that would benefit from watching again, and this time as a whole. This time, I was hooked in it's storyline.I also want to say that this opened my mind a little bit more. It's very difficult to do fantasy, romance, and comedy in the right way that it engages me enough. It's always been harder for films of this type for me to love than the usual, gritty, well-made thrillers or dramas. Which is why this stands out in my mind. The cinematography is amazing (as expected, as Delbonnel had the best cinematography of 2009 for Harry Potter 6), as is the art direction. I also noticed the colors. Yeah, it has very vivid colors, but the color saturation as whole had a very greenish sort of look to it, which i thought was unique in itself. The first half is faster-paced and different than the second, but both work completely. I love very few romance films, but the romance here is just so delightful. This is a film that leaves you happy as can be, and I am very glad i rewatched it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice Import but Not Great!,"`Amelie' is being called the toast of France. Critics amor `Amelie'. They are calling it one of the best French films of all time. Now, I did think it was cute but I do think that some of these critics are french toasted by including it in that illustrious category. The film is about a cute- petite French woman who gets satisfaction out of doing favors for others and changing their lives. Now, I did like the premise (especially in today's times). However, I did think the film dragged as long as the Tour De France. Guys- I do not think that you will like this film too much. However, I do know a way to change that. Just tell your girl that you want to have a very romantic French night that would have to include- viewing a French film like `Amelie"", doing some serious French kissing during the boring scenes of the film, and maybe ask her to get a friend and do a serious menage a trois (that's French isn't) during the film's climax.

Unusual and strange but a small part of me could identify,"The French are indeed strange. Amelie is about a girl who grew up emotionally disconnected from her parents and consequently lived in a private fantasy world. Alone in Paris, she works at a waitress at a cafe beneath the two windmills in Montmatre and basically keeps to herself. But things change with the death of Princess Di over in England - she discovers a box of old toys behind a tile in her apartment, hidden years ago by a former occupant. She tracks him down and surreptitiously returns it to him. Seeing the joy that it brings him, Amelie decides to intervene in people's lives in small, quirky ways. But given her introverted nature, she always does so in a way that allows her to remain behind the scenes. Until she falls in love that is.Although I found Amelie weird and am nothing like her, I believe that people like her exist and I felt that I could understand her better as the film progressed. I didn't exactly like her character but she has a certain quirky charm and a dark sense of humour that I can appreciate. Given how things can go wrong so easily, her numerous successful interventions were perhaps slightly stretching belief, but this is something you only think about after the movie.While I found the movie thoroughly strange (in terms of portraying city life and characters of a type that I have never heard of or experienced), I could appreciate it and I think most people will too. I really liked the mutual fascination of Amelie and the photobooth guy, and the suspense surrounding each of their encounters. While I don't quite buy into the idea of love at first sight, fascination at first sight is always appealing. I was annoyed by the ending though.

VIVE LE FRANCE!,"AMELIE (2001) **** Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Yolande Moreau, Artus de Penguern, Urbain Cancelier, Maurice Benichou, Dominique Pinon, Claude Perron, Michel Robin, Isabelle Nanty, Clotilde Mollet, Claire Maurier, Serge Merlin, Jamel Debbouze.  (Dir: Jean-Pierre Jeunet) FRENCH W/SUBTITLESEver since Audrey Hepburn has passed critics and film pundits alike have been trying with great effort (and no reward) to bestow her gamine crown to another actress along the likes of Irene Jacob, Anne Parillaud, Juliette Binoche, Julia Ormond, Rachael Leigh Cook and even Julia Roberts as possible heirs to the throne of romantic comedy.  Well stop the presses.  We have a winner in the amiable, flawlessly pretty French over-night-sensation that is Audrey Tautou, an utterly fetching and undeniably sexy comic actress with Ms. Hepburn's innocence tainted by curious frivolity.  That's just what is on display in full force to be reckoned with in this frothy fairy taleAs the titular innocent Amelie is a precocious yet well-meaning romantic at heart who makes it her life's work to intrude on others' lives ; that is by making changes for the good and positive to friends, strangers (and even enemies) alike.  Her whole life has been about enjoying the simple things and their unique calming qualities that she wishes were encompassed by all around her.  She helps a blind man cross the street vividly describing all imagery that they pass; she gets even with the browbeating produce market manager by infiltrating his apartment and making subtle adjustments to his daily life like changing the sizes of his bedroom slippers and adding sugar to his liquor cabinet's stock; she finds herself fixing up the local stalker with the addled hypochondriacal cashier in the diner she works as a waitress.  Ultimately Amelie's destiny is to make life more pleasant and in the process for the first time in her lively existence despite her loneliness, falls in love. The object of her affection is an odd fellow who she spies in the metro sweeping up torn pieces of photos from one of those sit for a quarter 4 poses machines for travelers to take snapshots of themselves.  Nino (Kassovitz) is a quiet man who uses the scraps to fill a huge album of memories of complete strangers in a weird art-as-life metaphor for how we all should perceive life in general: passing by in a sea of faceless strangers (that is giving credence to those we don't know as being significant). The latter is well on display here as Amelie lives her carefree lifestyle by doling out personal chores of goodwill and its charm is that she is self-less and even self-deprecating.   The fact that she is cute as a button doesn't hurt her either as she befriends many unlikely companions including an elderly brittle man in her apartment complex who invites her in to see his life-long preoccupation of re-creating paintings from memories of exhibits he saw in his past. The humor is also on full throttle in the sarcastic interplay with many of the denizens of the picaresque Montmatre and Paris particularly with the diner inhabitants and one hysterical running gag with Amelie's practical joke on her reserved father involving her abduction of his garden gnome by giving it an international jaunt and her father receiving snapshots by mail of the statue in famed cities having a ball. Utterly charming and exquisitely photographed by Bruno Delbonnel in saturated unreal living color has the appeal of a surreal picture postcard brought to life, the film relies on the slender yet capable shoulders of its ingenue, another Audrey who I hope will be around as the original.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie that leaves you with that silly smirk you just can't erase,"This movie leaves one with the ""warm fuzzies"" in a way a film rarely can. It is a film that simplifies life in such a way that all can relate to us. Audrey Tautou lights up the screen in a way that so few can; she is simply captivating.  I couldn't take my eyes off her for the entire length of the movie.  The glint of her eyes or the twitch of the corner of her mouth can pull the strings of the audience in a manner I haven't seen since Audrey Hepburn.  The wit and sparkle left me breathless, and, yes, also grinning impishly for the remainder of the evening.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What a disaster of a film!,"This movie ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen -- and I actually like foreign movies.  I would've given it a zero out of 10 if I could have. My problem with this one?  1) No plot 2) what's with this chick who goes wandering around in strangers' houses seeking revenge (foot cream in the toothpaste, and what not)?  What grounds does she have to get in to these houses?  3) she's chasing after some guy -- gets him to the coffeehouse to meet her -- and then the idiot sits and plays coy.  Won't strike up a conversation, or anything.  How stupid is that?  He comes to the door of her apartment, yet she just sits at the door; won't open it.  Stupid women irritate me, and she is one of the stupidest.  4) I couldn't care less about any of the characters, either; just as there was no plot development, there was no character development either.Bottom line, if you want to see a GOOD French film, see a classic like ""Jules et Jim"" or ""Cousin, Cousine"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

an absolutely edible and enlivening film,"This film is worth any good review written about it, visually it will dazzle your senses, the story will remind you of the human spirit and our ability to believe. It is everything a good film should be, most importantly completely original, it borrows form nothing but the most dreamlike desires of our childhood, destiny, falling in love...Audrey Tautou is so watchable, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet provides an amazing stable of thought provoking off beat characters (as in Delicatessen)..I absolutely loved it!

Fantastic,"As heartwarming as a film can be without trying too hard, Amelie is just a fantastic piece of cinematography. Every scene looks as if it has been lovingly hand-made, and the wonderful resonance each shot's colours have makes it very easy to watch.

When cinema restores your faith in the world!!,"What an incredible journey Amelie takes you on.  Destined to be one of those movies that is ""buzzed"" about from the Toronto International Film Festival and it deserves all the acclaim it will receive (remember it at Oscar time for Best Foreign Film).  Amelie is an example of what a visionary director can do with a strong story (I haven't been delighted by a movie like this in years) and fresh cinematography (can we all live in Paris for at least two years). In the lead role, Audrey Tautou is the discovery of the year.  She is so ""fresh"" on the screen .. her wonderment of the world in this movie is remarkable.  Anyone who loves movies (and not just the Foreign viewers) will find this movie more rewarding then any other film they see this year.Simply magic!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"sweet, funny and charming",I liked Amelie because we get to fill in the gaps in the story and the dialogue is incidental really. The story works incredibly well on a visual level. This is a postcard Paris and everything has that unreal sense about it. Its almost as if too much talk will spoil the imagery. Thankfully this never happens. It is also good that some scenes are not explained like the sequence where Lucien is practising some insults (it seems.)Watch out for the gnome. This movie is also well paced and funny as well. I liked Delicatessan from the same team but disliked City of the Lost Children so Amelie was a sweet surprise.Even though this is a highly filtered view of Paris it is a fiction that was enjoyable at the time.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amelie,"Amelie is the most remembered movie of the post-millennium period and is unconditionally loved by almost everyone who watched it. I think it will always be remembered by the people of this period. It is a truly French movie. Music, clothes, colors, and of course the influence of that magnificent French... .jeunet does not have any problems in creating this different and memorable, impressive environment and character, which is one of his best works, and he manages to bring a ""character"" to the history of cinema in itself. Yes, this character is ""Amelie Poulain"", of course. Although all the other characters in the movie, I am not exaggerating Indeed, all the side characters are deep and full of characters that could almost be the leading roles of different films on their own. There is a great cast throughout the movie, and I think the names that portray them could not have been chosen more appropriately. Especially Audrey Tautou, who literally lives the role of Amelie and gives her life to the fullest. She managed to write her name in history with this performance alone. Her physical structure, facial expressions, big eyes, mouth and nose, everything that helps her play a big role in creating a perfect Amelie. Not to mention her unique haircut, clothes and dreams, of course. She is different from the first second. An immersive, flawless movie that manages to keep you hooked.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

We all need a small Amélie in our hearts.,"""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a simple story of its own intriguing elegance. The protagonist, alienated from her parents , has struggled for love in the harsh everyday life since childhood. Indeed,Amélie Poulain embodies the side of our hearts in which we all craves for others' love and respect through our lives. What's more is that Amélie calls that side of our heart out and put it into practice in her own way. In the end, It not only tells a beautiful story but reminds us that to confront and fulfill the void in our own mind, we have to at first lend our hands to others and be their angels.

Oh man .......,"..... I can´t believe this movie is on the top 250 .....I have seen plenty of foreign films and this is not the best among them. It´s just a cute story about a cute girl with a cute mission.  And that´s really it.  The sub-plots (the travelling gnome, the photo-booth fixer, and the evil vegetable salesman) are where the real story is.  The rest is an attempt to tie things together.  Disney could have made this film and made it better, and we would have spared the awkward sex-scenes which, I fear, have only been thrown in to prove that it in fact NOT a Disney movie.Go ahead.

More art than entertainment.,"I will say right away that this film has more artistic value than entertainment value. For a bit it felt like the film dragged on too long and it made me a little uninterested, however I understood some of its significance. The actress who played Amelie did a very good job and there were quite a few comedic moments in the movie as well. It was also good to see more vulnerable and deeper character moments, plus certain reveals that were interesting. It's hard to believe that this director made one of the worst movies in the Alien franchise before he went on to make this movie (which used pretty captivating directing techniques)!

Pure magic,"As a real film buff, I have to say that I have never been that amazed by a movie before. I even watched it three times and it got better and better. This one has it all. It is exremely funny, stylish, thrilling and touching. I think the only movie that comes close to it is BArton Fink which also unites many elements to a great movie. The acting is brillant, too, especially Audrey Tautou is amazing. I think no one else could have played that part and I'm extremely worried that Hollywood's gonna do a remake starring Julia Roberts - urgh. This film shows that not only Hollywood produces well done movies but also Europe which seems to increase its ability to deliver masterpieces of cinema (in the last few years it delivered films like Billy Elliot, Trois couleurs: Rouge, Das Experiment, Lola rennt, Todo sobre mi madre, The Full Monty,...). I hope Le fabuleux... will win an academy award for best foreign language film, but I really doubt it'll win more, even though it truly deserves more as 2001 hasn't been a good year for movies. Jeunets work is the best there is this year and I wish that next year the first foreign language movie will win the award for best picture. You see, I'm very enthusiastic with this one and I cannot understand how someone can say that it's a bad movie. I am also very excited about its us-release and how it'll be liked by the American audience. But I think that especially in the present political situation a movie like this is the best that can happen. Like I said, the movie is pure magic and it's hard to summarize it, as it's so full of everything, that makes a movie worth of being watched. Furthermore the score by Yann Tiersen is one of the finest I've ever heard and I recommend everybody who liked the film to buy its soundtrack, you won't be disappointed. Well, I hope my comment have made you a little bit curious about this wonderful masterpiece and you'll see it. I guarantee you, that you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Beyond escapism into magic,"Another commenter, from Turkey, said, ""A human being lives as long as they dream and imagine. The day I stop imagining and dreaming will be the day I will be dead."" I think this beautifully sums up what truly great cinema aspires to be.If one goes into a movie theater only to be entertained for a couple hours and then to forget the experience, that's escapism. But if you are so moved by a film that it changes your life (like seeing Star Wars for the first time), then we're talking about a whole other level.Viewing Amelie is one of these rare experiences.Through the dreams of another, we are connected through a shared sense of lonliness in this (seemingly) uncaring world. But someone with a heart of gold (quite literally in one scene) shows us how to love by giving, without any need of validation or compensation.In one of the most touching sequences, Amelie sees a old blind man trying to cross a busy street. She takes his arm and leads him across. But she doesn't stop there, she holds on and walks him briskly past the shops, describing what's in the windows and what people are wearing. She gives the man a sense of sight for a few minutes. When she drops him off in front of the Metro stop, the man experiences Rapture. She has given him a priceless gift.This film operates at so many levels, I could write for hours, but I will stick within posting guidelines and simply state:Amelie is a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

2 hour kitschy and hectic disgrace to french cinema,"Along with Moulin rouge! this movie ranks as the ultimately worst godawful piece of excrement ever to be stuffed down the throats of the movie-going public in the history of cinema world-wide.

The movie is shot in an awfully colorful and contrasting palette which makes it look like a 2-hour soapflake commercial. The story is told in such a typically hectic manner, after a while you stop caring whether it is making sense or (more likely) not.Recently with the masterpieces ""Vidocq"" and ""Le Pacte des loups"", french cinema had grown a lot to my liking. After Amélie however, someone will have to hold a gun to my head before I will even consider a french movie altogether.One thing is true. ""She'll change your life"".

Recommended And Forgotten At The Same Time!,"Though it's easily recommendable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's trifle is just as easily forgettable. Try as he might, Jeunet isn't able to create anything remotely indelible in this sweet story of a wistful young woman (Audrey Tautou) who attempts to make the people who inhabit her world happier; when she comes across a book of strange portrait photography, she sets out to connect with the photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz). Jeunet pulls out all the animated and digital stops at his disposal and while it's never less than lovely to gaze at, it has the qualities of a comedy sketch television show (indeed, it has the feel of a low-key French Monty Python) and when the mysterious old man in the apartment below that appears in every French romance starts to become a major character, you know there isn't much point in paying close attention. Some might find this simple but densely-packed feature charming in its innocence (and goodness knows we need more films like this that have no use for violence) but others might be immune to its charms because of its one-dimensional presentation.

Another Overrated French Film,"There is no dispute of the inventiveness in some parts of the film; the strong cinematography and beautiful music scores but as usual with the director's previous efforts, Amelie is full of freaks who seem to live in another planet, French movieland.The seemless half an hour of introduction is occassionally funny and downright weird most of the time, however, the movie starts to drag on after one hour and Amelie's journey to help others and find her own happiness seems like director's excuse to throw us with too many oddball characters and pointless subplots.For example, at one point, the movie moves from the lead actor's(Mathieu Kassovitz) possible lateness for the date with Amelie in the cafe to being kidnapped by terrorists. Most people will find it hilarious and inventive but I think it's just another freakish and non-sensical idea of the French director. The initially sweet romance of Dominique Pinon with the waitress turning into wild sex in the toilet is tastelessly amusing and could have been edited out altogether. The part of Amelie teaching the mean grocer a lesson by messing up the house is like scenes taken out of a regular Hollywood trashy comedy.All these strange (notice how many times, the equivalents of ""weird"" are used here and in many critics' reviews) characters and subplots make the last half hour of Amelie like an eternity. Many times, I wish the movie could just finish off before 2 hours. Mind you I'm the sucker for 2 hours over drama.This movie is a love it or hate it movie. For those looking for a fun ride and something different from mainstream cinema, Amelie may be a treat. For someone like me who have to care for the characters in order to indulge in the movie, Amelie is just a cold art fare.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet's directing is excellent; his camera works is breathtaking (cf. scene where Amelie playing at ducks and drakes, the opening sequence and so many others). The dialogues are perfect and this is probably the best comedy ever made, since Dr Strangelove, and that's a change from `Walt Disney's' politically correct humor or the crude `American Pie's' sex jokes). All the characters are touching and  unforgettable.Some scenes are really masterpieces, for example the scene where Amelie imagines that Nino is coming to see her and the curtains move (for those who saw the movie, you know what I am talking about!). This movie is a subtle balance between macro and micro, between logic and absurdity, between beauty and ugliness between dream and reality, in short this is a HUMAN movie).

Jeunot does it again,"Jeunet is one of the best European directors (at least that's my opinion). After the strange movie that was the four sequel of Alien, Jeunet is able to return to the kind of movies that made him a great director, like Delicatessen, another GREAT movie. I have to say that I didn't know most of the actors (only those that appeared in another Jeunet films), but the most of them make a very good acting in this movie. Like the other movies of Jeunet, in the movie there's a kind of magic during all the movie, it reminds me of a faerie tale, with excellent secondary histories. I will say not much things about the plot, I think its better to discover it by yourself, I would only say that its a fabulous kind of tale, a history about the fear to love and loose that love, and well I think that i said too much. Go to watch it if you would like to see an excellent movie, and if you like it then watch Delicatessen and The city of the Lost boys (La ciudad de los niños perdidos in spain).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I was destined to see this.,"I went to see The Man Who Wasn't There, but accidentally walked into the theatre showing Amélie.  After seeing it, I felt it was destiny that I made that mistake, because this made my top 10 (and I'm a film student!) . Camera movement: excellent.  Mise-en-scene and colors: beautiful. Story-line: brilliantly clever- there are so many things going on, but in a coherent way that tricks us as well as Amelie's ""subjects.""  The opening scene had me cracking up.  I wondered if the rest of the film could be as well-paced and strong as this, and I found out it is.  I bonded to Amelie right away, and was fascinated with the quirky characters that inhabited her life.  Soon, she began to observe the world around her, as did I.  As she began setting up her ""stratagens,"" I became an active part of the film. The ending left me happy, and with closure.Upon first viewings, I wonder if a film will hold up after five or ten watchings.  This film requires multiple viewings, to understand all the detailed actions and jokes.  I think the characters and brilliant stories will hold up time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Magic Realism meets Chuck Jones,"Well, ""Amelie"" at least allows me to forget ""Alien Resurrection"".I'm a huge Jeunet fan, or to be more precise, a Jeunet/Caro fan. City of Lost Children and Delicatessen are two of my favorite films from the last ten years in which they were probably the most visually inventive and influential directors around. Films like ""The Matrix"" stole gratuitously from their visual aesthetic. Those films were nutty sci-fi/comedy/adventures where Amelie rests in more commonplace ground (albeit `Magic Realist'). It bears an almost too-close resemblance to the genre represented by ""You've Got Mail"", except Jenuet's filmmaking is far more vibrant and the laughs more genuine than in such spit-polished mainstream fare. There was also an honest and buried melancholy in Amelie which I stayed with. Of course there were plenty of bits that plastered a dumb smile on your face.In ""Delicatessan"" and ""City of Lost Children"" there was in several sections of helter-skelter action, almost impossible to follow in the first viewing. In `City', there was one brilliant comic/cosmic moment where the girl's teardrop set off a chain of ludicrously logical actions that resulted in saving her life. Another scene in it had one where a group of child thieves retrieved a key in a door with a ridiculously complicated scheme. Much of ""Amelie"" is an extension in spirit of those two sequences from ""City""; mad chains of association like Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng used to essay in. Jeunet had been toying with such connections-of-fate right through those first two films, and here he took them to hyperbolic lengths (still preferable to the excruciatingly self-conscious ""Run Lola Run"").In the insane breadth of modern life, Jeunet senses, there are grand chains of causality. Mathieu Kassovitz's Nino is a passive observer of one such chain, searching for his favored traces (the torn-up photos) in his attempts to make out something of its shape. He collects and studies these totems that tease him with practically unsolvable questions, like the identity of the mystery man, and gets an emotional kick out of this monument to chance and isolation.Amelie, on the other hand, seeks to be a whole chain in herself; invisibly she tried to alter lives and manipulate events. She wants to be a glorious mystery. The price she willingly pays for this is self-erasure. Where Nino, dumped into reality by childhood brutality, has reduced himself to an observant speck in the urban cosmos, Amelie, the lonely sprite, having brought herself up in a fantasy universe, naturally expresses herself through interventions that make her something resembling a meddling Greek goddess or Fury. The drama of the piece then is in seeing Amelie try to re-integrate herself with reality (in love with Nino) without too much pain. Only Amelie can fulfill Nino's quest because she plays with omnipotence. But it costs her much, too, as much as it fulfills her; she sees her plans occasionally wobble, fail, and become tragic (like the romance she sets up only to see it slide into destructive, repetitive behavior). It's an almost theological question - is this what God goes through six billion times a day? But it's clear what Jeunet's thesis is; his filmmaking is equivalent to Amelie's dreaming and subsequent actions, they're both weavers of intoxicating magic.That's really all the drama there was and it was a might thin for the film's length (about twenty minutes too long), but there were very solid, affecting emotional strands in the work; often it was like a meditation of forms of alienation and sorrow, lump-in-the-throat worthy, and it surprises me when people comment that it's all so lightweight. I was glad Jeunet didn't try to wrap everything up neat. The scene where the couple have love-starved sex in the toilet causing the café to shudder was nearly up there with the bedspring scene from ""Delicatessan"" (to which there was a neat reference also in the film). Indeed, was a genuinely laugh-out-loud comedy, the first I've seen in - I don't know how long. However, some of its comic bits, funny as they were (like the gnome in the international photos), seemed, well, second-hand. Much of the film was an almost mechanical process of watching Amelie set up her plans. There was a dizzying flow of information offset by what was actually a very simple little yarn of lovelorn not-quite-losers in the big city. Like Amelie herself, it was ostentatiously modest. Despite the superficial modernity, the film like ""City"" and ""Delicatessen"" was set in some weird netherworld between now and 1950 (a more innocent act really than all those French Socialist newspapers claimed) with a shimmering vision of a surviving cozy Paris full of cozy Gallic types, looking for the good heart even in the grindingly staid bourgeoisie (like Amelie's parents) that are usually the complete anathema to French artists.I agree with the general proposition that this film was about twenty minutes too long. I felt the weight mostly in the middle; I was thinking ""Come along Mr Jeunet, tighten the pace a touch."" All those speed-cinema tricks do not actually make for a fast film. Jeunet's films always have a love of eccentric humanity but gosh darn it I miss those apocalyptic landscapes and the harder edge Marc Caro used to give. Plenty of Edible French Chic here but not so much nouveau cuisine as a fine chocolate liqueur. Not, thankfully, a complete souflee.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A great feel-good film,"Amelie is a charming feel-good film all about how you can make people happy by making others happy. It also explores a second theme of whilst it is important to make others happy, it's just as important to make sure you're happy as well. Stylistically the film is great. The film makes great use of stop-motion, which gives it an entertaining old-timey feel. There are also some great instances of humour, such as all of the strange people who inhabit Amelie's world. It's strange to think that somewhere, people like this really do exist somewhere or another.Read my full review: http://goo.gl/Wfmbuu",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl...,"1st watched 10/11/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir=Jean-Pierre Jeunet): Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl named Amelie, played by Audrey Toutou, who attempts to turn her dreamlike life into reality through following a path of doing good deeds after finding a young boy's memory box behind a wall in her room. Her good deeds start happening after she delivers the memory box to the grown-up person --- who then pursues his ignored daughter and grandson. The complexity of this story and it's characters are actually too much to discuss in this short review – but I'll do my best. Her adventures start as a young child who loses her mother and is left with a father who does not relate to people, and therefore keeps her locked up as well until she is able to move away. She then tries to pursue life and love despite her faults and this movie portrays this journey. She works as a waitress in a local bar and is helped in this journey by an elderly painter who lives in her building. A mishmash of characters are introduced telling us their likes and dislikes showing us the director has a backstory for everyone of them. The one that Amelie eventually pursues is a man who has supposedly had the opposite experience in life by having too many people in it. He keeps a scrapbook of folks who take pictures in airport picture kiosk's and is obsessed with this. Her positive approach to branching out also benefits her in a personal way as she changes herself also -- before the end of the movie. This is more of a light comedy than a deep serious piece, but there is definitely meaning behind it the film. The dreamlike approach taken by the filmmaker makes it so you never know what's going to happen next and this is part of the joy in the film. This is a definite gem that should be treasured by moviegoer's throughout the world and hopefully opens the world up to this kind of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Simply marvelous,"If a movie deserves 10 of 10 stars, it's this one. It's not the best movie I have ever seen for there is a diversity of genres in cinema that are impossible to compare. But if you confine to the genre of fairy tales, and Amelie is kind of a fairy tale, then it is the best movie I've ever seen. It is full of splendid, crazy, funny, marvelous ideas, more than you can capture by seeing this movie only once, it has this congenial music by Yanne Tiersen (go and get the CD sound track !!!), it has this inimitable French charm, and above all: It has Audrey ""Amelie"" Tautou who is a sparkling jewel among all the equal-looking and equal-acting young (Hollywood) actresses of this planet. This movie goes straight to the heart and makes you feel happy, at least for two hours. It's like a drug and this may be the only drawback of the movie: It's truly hard to find oneself back in ones own world after having been in that of Amelie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

As someone who speaks no French, it was difficult to keep up the the pace at which the dialogue was spoken. Be ready to read quick. I would even suggest viewing on a computer rather than a television so that pausing is made easier. The movie is not just a love story, but also a story about finding oneself, and our own meanings for life. Definitely one you should watch before it's too late.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Simply beautiful,"Amelie is a stunning example of European cinema and one of the most wonderful films I have ever seen.  Ignore what you hear about Amelie being an idealistic view of Montmartre - it is, but it's proud of it.  Amelie is a fantasy film, it isn't trying to be an accurate portrayal of life in Montmartre, instead we follow the life of Amelie and her efforts to bring happiness to others. I think its a shame that some people will shy away from Amelie because it is in French with subtitles, but this really is a film that can be enjoyed by all film lovers.  Amelie is a visual treat, in fact I'd imagine it could be enjoyed without following the dialogue at all (although I wouldn't recommend it!).

A script is not a collection of incidents,"After watching Amelie, I was left wondering what was at the crux of this film?the cinematography (every possible angle on the planet)?the movie colorisation (heavily influenced by Almodovar)?the bag of gags (stop doing the eye thing Amelie, no more minute photos)?the characters (exaggerated and woefully over-acted)?the music (well conceived indeed)I am not sure at all, but one thing is for certain. The movie did not serve the script, because there was so little of it.Fast-pacing through the DVD director's commentary, Jeunet admitted that the first 20 minutes were devoid of plot. I couldn't agree more, but I think he understated time by a factor of 5 or so.Love and romance certainly comes into the picture as a main motif candidate, but in my opinion too late to make a difference. By the time we are sure that this is a love story, gags and style have taken over and the spectator is happily in green absinth trance. Which is good I guess.This is fast food cinema alright. Not the McDonald's type, the ""nouvelle cuisine"" one. 4 out of ten for originality and cinematography.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The sequence of  the old russian movie with subtitles actually talking of something else has been overused by creatives everywhere.

"Decent, but...","I hated everything that I'd seen by Jeunet to this point.  I thought that Delicatessen and City of Lost Children were that annoying kind of 'art' film that had more in common with music video than cinema, preferring eye popping visuals to genuine filmmaking.  And Alien Resurrection, his foray into Hollywood sellout was the lowest point in a series long past its sell by date.Amelie, when compared to these previous films, feels like a breath of fresh air.  Jeunet still prefers camera tricks to camera style, quick cuts to mise-en scene, and digital effects to photography.  And while the plot here shows quite a bit of invention, it relies far too much on its omniscient narrarator to inform us just how charming everyone and everything here is. But for the first time, Jeunet seems to want to put people in front of the camera instead of phantasmagoric setpeices.  The photography, when it is coherent, is often stunning.  The model here seems to be classic Hollywood musicals like Singing In the Rain, and Jeunet fills the screen with a stunning array of colors, and every shot simply sparkles.Of course, I still find Jeunet's visual style rather oppressive and tiring. But this very style will probably recommend it to the college students who will make this a big hit for a few years.  And it's nowhere nearly as godawful and overwrought as Oliver Stone's similarly stylized Natural Born Killers, which is what all the pretentious kids were watching when I was in school.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Don't miss it,"We're introduced to Amelie Poulain at a very early stage in her life (as sperm), which made me nervous that I was going to sit through this person's ENTIRE life in two hours. Not so. The opening sequence simply lays out the groundwork for the rest of the story, thematically and visually.For the rest of the film, we follow Amelie as a 28-year-old woman who, after her love life doesn't make her happy, devotes her life to performing secret, inventive acts of kindness toward others. The deeds she does are so imaginative and funny, the audience can't help but fall for her. The way they are presented is equally imaginative.We soon realize that the acts are a sort of defense mechanism, a wall she's thrown up between her and personal relationships. She longs for contact but is almost afraid of it, something attributed to her parents, like the way her father never touched her except once a year when he'd give her a medical exam. Her neighbor, Mr. Dufayel, the ""man of glass,"" helps her to realize it's time to be as kind to herself as she is to others. As the story moves on, Amelie comes out of her shell more and more, finding the courage to speak up, to ""get the last word in.""The same theme is strung through the film, that beauty unseen is tragic, but is still beauty. Amelie's selflessness is her beauty, but after a while she realizes it's not making her completely happy. She finds herself using her craftiness to trap the man of her dreams, but has trouble actually facing him.""Alien: Resurrection"" aside, this film should lift Jean-Pierre Jeunet out of his cult' filmmaker status. His films have been famous only in film people' circles, at least here in the States. But hopefully ""Amelie"" will change that. It's no less inventive and visually captivating than the rest of his work, but targets a wider audience demographic.It's French, so expect crude humor than U.S. audiences will find out of place. Still, ""Amelie"" is the kind of foreign-language film that could break away in America like ""La Vita e Bella (Life Is Beautiful)"" or ""All About My Mother.""

Amélie decides to take it upon herself to change the lives of some of the people she lives around, like her father, her neighbor, the concierge, and those who work in a fruit stand of the corner of her street.

Is this the limit to today's fantasy?,"I'm always surprised to see how movies like 'Amélie'or ""American Beauty"" can become so favorite and be accepted by people as the ultimate feelgood movies.... is this the kind of excitement and fantasy people need in their lives nowadays? If someone would be in his/her real life 10% of what Amélie is supposed to be in the film, then all the tricks she does on the film would look boring and as if they are based on the tips found in teenager magazines. Not to mention that their fantasy limit remains as mainstream as possible not to spoil the happy end everyone knows HAS to come. Everybody watching the movie feels good and secretely wants to be like Amelie, while in truth he/she only is like the guy that gets the box back: this movie puts in a small box all the things that made you feel good back then, the ones you obviously forgot in the way, needing now boxes to put you back in trail. So, to summarise: if you need such movies to feel good, you will feel good with this movie. If on the contrary you ARE the kind of person that does tricks to the neighbours you don't like and does good things to the neighbours you like, well you will agree with me that Amélie is left way behind in fantasy and tricks..... So, as a comedy and technically speaking, it's highly satisfying. But for the feelgood stuff, lessons of life etc. I have one advise: don't see the movie, but get a stone NOW and throw it to your neighbour's window, the one you hate most. Then you will have the effect the movie tries to achieve (but doesn't since it stays too much on the surface), and maybe even feel good afterwards.

But it just goes to show you that with clever writing, good acting and inspired and interested directing, simple stories still make great films.  I do think the film has something substantial to offer, it is not a ""pastry"" as some overweight film critics try to pigeon hole it as. Instead, the story attempts to show the importance of triviality and the insignificance of ""world events""  I love the way the story was loosely framed around the Lady Di tragedy.  We see how Amelie's world exists inside and isolated from the events that the newspapers say we should care about. This film is about escaping the isolated voyeuristic world that we live for and begin to live our own lives, rich with our like and dislikes, or fetishes and quirks. While I watched the film, I wondered if Jeunet was in cahoots with Bin Ladin because the timing of the events could not be better.  So turn off the 24 hour war coverage, skip Survivor and see Amelie.  On the way home stop buy you grocer and dip you hands in some grain if you like.Also, anyone who does not like this movie because it's too cute or sugary, is dead inside and should just off themselves now.

A contemporary fairy tale,"Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is the kind of movie everybody expects to see when they go to a movie theater. Cinema can't make us dream anymore like it used to, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet found the receipt for beautiful movies. He already made us dream with La Cité des Enfants Perdus, but it was in another world, and in other times. Amélie Poulain is a young girl living a regular life in Paris, when she discovers that she can, with very little means, change the others' lives. She can give happiness to people, without waiting for reward. In fact, she doesn't do anything special, but she can, for example give sight to an old blind man, just making him cross the street. She can cure hypocondria... But she doesn't need any power, just a pure heart. What about her? Who will help her to be happy and change her life? Who will take care of her?

FABULOUS MOVIE! Thumbs Up!,"I saw this movie almost a month ago on an AirFrance flight from Paris to Singapore where i am from. It was highly recommended to me by a French monsieur who was seated beside me on that flight. He barely spoke English while I cannot speak French to save my life but he could not help but recommend that I should catch the movie... Thank goodness it had english subtitles but it was indeed such an excellent movie and with a superb soundtrack...It was a 13-hr flight and Amelie was the first movie i saw and i was so struck by it that all the other inflight movies (chocolat / vertical limit?! /finding forrester..etc) really paled in comparison... I'm still so struck down by the simple, fantasy-like storyline which is romantic, funny and quirky all at the same time! ;) The actors were really good and carries the whole movie all the way through especially Audrey as Amelie...she is not only beautiful... she really makes you fall in love with Amelie... This is definitely one of the best movies i have seen...and i'm hoping that it will show in the cinemas here soon coz i would love to just watch it all over again....and again... But since it is quite seldom that French movies are shown here, i hope that i can get my hands on a DVD/video soon!...Someone mentioned its going to be released in October?..gee...that's quite some time from now..but well, its gonna be worth the wait i guess! ;) So you lucky people in Europe..go see it in the cinemas now!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Fresh and original,Funny story of Amelies destiny world set in Paris. You feel very near the atmosphere from the old town and the characters are very typical. The role is just perfect for Audrey Tautou and I cannot imagine somebody else is able to play it.

Awesome French drama.,"Audrey tatou is perfect as the titular character and the French capital has rarely looked as lovely in this charming French film. This film causes a stir when it was released in 2001 and you should have a look to see why. The dark comedic element, eccentric nature of the scenes and some great acting by Tatou should encourage you to do so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Simple, Touching, Clever and Wonderful...","This movie is so far one of the best movie I've seen. Once again Jeunet created a real mood in this movie. Far from the glaucous and unhealthy admosphere he usualy brought into a film. This picture is both unbelivably simple and so deep but with a bunch of laughters and tears. French directors usualy try to put reflections and emotion in their film but generaly end up with a big confusing mess. This is not the case for ...Amélie Poulain. This movie is simple, touching, clever and wonderful. When you go out of the theater you might have change some point of view from your vision of the life.

Angelique Audrey mesmerises as Amelie,"I am not someone who watches foreign language films very often. This is obviously my great loss and shame. 'Amelie' is the second such film I've seen this year. All I can say is, if 'Crouching Tiger' won Oscars, then this should too. It's far superior, in my opinion, to last year's surprise Oscar-scooper, and it was every bit as good as I had expected. I didn't find it too long at all. In fact I didn't want it to end. I don't know where they found Audrey Tautou, but she must be the greatest discovery of the century! Everything else about the film is good, too, (I especially liked the gnome) but it's impossible to forget Amelie herself, with whom I, amazingly, identified. I've never been to France. I certainly want to go now. If I could take 10 films to a desert island (preferably with the means to watch them) Amelie would definitely be there. 9/10. If Hollywood doesn't pull its socks up, I'm going to be fully converted soon. An utter gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Once upon a time there was a marvellous piece of cinema...,"...That made happy almost all the people who saw it. It was a very uncommon work of art that gathered together all the elements required for being an  exceptional visual feast that fed all the minds that were enlightened by it. Set in a very weird/fantastic environment, it was impossible not to be absorbed into it like a whirpool messing with all your senses. That film is called ""the fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain"" or if you like just ""Amelie"".And behind these unique fantasy view of France, there is the man, the director who took for himself the hedonistic role to make happy most of the people who would see the movie...Jean Pierre Jeunet. The murky, mysterious man who brought us the Post-Apocalypse in his previous work, now brings redemption in a world that is as strange as the others he's created.Amelie, is the story about a unique girl who suddenly realizes that her mission in life is to bring joy to others, but at the end is incapable to help herself when it comes to her happiness. This film, is the kind of fairy tale these days are lacking; like a couple of Aspirins that relieve you from the pain the outside world brings you for 2 hours.Now, the fact that the film is a fantasy and that Amelie might be the sweetest thing you would ever see, doesn't mean that she's capable of being mean with the people that messes with her. Just look at the poster for the movie, we see a girl that is happy just by enjoying the small delights of life, but that will get back at you if it is necessary. At the end, a person just like any of us in a world just like ours, only sought with different eyes and color...green.It is implied that this film has become one of my all time favorites ever. After watching it once, it becomes like a drug, something you have to do more than once. I became an Amelie-addict and I don't think I will ever rest until I see it again. That good is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Life-changingly positive and a genuine must-see.,"Amelie is the highest grossing film of the year. And it's easy to understand why. This film has been directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the leading light of the modern French film industry.Amelie benefits from Jeunet's innate ability to use the cinematic medium to create an environment which the audience feel part of. Watching the film is escapism. The character of Amelie, played by Audrey Tautot, is sweet, innocent, and modest, although her childhood was one that would have turned most people into criminals.The entire film relies on sentimentality. The relationship of humans to the physical space they inhabit, the little things that mean so much to people, the games we play, the inner child. That true love exists, that happiness is possible in this day and age.Jeunet's films look beautiful, thanks to Darius Khondji (also David Fincher's DoP) and are usually anachronistic in that it is always difficult to determine which era they are set in. A world apart from the dark, gothic, champagne-coloured lighting of Delicatessen, this film bursts with oversaturated colour, further communicating the joyful spirit of the film.He uses the classic French talent of solid characterisation, making 3D people who interact wonderfully. Like the scene in which the erratic old man teaches the simple boy to mock his boss, chanting names, magic is made.It's cinema in the truest sense. It's magical. It's also postmodern, helped by the creative team behind The Beach, Fight Club, and the Alien films, but so far removed from any 'plot' films that America may produce. If there's one avenue the global film industry should explore, it's how to make films like Jeunet's. And the box office profits reflect this.Incidentally, the actor playing Nino Quincampoix, Mathieu Kassovitz, is the director of La Haine, one of the best modern French films made, and a global hit. It was strange to see him in the least hateful film one can imagine!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Cute Girl, Cute Film","I went to see it 'cause I became infatuated with this Audrey Tautou, but I ended up being quite impressed with the lush visuals and amusingly clever story (and Ms. Tautou impressed me even more for her acting). Heavy on the romance, but it's bearable. The only problem with having to follow the subtitles, is that they probably led me to miss some of the many clever visuals. While my experience with French film is limited, I've never liked the ones I've seen. This film proves to be the exception so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
For me the best movie of all time,"I had a laugh at the poor reviews for this movie... I can only conclude that don't watch this film if you like action films.For me this is my greatest movie of all time and I will proceed to tell you why I think this...1) It does have a story... it is essentially a love story. I am baffled as to how people can't pick up on that. It is a romance and as such it delves into the fantasy feeling of being in love and infatuated with a stranger who you have yet to talk to and you have yet to know but your entire body aches to be with them nonetheless... that adrenaline that rushes through your body and creates that tingly feeling of nerves in your belly. The film captures that moment perfectly.2) The film is visual poetry. It is not seeking the harshness of reality... it is seeking to portray the pretense of love - see point 1. The photography in this film is just amazing and the focus on facial expression as a means of dialogue is fantastic. While I like heavy dialogue films that are characteristic of a Tarantino film, it is nice to go back to the facial expressions of the silent movie era... and Jeunet is a master of capturing the face and using actors capable of expressing emotion through the visual. The camera angles, the orange tint in the photography and the choice of colours, the attention to minute detail, demonstrate a true artist at work.4) The acting... too many poor reviews are given because of the lack of dialogue other than the narrator... So I am guessing these people don't like the silent movies of times gone by... nor will they like harsh films such as Hunger or the acclaimed The Artist. Expression need not be about words... and the actors that Jeunet has gathered around him are artists of expression without dialogue. Their skill at expressing an array of emotion through the face is astounding.5) Character development... we learn so much about the characters in this story in such a short time through a like and hate narrative that builds upon Jeunet's short film... Foutaises (available on youtube with English subtitles).Ultimately this film is about capturing a single emotion - the first feeling of passion and infatuation when you glance a person you would love to know better. It is visually stunning and is about expression through the visual. For me the film ticks a lot of boxes that I look for in a film... I want something that celebrates the visual - if I just wanted a plot then I would read a book, that said, I want something that has a story to tell and this film does have a story... it is a romance story. I look for good photography in a film and for good acting and this film delivers on both accounts. I also want to leave the film with a memory of the film and feeling whether it be a warm fuzzy feeling like this film delivers, anger, fear, or hate. I love films that make me think but those thoughts need not be complexities, this film makes me think about the film and how it was shot... that alone makes it one of the best films I have seen... it is great because it makes me think about how it was made as a film. In that sense I can understand how some reviewers can call the film self-indulgent... it is... it celebrates itself... it celebrates the art of film (there a number of little things throughout that celebrate film) in this respect you can draw similarities with Cinema Paradiso.However, ultimately, what makes a great film for me is one that transports me to another place where I am so engrossed in the film that I lose sense of time and when the film comes to an end, I feel as though I have lived as part of the film and have been away on holiday... a film that sucks me into itself... a great film is one that transports you to another place like a great piece of fictional writing in a book... where your own reality subsides and is replaced with the temporal vision being portrayed. This film delivers in that respect. It shuts out the outside and replaces it with a visually stunning piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

When I see a film like this I wonder why Hollywood does not (or cannot) produce films of its quality (""Martha Fokker"" indeed).  I guess what was best about Amelie was that is was <real>; that what she did and felt was something all people could identify in themselves:  her desire for justice, but not in the tired old legal way, but in a real, human way.  Her desire for love, not simply for herself, but for others in the world, even for those who the world sees as misfits, or as somewhat undesirable in appearance or behaviour.

Living in her own magical world en trying desperate to get some magic in the real world to. Sometimes it works but every once in a while it goes not quit as she planned. This creates some really hilarious scenes.

10/10,"I finally watched this movie. I feel like it's a beautiful love letter to introverts with wonderfully magical imaginations who have a hard time connecting with people in real life. Audrey Tatou's face is unique. The movie is so wonderful and fascinating that I didn't want to miss a single second of it. What a great point of view this filmmaker has. It's an alternative world full of intrigue, mischief, fun and romance. This is a rare gem of cinematic virtuosity. French filmmakers have always brilliantly used the magic of cinema, unrestrained reality and logic. It makes you want to dance in the street, kiss your loved ones, appreciate the service in a restaurant, smile at strangers, sing loudly. It draws you in and fills your senses with color, sound, music, light, characters and allows you to escape into a fully realized dream. It's the best in cinema.

A sunshine in your life you will never forget.,"Tonight, I went to the movies, to see Jeunet's latest movie...and for sure the best movie I saw since the Truman Show...and the 3rd ever I saw people spontaneously applauding at the end of the movie (the 2 others were the 5th element and Titanic). Jeunet, the director of the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" and the very cool ""Alien 4"" once again showed us he is, with Spielberg & co, one of the 5 best directors in the world. The action takes place in Montmartre, in the 18th arrondissement of Paris turned in some kind of urban fairyland, to a bumpy ride into Amelie, a funny girl full of dreams's life. I won't tell you too much of the plot, but let me say that Tim Burton, another master of poetic-SFX packed extravaganzas has lessons to take here ! Congrats to M. Jeunet for those 2 hours of pure magic and for his very original use of special effects, to Audrey Tautou (who plays Amélie) and to the whole cast for their astonishing performance.

fantastique,"A shy young girl finds a way to express here joi de vivre in the traditional French cinematography of the common people. The cinematography is very well done and it evokes all it is supposed to with a beautiful and charming Audrey Tautou even more cute than a young Juliette Binoche. Somehow I find the film less than satisfying, however.I am at a different point in my life maybe than older coming to terms with my mortality people, but it seems to be the running theme in many french films, a long stretch for someone who grew up on the pain of humanity in Scorcese and Coppola. It seems like Amelie sacrifices her own capabilities to live the simple life as a waitress who finds love around the corner with the photo geek. The only character who has seen any of the world seems to be the garden gnome. A well, I guess I am a sucker for a hard luck story and I take the happy endings with a little too much pessimism.

That unloved bby gurl seems thirsty AF,"Starting with the positive feedback about nice cinematography,camera work and colors I was making myself the same question that other angry reviewers made,considering this film is rated 8 in here.My theory is that the positive and overrated reviews made this a cult film is just because of the internet newcomers defined like a vast majority of unloved teenagers,impressionable new kids discovering foreign films and thirsty AF girls (and boys) with a heartache unable to find love.The reason this film sucked in my opinion is because that over the top pretentious development/acting.Being the main story (maybe a spoiler?) ''a sweet unattractive obnoxious unloved desperate to find love short haired girl likes to help people out with ulterior selfish reasons behind''Who cares about a girl like that and what she have to say to the world? reallyWhy is that? because it becomes annoying how bipolar this can be.I mean,a lot of girls can be identified with the lead character,due to the fact that (not in general) the main problem of the 21sth century woman is to find some stable ''male sexual reproductive organ'' and live happily forever,but still that doesn't count as a good story/plot/movie/meaning/feeling..1 out of 10 ...because of annoying performances and situations ...Audrey Tatou's best film ever?

Vive le cinéma français !,"Moviemaking, when done correctly, is magical. What is magical ? Well, it's strongly subjective by nature. It's that beautiful, unparalleled marvellous feeling of a strong emotional connection with an awe-inspiring film that you fall in love with. A film that you don't just like, appreciate or enjoy. Much more then this. A film which makes you realise how absolutely amazing movies are. Few movies achieve that feeling.The magical feeling of this movie is due to it's setting, story and visuality.Paris is presented in such a delightful and fantastic way. It's not the city of today that sadly suffers from a multitude of problems. Here it's the place of lighthearted ease and incredible beauty it should be. In general the authentic french nature and energy of the film is lovely and I enjoyed it a lot. The concentration on Montmarte was very nice.The protagonist, already charming with her simple yet mesmerising name, captures us, the viewers, as she develops an almost angelic taste for genuine altruism.The typical 2000s filmmaking (quick editing, colorized cinematography) is subverted with a simultaneously creative yet weird mise-en-scène.

On-screen poetry,"While watching Amelie, I was filled (for the first time since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) by my immense love of the cinema.  This movie filled me with joy, but more importantly, with Amelie.  The wonder of this movie is its ability to keep you in the moment.  Every emotion of Amelie is felt by the audience.  Via his poetic and artistic techniques, Jeunet transports you into the separate realities of his characters, as successfully as Darren Aronofsky did in ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but Jeunet's pallete of emotions is far greater. As I exited, a couple of the people I was with were bubbling away, ""Oh, everything about that made me happy,"" ""didn't you just love Amelie so much,"" etc.  Do not let people's simplification of this movie detract from it.

The film shows how a person's actions can affect those around them (for good and bad).

What a film should always be.,"Have you ever seen a movie able to move you inside, make you think, feel more optimistic, friendly or just happy ? This is some of the side effects this movie can do for you. When everything goes wrong in the world, many fell alone, sometimes depressed, losing faith in the life, worried of our future... A movie like this one makes you realize how much everyday life is important, how great life can be, how much we should enjoy all the little things that makes our life, our experience, our difference. This movie is so good, touch you so deeply, that some people preferred to protect themselves (being sarcastic, pragmatic, critic) when they saw it. I read a lot a reviews before going to the movie theater, and even I was expecting something really wonderful, I was far beyond the real value of this pure, state of the art performance. Speaking of criticisms, I remember one of them from a New York Business journal, writing how disgusting was the film, how the sweetness of the story was tasteless... Is this a surprise ? Not really. When you are driven by business values, and you believe your level of happiness is more or less the amount of money you earn or the size of the car/house you own, you can not just think happiness as a simple thing. To critics that found the movie was not realistic, not a true picture of life or Paris, not just trustable... Is not the purpose of a movie to make you dream, to make life looks better ? Why don't use the same critics against all Hollywood movies ? Do you really believe the stories ? In you everyday life, do you really think people look as pretty as in these movies ?

Too long too long too long too long!!!!!!,"Or at least it SEEMED like hours...Oh my god, here goes my hope for French movies... I usually don't like them. I watch one every two years or so. Afterwards, I always know WHY I don't like them...Everybody was full of praise about this movie. I went to see it with good hopes, but as always I was disappointed: The movie starts out fresh and funny, but after the first half hour or so, it is dragging on and on and on and on and after 90 minutes, I was sure that it was at least a 150 minutes movie. I was terribly bored by Amelies endless chase for this guy and was only happy when the movie was finally over.A movie for women?

Amelie keeps you smiling,"This is one of the most honest, heartwarming, and endearing films that I have seen in a long time.  Audrey Tautou is amazing, and Jeunet captures childhood innocence and imagination in a way that would make Truffaut proud. The colors and images as well as the imaginative uses of computer effects make this story one of the best of the year.  Go see it immediately...and then go see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Surprisingly, pretty good","Nothing - neither the hideous-looking trailer, not the favourable reviews, nor the unfavourable reviews, nor Jeunet's past work, nor Jeunet's expressed opinions, nor what I knew of the subject matter - gave me any reason to believe that ""Amélie"" would be anything other than two hours of torture.  It turned out to be a pleasant, pretty damned good movie.  It's certainly better than ""City of Lost Children"" (if not ""Delicatessen"").  Without the contribution of Jeunet's former co-director (and inspired production designer) Marc Caro, it doesn't LOOK nearly as good as it ought: too many sets and effects are merely digital (the single worst digital effect: at one point, when Amélie is excited, we pan down to a revolting X-ray image of her beating heart), only a third of the cutaway gags have anything going for them, and every single shot has an unattractive yellow colour cast - doubtless an attempt to capture the warmth of old Technicolor prints, but all it does the film look sallow.  Still, the charm is real.In its way.  Most of the time Amélie is a lovable neurotic, but Audrey Tatou has but to look at the camera - or even GLANCE for a moment in the rough direction of the camera - and the character instantly becomes arch and knowing and insufferable.  It's as if she knows she's in a film starring herself.  Amélie (like most of the others) is only worth knowing so long as we can think to ourselves, ""My god, she's really like that""; the moment we suspect she's putting it on, she's lost us.Those who think this is one of the best movies ever made (or the best French movie of the past decade, or some such) can't be getting out much: it's a sweet trifle, no more, no less.  What surprises me is that nine out of ten of those who loathe the film, no less than those that adore it, do so for the wrong reasons.  Amélie's little schemes are NOT the work of an angel: they're not motivated by altruism, most cause at roughly as much misery as they do happiness, one comes to a bad end and another of them was just plain nasty.  That's the POINT.  The film's mostly happy ending is meant to come across like the happy ending to ""Emma"" - good fortune rather than good management, and more than the heroine deserved.About the ""McDonalds"" criticism: Yes, no doubt the real Montmarte has McDonalds outlets in it.  That's no reason at all to put such things in the movie.  They don't make Montmarte any better and they wouldn't make the movie any better.  This is an important point.  When we find ourselves tolerating the presence of McDonalds outlets even in our fantasies, the battle against them will have been lost: what we have trained ourselves to tolerate in fantasy we cannot help but tolerate in real life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Please, see it in French","Please, the worst crime we could do to this film is not to see it in french.

three cheers for Amélie,"The truth is the movie doesn't run very deep. I do love it, though, and especially the main character. Amelie Poulain an unstoppable agent of joy, anonymously bringing peace to those around her. But she's always one step removed from human contact -- communicating through pictures, metaphors, trinkets, one-sided phone calls, secret manipulations, windows and spyglasses. She's not exactly shy or anti-social or awkward. In fact, she appears to be quite content with her interior life... until the possibilities for real connection arise, something that both entices her and terrifies her. When she finally gives in, it's a joyous occasion.In typical Jeunet fashion, the film's visual style is jaw-dropping, with a fistful of clever tricks, gorgeous splashes of bright colors, and a dynamic camera that keeps you on your toes. Jeunet uses cinema to enhance the significance of the details, in such a playful and generous manner. Audrey Tatou is charming, but really the entire cast is excellent.A modern masterpiece of wit, whimsy, romance and warmth. A breathtaking celebration of the things in life that are lovely, in ways large and small.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Almost the best film I've ever seen,"I generally only review really good films or really bad films, this was a really good film and i defy anyone to say otherwise.If you don't like watching subtitled films make this an exception because it really is a film everyone should watch. I can't imagine a person watching this and not smiling.It's a couple of hours of pure positivity just short of a hug from your granddad or an early morning children's programme. And yet at the same time there are some points at which you nearly find your self crying, is it possible for a plot to be that good, it is now.Take the central character, Amelie (hence the title) a character it is impossible not to like and yet you feel a constant frustration that whilst she is able to fix the life of so many others she is completely unable to fix her own when she is clearly the most deserving of all of them.That said, you find yourself in some ways warming to every character who makes an appearance from Amelie's seemingly emotionless father to the odd neighbour with the tragic past from downstairs. Every time a ray of sunshine is brought into one of these peoples lives another ray is brought into yours as you somehow experience their joy.Plot aside, the directorial techniques alone make the film a must-see. Completely original editing and style of acting make the film quite unique. It's so different and brilliant I'm actually finding it fairly impossible to describe or even begin to describe. in-fact the best i can hope for is just to tell you to watch the film and see for yourself.You won't regret it, you physically can't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great ensemble of multiple genres,"I was thinking of this film as an artistic film but it wasn't. It blew my mind as an entertaining aesthetic film from the first sequences and the title credit.Everything was so colourful as old colour films.I think we got used to the CGI a lot nowadays but I was surprised how it was used in this film ex. When Amelie was released from nervous situation...
The tempo was fast and I didn't get bored even fast French with English subtitles. Comical parts were so funny and fast but also there were slow parts and both were quite balanced. Most of the scenes were comical but there were some suspense scenes and were so thrilling as caper films. I would say its genre is romantic comedy but also it was an ensemble of so many elements of multiple genres. And those were making great harmony in high level. And I can't forget to mention about the catchy and beautiful musics by Yann Tiersen.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Exciting, Marvellous. A small masterpiece","I was so excited when I saw this film that I do not think will be able to find the right words to comment on it.Understanding that is the same good director of Delicatessen, you can easily follow the style and the speed of the film. Initially, it took me a small while to follow the description of all the characters but then, as a film ""leit-motiv"", I was deeply involved in the Amelie's hyperrealistic world. She is so detached form the nowadays reality that convince even more, specially because the film starts in a lovely ""Parisienne"" sixties years and ends up nowadays. The film, as Coen brother's films, is full of well defined characters, each of them has a special meaning in Amelie's life.It is necessary sometimes to see ""fresh"" films as this one, perhaps the best film of the whole season.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amelie is a life philosophy,"I am so happy to read that there are so many of us Amelie lovers out there!When I watched this movie for the first time I was in the company of my two best friends who had spent years leaving me post its and clues leading to pots of ice cream or candy. The three of us were completely blown away by the the movie's ability to philosophise about everyday life details, just as we had been attempting to do for years, in the hope of turning our simple lives into small boxes filled with magic, creativity and tenderness.It took us 15 minutes to leave the theatre room and another hour until we could finally have the guts to talk to each other and admit that we had just experienced one of the most beautiful cinematic/realisation moments in a very long time.From that day on I have been watching films in the search of finding something which will warm my heart as much as Amelie did ...I guess certain things happen once in your life.

Probably the GREATEST film in French cinematic history.,"Basically - it is Le Balon Rouge - in a longer and more modern format, the filming and the colours bring Paris to life - Amelie could have only been played by Audrey Tautou.

The reason this is a great film is...,"This film is loved by so many (for those of you who are nay-saying) because it is a perfect metaphor of the lives of so many. The fact that Amelie herself is so painfully shy and unsure is modeled by the lives of so many. She is strange, and we all are strange. She has her little ways, we all have our little ways. I feel there are so many little things in this movie that are overlooked by some: these overlookers, I feel, are those people who rush about their lives with too much to do and never get the chance to take time to enjoy the small things in life, like dipping your hand into a sack of grain. These people obviously don't have the time to fully enjoy such a timeless masterpiece that Amelie is. Amelie is in many ways a coming-of-age. While she is technically grown-up, she is really young. It takes time for her to learn that it is OK to love someone. That it is OK to show emotion. This is coming from a girl who had never been shown emotion. And that in itself is a precious gift.Anyways, to those of you who have booed this film, put a smile on your face and take time to appreciate life!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
the film of my life!,"(a.k.a - Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain) Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, Amelie is the visually and emotionally intense story of the painfully shy Amelie Poulain. Raised by 2 left of center parents, Amelie was left with only her imagination to get her through her childhood, an imagination that cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel brings to life nostalgically. Years later, after finding a past tenants treasure, Amelie decides to become a regular do gooder. However, we wonder if she will ever have the time to please herself, and if she will ever be able to tell the love of her life how she feels. Through a series of comical and heartwrenching trials, Amelie sets the wheels of fate in motion. This is a film, that when you think back about it, you cant help but smile. This is a film that will touch you emotionally, it will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly; think about the fundamentals of life. Visually, this movie is breathtaking. Acting wise, the characters are so well executed, and the characters are so real, that is impossible for you not to relate to them on some level. And if this film could not get any better, Yann Tiersen delivers an original score so beautifully composed and matched to the imagery, that it will give you chills time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Life will be magical if Amelie is in charge of the event.,"The French romantic comedy `Amelie' has been a big hit in Europe, so I approach it with respect and an eagerness to prove 50 million Frenchmen wrong. Somebody needs to watch the eponymous Amelie closely: she's a little troublemaker with a big heart, and if you don't watch her, she'll steal the gnome from your garden and then your heart.Amelie commits her grandest scheme by trying to connect with an introverted porno store clerk through a series of clues and coincidences that would make Tom Twyker envious.  In fact, the frenetic pace of Twyker's Lola, as she races for love, seems to have influenced director Jeunet. The romantic ingenuity of `Moulin Rouge' with its lovers' dreamlike pursuit of each other is here as well.I am distracted, however, by the conscious effort to ingratiate, both in the way-out vignettes (like sending a fake final love letter from a dead husband to a forlorn wife) and the many close-ups of the lovely, bemused Amelie. It is like watching `Life is Beautiful' for the 10th time-the bloom has long ago blown off by the film's obvious campaign to be relentlessly cute.Paris, however, is another story.  Montmarte is lovingly photographed, not expressionistically as it was in `Moulin Rouge' but spiritually; anything can happen anywhere, and it will be magical if Amelie is in charge of the event.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Over rated, But not without Merit","To call Amelie the 'Best French Film Ever!' is not an infomed comment. Why? The movie is enjoyable certainly, but it is not revolutionary or even particularly original - bar the fabulous digital shots. The story is quite pedestrian and is similar to lots of other films, notably Pleasantville. The dialogues are often laborious and the acting is not outstanding. Sure Ms Tautou is beguiling - but as a performance it is nothing memorable - hence she lost out on the Cesar (French Oscar) to Emmanuelle Devos much more deserving performance in Sur Mes Levres.The films many suporters at this time will no doubt be calling me a cynic and a nit picker - but someone has to. I liked the film but I am pointing out the films short comings merely because it is not being fairly criticised on this site - there are far to many cloying reviews that say little about the actual film.In the end all this is going to work against Amelie. Like Titanic before it this film is going to suffer from huge backlash in years to come and I don't believe will be in the IMDB top 250 in 10 years. It shouldnt be - its not important enough!",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a feast for all senses,"This is one of my most favorite movies.Since there has been written so much about this movie (why it is so good) and since I agree with all of them I was trying to get to the bottom of another phenomenon.From time to time I read or hear negative, total irrational and almost hate outbursts about this movie and I ask myself why there are so many extremely aggressive negative reactions to such a charming movie. I think I have some kind of an answer.I think hardboiled realists are the ones who have extreme difficulties with this movie. They just can't cope with all the excessive fantasy and imagination in this movie. They are overburdened coping with a hero who is not mainstream, an outsider not getting along with reality and yet winning in the end.It's interesting to deduce from the hate arguments another strength of the movie: Outsiders should be encouraged to be themselves no matter what because they give the world its individual, original and creative mark and that's what makes this world so unique in its mixture of reality and spirituality.Bravo Jeunet.Bravo Amélie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Love through vibrancy.,"Amélie has become something of a universal classic at this point and is a film that seems to be almost unanimously beloved, but why is that? Is it because of it's uplifting energy, the loveable cast of characters or perhaps the simple escapism of innocent untarnished love? I personally think that it is all of these things and a hundred other ones on top of that.The point I'm trying to express is that Amélie truly is a vibrant piece of cinema that has an almost undeniable charm. All this to say that I by all means understand the love this film about love has garnered. I love it too of course, otherwise I wouldn't be saying all this. However in the end the film's strengths also simultaneously work as weaknesses for me in a few ways.The movie of course doesn't strive for realism, but when a film goes to these extreme levels of experimental fairy tale-ism if you will, I end up not being able to fully invest myself into the emotions the story presents. What I'm trying to say is simply that the film doesn't reach any peaks on a dramatic level which it in ways certainly tries to do. Now is this a flaw? No not really and it really just boils down to me needing something that the film doesn't strive to deliver.Otherwise the film is very sharp, the editing is truly striking and exciting in it of itself, the music is memorable and delightful, the cinematography is gorgeous in a sort of storybook manner and the acting is purposfully quirky throughout.To conclude: the film is really good and absolutely worth seeing by practically anyone. The sheer style that Amélie exudes is truly remarkable and while I myself feel the film lacks some fundemental roots to keep it grounded enough for me, it is still quite the wonderful film.Rating: 7+/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It is a beautiful film, one I would watch even if the story wasn't as good as it is.I usually do not like having to rely on reading subtitles, but I think that the original language is too beautiful and intrinsic to the Parisian heart of the film to miss out on.

Dire..,"It came highly recommended, by more than ten people both men and women. It was a must see, the dawn of new cinema, a polished gem, etc. It was not before ten minutes into this movie that I became physically nauseous, I blamed my ale and switched to wine.The nausea didn't stop. In fact it got worse, a lot worse. Suddenly I felt a cramp in my stomach. I was sure I was going to hurl if I wouldn't stop the movie within 5 seconds. By fortune of luck I was able press the right bud on my remote control to eject the damn tape. And only seconds afterwards I already felt so much better.This was a first. I had gotten physically sick from watching too much banality. Before this moment I had only heard about this phenomenon in theory and in some very scary movie reviews here on IMDb.What makes this movie the nauseating experience it was, is quite simple. it's constant and pounding narrative is completely unfunny (even for someone who understands French), cardboard-cut-out characters which give new dimensions to the term annoying and people smiling smiles that will challenge your mental sanity.

A cinematic treasure ...,"To the viewers who complained about the movie depicting a totally unrealistic non-multiracial Paris, I wanna reply with a big and long : ""Soooooo what ?"" and here starts the review ...First, it's called ART. Which means it's something personal. A personal view from Jeunet which -I agree- has a very nostalgic 40's/50's feeling depiction of Paris with a sentimental focus on Montmartre, but again, why not? Why do you feel obliged to kill the joy of many viewers all over the world by adding a political ""re"" to Jeunet's ""vision"" ... should Jeunet have artificially inserted some racial minorities in the background just to satisfy the PC supporters : ""Hey look, I'm not racist!"". Amelie is a piece of Art, and an artistic masterpiece. It may look fake or artificial or just weird, but for me it was just a dream-like realistic-fantasy world full of non stereotypical yet eccentric people like in Capra's movies.Secondly, Amelie is UNIVERSALLY appealing. It deals with universal themes all of us can relate to : nostalgia, childhood, quest for love, family, meaning of life, there's a gallery of characters so rich that everyone can relate to the situations they live, their simple pleasures, the things they like, the things they don't.Third point : it makes you feel so good.It's an incredible feel-good and poetic movie that doesn't have the typical depressing message some movies like to sell just because it became so cool to push people down. By the way, being a feel-good movie is not enough, Amelie works thanks to the innovative story, the director's creativity, the wit of the script, and the beautiful and enchanting cinematography ... not to mention the score that fits the movie like a glove. There's no cliché in Amelie, it was something totally fresh and new for its time. (As a comparison, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a feel-good movie, but far lest subtle than ""Amelie"" especially with the forced Fairy Tale ending and all the celebration : money, love, dancing etc.)Ironically, those critics came for the same country that produced the film ... it's an unfortunate tendency to over-analyze things, to put them on a very rational and political level : the movie was highly praised, even by racial minorities. Why? for all the reasons mentioned before : an entertaining artistic and popular movie, with a stunning cinematography, a great script, and more than that : a movie with a HEART, incarnated by Audrey Tautou's illuminating smile. But some people feel obliged to show how smart they are and try to analyze movies like a 'journalist' just to point out some things as if we hadn't noticed them before. And you have some French elitists bashing one of the most popular French movies, one of the greatest achievements in movie's history and one of the best ambassadors of French Cinema all over the world.""Amelie"" is such an inspiring movie, that invites you to forget today's cynicism, and enjoy the personal vision of the director, of the most beautiful town in the world, providing universal insights about the meaning of life ...

Amelia Review,"***WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Amelie was a film that truly captured the beautiful scenery in Paris, France. The emotions expressed by the characters were fun to watch and there were a few comedic scenes to grab your attention. What I wished the film had done differently however, was the way they made the film look almost too imaginary rather than a real life perspective. There were two important ideas expressed in the film that I thought were great: the first was how the film made you reflect on life and see what really is important, and to make the most out of the time given to us. The second was that no matter what type of situation we may be in, or how far away we may feel from the rest of the world, there is always something to explore and change about ourselves. The first idea is seen when Amelie helps a blind man cross the road. While walking, she continues to explain to him everything she sees on the street; from a child laughing at a dog, to what kinds of food were being sold in the shop windows, while never telling the old man her name. This was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It proved that no matter how little the gesture you do for someone is, like simply helping someone cross the road, that little bit goes a long way. Others will appreciate the help, and you will feel better about your own self.French director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, has been known for his focus on romance and his extensive use of color and imagination, which he has truly portrayed in this film. I think his decision to cast Audrey Tautou, as the role of Amelie Poulain, was an excellent choice because she knew how to capture the audience right away.What I thought was particularly French in the movie was the music. It was not like most of the music we hear in most American films. I think the French use more of an orchestra for their soundtracks and keep it classic, rather than in America where we create music through our technology.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Perfect Rendering of Imagination as Reality,"What can anybody say about this magical film which has not already been said? I saw it again and decided there are some things. This film has deep roots in a rich tradition of reality-as-imagination, as portrayed in French literature and poetry. It evokes the 'impossibile realities' of Andre Breton's romantic surrealist novel 'Nadja', together with its love of the mystery of certain Paris locations. As so much of the film takes place at the Gare de l'Est, which was the favourite haunt of the unique poet and writer of 'glimpses', Leon-Paul Fargue, the film draws much from his eccentric imaginative tradition too. And as anyone knows who has read the magnificent 27 volume novel 'Men of Good Will' by Jules Romains, as I have, that tale recounts the communication between two young lovers by means of signs and messages posted in public places, just as we see in this film. Whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director, is aware of these things consciously in the way that he must be of the many cinematic references he makes, I have no way of knowing. But these things are in the blood and the bone of every Parisian. And although he is a Loire man, Jeunet is a Parisian now. As for the raids which Audrey Tatou makes on Collignon's flat in the film, these are a standard Surrealist activity. I knew well the 'last of the British Surrealists', David Gascoyne (an intimate of Paul Eluard and friend of Breton), as well as his friend Kathleen Raine, a British poetess. Kathleen told me that one time when David was upset with her, he broke into her house in Chelsea and 'staged a Surrealist raid on her home'. He turned all of her furniture upside down and left, - a clear precursor to Audrey Tatou! You breathe these things in the air of Paris, and if you have read any 20th century French literature, these things leap out at you and grab you by your solar plexus until you turn into a Jean-Pierre Jeunet. This film is perfect, everyone in it is perfect, everything about it is perfect, and I won't hear a word or whisper of criticism of it from anyone who doesn't wish a Surrealist raid on his home made in retaliation. Long live the Imagination Liberation Front! Down with the forces of mediocrity and drabness! May there be magic everywhere! And thank you, 'little elf with big eyes like a deer', and thank you, garden gnome who travels the world, and thank you Jeunet, you mischievous fellow and all who sailed in you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A lot of foreign films have a tendency to be hard to follow and very complex, which can be discouraging for people. The storyline of Amelie is complex, but not confusing. It is easy to follow all the the characters and situations (due much to the delightful way Jeunet decided to introduce them), but not so easy as to be boring.Honestly, I could watch this without the subtitles and be completely satisfied.

"""Fabuleux"" indeed","Already a huge success in France, I guarantee that this gem of a movie will enrapture audiences and critics alike all around the planet! What did it for me was the amazing aesthetics of the movie(the impressive special effects and the original camera work create a strangely enchanted and poetic world in the heart of Paris), its colorful and weird characters, its fast-paced rhythm, and the genuine kindness-cum-mischievousness that Amelie pours out everywhere she goes.

"OK OK so it's cute, I get it...","Every guy I know is secretly in love with this film, or more particularly with the character Audrey Tautou plays. I can certainly see why, and the same part of me that says ""get on the plane Bogart, what are you waiting for"", also secretly loves watching the (very small, I hasten to add) part of me that is Amelie.But now that I've seen the film several times over the course of several years, maybe the magical realism is wearing thin, or maybe the tired cynicism of real-life romance makes the whole thing a bit implausible. By the end of the film the character starts seeming a tiny bit shallow, and I think if I was actually friends with the girl in real life I'd feel both constantly guilty and irritated at her inability to maintain a conversation. The characters are quirky in the same way that everyone in Paris is to some extent quirky, and all credit to the film maker for capturing that elusive quality, but at times it seems as if they are simply slotting into very established stereotypes of Parisian life which I'm not sure he really manages to animate - particularly the bistro scenes grated for me.Since I spent six months being chatted up in exactly the same ""quirky"" way by 5 different guys a day (""vous avez les yeux d'une faune, vous me faites rever d'une autre vie"", yeah whatever dreamlover, long as you stop following me), maybe I'm biased and find it impossible to see past the dark side of all that terribly respectful flirting.Still, the scenes where she helps the greengrocer's assistant are both very funny and very touching.Overall, if you want some very stylised escapist romance with lots of whimsical wackiness thrown in, it'll do you fine.

"Beautiful, as in ""full of beauty""...","""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a film with a simple plot. One may think, ""All right, now we have new technology and everything, from filming to post production, so everything should be majestic, intriguing..."" or whatever. Well, this film is majestic and intriguing, but not for the quantity of visual effects used (which are plenty, very well done and very well placed in a time-space and script outline), nor for the shocking or violence-based manner of filming (not present here and frequently found in many ""box office hit"" productions, mainly in the U.S., although this way of ""dazzling"" film making is starting to make its way in Europe, not without major flops or hits - unreguarding the quality of the film contents). It is the subtlety with which the film came to life which shows an alternative - but not ""out of this world"" - way of filming, with a plain, yet excellent script, a very moving and concise sound track made by Yann Tiersen (a young and very promising artist, as I listen!), which is always in the mood of Monmartre - and you should visit the city listening to this sound track, if you may... -, brilliant, almost surreal colors, and very good techniques either in montage or photography... as far as the technical part is concerned. As far as the script is concerned, I can only speak for myself, thinking about the endless hours I spent watching my surroundings and thinking about what people do, how they act, what brings certain thoughts to their minds, laughing at myself for having thought or done certain things, being CURIOUS... and that's what it is all about, I guess... curiosity, holding to small pieces of what we learned throughout living, having small things to protect for ourselves, small thoughts, being with one foot on the ground, and the head within clouds, and feel like everything is found, not pursued, because all things found are also part of what we wanted to find, or else they wouldn't be given the importance they have for us... all of this is touching, and Beautiful, as in ""full of Beauty""...

The small things in life,"Amélie lives in her own world and delights in supposed trifles. Nevertheless, she is missing something to her happiness. To find it, she goes on a journey.The movie is a sign that you should appreciate the little things in life. Especially in today's fast-paced times, Amélie gives a pleasant decelerated contrast.It's nice when you get excited about things, like I get excited about movies, Amélie gets excited about putting her hands in cereal for example. It's kind of interesting, but nobody would do it. But you also like to stick your hands and feet in sand, which again sounds 'normal'. Things have to please you first and foremost, regardless of whether they seem alienating to the outside world. That's what makes the movie, it gives the feeling of being happy.Amélie helps other people in the first place, whether she knows them or not. She has a hard time with her own happiness because a lot of it is in her head, not in reality. She is insecure and therefore likes to stay hidden. Everyone is looking for something, be it love or the perfect work of art. You have to take your own chances in life, otherwise someday it will be too late.The backdrops and locations in Paris are excellently captured and offer an incredibly idyllic and fairytale touch. The characters are individual, curious and unique at the same time. The whole way the movie is made, in combination with the pace and the voice-over that is always on, fits perfectly and conveys a special mood.Amélie is a feel-good movie that is simply knit, but still conveys a deeper message. Amélie is the kind of movie you can actually watch all the time. It shows the joy of life and the joy of what you have. It lives from details and from a mood with a special flair.

May be it is the subtleness of the movie. I recommend this very strongly for everyone. The ""hidden treasure"" sequence instantly struck the right chords and reminded me of my childhood. The wandering gnome was a great idea.The cinematography for this movie is one of the best i have seen in years.And a special mention is deserved for that beautiful naive smile of Audrey Tautou.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Life is a beautiful, absurd adventure.","Seeing Amelie for the first time is a truly breathtaking experience. I had never seen anything like it and to say that it blew my mind would be an understatement. The beautiful surrealist Paris setting is like something out of a romantic daydream, the characters are well developed and inviting, and the story is so heartwarming it almost leaves you feeling intoxicated in the best way.Movies like this, Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood For Love, and Guillermo del Toro's Pans Labyrinth were my gateway into foreign film and I don't think I'd have it any other way. I mean, is there a warmer welcome into such a rich film library?The musical score by Yann Tiersen is so delightfully charming, and funnily enough I actually learned how to play it on the piano before having ever actually seen the movie that it belonged to. That's not terribly important, but I think it speaks to how strong a score is; the idea that you can take away the characters and the setting and the music still resonates and has meaning.It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this movie, so I'll simply say that I am incredibly indebted to director and co-writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet. There are films out there that, overdramatic or not, it feels like the world wouldn't be the same without, and this is one of them. I am grateful that this work of art exists at the same time as I do, and I think that's one of the highest compliments I can give.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The real creative types,"I haven't been thinking about commenting on ""Amelie"" until I recently saw ""Irreversible"". The post-viewing ruminations triggered this input.I've been admiring Jeunet since his beginnings. A highly creative person, with an (unfortunately) very rare poetic, naïve, sincere approach to storytelling, giving this fresh and heartwarming result found in ""Delicatessen"" and ""La Cité"". Mixed with an obvious passion for highly technical, tricky, difficult filmmaking, not far from DePalma's quasi-neurotic approach, and with a strong European fantasy cultural background, his works are as eccentric, highly personal, immediately recognizable as those from -say- Gilliam, Kubrick or Cronenberg (and Jackson before he sold his soul to the moneymaking system).Jeunet is really one of a kind, and when looking back in time, I can tell he's been a major influence in filmmaking over the last decade, even if the general public is not aware of this. Quite a lot of cinematic elements from his movies have been borrowed by the Wachowsky brothers, David Fincher, Alex Proyas and other -much lesser- directors. Unfortunately or fortunately, only stylistic elements were borrowed. No one touched the inner soul of his work. The only attempt that I'm aware of is ""Chocolat"" that is, despite Depp's usual greatness and a marvelous script, a laughable inconsistent mess.In ""Amelie"", it's Jeunet's turn to borrow from another filmmaker's work. Once again, very few people will actually ever notice this, as the source of ""Amelie's"" cinematic structure is inspired from a very obscure, overlooked movie: Garspard Noé's ""Seul contre tous"", which is like ""Amelie""'s evil twin.These two movies are quite different in tone (that's the least to say) and tell very different stories, but they share something else than a quasi-identical editing structure: the will to awake something that's asleep deep within our minds, a part of us we have chosen to forget since our adolescence, because the western societies wants us to be ""adults"".Jeunet has always been obsessed with this paradoxical notion of ""childhood"" and ""maturity"". He already tried to teach us a lesson in ""La Cité.."", during the confrontation between Miette and Krank: the older character is the immature one, and the younger one is the mature one. The extraordinary (and technically beautiful) metaphor of Krank turning into an infant as Miette turns into an old woman is the climax of Jeunet's essay. The message is clear: we, ""adults"", are missing an important part of our personality by putting our inner child in standby mode, and more than this, we are actually less mature because of this.I tend to agree with Jeunet, and the fact that so many people were genuinely, deeply moved by ""Amelie"", much more than by the ordinary ""sentimental"" mush the movie industry feeds us, seems to prove that indeed, something in us is waiting to be awaken. Something that Noé, with ""Seul contre tous"", tries to awake too, but with a very different, much more intellectual -though heavily brutal- method.""Amelie""'s success is a slap in the face of all those who claim they know what the public wants, and produce soapy, unpersonal, vapid, glossy but empty stereotyped stuff. See: give them some real poetry, they actually LOVE it. So much for the cynical idea that the public only eats s***t.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Gaspard Noé (who's responsible for the mind-blowing, utterly upsetting, thought-provoking and highly controversial ""Irréversible"") are the real creative types of today's European cinema now that Almodovar totally lost control and Bertrand Blier gets so multi-layered that his movies should come with a 2 inches-thick user's manual (yet his ""Un, deux, trois soleil"" stays IMO one of the best European movies ever). Oh and Kubrick is not around anymore (sob).Jeunet feeds us with rejuvenating magical poetry, Noé feeds us with upsetting but essential ethic questionings. Both work with a high level of abstraction, an uncompromising attitude, and a very impressive cinematic vocabulary. They totally compliment each other. Let's hope they'll keep on making more and more and more great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
one extremely sweet story of love!,"Amelie.Amelie is a film that describes in its most sweet way the importance of love in terms of the purpose of life.Amelie, the main character in the film, is a girl that was brought up so as to care tremendously about all the little things in life and all the tedious details that usually would be of no importance to regular people. This as said implies that she is not a regular / normal girl. But then again, what is normal? This is a question posed somewhere along the lines in Amelie's life. In the beginning she would think that she is the rather unusual as she has properties that can suggest that she stands out. However soon she realizes that these aren't properties that make her odd but merely what makes her different.Then all of a sudden she finds herself in a quest for purpose. So, as she could never ever dare to imagine this could be to look for someone that could lead her to love (which all things being equal is the most obvious and immediate purpose for life to all people) she discovers the warmth of the ultimate emotion by riding the arrow towards the exact opposite direction. The oxymoron here is (and not only does it apply to her but to us all) that it so happens that so very often someone that cannot trust love in itself, not for a second (the reason does not matter - here is because she is just so innocent and scared), can give and feel and produce oh so very infinite amounts of it! So she does that and sees clearly that helping people makes happy and can be an adventure. It also gives her the opportunity to apply her unique perspective of social intelligence and her own sense of justice.However, the miracle happens and I think it comes down to simply the fact that to the pure in heart love is inevitable. Hence soon she realizes that she wants to live and experience love herself too. She experiments, of course, tries out her power of being spontaneous so as to unleash it / provoke it in her near environment and then enjoys the effects.Then she meets someone (again rather odd) and sees that there can exist other people with similar care for little things and this of course triggers her emotions at first to a small extent but later to the maximum. She falls completely for this stranger and decides to try and attract him. She is quite successful but it's more due to the innocent and true nature of her emotions rather than it being due to a sense of habit or addiction.All this though is merely the story of what happens and cannot tell you of the unbelievable - in my opinion - way in which all this is put to description. This film has a great value because it shows in an innocent (but not naive) way the 'reach out to love' that all of us are capable of living in our lives. I think of this film as a lesson that teaches that true happiness lies in love and all I have to do to have love in my life is permit it to enter my life; all that love is, is infinite and can expand from nowhere, can be produced from nothingness and at the same time can be as filling so as to compose the whole of my life's meaning. And there, at that moment I'd be happy; totally, with no fear, no regrets, no uncertainties, no complications, just a clear perception of happiness as if it could be something tangent and I could wrap it around my self like a blanket.I can only hope it tells you the same thing.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Victor likes: whimsical, romantic French movies with beguiling heroines. Victor doesn't like: cynics and snobs.","I'm actually discussing ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" (or ""Amélie,"" as it's called in English) on my second viewing - I saw it on the big screen first, but I fell asleep during the first hour; this is something I also did during ""The 13th Warrior,"" ""Mission To Mars"" and the wildly overrated remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" (not that the original isn't itself overrrated, but that's another matter). But whereas my lack of interest in the other movies continued when I woke up, with ""Amélie"" I continued to be enthralled by the strange mix of reality and fantasy that the heroine's world revolved around.Seeing it on video again, it worked just as well without any sleep interruptions; this hugely successful French movie may well be a basic trifle at its centre, and it may play at times like a Gallic take on ""Ally McBeal"" with a dash of ""Emma"" - a dreamy young woman takes it upon herself to move among people's lives for the better (helping those who deserve it and tormenting those who don't), but finds that she in turn needs help in sorting out her OWN life - but its high rating among IMDb users is understandable. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie sometimes overplays its quirkiness (having our heroine's mother die when a tourist jumps off the Cathedral of Notre Dame and lands on her? Giving Amélie's lover a job in a porn shop?), but most of the time the movie judges itself perfectly; with its good nature and optimism, it's one of those movies that almost defies you to hate it.Which means that it'll be condemned as being manipulative, sentimental tripe in some corners - but others'll find themselves gradually drawn into the movie's embrace, and won over by Audrey Tautou's central performance, by its clutch of characters (it's very satisfying when the assistant to the hateful greengrocer comes out of his shell), and by its overall lack of cynicism. (That must be why some people hate it so much; and why it was such a hit in France - ""How dare French people finance and go to see a movie that isn't pretentious, is accessible and makes you happy!"")Come to think of it, I might see it again. Cue an Amélie-type smile...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I just wanted the right amount of quirkiness.,"I get why 'Amelie' attracted many moviegoers. It is cutesy and quirky at the same time, identifies with introvert and delicate audience, and is made in French, adding romantic and sophisticated vibes. However, the story is not powerful enough to consume me. During the movie, I cannot stop thinking this movie is trying so hard to be unique and one-of-a-kind. It overdoes everything. To emphasize Amelie's awkwardness and fear to face the interaction, the director pushes the story too hard to the level of creepiness and sneakiness. Even after her identity is revealed, she plots another plot. Also, while she butts in everybody's business and corrects his or her life, she always seems to know the right answer without even trying. Leap of logic right there. So many holes in the plot development to the degree in which one cannot ignore anymore. Another 'overdoing' by the director. Editing is unconventional: collage of videos following exact word of the narrator in a fast pace. This editing style brings more humor and comical vibes to the movie. However, the director adds dynamic camera movement to this already-exciting editing style. A modern motion picture is a flow of pictures for around two hours, and it captivates audience because it has ups and downs. However, during two hours of 'Amelie', there was no time to relax, think, or contemplate, ramped up to 100 all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amelie, happy of helping that man, decides to help humanity re-gain happiness and joy. Unfortunately she'll fall in love in the process. This masterpiece is smartly decorated with beautiful sets, unbelievable cinematography (which portraits Paris, one of the most beautiful cities), charming music and original and sharp dialogues. This film is smart: perfect. This film makes you think about life. Unlikely films such as Requiem for a dream, this film talks about humanity but in a nice, soft and tranquil way filled and decorated with beauty. This film proves ho the best cinema comes from Europe, and how it is important to watch different types of cinema. This film is on my top 10 list, and it's a must see: 10.00/10.00",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The love is in the details,"The origin of this saying goes back to the history of France and Germany, where exactly this phrase was first uttered is unknown today. At that time the saying went like this: ""God in small things, and the devil in extremes"".
Later, this proverb got into English ""the devil is in the details"", and most likely this version was then in Russian. In General, the neglect of small things is absolutely not excusable, since all the reality around us consists of small things. It is about this in ""Amelie"".
You can love something ordinary and simple, but this does not mean that it is something really such. It's just that others don't see it. Love is collecting unwanted photos, getting a letter from someone who would never be able to write to you. Love can take any form. What love means to you, you will understand only through the very details that symbolize your personality. Only by allowing yourself to follow these impulses can you become happy
The film is a little long, the idea in it is not new, but it is presented in a very kind, sweet and sincere way. It's a really good movie",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet perfection.,"Possibly the most beautiful film in cinematic history; hats off to whomever the cinematographer was because Paris, despite all its beauty has never looked so magical.From beginning to end I was mesmerised by just how rich each and every colour was, how strategically placed every filter was and how apt each scene was in putting forth the colours that reflected the feelings being conveyed. Paris became more than just a backdrop, Paris became yet another protagonist for us to fall in love with, yet another protagonist who's narrative became beyond engaging and impossible to resist and yet another protagonist who's arc mattered. It truly is a showcase in all that is great (of what little there is) about the French; overtly indulgent, pompous to an almost unbearable degree but underneath all the bravado ridiculously charming at its inner most core. A stunning achievement in visual mastery.Juxtaposed with this is the insanely charming lead Audrey Tatu. So lost is she on finding fulfilment for others that she seemingly forgets about finding it for herself. The beauty of the performance and the writing is that whilst she never openly craves it we, now living vicariously through this most lovable of characters, route for her to become emblazoned with the amorous feelings she so craves for those around her. The perfect example of how the primary protagonist of any feel-good film should be wrote and performed. Amelie could well claim to created an archetype; the character that is actually impossible to dislike, but is still as multi-faceted as any character in cinema.An infinitely charming and infectious piece that manages to warm the very cockles of this most cold of hearts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
All Hollywood should hide in front of Amélie,"I'd been trying for a long time to get out of the cinema happier than I got in: I was persuaded it was quite impossible, until I saw this wonderful great movie! Amélie is the paladin of the weak, the outcast, the people considered different and therefore outcast, she represents the victory of David against Goliath, of the good against the evil, of the weak against the strong, etc.In Amélie love and good are brought at the purest, heart-reawakening level, to show how simple is helping others to be happy. Amélie is the friend who everybody of us dreams to have: a sweet, tender, always available, innocent, pure-hearted girl with who you can share your fears, joy and sorrow and from who you can learn how to enjoy small pleasures of life.Thanks to the magic setting in a cleaned-up and romantic Paris, to the inscrutable simplicity of the characters, but mainly to the skillful interpretation of this wonderful new star Audrey Tautou finally we have a new reference point in the universe of the good cinema. Nothing in common with Hollywood's millionaire, overrated crap!I'm sad Amélie has been so underevaluated at the Césars and at the Academy Awards, but the biggest success comes from the public, this is the most important success of this great movie. There can't be another evaluation for me than 10 out of 10, I recommend it strongly: as for me I'm going to watch it tomorrow (March 27th) again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Still thinking about it...,"As it's been over a week time now that I watched the movie for the second time, I realized that it still makes me think about it and feeling of warmth, a bit of joy as well as sadness that it gives me.I am listening to the soundtrack and scenes are just popping up in my mind. Especially the scene when Monsieur Bretadou found the metal box and his childhood treasures, then when he sat down at the neighborhood cafe, he had the flashbacks of childhood memories that may seem very silly, and childish. But don't we all have memories like this which took place at some point in our lives that really effected us? That scene was a touching one for me for the very simple reason that it reminds you once again that life is very short and precious. You may become 50 or so before you even realize it, and forgetting about what life is all about. Are we missing our little opportunities here and there while we are having marathon racing against time?Another scene was the one when Amelie had her disappointment with Nino when she heard her waitress friend met with him. That melting down effect is absolutely right. I don't know about North American, European or Asian women, but I can speak for myself and many others over here that ""yes, we do have that exact feeling of melting down when something like that happens to us""...Although Jeunet is a male, this feeling could not be described in a better way by a female director:) You just feel like dying and melting down right there. You don't even want to exist anymore. At least for a few minutes or hours (ok, may be days or weeks and even months depending on the situation).The other one was when she playfully used the ""female"" in that painting of her neighbor Monsieur Dufayel was drawing one after another to describe herself. Those moments they discussed the look of her were so intelligently done. Don't we play games like these?God I can write down so much more, but I'll finish up. Amelie ""touches"" my heart, I remember how it feels like when I do something similar to Amelie's act of help to the blind man. Empathy and caring...How much does it cost us? Just a little effort to touch somebody and be touched...What else really matters in life at the end of the day? Are we really taking our careers and money and belongings with us when we are dead, anyways where we would be taking them?If one movie can make me think of so much and for so long, and it touches my heart, do I really care about its technical details and length and so on? Personally NO.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Escapism par excellence,"It s very unusual for a French-speaking film to break into the Anglo-Saxon world, but this quirky Gallic offering has done it. Some American audiences may find the sub-titles and the saccharine-sweet treatment difficult to swallow, but most British viewers should manage to cope. After all, the Paris portrayed here is the kind of innocent charm that so many of us seek on our holidays there; all the characters are eccentric and we are noted for our tolerance of eccentricity; and, after all,  the eponymous role was originally written for the British actress Emily Watson (hence the name).In fact, following the stunning success of the movie in its home land, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the lead role than the gamine newcomer 23 year old Audrey Tautou who gives a wonderful performance as the Montmatre waitress who wants to escape her own withdrawal from so much of life by giving some pleasure to so many other lives.  In the process, she discovers love in the odd form of a porn-shop worker who spends his time collecting torn-up photo booth pictures (Matthieu Kassovitz).The bizarre story-line and the inventive shooting are the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, previously known for `Delicatessen', `The City Of Lost Children' and `Alien: Resurrection' (only the last of which I have seen). The  possibly unfashionable - message of the movie is that all of us need a little magic in our lives and, if we can be the one to bring some of that magic to some other lives, then our own will be enriched along the way. Escapism par excellence.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
almost fabuleux,"Jeunet's tricksy and quite charming ode to romance and an oddly sanitised Paris walks a thin line between being delightful and being a little irritating. The imagination of the story's telling and the cinematic zest that it possesses help to cover up its somewhat excessive length and the incessant loveliness of it all.  Even the brittle bone disease of one of the characters and Amelie's occasionally commented on melancholia get short shrift as the sunshine and light of the whole film bulldoze through anything that may upset the viewer. Certainly, it pleases, but in an Easter sort of way where all the chocolate is in danger of making you feel the slightest bit like you have had too much sugar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Poetry made in movie,"Amélie Poulain is a hidden mountain treasure discovered only by the eyes of children's and adults which have rediscovered their innocence. It's magic, poetry that Jean-Pierre Jeunet has written, not a script.

Each time I watch it a notice a hidden secret: it can be a position of a character, a color and apparently inexplicable face expression. It's a chef d'oeuvre and comment it too much will damage it. An advise: watch it one... twice... as many time you need to understand some shadowed parts.You will be transformed, : 100% guarantee.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Amelie' is a very un-french film, something that is happening these days in French cinema.  No more aimless plots and new wave cinema.  No more verite'. This film is a deep character study on a character who is very very lonely & lovely and holds the camera lens in her vice-like grip.  The film is good-natured and kind, although unsparing in its spotlight on the soul's search for its own humanity.

"Simple, Sweet-Hearted Romance in Disguise","Bored by the monotony of everyday life and unimpressed by her world's more common, mundane pleasures, a sprightly young French woman resolves to add spice wherever the opportunity presents itself. In most cases, that means painting disruptive colors over perplexed neighbors and acquaintances - delivering a long-forgotten keepsake here, pulling an impish series of low-key pranks there - but as the exultant mood sweeps her away, she also lets herself slip, dreamily, into the net.This leads to a wonderfully offbeat, apprehensive game of cat-and-mouse, as her urge to continue the ruse conflicts with her desire to remain blissfully anonymous and romantically unattached. Cleverly disguising its genre for much of the run time, Amelie is an ambush of a romance picture; joyful and free-spirited without any of the dramatic hang-ups that I usually find so annoying about such films.Audrey Tautou is sublime in the title role, a performance that marries the fleeting, mischievous whimsy of adolescence with the empathy and awareness of adulthood. That's a difficult, but essential contrast, and Tautou has it locked down. As she goes, so goes the film.

Amelie: a modern CLASSIC,"2001 saw the release of the fantastic French film 'Amelie', and it instantly (and deservedly) became an international hit.A fantastic modern fairytale, 'Amelie' follows the life and adventures of young and whimsical Amelie Poulain who embarks upon a life as a waitress in Paris. Audrey Tautou puts in a stunning performance as Amelie, capturing the magic of the old silent movie stars whilst creating a charisma all her own. Her elegant portrayal lights up the screen not dissimilarly to the wonderful Audrey Hepburn.The style of the movie, wonderfully realised by director Jean Pierre Jeunet, captures the whimsy and fancy of Amelie herself. Pefectly placed shots, quick camera movements and a vivid colouring give this film it's own unique look. Although the way the movie portrays Paris as perfect - overlooking the gritty downsides all cities must face - received some criticism when it was first released, Jeunet's Paris is pristine and beautiful, reflecting the story itself.This style has even gone on to create wonderful ripple effects in brilliant new TV shows like 'Pushing Daisies', and is similar to Tim Burton's more colourful stylistic flourishes (think 'Big Fish').The story itself captures the imagination from the first frame, a story of eccentricity, friendship, love and finding your feet in the world, Amelie will make you laugh out loud, giggle amusedly, cry your heart out and last with you long after the final shot.The fact that it is in French will make many viewers switch off instantly, but although it being French is a curse for those of us who cannot speak it, it is also its biggest charm. I was very cynical about watching this movie when I first saw it, because of the subtitling, but after five minutes of half-hearted viewing I was hooked forever.If you see any movie this YEAR even, let it be this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Charming Tribute to Odd Introverts,"This film is inspiring on so many levels, not the least of which is how it manages to draw you in to the emotions of the protagonist by showing nothing more than a child amusing herself with home-made toys of a lost era in the first minutes of montage.Amelie's emotionally deprived and bizarre childhood seem at first to be preparing her to become a modern urban casuality a la the glass-man who paints copies of the same painting year after year, the bitter produce seller, the weeping tippler widow or the hypochondriac tobacco seller. But her charm, beauty, piercing insight and natural openness work in her favor as she battles her own tendency to withdraw.Finding a box of lost trinkets, she sets out to restore them to the rightful owner. That good deed and the emotional transformation she witnesses seem to set her on a path to right wrongs having to do with personal loss and alienation that she sees in her fellow parisians, not the least of which is her widower father whose only emotional tie is with a garden gnome.When love beckons Amelie, she is not at all prepared for the chances she must take. It is hilarious and heart-warming to see her pursue and hide from the object of her desire, an eccentric wounded artist of a man who collects discarded photos from train stations and works part-time in a porn shop.This movie is a pure delight. Scenes of Montmatre and other parts of Paris often neglected in films evoke a wonderful feeling of that city for anyone who has visited, lived in Paris or left a part of their heart there.Go see it!~",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The little movie that tries (too hard),"""Amelie"" has two major assets: fabulous cinematography, and the delightful Audrey Tautou.

It seems as if the whole thing was put together just so the audience would think it's the cutest, most charming and (my favorite) heart-warming little flick ever produced. This leads to constantly dumbed-down situations and behavior. Why?With Amelie, one either goes with it - my guess is, that's the way to enjoy it, and what most people do - or look past the cuteness to ask, what's there? What's all this really about?Not very much, in my opinion. Amelie is currently no. 10 on the IMDb's top 250. Like the movie, that's not heart-warming.

"Without Amélie, Today's Cinema Would Be The Scurf of Yesterday's","One of the most adorable, original & sweetest movies of all time, Amélie (also known as Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain) is a beautifully crafted, exquisitely narrated & gorgeously rendered tale about the simple things in life that usually are far more valuable than we deem it to be and throughout its runtime, all it attempts to do is to make us pause & admire those small wonders that abound around us at all times.Presenting its peculiar story with irresistible charm & incomparable wonderment, Amélie is a celebration of life that is captured in such an inventive manner that every single frame of it is an aesthetic work of art & passion and with its insanely magical blend of all aspects, the film also triumphs as arguably the finest effort to come out from French cinema & certainly ranks amongst the greatest motion pictures of all time.The story of Amélie follows its titular character; an innocent, young & extremely shy woman in her early twenties who, after making a surprising discovery in her apartment one day & using it for a certain good deed that pays off immensely well, dedicates herself to helping others find joy & happiness in their own lives in the most unexpected yet delightful manners while struggling with the isolation of her very own life.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who incorporated chapters of his very own life into the film, Amélie is brought to life in a style that completely defies conventions from beginning to end. Throughout its runtime, it ponders on moments that seem irrelevant to the narrative at hand yet without those little snippets, Amélie wouldn't be the same film for they add a great deal of sweetness into the picture & this level of unusualness is present in every single aspect.The screenplay is equally good with best parts being how it opens the story, introduces all its characters, paces the narrative & keeps it all glued together. Cinematography in itself is a heartwarming delight that exhibits rich, resonant & remarkable use of colour palette that captures Paris in stunning detail & vividness. Editing provides a refined pace to the whole film and although its 122 minutes of runtime sounds fair, I wish this splendid beauty never ended.Coming to the performances, Audrey Tautou as Amélie Poulain is adorable beyond belief & effortlessly manages to win hearts with her extraordinary performance. Beautifully capturing the innocent, naive & shy nature of her character, it's impossible for me to imagine someone else playing this role because Audrey turned out to be the very definition of Amélie as if she was born to play her. The immensely cute Flora Guiet also deserves a mention for she was equally amazing as young Amélie.And last but not the least is Yann Tiersen's mesmerising score which seamlessly integrates into the narrative to further elevate the joyous, cheerful & pleasant ambiance present in the picture and, together with other aspects, effortlessly succeeds in transcending its viewers to an otherworldly experience for 2 hours. The storytelling is unique, the performances are superb, the music is powerfully evocative, the direction is simply impressive craftsmanship, and because of all that there's no denying that Amélie delivers on all fronts.On an overall scale, Amélie is a celebration of selfless good deeds, the joy of little things, the satisfaction one gets in making a person smile and how our actions can really inspire & change someone's life forever. A whimsical journey & a life-altering drama that remains one of the most heartening & gratifying film experiences of my life, this is one masterpiece that left me smiling like a maniac like never before & I really mean it when I say that ""Without Amélie, today's cinema would be the scurf of yesterday's"". One hundred percent recommended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe,"This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camerawork are key elements to this.In the second part Amelie lives on her own in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of ""Delicatessen"", except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like an absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates.Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What's all the fuss about?,"This movie came highly recommended by nearly everybody.  Thus, perhaps my disappointment was a result of high expectations.The movie is original in the way that the life of Amelie (and her friends/family/acquaintances) is presented; However the novelty wears off after an hour or so, and all that's left is a trite, highly predictable movie that I wound up turning off.  3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Golden covered feel good,"Amelie is a special lad, a different gem in her appearance and her activities. She wants to be happy along with others. When she is struck and static with her purpose in life she energetically moved forward to make others happy. And she finds that it is her life's purpose. Jeunet made a brilliant, quirky one along with his screenwriter Guillaume Laurant. The movie is so speedy because we can find unconventional shots and frames everywhere. It also broke the theory, where Godard did on his films and that is talking and dealing with the audience directly. Amelie looks at the camera and made her gestures in order to communicate with the audience directly. There is beauty everywhere not only in mise-en-scene but also in the technical aspect. The background score is so astonishing and the production design feels more vivid in its context and the viewers get the feeling that they are watching something fantasy. More than that Audrey Tautou's handling as Amelie is so brilliant with the aid of her hairstyle and the outfit.

The world could use more people like her, especially right now.This film never fails to put a smile on my face all the way through and the language causes no barrier, because it's so well constructed and filmed that you can't help but understand what's going on.It is filmed with such great artistic value and direction, in fabulous locations and with a perfect soundtrack.I desperately want to hide a tin of special items somewhere, but I don't know what I would put in it. I also want to send a gnome around the world and collect discarded photos. The ideas are all amazing and I wish my mind worked like the writer of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Movie that makes me smile,"I remember reading about Amelie months before the movies release. I waited and waited for this French film to come out and was not even slightly disappointed. Audrey Tatou was without a doubt the perfect fit for the character of Amelie. Her large brown eyes and devilish grin are almost cartoon like, helping to give this film the feel of a cartoon or fairy tale. This is a magical story about finding happiness in making others happy and happiness finding it's way into your own life. The series of events and the way they unfold are perfect. The cinematography is outstanding, dare I say, whimsical. Sometimes a movie comes around that can just make you feel good, and laugh without being sappy or obvious. This is a movie that makes me smile no matter how many times I've seen it. It's also a movie that I can watch again and again and pick up something new that I missed in previous viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Color Palette,"I was amaze how brave the production design to push their color palette. It was stunning and subtle and work perfectly on their story. The contrast from the character, foreground, mid-ground and background are just right and create a nice depth of field and addition to that is the lighting, from key lights, fill lights, backlight and prop lights. The lights give as a cloudy look or we're in the state of dreaming or euphoria. The make gives the character a strong facial expression even without trying and it goes with her hair provided more strong independent woman. The costume design, she wears a nice and simple dress that does not distract the audience during the film. The Color Palette goes with the props and accessories and was planned and collaborated ahead of time during pre production. I also like the editing techniques used during post production, seamless and invisible. Overall it is outstanding movie and will watch it again and again to hone more knowledge from the creator of this film. There are more techniques used from writing, camera movements and angles, etc... and more to dig in from this movie for our future film makers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It's better to help people than garden gnomes.,"Five Oscar nominations; two BAFTAs, and six more nominations; four Césars and nine more nominations; and a Golden Globe nomination. There is no doubt that this was one of the best films of 2001, and one of the films that you should definitely put on your list to see.This film, starring cute Audrey Tautou (The Da Vinci Code) in the title role, is like an Éclair: sweet and delicious - a treat to be savored. It is colorful and whimsical and shows a Paris that only exists in the movies. But, there is enough sadness in the world. Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy life.Amélie never got love or affection at home so, when she finds an old box of treasures, she seeks the owner hoping for satisfaction. She gets it and resolves to spend her life doing good for others.It is the tricks she plays on those who are mean that are hilarious.She gets two lonely people together with unexpected consequences. Isabelle Nanty was superb as the hypochondriac.She brings joy to a lonely and bitter widow.Her imagination is stupendous! She helped others, but love eluded her until she found the courage to jump into it.Serge Merlin was excellent as Raymond Dufayel, a painter who stayed in his apartment alone. Jamel Debbouze (Angel-A) was fantastic as Lucien, as was Rufus as her father.Everything about the film: the direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the writing by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel, the editing, the sound - it was all top shelf.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One word: beautiful,"One word: beautiful.Amélie takes pleasure in the small things in life: dipping her hand into sacks of grain, cracking crème brûlée with a teaspoon and skimming stones on St Martin's Canal. But what she really likes is making small changes, which have large consequences. And after the discovery or a long forgotten treasure, she decides to make people's lives happier, the small way.This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. The cinematography, characters and storyline especially are wonderfully shot and developed. The opening scene has to be one of the best. It dictates Amélie's childhood (a very good place to begin, if I may say so myself). It describes her pleasures, troubles (or rather her parents troubles) and the main events, which took place (such as her suicidal fish). You fall in love with her instantly. You feel for her: pity her, admire her. Amélie is a dreamer who never grows up.This film is almost impossible to describe. Amélie's love for small details is obviously a love the writer/s have passed on from their own fascinations and the details are abundant. Every person Amélie touch's life changes. Happiness finds them and they find happiness. All I can say is you must watch this film. It is like no other feel-good film. It's quirky, fascinating and beautiful. Beautiful.

Those eyes!...but what a film as well!,What a beautiful film! It is unashamedly feelgood and old fashioned. As a male the achingly beautiful Audrey Tatou takes my breath away but the film is so much more than that.I think that the minor characters and the small plot twists involving them make the film a pleasure as much as the story of Amelie's bittersweet story.I won't describe the plot in detail as there are plenty of other reviews on the site that do that.Just take it from this cynic that you have to watch this film.

A charming film.,"Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, or better known as Amelie to English speaking audiences is a wonderful little story about a naïve and innocent young woman in Paris, who decides to help people around her and along the way a humorous and often quirky tale of love and life is told. After a rather mediocre, if somewhat underrated Alien: Resurrection, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is back on form. The film is striking with delicious colours; the cinematography is truly first rate and every frame is like a perfectly taken Polaroid. And to accompany such beautiful visuals is the wonderful and uplifting instrumental music by Yann Tiersen, with these quality elements in place the mood is set for Amelie's story.Played by Audrey Tautou flawlessly, Amelie is one of most endearing characters in cinema history. I don't want to give too much away about the storyline, but this is a romantic comedy that is easy to stomach, even for the most hardened thrill seeking movie goer, in essence, unless you have no heart at all, Amelie should win you over. I make a final esteemed mention about the narration throughout the film by André Dussollier, the recitation complements the movies eccentric charm and is a very nice touch. Simply put, this film is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A fairy tale for adults,"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin tells the story of Amélie Poulain, a girl who had a strange childhood. She didn't get any affection from her father except when he gave her a medical examination, her mother was a neurotic teacher who tutored her own daughter at home. As a child Amélie decided that she would isolate herself from the world until she was old enough to leave home forever.When she's old enough to go she moves to Paris where she works in a café in Montmartre. When Princess Diana dies, she accidentally discovers a little box that has been hidden in her house for 40 years. She decides to bring it back to the rightful owner, to make him happy. If he's happy with it, she'll dedicate her life to make other people feel good. If not, she'll continue her life the way she is living it now.I don't think I've seen many movies that were as touching and funny in the same time as this one. I certainly can't think of one right now. It has some kind of innocence which you'll probably only find in fairy tales. I guess that's the best way to describe this movie: a fairy tale for adults. It is not only a beautiful movie because of the cinematography, it is also beautiful because of the message it gives to the audience. It shows that the beautiful things in life can be found in small details and that you'll have to grab every chance you get to find happiness.The acting, the story, the way everything was filmed... This movie is just perfect in every way. It shows that not only Hollywood knows how to make a movie. As this movie shows us, European cinema can be at least as good, even better. 10/10 is the only appropriate score if you ask me. Don't hesitate to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not worth the time it takes to watch.,"This film is utter tripe. Weakly directed and poorly executed, devoid of any original cinematography what so ever. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has been going down hill slowly for many years and this is better than some he has done but by far not the best. Audrey Tautou is the main appeal in this film and I wonder if it would have reached the level of media attention it did with out her. Again we see art for arts sake something dressed up and strutting around like it's yet more highbrow art when all it really comes across as is pop culture pap for the masses. It is extremely overrated and hyped beyond all that it offers, all be it a sweet. If you have nothing better to do then worth a watch as its relatively inoffensive, if you can get over the saccharin aftertaste it will leave in your mouth.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I am in love.,"With Amelie Poulain. While watching IFC Grindhouse, There was a mention of Tuesday's Feature presentation, Amelie. I had heard a lot of good things about it, and as I do with every movie I want to see.What I watched is undoubtedly the most uplifting movies I have seen. I use the phrase ""the most (positive adjective) movie I've ever seen"" a lot, but I cannot emphasize the happiness I felt while watching this film. There are few movies, no, few situations period that I'll be a part of that make an unconscious smile appear on my face while they are happening; Amelie is one of them. The movie brims with heart, emotion, and an overall appreciation for life and humanity. Seeing the world through Amelie's eyes, her own beautiful perspective (which dies in most of us through the rigors of maturity and the passage of time) is as refreshing an emotion as can be experienced. When Amelie succeeds in her plans, we are as happy with her as she is; when she hurts, we hurt. Crying in films is usually reserved for tragedy, or a bittersweet departure, but I found myself crying at the sheer uplifting beauty that's crammed into every minute of this film. To call Amelie a ""good movie"" is an insult to the movie's strength of heart. To call Amelie herself a beautiful, shining spirit is a vast understatement; she'll charm you like no other character in film. A classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fabulous Journeys for Amelie and Me!,"I prefer the French title because its meaning is much more relevant to the film. I first watched ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) in a theatre five years ago. The film has gradually faded away since then. I have recently encountered it in Toronto's second hand market. I purchased it because I want to acquire some comedies. ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" not only fulfills my wish, but it also brings many more elements to me. I am glad to purchase it on DVD at a very low price while regretting for overlooking it after my first viewing.First, the use of colour is fabulous. This film is so colourful that it builds up the humorous sequences. The colours are appropriate but they do not exaggerate. They make the film bright and optimistic, which are the atmosphere that I experience.Second, this film conveys a message while being a comedy. I like comedies that has a meaning instead of mere laughs because characters act in stupid and exaggerated manners. ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" talks about Amelie changing other people's lives. She recaptures a man's childhood memories. She brings a man out of his obsession over his ex-girlfriend. She punishes oppressors (somewhat a social justice activist). I am impressed that she is so multi-dimensional. The film provokes me to reflect on how I can change other people's lives. I believe that everyone of us can play the role of Amelie.Audrey Tautou was awesome playing Amelie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes the right decision by casting her after Emily Watson is unable to fulfill the role. I think that Tautou is much more suitable than Watson because Tautou's native background is French.While ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" has many funny moments, I am most impressed by its tragic beginning. Amelie had a tragic childhood according to the standard of average people. She does not dwell in the tragedies throughout her lives. Instead, she opens herself to a personal journey, albeit small and coincidental. While we can change other people's lives, we can look around us. Some small and negligible incidents can change our lives.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

My favorite film.,"I will keep this pretty brief. There are way too many things to say about this excellent work of art. In my opinion, this film is a ""Perfect 10"". In a nutshell, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius, and ""Amelie"" is a masterpiece. After I saw this film, I purchased ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"", and fell in love with Jeunet's style. I am a 40 year old American male and my friends are all action and scifi lovers (I love a lot of that also), and they are perplexed that this is my favorite all-time film. I have turned quite a few people on to Amelie, and most of them are shocked to find out that foreign films are much more beautiful and cerebral than most of the garbage that Hollywood puts out. Now that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has opened the door in the U.S., it is my hope that more foreign films get a fair shot in American theaters.If you like this film, check out Jeunet's aforementioned titles and also ""A Very Long Engagement"" - it also stars the beautiful and incomparable Audrey Tautou and a couple of others from ""Amelie"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Mark Of Zorrini,"I liked Amelie a lot, even if it needed a bit more discipline in the tasteful stakes and tightening up on the running time. A film that opens with sperm and a live birth, continues later with the 15 orgasms blossoming in Paris at that moment, and is blasé in that true little shop of horrors, a porn shop, is not really my idea of a feel-good film. There's too many witty uncomfortably cynical moments in Amelie for that.Having said that, it's an extremely confident, stylish (French style), expertly colourful and cleverly directed comedy movie, where life's daily eccentricities are totted up and trotted out as being meaningful by their mundaneness. Par example, are you one who hangs the toilet paper top rolling outside or in? Have you always put your left sock on first to ward off toothache? Then get these concepts out there in digital widescreen and make people feel good they're not alone!An engrossing and pleasant enough two hours, but ultimately the feel-good movies I know I'll going back to include It's A Wonderful Life, Greyfriars Bobby or, as my daughter pointed out, Pollyanna!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A imaginative and beautiful romantic fantasy!,"""Amelie"" is one of the most beautiful, wonderful and enchanting films I've ever seen! Upon my first viewing, it became one of my most favorite films and I've seen hundreds of films from all over the world. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a wonderfully gifted director with a rich visual imagination. Audrey Tautou portrays the role of Amelie with convincing charm. I think she has a bright acting future, especially after the success of this film.What really sets ""Amelie"" apart from most other films are it's art direction, cinematography, use of visual effects and clever, insightful story. The lighthearted French soundtrack is beautiful from beginning to end. I think ""Amelie"" would be enjoyable for most anyone, not just film buffs or lovers of French films.No one can really deny that after you watch ""Amelie"" you have a smile on your face! Yes, it's a fantasy film, however it shows the little things in life that matter. It's very vivid in it's use of cinematography and visual effects to display a mood or feeling. One of my favorite images of the film is when Amelie, disheartened and disappointed when her would be boyfriend leaves the cafe, dissolves into water and splashes onto the floor of the cafe she works at. This beautifully and poetically captures the feeling most of us would have in a similar situation of a potential love relationship.Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the best films ever,"By far, this is one of the absolute best, most creative and imaginative films ever made. From start to finish you are immersed in the magical world of Amelie, a shy girl whose lack of contact with the real world as a child has left her to create a world of her own. Jean-Pierre Jeunet works magic with this film. The imagery is simple amazing, the story is simple delightful and the story hooks you in from the start to the end. Every shot of the movieisat risk of being repetitive, magic.The film is really a hidden pleasure, I find that I can start it at anytime and watch it, and every time, I cry at the end, yet feel so great. It is simple amazing. Yann Tiersen chops up, what I consider, one of the best musical scores for a movie. It is so fantastic. The entire cast is so extremely well put together, Audrey Tautou was the best choice possible, she was her part one hundred percent. You are left, in love with her after viewing this movie. I found myself desiring to see every movie she has been in after I saw this movie.Even though I saw this movie months ago, for the first time, I still just as excited today, as I was when I first saw it.

The Bafta awards gave this french masterpiece the justice it deserved.,"I am still not satisfied though, because Amelie is the best romantic comedy I have seen in my life, it is even better than most of the well known classic romantic comedies (roman holiday, Annie hall, pretty woman.etc), and it will be mentioned alongside the greatest romantic epics like Casablanca, out of Africa, the English patient and Titanic.Some one tell me why is foreign movies aren't being nominated for the main academy awards categories (acting, directing, picture), and don't tell me Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because that was once in a life time incident, this is totally unfair, Amelie was all about pure brilliance, the cinematography was terrific and it was one of the main factors in the huge success of the movie, the movie focused not only on the life of Amelie but on the people around her as well in a very unique way, it was like an easy puzzle to solve and the positive look for life from the brilliant writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet gave the movie that great feeling that ended up with it to be in IMDb top 250 (while I am writing this it is now ranked 38).The acting was great and that is for Audrey Tautou as a leading actress and Jamel Debbouze as a supporting actor in particular, for me Audrey Tautou deserved an Oscar nomination; some of you may think I am being ridiculous, but isn't she a good actress? Does it always have to be about screaming and crying in heavy tears to earn a nomination, what is wrong with comedy? Didn't Audrey Hepburn win an Oscar for a role just like Audrey Tautou's nearly 50 years ago, well I gotta say back then the academy had a little bit of sense among its members.And have you guys seen the last 15 minutes of the movie; it was 15 minutes from heaven I mean that was the best romance you can get ever.Thank god the Bafta awards gave this masterpiece the justice it deserved, and you members of the academy just keep your statues for your selves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the best comedies out there,"Normally when someone tells me a movie is a ""feel good film"" or is ""heartwarming"" I make sure not to see it.

Others have pointed out that there are parts that are unrealistic. This is true, but is not a fault--the film has magic and magic deserves a creative license.Furthermore, while the film isn't actually laugh-out-loud funny, it will make you laugh on the inside, not to mention make you feel good about life.

The most perfect film ever made,"This has to be my favourite film of all time, and the comment given by a critic which is printed on the front of the DVD case states - ""quite simply its PERFECT"" and i honestly agree. This is what love stories should be about, forget about the romantic comedies that are regurgitated every year, all of them loosely basing themselves on one another. This story of a recluse who falls in love at first sight and through imaginative and wonderful ways she allows him to fall in love with her...without them even meeting. Amelie is the sweet girl who cares of other people's happiness above her own, a trait that maybe more of us should adopt. She sets out to make people happy and set their mind at rest.The interlocking of other characters stories is refreshing such as the gnome which travels the world, a boss of a café with one leg shorter than the other, and an old man with brittle bones, to the painting by Renoir with the girl with the glass that is mirrored to Amelie's life.The cinematography is incredible, the use of colours such as the green and yellow tones add an alien dimension to the film allowing it to look more beautiful than it actually is. This film is a beauty in more ways than one and i cannot praise it enough.

"If it had been only half as cute, I would have liked it twice as much.","This movie tried SO hard to be whimsical, it ultimately turned me off.

Now, I'm a sucker for romance and ""quirkiness"", and, yes, even cute, but this went way over the top. It reminded me of a commercial which desperately pushes every possible emotional button so that you will like it, but you just see right through it, change the channel, and decide you will never buy the product because of that commercial. Now imagine such a commercial going on for almost two hours, and you have this movie. Too bad because the lead actress was beautiful and had a lot of charm, the photography was great, some parts of it did work pretty well, and the concept had had a lot of potential.I had rented the dvd, and didn't bother with the extras on the second disc, because enough was enough.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Whimsical Paris Tale,"Amelie as it is known in the states is a warm sweet tale of a young Parisian girl who decides to practice random acts of kindness with neighbors and strangers. The thought aside, it is Amelie's methods that give the film its joie de vivre as she races around Paris concocting ideas that will bring a little light into the otherwise melancholy, hum-drum existence of co-workers, a concierge, a blind man and a stranger that she reconnects to his past. All does not go according to plan in some instances but that only adds to the infectious frenetic pace that transitions so well between reality and fantasy.As Amelie, waif like Audrey Tautou resembles a young Audrey Hepburn with a more impish demeanor and devious streak. All her acts are not out of kindness and an act of revenge on a fruit seller is comic and ingenious. With a character and look that falls somewhere between Chaplin and Giulietta Masina in La Strada it remains impossible not to fall for her charm.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's assemblage is tour de force. His opening montage of scenes that reveals Amelie's life growing up is skillfully edited and juxtaposed with a narration delivered at a break neck speed that dilutes the gloom with dark humor. His excessive use of wide angle and tracking shots and zooms all seem appropriate to a style that bursts with energy throughout. The music score partners wonderfully with the pace and it gives the film an even more joyful trajectory. He also utilizes the Paris setting well (especially the Sacre Coeur area)without becoming self conscious. Part of the film's attraction lies in the great city but Jeunet never let's it get in the way of his characters.Amelie may be populated by glum, lonely people and topics that deal with loss of opportunity and dreams but Jeunet's audacious style turns it into a celebration of life by providing what Amelie does for those around her.

The Feel-Good factor skyrockets!,"This is the first French film I have seen and all I can say is: If all French films are like this, then I think I'll emigrate to France! This film is hilariously funny and heartbreaking at the same time. It's the kind of film that should be performed on the stage, but could never be. Audrey Tautou is brilliant as she plays Amelie, a girl who spends her life helping others in a neighbourhood in Paris. The film could be seen as fairly 'arty' or 'eccentric' but, in a way, this style helps to create the general atmosphere of the film. The film is arty but not just for the sake of being arty. It actually fits! Its the kind of film that could only be made by the French. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Light and pleasant, puts you in a good mood","This is Jeunet adapted for American taste. It is light, romantic and puts you in a good mood.

Just Read My Review,"There are some films that are pure joy to watch. These are films to be watched, cherished, and loved over and over again. There are certainly films that I may not herald as perfect cinematic achievements, but bring a smile to my face, and warmth to my heart. Amelie is such a film.Jean Piere Jeunet made a series of dark, depressing films before Amelie. They seem to come from some strange crossing of Brazil era Gilliam and HR Giger inspired Alien landscapes. In fact Pierre directed the 4th installment of the Alien franchise, Alien resurrection. Prior to Amelie's huge success he was only known in the US for this picture. Which is a shame, because her previous two films (Delicatessen and City of Lost Children) are real gems.In Amelie, Jeunet has lost his Orwellian vision of the world and has come up top of the world into the clear, blue sky. It is a beautiful, color filled, world that he has come up into. Amelie is alive with color and beauty. It is as if his first three films were harrowing graphic novels, and this one is bright, Technicolor Saturday morning cartoon. It is even a change of story for the director. Where his previous films concerned such meaty subjects as cannibalism, child murder, and those bloody awful Aliens, here is a simple story about making people happy. I'm not sure what caused these changes in the director, but it is a treasure to behold.The story revolves, of course, around Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a shy, quiet, and lonely young women living in the Montmatre section of Paris. Through a random series of events she decides to make people happy. The means in which she manages this, and the heart of the movie, is through devising an extraordinary, and quirky, series of stratagems. For example, in order to bring some excitement into her saddened fathers life, she kidnaps his garden gnome and sends it across the globe with an airline stewardess. Her father sees the gnomes through a series of photographs taken with the gnome standing near national monuments! The entire film is played out with a child like innocence and beauty. Jeunet uses his camera to create images that are light and joyous. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie like a pixie who is bursting inside to tell the worlds funniest joke.Having actually visited Paris before watching this film again I found an additional joy by noticing the little details unknown to me on previous viewings. I have walked the steps of the Sacre Couer, have seen the photograph kiosks in the train station, have seen the top of the Notre Dame. These actions did not bring any further realizations into the film, but brought a little more joy to my viewing. It is like when a film is set in an area you once lived. It may not have anything to do with you, but there is a pleasant joy in knowing where the events take place.The film does not look or feel like the Paris that I visited last Christmas. It is almost a fairy tale version of the city. A city that, as an American, I conjured up with such names as ""City of Light, City of Love."" The reality is a much darker, dirtier sort of place. But in this film everything is lighted beautifully, there is no garbage piling up on the streets, and the metro stations look lovely. Even the people if not always cheerful, are quirky and cute in their unhappiness.There are other films that achieve more in their 2 odd hours of screen time, than Amelie. Though I could site more serious, and relevant films, it would be difficult to find one so full of innocent joy.Like this review?

Superb,"I really liked this movie. Why?! Because the ""warm"" image, because one moment it makes you laugh and the next one makes you cry.

A copy,"Although this film is not terrible, what I did not like about it was that this was clearly a copy of an earlier film, Benny & Joon from 1993. And a shameless one I might add. I like the other movie better. If you have watched it it is so obvious that this one is trying to copy everything, but at the same time trying to hide it. That is quite upsetting. I don't know why many people do not seem to notice this. Maybe the earlier film is pretty unknown, but I can tell you, it is much better. It is just fresh in a way this one isn't. Maybe it is not such a bad idea to revise old ideas and to recycle old movies, but only when you really have something to say and to add to the story. Not this way. I am really disappointed that I watched this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Must-Watch,"9/10 ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a brilliant show. As a student of the French language, I was searching for shows that are easy to understand and interesting to watch. The film ""Amélie"" fits the bill. The words used in the show are fairly simple and the characters speak clearly.The main character, Amélie, is easy to love. She appears eccentric yet intriguing. The narrator's witty, dead-pan lines augment the sense of quirkiness in the film, making it comedic and light-hearted. Watching Amélie grow up strikes a powerful nostalgia in the audience chord; it is at times laughable, at times pitiful and at times shocking.In all, this show has it all - laughter and tears, and downright weirdos. I would recommend it to all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Magic, original and just delicious","This is a vibrant, elaborated film which submerges the viewer in an absurd and hilarious universe.

I'm sat here now watching Amelie again for the first time in a long time and it makes me wish that more movies were made like this, beautiful stories, simplicity, the acting is wondrous the locations have been shot with so much love.

When bad things start happening around her to the people that she cares about, she decides to anonymously intervene and bring them surprise and joy.  Everything about this movie was wonderful.

Amelie - The pearly-bug-eyed-nincompoop-middle aged-thirty something-girl-who,"This movie has absolutely nothing. No story, no watch worthy plot, no characters, no motivations, no progress. It isn't even artistic in any sense. Being an International cinephile, french cinema has been one of the hardest for me to get into, the whole language is not good on my ears, it has no tone, taste or modulation in it. The sounds of the language are so dry and uninteresting that it's hard to stand for a non-speaker of the language. I guess here in the movie maybe the difficulty maybe because they employ too much of a local dialect in the movies.Back to this, the protagonist here is one of the worst in world cinema. I've watched a lot of boring or bad lead characters but none as plain and lackluster as this. The thirty something actress making up cute faces with her bug eyes and pouting mouth is an absolute drab and pain to watch on the screen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Intelligent, visually intense and beautifully filmed, well acted in the best French farcical tradition, this movie rocks! It's fun, fantastic and sexy, but the amazing thing is that it is also very real in its characterizations of human behaviors and, especially, human quirks.

So much fun...,"I've watched this film so many times and have found it just a total pleasure each and every time. There is so much humour in the film and so much feeling for life and how events can touch each and every one of us. Audrey Tatou's glances to the camera are a fine touch that bring the impishly humorous moments of the film to the viewer and lets us share in the delight of what may come. Unfortunately, in my experience too few people have heard of or seen this film...what a shame. Since watching Amelie I've been touting it to all and sundry and will continue doing so for as long as I can...more people need to experience Amelie. The sound track is also something to savour with fine Parisian sounding accordion music that turns out to be rather more... I could go on about cinematography, etc... but the best thing I recommend to do is that you switch off the phone, sit, turn the lights down and get comfortable for one of the finest films made for many years.

Outstanding,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives us a refreshing tale about Amélie Poulain, an ordinary girl until something extraordinary happens to her: she falls in love.

French Beauty,"Amélie Poulin is another one of those stories that depicts the gravity of the human situation, but in no way 'just another one'; this master pies combines a great plot, with enchanting music, hilarious punch lines, marvelous imagery, trancing emotions, and it'll glue you to you're seat, comfortably, right to the last minuet, and after, it'll make you're like sweeter.The motif is pretty simple, it doesn't tackle problems like sex or money, it's dedicated to the little things that make up our humanity so bearable, and yet, this is no romantic joy-ride, it's a conscious journey in which fantasy plays leitmotifs, taking the shape of each situation, carving it slid from sounds and image.Like American Beauty; it tells us that 'there is hope!' not necessarily by love, but but the love of one's own dreams; life doesn't have to be wonderful, but can make it be so by dreaming, and when you dream truly enough, there's no line left between reality and imagination.Amélie is a cute young parisian, who appears so sweet and harmless, but actually capable of anything others wont expect. she's the master of her illusions, while the others are captives of theirs, that what makes her the strongest. the only thing holding her down from becoming also the master of her own 'real' life is fear, that soon she discards realizing, with some help, that 'when you're bones are not made out of glass, you can survive the bumps of life'.If you liked American beauty, Magnolia, and the Royal Tennenbaum; you'll love this, if not; then take my word for it: this is one of the best movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A superbly enjoyable feel good movie.,"Amélie is arguably one of the most original and enjoyable films of the year. You'll find yourself involuntarily smiling throughout. The main character Amélie (played superbly by Audrey Tatou) is such a pleasant character, who you feel yourself really relating to. The support cast were outstanding too, and in the two hours you get to know so many of them so well. With very unusual photography and direction, special effects reminiscent of Ally McBeal, a very sweet story (which can sometimes seem a little bit jumpy), and characters that you genuinely care for Amélie is an absolute must-see. And even if you are put off by subtitles there is enough happening visually to keep anybody interested.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Crush with a strong heart,"It is often rumored among the non-specialist film viewers that European cinema has only those films with a romantic rhythm that contains a set of philosophical ideas, which are represented rigidly and mysteriously without caring about the most important aspect - from their point of view - which is fun and entertaining!This is what makes the viewer take a negative attitude towards some films before they watch them in the first place, on the pretext that the film is spoken in a language other than English - the usual language of Hollywood films - for the viewer, but what do you think, dear reader, if you find a movie even though it is French speaking but it has achieved unprecedented success among viewers around the world, including Arab viewers?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Film of 2001?,"When I told someone in the elevator this morning that I had seen ""Amélie"" over the weekend, she asked, ""Isn't it just pretty much cute girl gets a lot of close ups, does things for people that changes their lives, and then learns some sort of lesson about herself at the end?""  ""Well, yeah,"" I said. ""That's it in a nutshell.""Only the worst kind of cynic could dislike ""Amélie,"" however.  Once again the French have come along and shown us how cinema is done.  ""Amélie"" isn't strikingly original or groundbreaking--I've seen funny asides, quick cut-a-aways to imaginary events or fantasies, exocentric but harmless characters, and even talking photographs in other films.  But ""Amélie"" uses all of the above and more not to show off but to charm its audience.  It never misfires, never takes a wrong step.And Audrey Tautou.  So much has been written about her already that I won't go on about her here.  I do think the comparisons to Audrey Hepburn aren't too far off, though.  Really no actress since Hepburn has been able to steal entire moments of a film with her eyes alone the way Tautou does all through ""Amélie.""Admittedly, I haven't seen too many titles from 2001, but I'd venture to say this has got to be one of the best films if not *the* best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

There were so many things I could relate to with the main character, Amelie, and I never knew that others thought that way about little, everyday things. It's a great story about life, love, and even fate... I think. And I've told a lot of people about it. I know I have taken forever to comment on it, but the fact that she's in The Da Vinci Code sparked me to do so. Anyway, it's a must-see for everyone -- and if you don't like it, oh well.

Visually stunning and humorous film of the unique life of Amelie.,"This was a fabulous film of humor and saddness. Amelie is so unique and misunderstood.

I especially enjoyed the garden gnome's vacation postcards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A beautifully quirky comedy,"Amelie is a splendid movie. It is truly a feel good movie that will charm anyone who watches it. The quirky tale is about a woman who sees unhappy people in her life. She tries to enrich the lives of those seven people to make them as happy as her own. When Amelie finds a man that she loves, she is unsure what to do and is completely clueless. Amelie is a great movie because of its odd sense of humor. The humor is very quirky (to those who have already seen it: the orgasm scene). The humor is somewhat similar to the American TV show ""Pushing Daisies"". Amelie should be able to charm any person and will suck them in within the first fifteen minutes of the movie.

Probably THE feelgood movie of the year.,"Although somewhat of a departure from Jeunet's previous works, ""Amelie"" never fails to amaze and amuse. I have to admit the dark, almost noirish sets and twisted camera angles of ""City of lost children"" and ""Delicatessen"" have set the bar for visuals extremely high. ""Amelie"" didn't get even close to that level, but did Jeunet really want it to?This movie is bright. It is funny. Touching. And just a tad too long. Though it does picture the process of falling in love, calling it a love story would be quite an injustice, it is so much more. From the moment Amelie decides to go on her quest of good doing you can't help but hold your breath only to burst with laughter every few minutes.Maybe I expected something as ground breaking as COLC or as twisted as ""Delicatessen"", I do not know. There seemed something was missing but I'm not yet sure what it was. ""Amelie"" is a fantastic experience, but not a masterpiece.

Loved it! Unique..,"I just finished watching this film. Its one of those that is more a piece of art rather than some typical film out there. At times it makes no sense because it has no definitive purpose, what will happen?But thats what makes it so great. Amelie takes you on an adventure of someones life, maybe someone a bit EXTRA Ordinary. By the end you love it and you don't even know why. Its very blunt about everything that is around, scenery, the people and even the main character is perceived as strange at times; I find that foreign movies have that magic in them. Even though it is in french, I find that you don't even realise because as a viewer you are so entranced in what is going on. Not many films do that these days, or at least that I know of.The use of narration from time to time especially at the beginning give it that unique, quirky feel. As if you are reading a book and as you read the images you conjure, are up on the screen in front of you. Maybe not the right way to explain it but it just has a different vibe as a film and thats why I loved it so much.The music is also wonderful.The thing is that I can't exactly describe the plot, because it wouldn't be the same.

"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT!!","I think this film is totally overrated. it is impressive stylisticaly but does, frankly, not deserve it's sky-high position. We have to belive that there are so many good movies out there and on the 250 list, like Reservoir dogs and Se7en and this does not outconquer these masterpieces! The story is a bit too basic and the whole impression is distorted by the screenplay clichés, borrowed from top movies such as Magnolia.

"Unusual, unique and beautiful!","This has to be the most unusual, unique and beautiful movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend it to everyone! 9/10 stars! I kept hearing rave reviews about this movie, and when I finally had the opportunity to watch it, I took it. The moment it started, I knew it was going to be different. I almost turned it off, though, because it's subtitled, and I'm not very fond of having to read a movie I'm watching. I decided to give it a chance, and I'm so glad I did! The story follows a young girl who was starved of attention from her parents, kept home because of a non-existent illness, and spent the majority of her life as a loner. She develops a vivid imagination, and an odd curiosity about life. Something changes her destiny, and that's where the story twists and turns, becomes unpredictable and somewhat magical.Amelie is an amazing character; full of humor, deviousness, sadness, imagination, compassion, beauty, intelligence, and she also has a keen eye for detail.There are times when this movie reminds me of ""Seinfeld"", in which it's a movie about nothing and everything all at once. It's a masterpiece, full of ups and downs, sharp turns, slow interludes and fast paced action. I can't categorize this movie as just a comedy, romance, drama, action, mystery or suspense ... it's all of the above! It's wickedly wonderful!Oh, to top it all off, I completely forgot that I was reading subtitles after about 15 minutes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"la joie de vie, la sine de vie! (the joy of life, the meaning of life!)","Never has a world looked so wonderous as that of Amelie. If one could ask for such dreaming, let the eyes close upon this dream.I saw this opening weekend in a small arthouse cinema. Though we were all strangers in this small room our laughter did befriend us all. I have never experienced the magnitude of absolute joy shared within an audience; So often your experience is confined to you and your companion/s, but this time I shared it intimately with the whole theatre. Everyone walked out the doors with a smile upon their face and a feeling of humble acknowledgement of an experience!!Who cares for history? Who cares for the future? It a film that is about the now! It's about us! In our lonely, unloving, scary, neurotic world. Amelie is about humanity, it's about love, happiness, beauty and one persons ability to see that beauty and change the world.Everyone should see this film, not just because it's great, but because it's all that should be of our world. It's about the beauty of our world if we would just stop to look at it and let it in. It's impossible to see such beauty in life and be so shy of it in reality. No matter how hard life gets it is all still so wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just like daydreaming!,"Of all the films we've watched in class, my favorite is the film about a girl that'll change our lives, Amelie (The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain). I first heard about this film on my freshman year in high school and I neglected it just like what I've done to European and Asian films (I was so into Hollywood before). Still, I was curious when I saw the movie poster, showing Amelie with a giggly yet mysterious smile. Often I tried to search for a copy of the film but I ended up buying poorly-written, Hollywood teenyboppers. So it was really a good experience when we got to watch this on class.I chose Amelie mainly because its theme is unique for me. I am really fond of films with very colorful characters, those who are not usually found in every society. Amelie might be very typical externally speaking. She's just an ordinary boarder working as a waitress in a ghastly restaurant. We might have seen that kind plenty of times already. But personality-wise, Amelie is unique, being curious on everything she's unaware of and trying to deal with the people around her while being herself all the time. She's childish, she throws stones at ponds to ease with her problems, but quite inspiring. She encountered certain traumatic experiences in her childhood, but still she preserved her colorful personality.As much as I've enjoyed the color of Amelie's personality, I was absolutely entertained with the color used in the cinematography. In the whole film, the yellowish tone of the color was maintained. It was advantageous for me since I am relaxed with this kind of tone, unlike those in films that are too dimly-lit or too bright. I don't know exactly why, but I think it psychologically relaxes my mind (and my poor vision).In general, I liked the film because it doesn't preach, it tends not to change our perspectives in an instant. It just clearly shows us how slowly we could improve our own lives and at the same time, try to improve others in our own little ways. There are some flaws in the film's realism, especially in the animation-side, but I still enjoyed the whole of it. It was just like daydreaming, and then waking up having a dose of heartfelt optimism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Life is all about simple pleasures,"I cant think of any movie which reinstates my faith in Life more than this one. At the end of the day, the happiness in our life is the summation of all the simple pleasures that we experience.Amélie is simple; she has devoted herself to simple pleasures, such as cracking crème brûlée with a teaspoon, going for walks in the Paris sunshine, skipping stones across St. Martin's Canal, trying to guess how many couples in Paris are having an orgasm at one moment (""Fifteen!"", she informs the camera), and letting her imagination roam free. Even the idiosyncrasies of the central character(Amelie) are truly incredible. I wont go into the details of the story.The cinematography is top-notch, the direction is fabulous. All in all a rare film where everything falls in together in perfect harmony. A must-watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A great little piece of French cinema,"This movie is not quirky in a way which feels overly quirky or in a way that just feels pretentious, this is quirky but it's just lovely. Amélie is of course the French film that was very well received when it first appeared in the early 2000's and not just from the audiences of France, no Amélie seemed to take the hearts of people from around the world and managed or still manages it should be said to capture the hearts of many who view it. Although some claim this to be a masterpiece I don't think it is quite at that calibre, nevertheless it is still a great movie and one that is highly recommendable, even to those who wouldn't think they would like it.The story centres around well Amélie of course, Amélie Poulain is just a seemingly normal woman working in a Parisian café and lives by herself, but of course we as the viewer get to see what she is truly like. She is not weird really but she is definitely odd, but Amélie is awesome in this film because she is extremely hard to really dislike or the performance of the lady playing her, Audrey Tautou. The plot see's Amélie do a lot of things actually, she becomes a friend of sorts with a fragile old man, tries to find a young man who caught her eye and messes with her dad, sounds like a very random plot and to be fair, it is.The pacing of the film is frantic and speedy, the lines sometimes come out extremely fast and all credit to the cast for really getting the dialogue out in a way which in funny and entertaining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet directs the movie and really tells quite a little story at the helm, he makes this super strange but really entertaining and although the decision to colour the movie in terms of lenses is quite a peculiar choice, it actually pretty much works in the end. Guillaume Laurant who thought up the story alongside Jeunet then also writes the film and gives Jeunet a great little script to work with, the movie moves along without stopping for too long and that I feel really makes this keep going until the very end.I mentioned Tautou as Amélie and she is very good in the role, she very much makes you feel for the character and she is fun to be around as well. Serge Merlin as the frail man Amélie befriends is good and works well at the beginning of the story because most other characters take a little while to get used to with the random stuff they say and do. Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is pretty good too, when he is in the film the story is usually at quite a fast part and so Kassovitz does a good job of keeping the pace going so that the movie really does flow very nicely indeed.I feel Amélie demands a second watch, I watched this the first time and felt it was pretty basic, but on the second watch I truly opened my eyes and saw this for the great film it is. I couldn't recommend this more to those who haven't already seen it, it's fun, oddly thrilling and just generally very different indeed. So Amélie, a film that showcases how quirky can be done so well but also shows just how good French cinema can be, oh and this movie is stunning to look at by the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
wasn't anybody else really disappointed by this film?,"I have seen the other two films by this director, and I really enjoyed both of them, especially the City of Lost Children, which I thought was one of the best pop sci-fi films since Star Wars.  But this film was a real disappointment, loaded with treachly sentiment and annoying characters, not the least of which is the title character who spends the whole movie tormenting people when it's really none of her business and then the director thinks he can show a wide angle overhead shot of her smiling and we'll suddenly like her.  Well, I don't like her character at all, and the films moments of joy are little more than tired imitations of Truffaut or Goddard.  Let's get Jeunet and Caro back together again so this guy can make some good exciting movies.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amelie,"Hello.I recently watched Amelie's movie and I hasten to share my opinion. I've heard a lot about this movie, now I can make up my own personal opinion. In general, the film is not bad, although at first it seems a little tedious. It was interesting to me, although sometimes I resented why Amelie interfered in the lives of others. Most of all, I liked how she taught an evil fruit and vegetable seller a lesson for humiliating and insulting his partner. The essence of the film is simple and interesting. Everything in this world is interconnected, and you need to try to give at least a little bit of happiness to your loved ones.In the film, Amelie tried to create a chain of happy accidents for people she knows.The film inspires noble deeds, pushes for small feats for loved ones.If you want a miracle, create it for others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Video Clip For An Album,Yann Tiersen!!What an unbelievable music quality..The movie is like a video clip for songs by the way i'm not underestimating the movie of course.You must watch the movie if you did'nt watch it yet you must see the pure emotions which was all over the movie and while your eyes are witnessing a cult your ears will be pleased actually more than pleased with the soundtracks.Think about a great movie and imagine what would you like to hear while you're watching it.That's what Amelie gives to its viewers.A pure enjoyment and a concert at the same time.Completely a different comment on love stories and a proof for fell in love with somebody who is not so beautiful or sexy is not interesting....,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"An engaging, beautiful film","This has to be one of the best foreign films ever! With brilliant acting by Audrey Tautou as Amelie Poulain, and Mathieu Kassovitz as Nico Quincampois (the love interest), this film soars. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie with dignity, and Amelie's eccentricities do not detach the audience from her, rather they endear the audience to her.The script is intelligent, witty and engaging. I found that the audience were taken up by both character and situation: this is a film about love, about self-discovery, about life.Like the title, it's fabulous! The film does not fall into cheap clichés; it maintains a humour throughout. It's a superb slice of life, and Amelie (the character) is so well-meaning, so scatterbrained, so ... well, human, it's a treat! Well deserving of its place in the top 250!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A French film that will appeal to Americans,"This movie hit France like the Sixth Sense or The English Patient hit the United States.  Amelie is light-hearted, romantic, comical, and yet brilliantly intelligent.

Off-Hollywood at its best (9/10),"This movie is a true masterpiece. It is beautifully filmed and the cast is fabulous. True, most of them don't look like they are hot off the Vogue-Cover, but that makes them look so much truer.The story is basically a romantic comedy. Amelie is a woman, who seems to be a typical single of modern life. Her imagination sometimes takes her on ""little trips"". You get to know her and her surroundings. It's just an everyday story with a little twist towards a fairy-tale.The ""magical"" elements never take overhand, or get unbelievable. We all have day-dreams like that sometimes, but in this movie they are an integral part of the whole story. But watch out: because of some adult content (you get to see a bit of naked flash, and bit a few sexual items are discussed) this is NOT a movie for young people.I give this movie 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stunning,"This has become my all-time favourite film... amazing visually, and emotionally. Amelie's fragility and sensitivity are profound. Just gorgeous.

I also happen to be in love with the music from the film.. As a result of this movie, I will now do serious research on both the film's director, as well as Yann Tiersen. Audrey tatou is an amazing breath of fresh air.. Also very versatile.... I saw A Very Long Engagement, and that film was also very beautiful. Class.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
'tis a movie for the holiday seasons!,"A feel good movie is what Amelie is.

There's always that dicey chance that good reviews may not necessarily match the the movie (everybody has their own opinions and how they process them). But this movie did live up to its reputation, I felt. A few odd scenes (some that really make you laugh - the deep guffaw sounding laughs)but there is something nice about a movie that portrays how one's childhood can affect one's own future and finding your destiny. It is refreshing!Definitely, if you are looking for some humour and romance, this is one that I would recommend to add to your viewing list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

As I said earlier, the movie is a hymn to life, and I feel very happy knowing that Jean Pierre Jeunet will be directing Life of Pi, the Yan Martel best seller, the story that will make you believe in God.I saw the movie about five years ago and it still impresses me every time I see it. It is very different from anything else around. The music is touching, the acting is out of this world. It's like being taken to a dream world that can only exist in our hearts and in the imagination of talented people as Jeunet. In case you haven't seen it, i definitely recommend you to.

I spent some time trying to ignore the subtitles so I could practice listening to the French (which, for French learners is quite easy to understand).  Tautou says very little during the film...verbally.  But her face speaks volumes...as does the narrator.

A movie about the details,"When you see Amélie you don´t have to worry about the story, because the most important thing in this movie are the details.  And that is the geniality of this movie, it shows that the films are so much more than a tellingstorys tool.  The films as an artistic medium has a lot of resources to make us feel an aesthetic experience (more than a simple story) and Amélie uses a several amount of them.  Amélie herself tell us that what she likes about going to watch a movie is to see the details that nobody else see.The movie begun just as a very beautiful film and at the end you find that is much more than this.  From this central idea the movie starts telling us some apparently unlinked events and then introduce each character telling us details about its life like what it likes and what it hates. Make a character that repeat every year the same picture fixing each time a new detail, to the point that now he is trying to catch in a perfect way the eyes of a girl.  The movie has some majestic scenes (Amélie with an imaginary friend, the suicidal fish, the talking photos, she becoming a tear, etc).   With out those moments the movie wouldn´t be the same, neither would be a good movie.Another important point to think about is how the TV plays as her consciousness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Very Clever,"Was pleasantly surprised by the clever narration and dialogue. The pace was a bit a slow toward the latter half of the movie. The climax didn't seem like much of a climax, but I appreciated the lack of extravagance of the ending. It fit the introverted vibe of the entire movie.I loved the way each character was developed. Every character seemed very important, even if the character did not advance the plot. Some characters had zero impact on the plot, but they were just so god damn funny.Audrey Tautou's acting was stunning. That smile is perfect. The way she looks down while smiling is unsettling and warming at the same time.

She does the humane things of helping people, by making a pinter find his object, by making a two people fall in love, by making a man find his mysterious photo face. But it is her and her only love which she finds make her joy eternal.The story goes a long way from going into her brain and finding out what kind of questions she has to her delusions, her sad childhood and her fantasies. This film is ranked as one of the finest French Cinemas to come in last decade or so, and I will go with it for it's full of whimsical moments and never a frame is mundane.I have sen this film thrice and what I have always fallen in love each time is with the composition of the scenes and the cinematography, I say this is sheer poetry. That is, the whole film is as fluid as a beautiful poem is being recited, just that the language is French, we need the subtitles to help us through. I wish I learnt French to avoid reading those subtitles.Audrey Tautou is refreshing, her every nuance indeed is beautiful and I have loved her over and over again whenever I see this piece of art. The music by Yann Tiersen is delightful and accompanies perfectly with the stunning visuals.Above all, if I must thank anyone, then it's the director Jean Pierre Jeunet who made a good tale written by Guillaume Laurant into a great one. Of course, the director was helped a great deal by the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel who created a perfect Paris.Oh, did I mention that the film was shot in Paris, yes indeed Paris is shown and we see a very intrinsic and an intimate Paris that is devoid of the famous monuments it has and comprised of the simple homes and lanes most tourists might be missing. Yet, all is beautiful and mostly, you will love it.Oh, I used the word love many a time so this is not a film that is merely likable, it's a delightful tale that is loved by many and I am happy to be one among it's lovers.A 5/5 for a great loving film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It helps to know that someone is still out there who can still characters who are not ""realistic"", but unique, and who get a life of their own.

One of her most appealing kindnesses brings puzzlement and then joy to her own lonely father. Audrey Tautou (Amelie) is a lovely actress with enormous brown eyes.  The Montmartre area of Paris is lovely, bathed in a golden glow.  The supporting cast is an interesting collection of folks, none of whom is as lovely as Amelie herself.  There is an impishness to much of her good works, especially involving a heartless greengrocer who mistreats his assitant.

"""THERE IS NO HELL, THERE'S ONLY FRANCE.""","Frank Zappa had it just about right with that above quote, and if you're not laughing you've obviously never been to the REAL France (and stepped in some of the ever-present dog-doo on the sidewalks over there, or dealt with some of the  'rude, snobbish & bizarrely hostile behavior' that seems as natural as breathing air to more than a few people over there), or had blinders on when you did go there, inspired by the FANTASY Paris of charming little virtuoso films like ""Amelie.""Now, in all fairness to the film, it does contain some very intense and hilarious satire in its first half (though of the much-too-exaggerated 'over-the-top' semi-fantasy kind) & is obviously the work of a CINEMATIC virtuoso (which does not imply Jeunet is an ARTISTIC virtuoso also, it only means the guy is a complete master of the TECHNICAL possibilities of the medium), but the splitting of the film between satire & irreverence on the one hand & the most cliched of schmaltzified romances on the other, seriously hurts the film's effectiveness as a possibly DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT piece of ART-ifact. It starts off majestically & ends up as CHARMING-SATIRE-MINUS-FLUFF, unlike ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" by the Coen Brothers, which starts off majestically dark & ends an awe-inspiring confirmation of the maxim behind every great 'realist' film: Pascal's famous ""Man's greatness is so obvious it can even be deduced from his wretchedness."" Now, I mention the Coens' film because it is the only film I've seen this year with CINEMATOGRAPHY (courtesy of Mr. Roger Deakins) matching or maybe even surpassing the INSANELY MAGNIFICENT level of the one in display in shot after shot in ""Amelie"" by BRUNO DELBONNEL. I was truly knocked out of my seat by the unerring beauty of the angles used & the antique-look-contrasting-with-modern colors within the shots. I also mention the Coens, because Jeunet is making films now that are sort of ""Raising-Arizonaish"" in their comic-book-imposed-on-reality extravagant, comic style, but will hopefully achieve the maturity of the Coens, in his deeper outlook to turn out something like ""The Man Who Wasn't There.""Getting down to more specifics, ""Amelie"" reminded me of Louis Malle's classic 1960 film ""Zazie Dans Le Metro,"" which also is split down the middle, magnificent for the first half, BORING & cliched in the second. However, Catherine Demongeot (who, bizarrely enough, Nabokov once said would've been the PERFECT LOLITA had he been allowed to pick one young enough to add the proper amount of repulsion to Kubrick's film) in ""Zazie"" is a 10 year old girl, & much less interesting to red-blooded heterosexual hairy-chested men (such as yours truly) than the supercute, 'BIG SHOED' (above as we;; as below), starlet of Jeunet's film: Audrey Tautou. On one level, the film is a love affair between Jeunet's camera & Tautou, in the time honored tradtion of Sternberg/Dietrich, Powell/Kerr, Hitchcock/Hedren, Godard/Karina, De Palma/Nancy Allen, etc., the angles he uses, the way he frames her, the endless close-ups, all of these things are the work of an artist in love with his subject (whether there's a 'love relatonship' in 'real life' is beside the point), and all the audience is thankful for it.On another level (again reminding me of ""Zazie""), the film takes you on quite a TURBOCHARGED, non-cliched 'tour' of picturesque areas of Paris, & is maybe the best advertising the old 'city of Romance' has had for years. It takes the eyes & sensibilities of masters like Jeunet & Delbonnel to get these shots with just the proper amount of irreverence incoroporated (by what they choose to show and omit), & then ruin them by overplaying sappy annoying accordion music for way too long towards the latter, weaker third of the flick.All in all, 3 out of 5 stars or a 7 on a scale of 10, which means DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED, but like another technically dazzling, relatively popular French film before it Patrice Leconte's ""The Girl on the Bridge,"" a little too short on substance and TRUE ROMANCE (as opposed to the cliched, NON-EXISTENT kind displayed in the film; check out Renoir's ""Picnic on the Grass"" or Jacques Becker's ""Antoine et Antoinette"" if you want to see a similarly whimsical, semi-fantasy film nevertheless displaying the EXISTENT KIND OF 'ROMANCE' IN INNER SENSIBILITY if not in actual, same-story realistic possibility) to give the 'HELL OF FRANCE' its proper artistic due, and in consequence become as great as let's say Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player."" And did I mention that a sizeable portion of the film is, among other things, a dead-on satire of Hitchcock's overrated classic ""Rear Window""?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Charming,"Visually stunning, this film is crafted by masters. Acting, directing, cinematography, production design to every other little detail has been brilliantly accomplished. A sweet story, simply and effectively told. You won't find car chases here and big explosions. What you will find is simply the beauty of seeing around you as you find your own values and your soul. The star of the film is magical. She has a remarkable energy that will keep you glued to screen. She is so beautiful on so many levels. She certainly accomplished her tasks in this film like those days of great classic stars might have. I can't wait to see what comes next from this very talented group of filmmakers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A film that no sentient creature could possibly dislike.,"French cinema often leaves me underwhelmed, so I was pleasantly shocked by ""Amelie"". Rarely, if ever, has a film so perfectly captured the spirit of a unique character and thoroughly infected its viewers with her charm. But what really caught me off-guard was the film's wonderful sense of humor. Amelie is so many light years more romantic, funny, and creative than Hollywood's recent so-called ""romantic comedies"", that the makers of such movies should be forced to quit their professions, move to Uzbekistan, and take up goat-herding.The only meaningful comparison is to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", but ""Amelie"" is significantly more entertaining. Much like a certain other actress named Audrey, Ms. Tautou is absolutely charming. Indeed, the entire cast is stellar, breathing a real vitality into the troop of oddball characters that inhabit Amelie's world. Jean-Pierre Jeunet takes obvious delight in capturing the quirks and oddities of life, adding surprising depth to characters and events that might otherwise feel clichéd.I've heard many people say that they don't like to watch films with subtitles. I say that anyone who can read at a high school level, and possesses a soul, should enjoy ""Amelie"". You'll love it.If nothing else, you will never look at gnomes the same way again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Amelie in her beautiful journey""","This movie created its own unique universe, from the plot, characters, and the thoughts in this movie, and the way this movie explains Amelie journey and her struggling at a young age, from that she created her universe to be happy with it far away from sadness, a world full of happiness. And trying to help the poor and the lonely once and the beloved ones. I like that she managed to bring her universe into reality and explore the love that everyone is talking about, but her fears sometimes take advantage of her trying to stop her from moving forward, and imaging something bad in the future will happen, however there are good people in this universe will be with you and help you every time and everywhere. That what Amelie trying to do, encouraging people to Spread joy, be a dreamer always find your happiness. This movie is so touching, heartwarming, and emotional.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A funny, glorious, heartwarming film","This film is definitely one that appears on my list of favorite movies. each tiny detail was perfectly mastered. It is beautifully filmed, the script witty and charming, the acting perfect, and the design fits the mood of the film completely. I have NO IDEA what kind of a person whose heart this movie could not touch. It is about an innocent, shy Parisian girl who finds happiness in helping people, when she really must learn to help herself. What is not to love about the characters, and heartwarming humor who so determine this film? It gives a soft and subtle view of life and love. The color compliments it's charming view of Paris, and the zany characters who reside there. It is clear to me why this movie has been such a success, and has inspired so many people. I recommend Amélie to anyone willing to be truly amazed by such a light, funny view of the way we live our lives, and the many characters we meet along the way. WATCH THIS FILM!! It is definitely not to be missed",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing,"I can honestly say this... When I first watched this in the early 2000s, I was shook. Totally. I just sat there..... And I wanted to be a better person. That's the only time that a movie has affected me like this in my almost-50 (now) years on this planet.I think that people who say that it's too whimsical need a hug.I think that a person who helps other people in an effort to fill a hole in their own life is usomething that we can all relate to nowadays.The cinematography is stunning. That shot of her skipping rocks on the levee (?) is phenomenal. The music is exquisite. Even my kid plays it on the piano.All in all, this is a lovely, inspiring movie that leaves its mark on you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful,"This film is like savouring a sweet mango for two hours. It is a shot of joy, a brief experience of love, that fades soon after you leave the cinema. Is it a great film? No. It is, however, the ultimate in feel-good films, since, for once, it actually does make you feel good. No, Wonderful, if only for a short while. Still, when the feeling fades, you can always see it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"""Amelie"" is a story about a girl named Amelie who learns to help other people and herself.","To me, Amelie is a heroine. Imperfect, Amelie learns to deal with what life throws at her. She is diagnosed, by her father, with some problems in her body. (SPOILER!) More specifically, she is diagnosed with heart problems. (END OF SPOILER) She ends up living only with her father. By then, she decides to leave and to start her own place. Also, even though she manages to help many people, she gets to a point that she has trouble trying to help herself, and she needs help from other people.Amelie's adventures keep her on her feet, as she begins to understand the world and the people around her. She opens up to new possibilities, optimism, if you will. And by performing the great task of a dynamic character, Audrey Tatou manages to send intricate messages to the viewer. Amelie becomes a role model and an example of someone who cares more about other people than herself, and I think that this is one of Mrs. Tatou's achievements. Besides Amelie, every other actor does an almost perfect job of becoming their character, which goes beyond just staying in character. As I've seen in many other films or movies, actors that do mostly comedies, have trouble being serious or even professional in action or adventure movies. This is also why the actors for this movie are so good, they are in a movie with mixed feelings and genres.This film is romantic, a comedy, and an adventure all at a time, which makes it so simple for actors as great as these to send a message to the viewer. Joseph the stalker shows us how important it is to not get distracted from the world around us, as well as Georgette. Nino Quincampoix teaches us that we should never give up at anything. He works at a sex shop and lives a life without knowing that his true love, as we might call Amelie, is near to meeting him. And finally, Amelie tells us to be ourselves. If it is helping people that shows our inner selves, then we should be ourselves. If it is video games, technology, movies, and series what make us who we are – may I say who I am - then we should go ahead and be who we are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An adorable and wholesome film!,"Amélie (2001) follows a young woman who finds a hobby in helping people achieve happiness, however when she comes across a handsome stranger, she has to take her own happiness into her hands. This was a really gorgeous movie that warmed my heart. It was told with amazing narrative and pacing, with brilliant writing. It was truly an iconic piece of filmmaking and it's understandable as to how it's become a cult classic.The film had a beautiful and over-saturated tint that really added to the cinematography! I absolutely loved the colour palettes and it was perfectly shot, the camerawork was impressive. I particularly loved the fast zooms into characters' faces.The opening narration was upbeat and really gave us a feel for the characters, which all were very likeable and quirky. The acting was really good and everyone did a great job and the casting of young Amélie was brilliant. The romance was adorable and melted my heart, and the dialogue was witty and pretty funny! The fourth wall breaks were great and really added to the humour.The music used was nice and upbeat, very fitting to the tone of the film. The score was romantic and recognisable and helped capture the audience's attention well.Something I really liked about this movie was that it had a really good and touching message, with strong themes of kindness and love. This made the film all the more wholesome and loveable.Lastly, the film had a super upbeat tone and was incredibly fun and lighthearted. It really reminded me of Wes Anderson's films! I also liked how the movie had strangely high tension. I was so desperate for Nino and Amélie to get together!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR!,"Amelie was stunning. What a way for me to start 2002. I've never walked out of a theater so satisfied, with the minor yearning to walk right back in. I originally wanted to see this movie so I could get my hair cut like Amelie's and that I had heard Audrey Tautou was the next other Audrey. Little did I know this film would touch me in such a way that I would be affected days after. The beauty of Amelie and all of Montamarte is shoved at you in quick flashing seconds or in slow motion doses that leave your heart racing. I'm struggling here trying to come up with a description of how wonderful this film is and all I can say is that you MUST see it. It's one of the most kind-hearted, funny, beautiful movies I've seen in my lifetime (granted it's hardly 18 years, but that's pretty good). I've recommended this to everyone I know and now to all of you. See this movie, you won't be disappointed. Even if you don't like reading subtitles, just watching it you feel practically everything and are still able to fall in love with Tautou's grand performance of Amelie of Montamarte.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

MAGICAL & HEARTWARMING MOVIE,"THIS IS A PURE CINEMATIC MAGIC, a film that sweeps you off your feet and drops you into a dreamlike Paris where every corner holds a little bit of wonder.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet crafts a world so full of color and whimsy that you feel like you're walking through a beautiful daydream, where even the smallest moments are filled with delight.Audrey Tautou is utterly captivating as Amélie, giving life to a character who is as relatable as she is extraordinary. Her quiet determination to spread happiness, despite her own loneliness, is both touching and inspiring. The playful cinematography, paired with Yann Tiersen's enchanting score, adds an extra layer of magic to the experience.

I understand some people won't get it, find it smaltzy but all I can say is ii am glad I. Not one of those people. To give this film a one is just churlish and trying to be clever, I personally can't stand Ed Sheeran or Coldplay but I can recognise they are good, I just don't like them.

Perfect,"Is there anything about this movie that can get a note less than the highest!? So, naturally, this gets 10 from me!I like the story. I guess anyone who is romantic and who believes in eternal love or love at first sight or soulmates or similar love affairs things will give this movie a 10!Audrey is brilliant in the role. She is so convincing that no wonder she will always be remembered and known as Amelie. All other actors are great too and the mini society we get to know from the caffe and the building is appealing.Paris scenes... Who can not fall in love with the city of lights? Who can not wish to go there once or return? And who can not wish for a love like that to happen in Paris?Renoir painting... I think that Renoir was chosen very carefully because I do not think that there is a painter ( was) who was as 'sweet' in his themes as Renoir. So, it is natural that such a painter fits perfectly into the sweet film.Soundtrack ... It is one of the best soundtracks I know when it comes to mostly music only arrangements. And the title music/song has become somewhat of a signature song for France and French culture.So... Great love in a great city. Beautiful music that adds to beautiful scenes. Perfect movie is here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fabulous? Absolutely!,"From French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes a film with the most original and sparkling look I've seen in a decade. Using camera angles and colored filters we've come to associate with TV commercials -- the good ones -- Jeunet turns this romantic adventure of a young Parisian who's afraid of intimacy into a visual whirlwind. His film-making technique owes much of its inspiration to those small orbs of water we shake to see the snowfall, the flashing open-shut action of a painted Spanish fan, and the zig-zag movement of the skateboarder.  My favorite visual trick is the talking passport-size photos, not one, but four, images of a Spanish gent who dispenses advice to the love-lorn hero, brilliantly played by the endearing Matthieu Kassovitz.The images and scenes pass with a speed the dazzles, as the young heroine Amélie pursues her many projects, whose goal is to improve the lives of ordinary Parisians who populate her life. Her imagination works overtime, even as she herself becomes the target of another form of improvement -- falling in love. The film has relatively little dialog; verbal cohesion comes at crucial points from a slightly authoritative voice-over. The wonder of the film is that it tells it story and holds us viewers primarily through visual means, as well as the enchanting performance of Audrey Tauton in the title role.  And then there is that music, so charming it makes you sit through the credits that roll at the end. And finally you sit in the theater, lit again and reeking with the reality of spilled popcorn, and you wonder if you can't just sit there, and watch this wondrous escapade all over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My favorite. Of all time.,"This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. No movie has ever been so brilliantly simple, beautiful, and mood altering, yet non-taxing all at the same time. It's beautiful in composition, humorous on a uncomplicated level and all around divine. The plot is intriguing, the characters are fantastic, the music is absolutely ideal for the film, and it's just the ultimate perfect movie for any situation.I'm not one of those snobby, liberal foreign-film loving people who'll sit down and watch any pile of crap just because it's subtitled, either. (Just so you know.) I also never use cliché's like ""it will change you"", but I have to say, there will definitely be a little more optimism to even the most ruthless pessimist. I also hate to call it a ""feel-good movie"" or a ""romantic comedy"" (I hate romance films) but it technically constitutes as both, even though the romance part is a byproduct of the plot (thank god).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
