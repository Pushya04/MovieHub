*A Thought-Provoking Conclusion to the Matrix Trilogy*,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" wraps up the epic saga that began with the groundbreaking ""The Matrix"" and continued with ""The Matrix Reloaded."" While it received a mixed reception upon its release, the film offers a visually stunning and philosophically rich conclusion that will resonate with fans of the series.One of the film's most significant strengths is its ambitious exploration of themes such as free will, destiny, and the struggle between man and machine. The narrative takes bold leaps, diving deeper into the complexities of the Matrix universe, and raises intriguing questions that challenge the viewer's perception of reality.Visually, ""Revolutions"" is nothing short of spectacular. The action sequences, particularly the climactic battle in Zion and the epic showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, showcase groundbreaking special effects and impressive choreography. The film pushes the boundaries of what action cinema can achieve, making it a visual feast.The pacing can be inconsistent, and some viewers may find parts of the plot convoluted or difficult to follow. The dialogue, while profound at times, can also feel heavy-handed, especially in moments that require a more subtle touch.""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a fitting culmination of a beloved trilogy. Although it may not reach the heights of its predecessor, it successfully encapsulates the series' core themes and delivers a thought-provoking narrative. For fans of the trilogy, it's a film worth revisiting, as it invites discussion and contemplation long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still trying to absorb what I've seen,"Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film.  Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it.  Viewed that way I think it succeeded.  I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed.  The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see.  I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here.  After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due.  It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD).  I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finding Neo,"'The Matrix Revolutions' is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were 'The Matrix' and 'The Matrix Reloaded.' In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.Of the three films, 'Revolutions' is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting. What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities. The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for 'Revolutions,' which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme. In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled 'Finding Neo'). The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by. Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from 'Revolutions' - which we did from the two previous 'Matrix' films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which 'Revolutions' very nearly is. Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better They Had Stuck To One Super Matrix Film,"I found this better than the second Matrix film (""Reloaded"") but not anywhere as intriguing as the first film. Perhaps they shouldn't have made ANY sequels.Once again you have the same problems: too much verbiage that you can't make sense of, and too much violence. Regarding all the techno-talk, what good is it if you audience doesn't understand what's going on and are lost most of the time?After awhile, frankly, especially with the unlikable lead characters, I didn't care what happened. As I said in the second movie's review, they should have made just one tremendous Matrix movie, even if it were an hour longer. The sequels did nothing to enhance the legacy of that film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It makes me mad...,"...that this film is not getting the credit it deserves. It is in my opinion one of the most underrated films of all time along with The Matrix Reloaded. Revolutions is undoubtedly different from the previous films both in general and in terms of tone but why is that necessarily a bad thing? I won't be so arrogant as to say that the people who don't like this film are unintelligent. Whether or not people like a film or not is a subjective matter but I can't help feeling that the people who dislike (or even hate) this film are missing something because Revolutions is an intelligent, entertaining, beautiful, sad and moving picture.The acting of all three films have been a mixed bag and although I usually join in the bashing of Keanu Reeves I find him strangely fitting for the part of Neo. His voice is not the perfect voice due to its monotonous tone but his body language is very good and sometimes even great and that is the case in Revolutions as well. Carrie-Anne Moss plays her character like she did in film two and that is neither particularly good or bad but a decent performance. Laurence Fishbourne's character has been reduced somewhat for the final part of the series but I found that the lines he did have were delivered with conviction and experience. As most people know Gloria Foster died before finishing her scenes for Revolutions and thus a different actress was cast to take over. The choice fell on Mary Alice and while she is no where near as good as Foster she is decent enough. Ian Bliss gets a chance to show his worth in the third film and personally I found his scenes to be among the most interesting of the film and his uncanny imitation of Weaving was spot on. Most of the secondary cast from Reloaded returns in their parts in Revolutions and they all do decent jobs with their characters. Harry J. Lennix (Lock) improved his character tremendously in spite of limited screen time. Hugo Weaving still provides the best acting in the film and steals every one of his regrettably limited number of scenes. He is probably my all time favorite screen bad guy. He manages to show the change in his character remarkably well considering how limited his screen time is. Agent Smith exhibits an increasing amount of human traits including anger, hatred, jealousy and even a sly sense of humor. This change happens to mirror Neo's growing understanding of the machines. Neo and Smith are linked in that way as well.The effects are of course extraordinary which was to be expected after the stellar effects in the second film. Although there weren't as many scenes inside The Matrix this time around I still found the effects of the ""real"" world to be awe inspiring at the least and the battle for Zion was an incredible display of special effects. Of course the directors never lost sight of the people involved in the battle making it more tense had it only been effects. The climactic battle between Neo and Smith is quite simply stunning. It takes roughly 15 minutes and I for one hardly breathed in those 15 minutes. All three Matrix films have been inspired by Japanese animé comics and that is very visible in the final battle as one can't help but think of Dragonball for instance. The action in that particular scene is frighteningly well done and I got the chills when I watched it in the cinema. Very well done.The story is darker in this film than in either of the previous films but that is to be expected as the first film was about birth and the second about life. Obviously that means that the third is about the inevitable end that must come to us all: Death. This does that the tone of the film becomes much darker and I felt that was good. This did that the film distanced itself from the previous films in the series and rather than become another rerun the film becomes its own entirely and that is both its weakness and its strength. I think it is its strength as it increases the originality of the film but apparently a lot of people didn't like the interpretation that the third film represents as is clear from the bashing the film has gotten from audiences and critics alike. The film does still have great symbolic value and you can interpret the film in a great number of ways like the previous films. For me this improves the film(s) greatly as you can watch it again and again and still find new things that will renew your interest.Sadly I cannot make you love this film as much as I do because that would defeat the purpose of the film which is to make people think for themselves. My conclusion about Revolutions is that you will either love or you will hate it but in my opinion Revolutions is almost as good as the first one and one of the best films I have ever seen.9/10 - On my top 10 of best films.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An amazing third entry to end the Matrix Trilogy!,"The Matrix Revolutions (2003) is very underrated trilogy of the mythology to understand. I know for a lot of people is not that good and it is terrible movie to watch. The first time I watch it, I couldn't finish it because I did not understand it and I felt bored with the movie. The second time I kept watching I just enjoyed the movie and I wanted to know more, what will happen next. I think the movie end perfectly the trilogy, tough it did lack on a story and on the action, there very barely in it, that it was in the original and the second movie. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies amd I love this movie to death I don't care what anyone says.The movie it self's focus more on the humans and the battles against the machines on the planet Zion, more than they are in the phone line of Matrix. I think this was a brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy. If you didn't understand what the matrix was by the end of the film, then you're never going to get it!Many viewers preferred Revolutions to Reloaded, thinking it was a simpler, more straight-ahead action movie. Though it may have appeared that way, nothing could be further from the truth. Revolutions was a mind-blowing layered ending that honored and respected the plot threads and themes introduced in the first two movies. The character arcs were satisfying and true to the characters introduced in The Matrix. The creators continued to challenge our understanding of the Matrix and its purpose, avoiding the temptation to serve us a bunch of ""their"" answers on a platter. That, to us, would have been a sellout of the vision they've been constructing, and wouldn't have been fair to us. Nor would it have been true to the spirit of the previous movies - they've never told us what things meant, they've only shown us the door.Everything that has a beginning has an end. In this explosive final chapter of the Matrix trilogy, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity battle to defend Zion, the last real-world city, against the onslaught of the machines that have enslaved the human race. And, now as Neo learns more about his heroic powers--including the ability to see the codes of things and the people, he faces the consequences of the choice made in The Matrix Reloaded. For Neo, that means going where no human has dared - into the heart of Machine City and into a cataclysmic showdown with the exponentially more powerful renegade program Smith. The revolution is now: The Matrix Revolutions.I wish they made more films about the Matrix. The fighting, story and the conspiracy theories that emerged from these movies created a new world for millions of people out there. Some of the conspiracy theories even created a new ""religion"", the CGI was at the time freaking impressive, the fighting in slow-mo were even more epic and the story itself captured a lot of hearts. Just saying to all who think this movie (and/or the first two) sucked balls,- you are a minority. Movie is great, second one being the best in the trilogy. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy because it ends the story and answers what happened with Neo (Keanu Reeves), he saved Whole planet and defeat Smith (Hugo Weaving) on the end of the movie. This movie may not be the best in storyline, but hell it knows how to make action! That end fight and emotional ending leaving behind a plot for sequel ...Second really expanded the meaning of matrix and the whole idea so I don't understand the hate.There is a lot of memorable moments the Smith vs Neo climax rain scene is one of my favorite movies scenes of all time. Anyway I love this movie it is not good as the greatest or the best movie or that good, but it is still a worthy sequel to watch and a good end to the trilogy. It is one of my personal Keanue Reeves favorite movies and I love this movie to death. I am giving this 9/10 and only because one of the characters dies in this movie not telling which one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It would have made more sense had they stopped with the first,"So the problem about the Matrix trilogy is this: it totally changes its objectives between the end of the 1st movie and the beginning of the 2nd. In the end of the first, it seemed like they were going to get rid of the matrix and free everyone. In the 2nd and 3rd, it seemed like they were trying to save Zion and that the matrix was just some unimportant story line.The first movie: amazing. Second movie: not at all great, but better than what I had been hearing. Third movie: As bad as I heard and worse.One person said upon seeing it right after its release: ""It left more questions than it answered."" Can anyone say UNDERSTATEMENT? NOTHING makes sense at the end of this movie. I'm not even going to bother to try to explain it, because I can't. The climaxes (with Neo & Trinity, and with Zion) were both SEVERE anticlimaxes. The fight at the end made no sense. A good hour of the movie (NOT including the scenes with Neo & Trinity spliced in between) was taken up by the battle for Zion. Nothing happens. Sentinel after Sentinel pours from the sky/roof/whateverthing and attacks the people, and they're killed over and over (and over). It's the exact same. . . the ENTIRE time! At least movie 2 made each action scene different, even if they weren't as good as #1. Oh, and the CG effects were so rampant that it clogged the screen. You didn't know where to look, and it turned out messy, not breathtaking.Messy. That's the perfect word to describe the end of this disappointing movie. Everything would have made MORE sense, even with the unresolved plot lines, had they stopped at Matrix #1 and left us hanging. ""Quit while you're ahead,"" the old saying goes. If only the Wachowski Brothers had.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually impressive but bloated and unwieldy,"As the city of Zion fortifies itself for defence against the influx of sentinels, the two remaining ships of the fleet prepare to return to the city.  Neo lies in a coma with the sole survivor of the attack on the fleet, however his brain patterns show that he is lost somewhere within the matrix. Trinty and Morpheus go to rescue him and return him to the real world. Back in the real world, Zion is under attack from the sentinels, Neo decides that he must travel into the machine city and confront the creator of the matrix while Niobe pilots the remaining ship back to Zion to take on the sentinels.I love the original Matrix, but can't help feel that the 2 overblown, over serious sequels have damaged it.  This film works a little better than the second sequel but not by much.  Where Reloaded left us with unanswered questions, Revolutions offers us the answers.  Sadly the ""answers"" just left me confused and bewildered.  I didn't feel like the film even tried to explain what was going on, and the ending came about far too suddenly and with little explanation.  I know that a film is good if it leaves you thinking about things and I could sort of guess that Neo might have become some sort of programme etc at the end, but I still felt that the film should have helped me out even a little bit!The plot is very heavy going and it lacks the light imagination evident in the first film.  This really sucks the fun out of the film and makes it hard work - I have nothing against it being thought provoking and requiring thought, but it all seemed very laboured to me.  The opening hour is quite hard work and the whole ""train station"" thing is never really explained and just seems designed to fill time or something.  The action all looks great - the attack on Zion is visually very impressive and is quite exciting. However some fight scenes are so overblown that they failed to inspire.  The shootout in the check room of the club is simply a tired retread of the groundbreaking lobby shootout but it is the final fight with Smith that shows what I mean.  Neo's showdown with Smith in the first film was great fun and very exciting.  Here (and in Reloaded) it is an excess of special effects, horribly overblown - visually impressive but not enjoyable.The film seems to have taken on the mantel of ""meaningful epic"" where once it was a clever film with no assumptions.  Listen to the music - that's where the clue is.  Instead of the rock mix from the first film it has taken on big sweeping classical pieces that it scatters around liberally to try and give the film an epic feel that it doesn't deserve.  It is still worth seeing as it finishes the trilogy but it is hard work at times.  The acting continues the curse of Reloaded in that everyone thinks they are reading Shakespeare and gives their performance as if they were speaking words direct from God.  Even Weaving's Smith is a little too full of himself this time.  The dialogue is pretty bad as before - full of clichés and over wordy speeches of grandeur, it just gets tiresome before it gets engaging.In the first film we were told no one can be told what the matrix is, we must see it for ourselves.  We were then taken on a journey (with Neo), led by Morpheus into this world that was explained as we went.  Here we are simply dumped in the middle of an impenetrable plot and basically left to work things out for ourselves with little or no help.  Attempts to have characters like the Architect or the Oracle explain things are simply clunky and don't work at all. I'm not adverse to thinking, but the more I think about the film as a series the more i see unanswered holes.  I was hoping that Revolutions would tie things up from Reloaded and actually serve to make part 2 work better, but it didn't.  It took some positive steps but really the same weaknesses just continue.Overall I was glad I saw it to finish the story, and visually it had some very impressive moments.  However the feeling was of a film with no controls, spiralling out of control - with narrative flow lost behind half ideas and spiritual nonsense.  It is over indulgent, bloated and full of a sense of it's own importance - an importance it simply does not have and should not be wearing on it's sleeve.  The Wachowski's created a fascinating universe but, as they opened it out, their egos have inflated the material and their inability to control and tell such a massive story has shown and the last 2 films have really suffered as a result.  Worth watching for what it attempts to do, but ultimately very frustrating for what it actually delivers and, more importantly, what it fails totally to do.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Revolutions"" provides substantial conclusion.","""Wait. I've seen this. I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something. I say, ""Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."" - Agent SmithPicking up where ""The Matrix Reloaded"" left off, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" has a big task ahead of itself. While attempting to wrap up looses ends from the previous installments, it also has to provide closure on the overall saga as well as live up to the precedents set before it.Was ""Revolutions"" a disappointment? Well, financially it performed much weaker than its big brother in ""Reloaded"" but otherwise, the answer remains a resounding ""no."" In fact, ""Revolutions"" slightly succeeds at besting the second film, as well as wrapping up the trilogy in a nice and neat manner.Unlike ""Reloaded,"" the third installment carries more emotional weight rather than show off its visual marvels. There are two big action scenes that make up about a third of the film. One is a breath-taking invasion of Zion by the sentinels which is so good that you almost forget that we haven't seen our two main characters for the better part of a half-hour. The other, the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, is nothing short of epic. Thousands of Smith's clones watch in the streets and the buildings as the two duke it out mano a mano in the rainy streets of The Matrix. These two scenes best what was done in ""Reloaded"" and push the plot forward all the better, all the way to its inevitable conclusion.Sure, the film's loaded with clichés and yes, it still has an overall feel and tone similar to ""Reloaded"" that doesn't sit well with the original film (Powerade, anyone?), but it's as close to a perfect closing chapter in the trilogy as we were ever going to get. It's got a grand feeling. It's both sentimental and definitive. There are very few franchises in Hollywood that end in a way that ensures there will be no more sequels to water down the formula, and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" ends in such a way that not only do you feel satisfied, but that simply, there is nothing left to be done. The Wachowski Brothers close out their trilogy with a bang, slightly redeeming itself while providing appropriate closure.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Movie Which Is Underrated,"I'm watching Revolutions this time again in 2012, and now being almost 8-9 years older, i understood and liked the movie which back there in 2003 i felt disappointed.This movie is much better than the piece of crap movies we get to see nowadays (I mean in the science fiction category). To those who wanted logic and gave bad rating to this movie... i'm sure they did not went to see logic in Avengers and Spiderman. Makes me laugh when people speak of logic in such type of movies.What a dose of special effects, which were really fantastic, specially the final battle, with $110 million budget it outcast many biggies of nowadays.I personally believed that those who felt disappointed was because:1.They wanted to see the normal happy ending.2. Did not want to see a character die.3. Wanted to know what happens after the end.4. They have watched Matrix 1 & 2 too many times and this one came too soon (6 months after reloaded... it should have released 1 year after)5. They wanted to compare it with Matrix 1 & 2 and did not want this one to be different.Well...

Action-Packed Tedium,"It is hard to believe that the original Matrix's philosophical subtlety came from the same authors of the two sequels.It seems the brothers must have cribbed the original story for the first Matrix, since the last 2 show none of the original's subtlety or interest, just rehashing and CGI multiplication.One evil robot, two evil robots, many many evil robots. Wow, what an idea, what creativity!Viewing the behind-the-scenes on DVD disc 2, you can see the reasons for the incoherence of story and scenes - the huge fractured design team, numerous 'senior this' 'senior that', all contributing to some corporate creation lacking any inspiration. Maybe the corporate cube-farm culture works for making cars, but it doesn't seem to work for films.I would have liked to have seen another level of reality exposed behind the mindless machines, and why are they so mindlessly evil when they can think up such a subtle ruse to enslave the humans? It isn't consistent. Why not introduce an alien ET culture who is really the master culture enslaving the machine culture by some similar hallucinatory ruse. Or, have the humans escape by transcending their bodies, as in all the traditional gnostic spiritualities.All in all, the Matrix is just a retread of the movie TRON. TRON at least had some insight into what the machine mindset and motivation for domination might be, e.g. tyrannical game addiction, much like the decadent Roman emperors. The Matrix, after the first film, gives no thought to any subtle motivations of the machine culture, preferring the tired cliché of 'alien villain = mindless unrelenting violence'.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Half I expected, and half was better than expected.","Revolutions is much more concise and to the point than Reloaded was. The action is much more focused and purposeful, mostly because the movie is working its way toward a conclusion, rather than an open ending or a cliffhanger like either of the first two movies. The dialog is geared toward answering unanswered questions rather than raising new ones, and even the new questions raised in the third film can be answered by watching the film again (watch all three a few times over and you'll be as pointlessly knowledgeable about The Matrix universe as I am!).Unlike Reloaded, even the score fits well with every scene in the movie. I didn't care too much for the rave scene (the scene or the music) in Reloaded, but I can't recall a moment in Revolutions when any scene or sounds felt contrived or unnecessary. If nothing else, I was more disappointed that some scenes and characters didn't appear in the movie! For instance, the Merovingian and his goons were grossly underused in this film! Such an egotistical, maniacal character should be the focus of more attention than what he received in what is supposed to be the best movie of the trilogy.(One thing I must say to any viewers who criticize the film because it doesn't look real enough or doesn't feel right: you need to stop thinking like an illogical human and treat The Matrix like what it is: something that isn't real. It's science fiction, and much of the action takes place in a computer simulated dream world that is described as an imperfect simulation of the ""real world"". That is all.)I have been more involved in The Matrix than I have been in any other media phenomenon to hit pop culture, which means that it is simply, for whatever reason, the realization of an idea that works very well for me. The Wachowski brothers put together an excellent body of work with these films and accompanying works on various media -- so excellent, in fact, that I am easily distracted by discussion of The Matrix, both within the context of the story and above and beyond the story (symbolism, allegorical applications, etc.)My only complaints were that the Merovingian was grossly underused, the fate of the Twins and some other characters was not explained, and the Kid's triumphant ""The war is over!"" at the end was a bit premature, given what we had just watched for the last two hours.Finally, everyone should keep in mind that the machines have Neo's code, and whether Keanu Reeves comes back or not, his intellect may yet survive in the Matrix somehow...",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting,"Having now seen the full trilogy along with The Animatrix, I feel that it is safe to say that the body of work is quite an achievement.  While I did prefer the original, I don't think that it is necessarily due to the quality of the film as much as the fact that it was my first venture into the world of the Matrix.  I feel quite strongly that the original film has been grossly overrated despite being a good movie.  It was just as porous in its logic, and certainly the corniest of the trilogy.The last film is perhaps the coldest of the three, and yet the most intellectually interesting.  The first barely contained much originality of philosophy.  With each film, however, the trilogy veered off further and further into surreal philosophy.  Still, although the most interesting, it's that coldness and detachment that made me like this film the least.I am sure this, like Lord of the Rings, will go down in history and become a beloved trilogy.  To me, however, it is the achievement of the films moreso than the films themselves that impress.  Unlike the original three star wars, I do not hold a special place in my heart for these films.  Instead I look back upon them as a piece of film history.The one piece I will remember is The Animatrix.  Now THAT was a great work.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better when viewed twice...,"Initially, I was expecting the movie to be more plugged into the matrix than unplugged from it.  After deciding to go back and see the movie a second time with that expectation already established, I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I understood then that the movie really required to be primarily ""unplugged"" in order to make any type of sense at all and close the trilogy.  It didn't hurt that the second viewing was on an IMAX, as well.  The sound and effects were simply amazing once again, and in spite of all the negative reviews out there, I am satisfied with the trilogy as a whole.  I look forward to adding the DVD to my collection; it will be well worth the investment that is required.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Yes, I understood it.  Yes, it was bad.","I don't care what you learned in your Philosophy courses, this movie wasn't any good. I don't say this because it was ""too deep,"" because it wasn't, I say this because it was a film that failed miserably at everything it set out to do.First off, the battle for Zion.  This would have been interesting, had it not been a case of a bunch of minor characters being the focal point. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are the central characters of this film, and they were nowhere to be found in what was supposed to the biggest action scene. While the concept was cool, it just came off as watching some kid you don't know at an arcade play video games. Sure, some of the stuff is neat, but there's no emotional attachment. I could have also done without this battle including every single war movie cliche ever.  The momment I saw the kid tip his cart over, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I was correct. Not because I'm smart, but because I've seen it done in dozens of other movies.Then we get to the script.  Here is an excerpt, more or less:NEO: What am I supposed to do? ORACLE: You know what you're supposed to do. NEO: Ok. ORACLE: By the way, I'm a different actress, I better explain that every time I'm on screen.This goes on for about 20 minutes or so and makes you want to put your lip over your head and suck your eyeballs out of the sockets.  In fact, I'd say that a good 60% of the script consists of characters saying ""You know what you need to do"" ""You know the answer"" ""When the time comes, you'll know."" This is fine in a comic book or a novel, where we know a character's thoughts, and there's room for introspection, but on film it just doesn't work. Screenwriting 101, people.Also, when did they replace the actors with wax statues? Keanu is Keanu, but even since Reloaded, the acting seemed to drop off.  I've always thought that Morpheus was the most interesting character in Martix lore, and Larry Fishburne usually is a high point of the movies, but he sleepwalked through this one, mailed in every line and had a look on his face that seemed to say ""I really don't wanna do this any more."" This is probably due to the fact that they really didn't give any of the principal characters anything important or interesting to do. Morpehus was relegated to playing second banana to Niobi, which pretty much was a total betrayal of his character. The same guy who gave a speech to fire up Zion is now just sitting around being yelled at?As for the philosophy stuff, there wasn't all that much in this one, which was one of the positives, because if I had to sit through another half hour speech about causality, I'd declare holy war on france.  But not to fear, this one's chock full of religious symbolism.  If you never made the connection that Neo was supposed to be Christ, well.. this movie will not only make that clear, they will beat you over the head with it, to the point where a cross actually appears on Neo's chest, and he's dragged off while in a crucifix position.  Why not just end the movie with 100 years later everyone celebrating a holiday called ""Neomas?""  Despite all the Matrix fans who say that this is a film designed to ""deprogram"" people and ""open minds,"" and all the Matrix fans I met who bash christianity, this is a pretty pro-christian movie.When I first saw the Revolutions trailer, I said ""This fight between Smith and Neo had better be the best throwdown ever caught on film.""  Well, it wasn't.  Now, I'm not gonna go on a tirade about the CGI, because even though it looks like The Sims fighting, that's what you expect in the Matrix series.  My problem is how on a whole, the fight was just pretty un-interesting.  It's basiclly like watching Dragonball Z. Stuff blows up, they punch each other through buildings and fly around.  The problem simply is that the first Matrix was so innovative, they just were unable to top themselves, no matter how hard they tried. It just seemed like everything they did in terms of action and fights was just... old.  They even just redo the lobby fight from the first film, except this time the bad guys are on the ceiling.As for the ending, I wasn't as angry about it as some other people were. I can see why it ended that way, and I think in a way you have to respect the risk that went with ending the trilogy like they did.This movie seemed like it was running on fumes, and that ultimatly was the failure.  I think that if they had not shot Reloaded and Revolutions back to back, if they had time to say ""What worked in Revolutions?"" before they did the third, they would have been able to come up with something better. But alas, they ended up with what will most likely prove to be one of the most disapointing films of all time.  And worse even is the fact that Reloaded and Revolutions take away from the original. I tried watching Matrix the other day, and it just wasn't as good now that I know the full story and most of the disapointing answers to the questions asked in the original.So those are my problems with the movis, but I've got one other problem pertaining to Matrix Revolutions.  I'm pretty sick of the main defense of this movie being ""You didn't understand it!"" or ""You had too many expectations!""  Please.  The movie is flawed, horribly flawed.  Just because it has ""The Matrix"" in the title, doesn't mean it's good.  It's ok to dislike this film, you can still call yourself a matrix fan. Heck, I hate Rocky V, but I still call myself a fan of the Rocky movies. If you loved it, great, that's ok.  But if you realized that it's not good, don't grasp at straws trying to prove to yourself that you liked it, I'm sure your compatriots over in the mIRC Matrix Chatroom will love you nonetheless.Also, you really dont have to be a rocket scientist to understand the Matrix Trilogy. We're not dealing with 8 1/2 here. So if you wanna respond to someone who didn't like this movie, don't play the ""I'm smarter than you because I liked this"" card, because that's just silly... it's a movie, not a way of life (if you think it's a way of life, please get help immediatly.)So before you're about to call someone a mental midget for daring to dislike a Matrix film.. just think: What would Jesu...err...Neo do?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A fine third film, better than the critics made out.","Neo remains trapped in Limbo, whilst Agent Smith aims to take control of The Matrix.I have definitely come to enjoy Revolutions, when I first saw it, I didn't get it, and when I saw it in the cinema, I felt totally frustrated by it. However after a couple of viewings, I've really come to enjoy it, after all these years, it finally makes sense.Action packed sequences galore, there are no quiet or dull moments, it is relentless, the sequences look fantastic, the film's Cinematography is one of its main strengths. In addition to the non stop action and fight sequences, there are some incredibly moving moments, the ending in particular.Credit to the makeup team also, they did a first rate job, some of the injuries look pretty realistic.It's quite a cohesive storyline, I found this one quite straightforward to follow, more so than its predecessor.The original remains my favourite, but I honestly think this is a worthy third entry, I personally prefer it to Reloaded, maybe one day I'll gain an appreciation for that one day too.The acting was very good, as always Reeves is spot on, I just loved Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburn once again.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Ending---7/10,"Upon first leaving the theater, i was disappointed in the final installment of the Matrix trilogy. As I started to read up on it, however, I realized it made perfect sense to end it the way they did. I don't like writing spoilers, so i'll avoid that. I'll just say don't judge it right away. Let the whole trilogy sink in and it will all make perfect sense. The fight scenes are just as good as ever, but the battle on Zion was a little long and sometimes repetitive. It did feature some great action, though. There are plenty of tense moments and some unforeseen events that will catch you off guard. Hugo Weaving does the best job and plays the coolest character in the entire trilogy in Agent Smith and his many, many clones. This movie is very good but the original Matrix is still my favorite. If you didn't like Reloaded, you probably won't like this one. I think it is a well made trilogy and one that should be seen, because as soon as you understand it, the Matrix has you. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Success breeds 'yes' men.,"The Matrix:Reloaded was good. Not as good as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. Revolutions was unfortunately many degrees below that standard. The feeling I got throughout the entire film was that the Wachowski's had the phrase ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" on their minds, and due to the success of the first film, nobody would stand up to them and say that, well, actually, it would be pretty cheesy. There are so many scenes that are just awful cliched nonsense. I hope that in ten years time, as happened with the Highlander series, somebody will come along and pretend that these original sequels never existed and create some new ones following on from the first film.Too many characters with too little substance. Scenes based on effects instead of story, characters based on ability rather than being interesting. A pile of rubbish really.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spectacular, but disappointing","'The Matrix Revolutions' is not as good as 'The Matrix Reloaded', which was not as good as 'The Matrix', and it is not as spectacular. If you thought 'Reloaded' was a disappointment you will probably not like this installment.The story goes to the attack of Zion and Neo (Keanu Reeves) on a mission to the Machine City, together with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) try to arrive in Zion on time to stop the machines. Of course Smith (Hugo Weaving) is causing some problems.There are spectacular scenes here, although I think the best were in 'Reloaded', but that is about it. The attack on Zion is way too long, and things simply didn't feel as 'The Matrix' anymore. In the end that feeling came back, a little. The final sequence are spectacular and felt right. Not bad, but compared to the other two movies a disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Takes the rest of the step off the edge,"I base this upon the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An appropriate question to ask would be ""where did it go wrong?"". The first left little, if anything, to be desired. Already with the second it got worse, and this just does not work. Such a waste of potential. The dialog ranges, but it's too often simply not believable, or incredibly corny. This also has an abundance of cheese. The clichés are all over the place, with situations we've seen countless times before in typical mainstream pap. The plot isn't all bad, however, it spends so much time on characters that aren't fleshed out enough for us to care about them(and The Kid is downright intolerable in this). There are scenes that don't feel like they have a point. The effects are still almost invariably excellent, but more than ever before in the series, it feels like they were put there for no other reason than that they looked so great, to put something cool in, because the Wachowskis could, and without being well-integrated. The cinematography isn't as impressive. The editing is fine, but several things go on for too long. There is still philosophy, still ideas, still themes and symbolism. These, sadly, come off as being pretentious, like in Reloaded, and here they even take over, rendering this meaningless if you do not interpret it, and while that also somewhat rings true for the second one, the first one, whilst it would make it have considerably less impact on the viewer, could be enjoyed as nothing beyond another version of the old popular conflict between good and evil. This can't decide if it wants to be accessible and mere popcorn-flick fun, or smart and providing food for thought, and ends up failing to be acceptable as either. The acting ranges. The music is well-done. There is sensuality and definitely material in that realm, a fair amount of harsh language, and some quite bloody violence. This also comes with a text introduction(by the brothers, the same one as on the other two) for the commentary tracks(well worth listening to). One of philosophers, Dr. Cornel West(and yes, if his voice sounds familiar, he does, in fact, have a part in both sequels, as one of the councillors) & Ken Wilder, who like the three films, and one of critics, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson, who were less positive. The double-DVD holds artwork, a time-line, and a couple of featurettes. I recommend this to those who want the whole franchise, at least the efforts that were put up on the silver screen, and/or those who are mainly interested in the concepts and thoughts explored in these. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More enjoyable than Reloaded, but still not the original.","Let me start off by saying I didn't like Reloaded all that much.  In fact, other than a couple of scenes I didn't like it much at all.  This one, however, I found to be very enjoyable.  I was looking for a couple of hours of diversion and I got it.  This one picks up where the last left off; thank goodness there was no recap.  Neo is in a comatose state and the machines are close to Zion.  What ensues after a somewhat slow start is a great battle and one heck of a finishing fight.  Not as many speeches in this one, and thank God there was no rave scene or anything like that in this one. Morpheus kind of takes a back seat in this one and that helps as he has less time to make dramatic speeches, actually Neo isn't in a lot of this one either.  Still it works cause the battle between the squid robots and the people is really cool.  The humans use these cool machines that are reminiscent of the loaders in the movie ""Aliens"" except they have guns. Agent Smith is also back and he is close to taking over not only the matrix, but also all of the machines.  This sets up an incredible fight that reminds me of a fight in the anime DragonBall Z.  In fact this movie makes me excited about that movie, cause I can see they can do fighting right in that one.  It also makes me excited about Spiderman 2 as those tentacles on the squid robot look like his arms would.  And those machines the humans were using make me look forward to the Transformers live action movie.  Are all the questions answered?  No, but some of those questions should have never been brought up in Reloaded to begin with cause they were only used to try to make it seem more complicated than it was.  This movie was simply more of an action movie, which is probably why it turned some off, but I liked it. I gave Reloaded a 4, but I give this one a 7, it is not without its flaws, but overall this one did not disappoint me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nothing new, nothing revolutionary.","Within the first ten minutes of this film it seemed that Revolutions wasn't going to be the redemption of Matrix Reloaded I had hoped for.  The cod-philosophy was back with a vengeance but within even less substance then the supposed profound musings of the previous films while the first few action scenes seemed crudely tacked on set-pieces used as weak attempts to move between the poor-excuses for plot devices.  As the film progresses it gives a disproportionate amount of focus on secondary characters with whom we have little-to-no attachment to, unless of course you have succumbed to the cynical cash-in ploys of the Animatrix and the Enter The Matrix computer game, but even then their backstories are less than fascinating and add little to the film.  It is as if the Wachowski brothers have run out of ideas for the main characters, who, without the fast-paced world of the matrix to play with, reveal themselves as increasingly 2-dimensional, only defined by each one's singular purpose - i.e. Morpheus' faith in Neo as saviour, Trinity's love for Neo, or Neo simply being Neo, the all-asskicking super-dude we all secretly wish and/or think we might be.  The Wachowski brothers appear to be introducing as many other (also 2-dimensional) characters as possible into the fray in order to distract us from the poor development of the series' central characters.   What we are left with is an onslaught of scenes with characters in peril which we ultimately don't care about, and that do not make for exciting viewing.  In fact, I personally was looking forward to the potential deaths of certain of the Zion-based characters rather than fearing their demise, notably ""The Kid"" of Animatrix fame and the Captain who's main role in the film is to shout ""Aaaargh!"" while firing large guns (I won't tell you whether either of them actually do get it or not).  Neo and Trinity are given little screen-time for the bulk of the film as they go about their separate mission while Morpheus literally takes a backseat to Niobe, a character for which we care little for unless we have been lining the Wachowski brother's pockets further by buying Enter The Matrix.The action scenes themselves can err the viewer towards boredom - there's only so much interest or fear to be gleaned from admittedly well-crafted but still obviously CG creations.  The sheer scale of the employment of CG creations in Zion unfortunately makes the whole battle seem too fake to be truly involving.  Much of the film is not unlike watching a friend playing on his X-box but not being given a turn yourself.The film's attempts at plot hinge on the themes of love, death and perhaps even a slightly Jungian themed idea on the dichotomy of the self in terms or Neo and Agent Smith's relationship to one another and the inception of a twisted humanity into the program, Smith, who's menacing role is inevitably driven towards a pantomime villain styled performance.  The love theme is somewhat overplayed and seemingly without anything to say other than ""Love's great, isn't it?"" while we are yet to see really why there is any love between the dull, lifeless characters of Trinity or Neo.  The climax of their love in this film is embarrassingly acted and overlong, releasing a few laughs from the more cynical of us in the cinema.  Moreover, the much anticipated answers to the looming questions of the second film and the conclusion of the series are glossed over with vague dialogue masquerading as profound sentiment, ultimately leaving the viewer to come up with their own explanations as the Wachowski brother's appear incapable of doing so themselves.  Oh, and they never do explain why Neo's intra-matrix powers have deteriorated from the first film (where he ultimately became capable of rising from the dead to invade and destroy the agent programs from inside) into merely being a better-dressed version of Superman.  The questions of free-will and metaphysical freedom touched upon in the first film are largely ignored in favour of a simple fight for survival against the evil machines invading Zion and Neo's battle with the cyber-bogeyman that is Agent Smith instead of the potential for a psychic/psychological battle with the matrix program itself - a potential for a mindblowing effects-fest if ever there was.All in all the concluding part of the Matrix trilogy comes over as a bloated, overlong ending tacked on to reloaded with few to zero new ideas, less engaging action scenes and an ending that may well have been conceived on the back of an envelope while on the way to work.  The brothers did a masterful job of melding science fiction, comic and anime influences into a thoroughly entertaining, ground-breaking and thoughtful film in the original Matrix but have stretched the concept too far in a quest for a bigger bank balance. Although kids with a short attention span may well find the blaring gunfire and many explosions of Revolutions appealing they were much more entertaining when more firmly routed in the artificial world of the Matrix itself.  Upon leaving the cinema the thought I was left with was whether the real matrix controlling and shaping what we think is that of the dumbed-down entertainment industry, force-feeding us brainless, unimaginative films to pacify our minds.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better story and visuals than the last one.,"They really upped the ante with all the stunning visuals and effects on this one.

Matrix rethird - of four,"And who knows? Maybe even more will be coming our way. Having said that and the fourth one aside (more on that on its own page), this continues from the second Matrix on. You don't seem to have seen the other one, but of course it makes sense to have seen the previous movies. And this having even more characters in common with the sequel and coming over to this movie ... well again it makes sense and I will assume you have seen the previous movies.Many returning characters, one that we may not have expected to see again after the original Matrix was Hugo Weaving. He was so good as evil Agent Smith, that I reckon it was inevitable (no pun intended, you'll know if you know) that he had to return. In another form and somewhat it even makes sense. But then again, the movie is quite convoluted. And while the original movie had so many coincidences and convenient timing (not to mention knowledge when it was needed for the story and characters), it is not as fitting for this movie. That drifts off and tries to be philosophical but fails in major ways.But as a piece of entertaining, it does work. The movie is a blockbuster that tries, as the Wachowskis try to tell us, to give us action and substance. Not sure if you agree that it actually works that way or if you feel the campy vibes win over. I reckon for most it is the latter.But since the second movie was a bit of a letdown, I feel like this is a bit of an upgrade. It seems more grounded ... at least at first. And therefor it works, we connect with the characters and the threat level is quite high to say the least. Action set pieces are really good and even if it almost too much when it comes to the ending (all bets are off) ... it seems to be the conclusion the Matrix needed ... well until ... the decision makers who always look for numbers (the irony I know, right?), see the opportunity to make a quick buck .. or two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Revolutions""  It goes on and on and then ends, at least with a bang.","""My admiration for 'The Matrix Revolutions' is limited only by the awkward fact that I don't much give a damn what happens to any of the characters. If I cared more about Neo, Morpheus, Niobe and the others, there'd be more fire in my heart. But my regard is more for the technical triumph of the movie, less for the emotions it evokes. Neo is no more intended to have deep psychological realism than Indiana Jones, but the thing is, I liked Indy and hoped he got out in one piece -- while my concern about Neo has been jerked around by so many layers of whether he's real or not, and whether he's really doing what he seems to be doing, that finally I measure my concern for him not in affection but more like the score in a video game.""OK, so again I use the words of critic Roger Ebert to help express the feelings I have towards the groundbreaking ""The Matrix"" (1999) and its two lackluster sequels ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (both films released in 2003).The first ""Matrix"" was (obviously) the best film in the series, with its wild and kinetic action scenes, and gravity-defying special effects. This film ushered in a new era of action film that would quickly wear out its welcome just two years (and about 20 imitators) later.It came to us amidst a very welcoming public, dazzling us and puzzling us with that catch phrase  ""No one can be told what the matrix is  you have to see it for yourself""; I myself was put into complete awe by its magnificence and brilliant storytelling.Then came ""Reloaded"" in May of last year and its sequel later in November. ""Reloaded"" came to us amidst hostilely mixed reviews from both fans and critics and the same situation occurred with the release of ""Revolutions.""Add to that my feelings are the same. ""Reloaded"" was mediocre at best and the main criticism I had with that film was that it was simply too much, and tried too hard to be deep and meaningful but failed miserably at winning my interest and convincing me of what its supposed goal was.It was full of semi-meaningful and pseudo-philosophical dialogue about free will and choice; it just didn't matter. It was a lot like just get to the action scenes already, and believe me, I never pray for action scenes but ""Reloaded"" just wore me out with its boredom. I rated that film a ""6"" and believe me, I haven't changed my mind yet on that rating.Now we're at the third film  ""Revolutions."" Though ""Revolutions"" is, as a whole, a much, much better film than ""Reloaded,"" I got the feeling that it was only making up for the problems that plagued its predecessor, and I'm positive that was what it did. That kind of killed the experience knowing that is what was most likely the intention behind this film; but at least it kept you watching through the special effects and breathtaking action scenes that were reminiscent of the sequences in the first ""Matrix"" film.Indeed ""Revolutions"" was much more tolerable to watch, and it did go out with a bang as was expected by the ""holy"" crowds that view these films as some sort of new religious experience.Another scene would be the attack on Zion, which, forgive me, reminded me a little too much of the battle sequence from Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) because of the style and the way it was presented to the audience. Believe me, when I saw this scene for the first time, it reminded me so much of seeing Zeroes dropping bombs on Battleship Row, and then sitting there and watching the Sentinels in this film slay humans mercilessly in their never-ending assault on Zion.The trilogy certainly ended the way I predicted that it would (I will not disclose the details) but it ends up being worth it (much more satisfying than the abrupt conclusion of the previous film), especially for the all-too symbolic, apocalyptic ""Burly Brawl"" action sequence between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) at the end of the film.The scene itself is a masterstroke of genius and technological mechanics, and you're immediately put in awe by the effort and skill that went into engineering it. If the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry) ever did something right with the sequels, it would easily be this one scene.Anyways, to conclude, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" ended the series on a good note and I enjoyed it a lot.I give it a solid ""7.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

very satisfying conclusion,"i was worried about how i would feel about this movie after seeing all the negative reviews but i think the negative reviews come from two perspectives; 1) people who only like the matrix for the hong kong style fight sequences, and 2) people who can't follow the movie or don't like the fact that it is not self-contained like the first one.i'll try not to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it.  for me the ending of a movie (or series of movies) is crucial, and if i feel that the ending is weak i can't really like the movie.  so like i said i was worried, but i was very happy with the way the storyline was resolved.  some of the machine action sequences or battle scenes or whatever didn't do so much for me, but that storyline was fairly necessary for the movie.all in all i am really looking forward to seeing what the wachowski brothers do next.  i really like the philosophical/psychological elements in their films and would really be interested in seeing what they could do with a movie that didn't require so much action and special effects.  but i do hope that they might consider going back to some of these characters and telling us more about them.  i love the implications of the sati character and would love to see more of the merovingian and persephone.  and who could ever get enough of agent smith?the matrix: 9.5, reloaded: 8 (mostly for the weakness of the first 40 minutes), and revolutions: 9 (for being too dependent on the machine action/battle sequences).  it's been a wonderful trip.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"After getting off to such a great film, 'The Matrix' trilogy finishes on a fizzling whimper","'The Matrix' is a genre and film milestone, while it is not one of my all-time favourite films it is still a great, impeccably made and awe-inspiring film and ground-breaking in its visuals and sound that broke boundaries in a way rarely if ever done before.In 2003, 'The Matrix' boasted two sequels, 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions', generally considered critically and to audience not a patch in quality (though more mixed reviews than negatively received). To me, both are vastly inferior and have major problems. At the same time, neither are travesties, there are notable good points.Hard to say which is the better of the two sequels, they both have similar strengths but also similar flaws with a couple of things done better or worse in the other. Generally it is a shame that after such a great first instalment that 'The Matrix Revolutions' feels largely unsatisfying.Starting with 'The Matrix Revolutions' good things, the film while not as imaginative as the previous film or as ground-breaking as the original still looks great. The production design is still audacious, the special effects dazzling and uber-cool, very slick editing and cinematography that's both clever and imaginative. There is an epic eeriness to the music score.While not as astonishing as previously and there is a slight overload of them (with a couple overlong), the action scenes are still very impressive and the awe factor is still there. They benefit from looking great, breathless stunts, a great sense of paranoia, energy and tension. The final battle between Neo and Smith have garnered a mixed reaction, to me it was thrilling stuff and spectacular in mood even if ending on an anti-climactic note.Lead performances are fine. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss are cool, Hugo Weaving is deliciously wicked and Laurence Fishburne is imposing and charismatic and doesn't take it too seriously this time even with less to do.On the other hand, 'The Matrix Revolutions' is particularly crippled by its pacing and dialogue. The pacing is even more problematic here than in 'Reloaded' with the first half especially being so inert the slower and talkier parts feel stillborn.Dialogue was not a strong suit in 'Reloaded' but it's amplified here, its endlessly and annoyingly cryptic conversations, over-wordiness, over-complicated long sentences and wallowing self-importance add to its increasingly cheesy and stilted feel.'The Matrix Revolutions' story often doesn't draw one in enough, with a very dull first half that makes one tempted to bail. Although the second half fares better, the sense of wonder is nowhere near as strong and it's masked by too many characters, situations and scenes that are overlong and extraneous so, along with an over-seriousness, it feels too bloated and heavy.While the leads are good enough, the rest of the acting suffers from sketchy characterisation and poor writing. The ending is abrupt and confused, leaving one with too many unanswered questions which a final film in a trilogy should not do.Overall, not a travesty but less than great. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix Revolutions in 2021,The following for The Matrix Reloaded is a masterpiece in it's own way. It's not for everyone as the idea itself is o ly for particular type of movie fans. This plot has to be followed with the plot of the first two movies in mind. Some little details are linked and even few dialogs are linked and it should be watched in that way to get the 100% out of this movie. It's brilliant and I I don't understand why there's hate. This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology!Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. The final action sequences use way better CGI than any recent movies we saw in 2020 or any other recent movies. It's full action packed and the effects they used is way ahead of their time. Thia final movie has a different plot than the first 2 movies but in a good way. It's complicated and that might confuse some viewers for sure. Action sequences are well choreographed and has a unique style. It's not the typical action sequences we see everyday.This is still a very relevant movie even in 2021. Most underrated. This rating has occured because of confused fans in my opinion as the plot is complicated but it's well written. You just have to have that mindset to understand it. Great movie and any serious dad should reccomend this to their kids as a knowledge handover.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Holy mother of god!,"I just came back from seeing the Matrix Revolutions and it blew me away! I mean it literally BLEW me away. The movie exploded and I flew back 18 feet still sitting in my seat! That's how good this movie is! It completly outshines the other two movies by so much! The special affects were spectacular! The action kept me on the edge of my seat, the whole Zion battle was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. Although I must say this movie was just not all action... That's right, unlike the Matrix Reloaded which was just a giant action movie (not saying that's bad either) but Revolutions was a lot about preparation and Planning. There still was a lot of action and fighting though.I still think I may like the first one the best because that one started the epic adventure. Then I think of the movie I just saw and think: I like them in different ways. The first Matrix was good for introducing you (obviously) The second for Action (action taking you deeper into the story) And the third one for making you think and (as I said) BLOWING you away.I give this movie a 10/10. And I must say: ""Everything that has a beginning.... has an end"". By that I mean my review has just come to an end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good idea gone wrong ... again.,"Horrendous! I want my seven Euro back. This movie was the death blow to what the good idea that was half-beaten to death by the ""Matrix: Reloaded."" After that second movie with it's unnecessary first hour of footage, the ""Matrix: Revolutions"" finally destroyed all hope of resurrecting the revolutionary (no pun intended) 1999 film, the ""Matrix.""Where to begin? I suppose, first of all, dialogue. Cheap, trite philosophy from Keanu Reeves? No thanks. Uninspired speeches given to men going to battle robots that can swim through air with no sort of propulsion apparatus? No thanks. Insincere, hokey love duet between Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss? No, no, no. Why did he bring her back in the second one? To spite me?To quote a friend of mine, ""I have seen this thing in other movies ... it's called acting, and it just wasn't in [the ""Matrix: Revolutions""] at all."" Now, though I want to agree with this, is a little unfair. Hugo Weaving acted quite well, as usual, but the lack of acting skills from nearly everyone he interacted with made him appear to overact at times. Sorry, Hugo.Also, although I realize some of the following examples will be stretches, but I feel I must mention them, there are the rip-off scenes. First, the same friend who commented above also said that he appreciated the scene where Jada Pinkett Smith flew the ship (or whatever) into Zion and EMP'ed all the robots more when it was the Millennium Falcon escaping the Death Star.  Sorry, Will, your wife just isn't Billy Dee Williams. Oh yeah, Ben Affleck from ""Daredevil"" called for you Keanu, he wants his superpower back. To put Agent Smith in a human body only to get killed after he accomplished next to nothing in it ... great idea Wachowskis. And the mech robot thingies... seemed stolen from ""Aliens."" I know that's a bit of a stretch, but if I imagine a military version of the cargo loader that Sigourney Weaver fights the Queen Alien in, it would be one of those. Plus, that speech Captain Whoever gave before the battle seemed like a cross between ""Patton"" but dumbed down to ""Independence Day"" proportions. And the whole of the movie that happened outside of the ""matrix"" (which really only began in the second film) has always seemed to me a rip-off of the man vs. machine war that started in ""Terminator,"" only the machines are more modernized with special effects.Also, this film tossed in a bunch of incredibly useless extra characters like the Trainman and Sati and her parents. I say these are useless because Morpheus and Trinity go to see Merovingian and Persephone in an encounter which lasts about five minutes. In fact, I believe Monica Bellucci's cameo was merely to point out that she has an ample bosom as her one line was utterly meaningless. The new extra characters detracted from the old ones and the old ones just seemed tossed into the script. Ugh!To the Wachowskis, great idea with the first one guys, but when you expanded the world of the matrix, you bit off more than you could chew. The entirety of the trilogy should have been contained within the matrix in a fight to free the minds of all the other humans or something, but the Zion, machine world, and the Matrix was just too much to handle in three movies. Also, if you guys want to philosophize in that manner, go to a Star Trek convention or brush up on your Kant and Rousseau first. Seriously.Conclusion: I recommend seeing this movie only if it's raining and you've watched every one of the movies you own six times or more and this just happens to be available. Otherwise, don't waste your money.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix > Revolutions >>>>>>>>Reloaded,"I never saw The Matrix on the big screen, in fact I had never heard of it till it came out on DVD. I watched it and was amazed. Such a unique take on a familiar concept (Dark City anyone?). New and fantastic special effects and good flowing and thought provoking dialogue. This was surely a film that the filmmakers could see as risky, since all the special effects were groundbreaking and cost so much. Adding to the problems was that it starred Mr. Whoa!, Keanu Reeves, who I feel has never proven himself a strong lead in any role. In sense I could tell they were holding back what they were capable of, mostly due to lack of money. In time The Matrix became a huge success and the Wachoski's had all the money they would ever need. With the money came the possibilities of a sequel. (it seems these days that if any film makes enough money that it deserves a sequel.) Well the ideas started brewing and soon Reloaded and Revolutions were announced and then filmed back to back.I went into Reloaded with really high expectations. My expectations were so high based on the possibilities The Matrix left us with and where the story could go from there.. Boy was I let down. The negative definitely outweighed the bad in Reloaded. The editing, the pacing, the dialouge, and the acting, all horrendous. The only saving graces of Reloaded are two action sequences, Neo vs. The Merovingian's henchman and the freeway chase. The burly brawl was cool, but not needed and overdone. It seemed to be filmed only to make the fanboys cream thier pants. Overall a slow and pointless transition for the trilogy. Pointless, only because none of the questions asked in it are answered in Revolutions.Revolutions on its own is good film. It doesnt quite fit into the trilogy, but considering Reloaded, that is a good thing. It's nowhere near as good or wonderous as The Matrix, but it has it's own sense of wonder. We finally get to see the scorched remains of the earth. We see how populated the machine world actually is and what it looks like. The first twenty minutes or so are just filler and confusion that leaked over from Reloaded. Once the main conflict gets started, the film really grows on its own. The defending of the dock in Zion was incredible, some people have said it's overdone, I disagree. The attack is massive and it needed to be. I was just in awe at the swarms of squids streaming in. The people of Zion knew it was hopeless, yet they fought on.Neo vs. Smith, probably the one moment in film I have been anticipating all year. Was it cool? Yes. Was it necessary? Probably not. It was a combination of the subway fight and the burly brawl. I couldn't help but laugh a bit as these two unstoppable forces beat the crap out of each other in each overly exaggerated shot. Have you ever wondered what a fist looks like flying toward a face in pouring rain? Well Revolutions shows you.This film worked for me because all the stuff that was pounded into us in Reloaded was dropped. All the philosophy is gone, for the most part. The ending itself is a bit anti-climatic, too happy and sequel fodder. Why can't films just end anymore? Why do filmakers insist on leaving open possiblities for sequels? I just don't get it. The Matrix Reloaded was a dark, violent and sometimes over the top action movie. I bought it and I liked it.And to those of you who haven't heard of or seen Dark City. Go see it and watch a much better movie than The Matrix that has almost the exact same concept.***/*****",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix trilogy turned into old fashioned fighting and shooting.,"What made the previous 2 Matrix movies good and unique were the ""matrix"" fights and the use of bullet time. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" threw this all overboard and what is left is an old fashioned fighting and shooting science-fiction movie instead.It's ironic, the worst scene's in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" were the Zion's scene's but in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" these are the best one's! The Zion attack is definitely spectacular but when you watch a Matrix movie you would expect fight scene's with wires and bullet time and not the fighting and shooting that has been done dozens of times before. It's also a disgrace that they heavily borrow from other science-fiction movies such as ""Aliens"" (The whole APU things and they even seem to have borrowed some of the costumes and weapons used in ""Aliens"") and the Star Wars movies (using nameless characters that only press buttons and deliver their line's cheesy. In the Star Wars movies this work but in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" it gets only annoying), instead of being original like the first two movies.The end Neo vs. Smith fight is cool but it can't make up for the lack of missing fight scene's. Also the burly brawl and the subway fight against agent Smith from the previous two Matrix's movies were in my opinion better. I don't know, the whole end fight seemed like a Dragonball Z episode were two superman like characters fight each other without getting seriously injured.Thank God most of the mumbo jumbo talk from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is gone but it still have some pointless and simply weird scene's such as the whole Merovingian/Persephone scene that only felt like a lame excuse to show Monica Bellucci and her cleavage again.Yet again there is absolutely no spark between Neo and Trinity which makes the whole love story yet again very unbelievable. In the first Matrix movie there was still some good acting and dialog but in the other two it is the complete opposite. Low point when it comes to acting was Clayton Watson who gave a great lesson in overacting.It is far from a bad movie, it is just not what you should expect from a Matrix movie, in that way ""The Matrix Revolutions"" disappoints and also the ending is not completely satisfying. Still it is a spectacular movie with some at times impressive special effects and I have to admit that I was completely blown away by it when I first saw it in the cinema (The main reason for this was the Zion fight that was very spectacular to see and hear in the cinema. I would have rated it a 9/10 back then, which is higher as my ""The Matrix Reloaded"" rating) but once when I saw it again for the second time at home I noticed the many flaws and the unsatisfying things about the movie. This is also why I hardly ever write a movie comment for a movie that I have only seen just once or in the cinema.Might seem good and spectacular the first time but it gets worser on every viewing.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"You'll love it or hate it, this is why.","The Matrix Revolutions brings the mind blowing trilogy to an end. For some, it brought resolution, for others not. Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.The Wachowski brothers, perhaps, could have portrayed the finale with a little more clarity; but I find it ashame that so many have come to hate this trilogy upon seeing Revolutions. It goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the little details we sometimes disregard in such an action-oriented trilogy as the Matrix. There really is more to it. And once you understand the film, you get to love the rest of it: the action, the characters, the story, even more. 9/10",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not to sound insulting, but I think most negative reviews just don't get it","No spoilers here, and I'm not going to get into the philosophy, hidden meaning or anything else like that here...
To judge this film, or any of the three films as something that you should 'get' as a stand alone movie is ridiculous. Yes the first movie can be viewed this way and justly deserves a strong rating. The Matrix introduces the story, the characters, the premise and concludes at a pretty natural break in the overall storyline. To that end Reloaded introduces more characters and develops the story further. However if you need the third movie of a trilogy to introduce more, and not be dedicated to the conclusion of the story then you should love Godfather III.So what is there to 'get'? There is much that you can understand about the making of these movies prior to ever watching the movies that will help immensely in my humble opinion. First the Wachowski's directorial debut was Bound with a whopping budget of 5mil, then on to Matrix at 65mil, and from there to Reloaded and Revolutions at a combined 300mil! I have read 2 versions of this. What is the same in both is the they wrote the entire Matrix trilogy as one story and wanted to sell it that way to a studio. The difference in the two stories is what their motivation for Bound was. One version has it as an audition to the studio for funding the Matrix, the other is that it was not. Regardless it was filmed in the 38 days largely because of the Wachowski's extensive planning and clear vision for the film. This is one thing for Bound, but quite another when you consider they did the same thing for the Matrix trilogy. They story boarded all the scenes for the trilogy once they started the production of the Matrix. They had all three movies made in their heads, down to how every scene looked prior to ever starting them. Further, if the technology did not exist to put on film what was in their head, then they just went ahead and created that also.I highly recommend these films be watched in a 'marathon' fashion, but what I would recommend even more is that you start with Matrix Revisited, to see the journey you are about to go on.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not quite what I was expecting,"This is it, the last film in the trilogy that should answer all your questions that you had about the first and second and give you a good feeling inside, right? Well, I left a little down because I still had questions. This installment of the Matrix was the last half of a two-part movie. Through the chilling attack of Zion to Neo's journey to the world above, there was a decent plotline to hold onto even though it really unfolds in the last third of the movie. I was dissapointed for three resons. One, because I thought the directors left some things unanswered that I felt were necessary in the understanding of the story. For example-Neo's power outside the Matrix was not clearly explained. Second, I thought in the fight for time, the elements such as plot and development were a little watered down. Thirdly, they left us with a very pessimistic view of the future of the human race. I did like the allusions to Christianity placed in the movie, and I thought overall the fight and battle sequences were outstanding. The directors do a good job of giving us the full extent of the machine world also, but I was let down by expecting more than the Wachowski Bros. were willing to give us. Overall--- gotta give her a 7 cause It didn't deliver like 1 and 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Leave this one at the video store,"If The Matrix was the movie that was to free your mind, open your eyes, know thyself, and unplug yourself from the system, then Reloaded and Revolutions are the two movies that will plug you back into the system and force you to forget everything you were taught about the matrix.Somehow, in the last two movies the goth and hacker theme was replaced by some raver and bondage theme. It is as if any form of freedom and anarchy that was in the first film turned into consumerism and conformity in the second two movies.If you are a fan of the Matrix DON'T see Reloaded or Revolution.

solid action movie,"This is a very respectable end to the trilogy. The second movie and this one aren't as much fun as the first one, which was both groundbreaking and full of interesting ideas, but the action sequences and quality of the special effects are even more impressive in the last 2 pictures. I think that I liked ""Reloaded"" more than ""Revolutions"", because I felt that ""Revolutions"" left a few too many threads dangling.

Do I need to watch again?,"So I've managed to crack through all 3 films and I'm left with one emotion. Confused. So I ask the question. Do I need to watch these again to get a better understanding? Or is it just one of those I'll never get.I've given it a 7/10 because even though it's a confusing plot, I still enjoyed it. There's some great action scenes as per and the characters are as good as they were in the other 2 films.My first issue with this film is that it goes completely off cue from the first film and completely changes direction, which doesn't help the confusion. It's not just one long plot throughout 3 films.
I thought that the battle scene for Zion just went on and on, like it was cool to watch, but it just didn't seem to end. And because of this, I felt like the likes of Neo just wasn't in it as much as he should have been. He kind of just showed up towards the end.Do I recommend watching the entire trilogy if you haven't? Definitely. Even if you don't understand it, the action scenes alone can make you enjoy them regardless. All I'll say is that if you do watch them. Make sure you sit there and put your full concentration on. Don't half arse it. But yeah, overall I enjoyed it and I think I'll have to watch again at some point to get a better understanding.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brave end to the trilogy,"While Star Wars (through ROTJ) returned to its pre-teen fantasy nature of the 1st film, the Matrix trilogy shed that perception and instead went for a much grimmer, and realistic adult take on the hero's myth. The film is grim in nature, and deals with the realization from the last film that victory is impossible. The rest of the film is a big countdown as the humans (who are all wonderful, especially the actors from Zion like Captain Roland or Niobe) try to prepare for the big assault by the machines. The character interactions in the 1/3 point are all on point. We see the characters in their most vulnerable state trying to make it work in the face of armageddon. It all builds to a brilliant action climax that IMO has still to be surpassed even from modern films that tried to rip it off (IE: Man of Steel). This is a fantastic finale to the Matrix trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Makes you think...,"Despite some awful critics, I have to say that this movie was more than I expected. What most people that didn't like it criticized was that the movie left some story arcs unanswered, but this in fact was something to be praised.The movie didn't give all the answers, but rather left the foundations for the audience to think, analyze an decide them. That's how there are so many interpretations to it, it has so many layers that it would take more than just one good chat to understand all the meanings of the matrix.This third installment didn't have more kung fu, or philosophical speech than the first two, it rather had more symbolisms throughout not only the actions and reactions of the characters but also through  the concepts used.Something people should consider  is that according to Joel Silver, Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie cut in half, which gives a different perspective to Revolutions if only analyzed alone.This movie is about an end, death, finding a meaning for life, fighting, truth, etc. But it is not a movie about conclusion. The answers given in Revolutions lead to more questions because in the end it is about believing rather than knowing (reading between lines that is one of the may messages of the movie). After all, if you knew everything, what would be the point?Revolutions also has some incredible special effects scenes and sound. The lightening is superb along with all the technical aspects of the film. The CGI doesn't look as exaggerated as in Reloaded (it's better executed).The only complain I have is that the chemistry between Neo and Trinity is a little lacking. The story arc is well resolved, but I don't know if it was a matter of the actors or the directors that the chemistry is just not felt.In the end I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Reloading the Series,"Released only 6 months after Reloaded, the last film in the Matrix series is actually a pleasant surprise, especially considering the middle installment being exactly the opposite. While the movie leaves a lot of questions open, it serves as a satisfactory and exciting conclusion to the series.While the second film was bogged down in a convoluted and draining script, Revolutions seems to have stripped the story down to its basic elements. Now, far removed from the bitterness of the disappointment of the Matrix sequels—which seemed to be on par with the general sentiment for the Star Wars prequels—Revolutions actually ends up being a much more emotional and spiritual climax than any of us probably remember. Although this movie picks up right where the last one left off—that is to say, in the middle of an embarrassing mess—The final film is way more entertaining and refreshing than Reloaded ever could have dreamed of being.The reason, I think, that Revolutions was so ill received when it came out was for a number of reasons. First of all, the majority of the movie takes place in the real world, completely outside of the Matrix. The only time we are in the Matrix is when Trinity and Morpheus meet with the oracle to try and find out how to get Neo out of the in-between world he thrust himself into after realizing his powers work in the real world, and then one more time for the final battle. Also, the story goes in a very unexpected direction which left many people, myself included, feeling like it was the biggest anticlimax of any story. Neo is stricken blind by a man that has been possessed by Agent Smith, Trinity serves as only a dramatic character, and the film ends with peace between man, the machines, and the Matrix, rather than the annihilation of the last two. However, looking at it now, all of these things work in favor of the movie.While Reloaded exploited the iconic nature of the first film with such stunts as having Neo fly, having Neo fight fifty Agent Smiths at once, having Neo manipulate the Matrix in every way imaginable, having Morpheus fight bad guys for fifteen minutes straight, and having the machines attack the Nebuchadnezzar again, Revolutions seems to throw off all of the iconic nature of the trilogy, and instead find a conclusion that is interesting and, surprisingly, in tune with all the mounds of philosophical ideas they built into the first one.Zion is preparing for an all out machine attack, and deep down they know they will be making their last stand. Meanwhile, Neo and Trinity have taken a ship and are trying to make their way to the machine city. The battle takes up a majority of the movie, and the characters that were introduced in the second film serve as the focus of this part. The battle is certainly too long, but considering it has an emotional center, it is not nearly as draining and pointless as all of the fights in Reloaded. If the supporting characters had been more interesting, then the battle would probably have been more fun to watch, but what can you do.One thing that is a striking blow to the movie is that Neo gets a little shortchanged in this. During most of the battle, and a long battle it is, we don't even cut to see where Neo and Trinity are. When we do, Neo fights the man that has been possessed by Agent Smith, but he is blinded in the process. No matter, because he can now see the world, or at least machines, as golden light. When they arrive at the machine city, their ship crashes, and Trinity dies. Neo then walks to a certain point, and meets the head honcho of the machine city. It turns out, Agent Smith has turned every single person in the Matrix into himself, and both Neo and the machine leader know only the Chosen one can stop him. Neo then goes into the Matrix, fights the Agent Smith that used to be the powerful oracle, and is then defeated. Neo's defeat then brings an end to the perceived glitch that was the Chosen one, and then the Matrix reboots. In the real world, Neo dies, and the war between humans and machines ends. We don't see what happens in the near future, or the rebuilding of society. We do know that now anyone who wants to unplug from the Matrix will be allowed to do so.This story is obviously heavily influenced by religious texts and stories. Neo as a martyr for the freedom of humanity as opposed to the leader of a revolution completes his arch as a Christ-like figure. And the film leaves us by telling us that people plugged into the Matrix have a choice if they want to leave or not. That theme runs throughout the entire series, so it is fitting that is how it should end.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's as if they were purposefully TRYING to make it as bad as possible,"I'm no ""Matrix"" nut, but the first one was okay, and the second was different (if extremely pretentious). ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is an amalgamation of all the flaws of the previous two films with none of the positive attributes. It continues to focus upon the efforts of the Zion underground, scenes which are so hopeless and laughable they make the rave party in ""Reloaded"" look dignified. The final ""battle"" between Neo and Agent Smith is perhaps the most anti-climactic finale in any movie ever made.Some people have come to the film's defense. They've tried to imply it's an intellectual film - which is a rarity - and people who cannot appreciate this are too accustomed to MTV.Look, the Wachowski Brothers dropped out of high school, okay. They admitted that they borrowed many different themes from religions and philosophies for the first film. The thing is, they could get away with slight references in the original because the original was an action film. References don't need to be expanded upon. ""Matrix Revolutions"" tries to talk to us - and it fails, because the Wachowskis are not brilliant thinkers, and their attempts at writing a script packed with philosophical mumbo-jumbo is laughable at best. It's being talked down to by an intellectual inferior, and it's painful.The action scenes - and there are a good number, don't get me wrong - pale in comparison to ""Reloaded."" They just aren't nearly as entertaining.The ending is terrible. And the scene with the girl and the Oracle on the park bench is so beyond-bad you have to wonder if it's meant to be a parody of itself.Remember the scene with the Architect from ""Matrix Reloaded""? Stretch that out to an entire film's length - the result is ""Matrix Revolutions.""",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix Revolutions  The revelation of a revolution,"(Karthik Narayan) Knowing this was the final of the trilogy of the Matrix movies, which has revolutionized the movie world, the movie carried great hype in my mind and all across the globe.After watching the movie, I realized it captured the very essence of Hinduism/ Buddhism and the way to reach life's ultimate goal  to find out the meaning of life itself.Each one of us comes into this world with hopes, dreams and aspirations of attainment, what path we choose is our own. However, after a while, most of us get sidetracked by so many other things.The immediate purpose of existence in this world is survival  now that is reality.But the ultimate purpose of life is to find out the meaning and role of our lives. This will not happen if we stand in one spot and trust things will happen over time. It requires the belief in oneself to own up and go forth to find the glory of light.For only the one who seeks with their hands raised to the sky and their feet moving along the earth can find their true destiny  and beyond darkness, there is light. We need to believe in the light that sparks up our lives and move towards it. This light is what we call the truth.And the truth is not for us to seek but to make. For one writes his own truths and lies in life.This movie seeks to bring to light all of this and much more. I got my enlightenment, watching the good vanquish the evil, sacrificing self to the truth. For it is a consuming factor, this truth.Go watch this movie  and I am sure you will, beyond a shadow of doubt, be entertained and most importantly, enlightened.Rating  6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Another big disappointing sequel to ""The Matrix,""","Like it's predecessor, the final installment of The Matrix trilogy is overcomplicated in plot, yet even more excessive in CGI. The entire 2nd half of the film is a huge barrage of special effects, and while it's not a huge bore, the brilliant choreography has been sacrificed in it's place; save for the final battle between Mr. Anderson and Mr. Smith, and it's always a pleasure watching the two stars square off. Fun moments aside, it feels overlong like Reloaded and is just as unnecessary.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Movie was good, but could have been cut down.","The matrix revolutions was a good movie but too much was unnecessary.The war between the machines and zion was amazing but a little too long, the dialogue drawn out and boring, and the fights are too elaborate although they did take after Dragonball Z and other animes in their fight scenes. Other than that, I thought that it was better than reloaded but we can all admit that The first Matrix was the best by far.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Matrix Revolutions  The Choice is yours.,"I'll just start by saying that to make an effective and fair review of a movie/story one has to do a little research. I've noticed that people are complaining about certain aspects of the story in their reviews, particularly the place of secondary characters such as `The Kid'These can be explained with a little research, I urge everyone to see the Annimatrix, preferably before seeing Reloaded or Revolutions as it help explains a lot. Sure some of the characters may seem a little cliché, but having a bit extra background knowledge of the story will help alleviate this.Having said all that, revolutions was better than I expected, I would place it between the original and Reloaded which was somewhat of a disappointment. There is a good mix of story and action, and you never know where the ride is going to take you. Some of the fighting between Smith and Neo is slightly tiresome as we all know it was never going to end with a fistfight. The battle for Zion is nothing short of spectacular, there was obviously a lot of effort and thought put into it.This movie can be enjoyed by the fans of the matrix story and scifi fans in general. Again it is a matter of choice, you can either focus on negative aspects (of which there are a few) or you can focus on the positive ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The conclusion of a fine trilogy!,"This movie concludes the trilogy of ""The Matrix"" series. Neo and the gang are at the mercy of the tech villains. Mr. Smith is ever again relentless in his efforts to stop Neo. Won't that man ever give up? He goes to great lengths of upgrading himself and making duplicates by a deadly touch. Oracle, the wise one is always the toughest next to Morpheus and Neo. And who would have thought than Smith would take over Bane's body. Pure puppetry! And Neo enhanced his other power replaces his eyes when he fought the guy he thought was Bane. The machines in the movie were intense enough to stop a horde of those ""locusts"" that would damage the ports, and Neo himself would have to defeat Smith once and for all from within. Smith: THE VIRUS! Neo: THE ANTIVIRUS! He couldn't save his love the second time around, but he was able to save the world at the cost of his life. He was definitely a hero at the end. When he will be seen? Only time will tell. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix mythos,"The bigger picture had already started taking shape in ""The Matrix Reloaded"", but there were still doubts amidst the pile of narratives, and of course in the vortex of the hyper action. But it's obvious in ""The Matrix Revolutions"". The Matrix trilogy is a sci-fi retelling of the Christianity fable. Slightly heretic perhaps, but it's the Christianity fable all the same.Think about it. The Architect is God. He created the first perfect matrix which mankind rejected. Ring any bells? Yes, this is the original sin redux. Thereafter mankind lives in a kind of downgraded matrix that suits their needs and nature better. The agents/programs are God's angels so to speak. Neo, aka the saviour, might be another means of control, but he's the saviour nonetheless. Agent Smith is the angel that rebelled and freed himself; he's, ho-hum, an Antichrist of sorts.The difference in the Matrix's Weltanschauung is that mankind has rebelled against the Architect, aka God. Mankind (or at least a part of it) wants out the matrix, out of the role-model of god's universe altogether. It chooses to. Essentially the Matrix trilogy depicts mankind as some sort of anomaly (to use the film's terms), eternally bound to be in conflict with something without even really knowing why - the establishment, it's own emotions, whatever.The three films can thus be categorized as such: The first film is the introduction to the general idea and aesthetics. The second film is the culmination of the aesthetics, and the deviation and dilution of the idea into more interesting levels. The third film is the clearing up of the idea (and thus slightly disappointing), the decay of the overindulgent aesthetics, and the pompous pathos of the ultimate battle between Neo and Agent Smith.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Total mixed bag,"I saw the movie last Saturday, and I've been trying to decide what i thought about it ever since then. Everyone came out of our theatre with a ""Ho-hum"" look on their face. This was not the ""balls-to-the-wall"" action film we all envisioned. I know it's certainly not what I expected. Therefore I am totally torn on my feelings for the film. On one hand I thought it was cool way to end the series, on the other hand, it seems there is so much more that could have been done to make this a better movie. There is no clear ending here, I won't give it away, but those who have seen it know what I'm talking about. We're just supposed to accept that some things happened after the end of the film, and in my opinion that boils down to bad filmmaking. Then I start wondering if it was intentional. The Matrix movies have always been about thinking and elusive meanings and dialogue, but it still seems that there should have been some attempt at a true ending. Now to the fights, these are spectacular. Spectacular, other than the first fight with Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph against the Merovingian's goons which seems to me like a rehash of the lobby scene in the first movie, but then we get to the good stuff. The Zion dock fight is a new step in the right direction for CG mixed with live action, this thing is a beauty to behold and one of the best parts of the film. The superfight at the end is astonishing as well, as we finally see the two most powerful characters in the Matrix mythos go at each other like there's no tomorrow. Agent Smith is now totally enshrined as my favorite character of the entire trilogy, and he ranks up there with Darth Vader as one of my favorite villains in film history. Hugo Weaving shines here, and I hope will get some much deserved credit for his portrayal of Smith. The movie though is a totally mixed bag; it's better than Reloaded but not as good as the original which set the bar so high that it's hard to surpass. It will definitely take multiple viewings to sort all of this out and decide just how this film was meant to work. There's way too much to think about here. I think that if people give it a second chance and not just dismiss it after the initial viewing they will find more to love here, but only time will tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disappointing finale.,"In the moment, the third entry in the 'Matrix' trilogy is about as entertaining as its immediate predecessor. However, when considered as a whole it's arguably much weaker, principally because it fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the saga (which is one of its primary functions). Taken as a pair, the two sequels to 'The Matrix (1999)' are very disappointing; they really don't come together to create a cohesive whole and, because they make up a larger portion of the trilogy than the amazing first flick, they leave you with an underwhelming impression of the whole affair. They ultimately make the first film worse because they make it necessary for you to remind yourself that the first film truly is as good as it is. Plus, they could have easily been compressed into one picture of reasonable length. In and of itself, 'The Matrix Revolutions (2003)' is a decent in-the-moment experience which contains some impressive visuals and a couple of decent action sequences. However, it isn't particularly compelling and it has some fundamental pacing and structure issues. The action is often far too over-the-top and far too reliant on CGI to feel tangible. At its best, it's a bit of mindless fun. Despite its sometimes impressive scale, it doesn't really hold a candle to anything in its predecessors. Anything that isn't an action scene is only passively engaging. It's fine, but it isn't anything special. When all is said and done, the thing doesn't feel all that substantial. It's disappointing, for sure. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Every cliche rolled into 2 tedious hours,"I might be too old (32) to see movies like this, but this was an utterly unbelievable movie to me.  Perhaps I can't experience suspension of disbelief anymore.  The dialog was entirely predictable in many parts as much of it was very cliche.  Several times I thought perhaps John Travolta actually directed the movie because I could swear I was watching Battlefield Earth on at least 2 occasions.This movie is a bit pretentious.  It's of course illogical - for example, do the AI machines not realize how easy it is to build a bomb?  Why can't anybody think to reload weapons before they get into the line of fire? Why would anybody build a mechanical assault power suit with no armor for the operator?  Aren't there any targetting systems run by computer anywhere in Zion?  What powers Zion?  People?  Natually, I can go on forever about these little snafus, but there is little point I realize in doing this.  This is an action movie after all which means any sense of reality is forbidden.  Why spend $100K on a (competent) technical consultant when you can use that money on 3 seconds of CGI footage?  The last time that was done was for 2001 which is still watched today, despite it's incomprehensible plot.If you can ignore the bad dialog, what seemed like soap opera quality acting, the gaping plot holes and the nit picks of a completely illogical and unbelievable plot, it's a wonderful movie.  However, if you're like me, you'll be wondering why you didn't spend the $8 on something more entertaining like an energy saver fluorescent light bulb.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Leaned too much into the machine action.,"It's not near as good as the first, or even the second movie. The dialogue wasn't that impressive or memorable for the most part (except Hugo Weaving does play a great villain and is good in all of the movies, along with how his conflicting plays out with Neo), except the human conflicts and the more philosophical exploration of the Matrix and reality were not explored in this film near as much since it was very established very early on, but that makes this movie somewhat uninteresting. I don't care about the machines or Zion as much, I care about the human to human action/hand to hand combat and the more personal conflicts that this film did not have a great amount of. In the end I'd say it's fair though. I still liked it more than others did just because of a few parts that made up for most of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Why?,"It is hard to believe that the original Matrix's philosophical subtlety came from the same authors of the two sequels.It seems the brothers must have cribbed the original story for the first Matrix, since the last 2 show none of the original's subtlety or interest, just rehashing and CGI multiplication.One evil robot, two evil robots, many many evil robots. Wow, what an idea, what creativity! Viewing the behind-the-scenes on DVD disc 2, you can see the reasons for the incoherence of story and scenes - the huge fractured design team, numerous 'senior this' 'senior that', all contributing to some corporate creation lacking any inspiration. Maybe the corporate cube-farm culture works for making cars, but it doesn't seem to work for films.I would have liked to have seen another level of reality exposed behind the mindless machines, and why are they so mindlessly evil when they can think up such a subtle ruse to enslave the humans? It isn't consistent. Why not introduce an alien ET culture who is really the master culture enslaving the machine culture by some similar hallucinatory ruse. Or, have the humans escape by transcending their bodies, as in all the traditional gnostic spiritualities.All in all, the Matrix is just a retread of the movie TRON. TRON at least had some insight into what the machine mindset and motivation for domination might be, e.g. tyrannical game addiction, much like the decadent Roman emperors. The Matrix, after the first film, gives no thought to any subtle motivations of the machine culture, preferring the tired cliché of 'alien villain = mindless unrelenting violence'.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Ending to the Matrix Trilogy,"The first 'Matrix' was one of the best science fiction films that I have ever seen. The second was a failure, and I was concerned about the third being even worse. Well, for once, my concerns were not justified, and the final (is it final really?) movie in the series without being as good as the first one is not a bad movie at all.On the bad side, there is nothing too original or too unexpected in this series. It very much continues the second part, and I remember having read that the authors consider the two last parts as one film. Some of the pseudo-philosophy could have been avoided, and the symbols are not that deep as the authors would like us to believe. Overall, this 'quality' part of the story and film is the weakest.Now the good side. The action is really good, and the effects are as good as you can get with the technical means of the beginning of the 21st century. It may come as surprise, but the real art in this film is in the good cinema created by the effects. Some good acting helps, casting is good excepting Monica Belucci - I cannot imagine why such an exquisite and beautiful actress accepted to play this purely decorative role - Maybe she just wanted to be part of the movie?The film got a lot of bad critics, and I do not really understand why. Maybe it is because of the high expectations the first 'Matrix' created. In any case, it is not bad at all, and the trilogy gets a good ending, although not an exceptional one. Yes, the Wachowsky brothers can do better, and the audiences are waiting for better from them. This one gets an 8/10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so good,"Wow, this may go down in history as the most unsatisfying final act in movie history. The Matrix Revolutions is hopelessly convoluted, weirdly uninteresting, Completely humorless, and entrenched in the excessive CGI-laced hokum of a thousand other nauseatingly stupid action movies. But at least many of those are self-aware in that they're bad, and thus know when to have fun.  Revolutions seems to be under the impression it's elevated above those in some capacity.  The fact is, if this movie wasn't riding on the coattails of its predecessors, it wouldn't even be a blip on the blockbuster radar.And it shouldn't have been this lame.  The original film was stylish, inventive, and threw in some intriguing philosophy to boot.  It wasn't a masterpiece, but it definitely set a new standard for all action movies that followed it.  Its sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, was more of the same, just more grandiose and even more confusing for those who had trouble understanding the first film's mechanics.  It was also pretentious in some ways and in desperate need of editing.  But it was still GOOD, it still worked when all was said and done, if for no other reason than that the action sequences were spectacular (although the Neo human-to-CGI transformations were jarring and painfully obvious).Revolutions, on the other hand, is a mess.  With the exception of Morpheus and Agent Smith (and, however brief his scenes, the Merovingian), none of the series' characters were very interesting.  Here, they're flat-out unlikable because not only are they boring, they're weirdly stupid and spout incredibly cliched lines.  Those who played the video game Enter the Matrix might see something worthwhile in Ghost and Niobe and ""the Kid"" is from a sequence in the Animatrix, but who cares?  Unlike Star Wars, where the minor characters usually looked cool or had funny voices, the ""Expanded Universe"" cast here are all useless talking heads, amalgams of soldiers from countless WWII shoot-em-ups or human Jar Jar wannabes (at least Jar Jar was cute for small children.  The Kid is apparently some sort of obnoxious replacement for Mouse from the original).  The dialogue is simply god-awful throughout the entire film.  Any scene that starts out interesting always ends up flat. Characters come and go without a trace, many of whom who were from Reloaded and who fans assumed would be a large part of this entry.  Not so, instead they're wasted, being only involved in scenes that are pretty much time-fillers: the ""Rescue Neo"" sequence serves almost no point and does nothing to advance the plot, instead it's a vehicle for a dull shoot-out and token cameos from the Merovingian and Persephone (and what was the point of the Trainman?!)The movie goes downhill (moreso) from there.  Lots of goofy-looking Mechs ripped off from Aliens shoot a lot of squiddies.  Characters die, the audience blinks in indifference; after all, there's no development of their personalities, so why care what happens to them?  I ended up rooting for the machines because 1: they look cool and 2: if they did succeed in destroying Zion, no one would have to suffer through another ""rave scene"" ever again. Neo discovers his destiny a la Luke Skywalker or Aragorn after more needless scenes (they truly serve no purpose, I'm not kidding), but the setup to this is not adequately explained so many will be scratching their heads.  The problem is that even if you do care enough to understand fully the events leading up to this movie's huge letdown of a finale, you'll still likely not give a hoot because the story's major players are lifeless; even Morpheus is now Chewbacca in this one (which I guess makes Niobe a very hot Han Solo, also Jada Pinkett Smith is the only actor on the human side who shows some resistance to monotony, as her lines are delivered with genuine passion). Hugo Weaving and his identical buddies gnash their teeth a lot.  Mary Alice as the Oracle sounds like Barbara Walters, and her proselytizing has become tiresome.Ultimately, Revolutions is proof that The Matrix franchise had nowhere to go after Reloaded.  The entire series is like a particularly unusual three-course meal: first a tender filet mignon, followed by an after-dinner salad, but ending with a partially melted Junior Size Three Musketeers bar.

A disappointing conclusion.,A disappointing conclusion to the Matrix trilogy as characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disappointing end,"The flaws of the previous sequel are more readily apparent here as the focus shifts to the ""real"" world which is populated largely with uninteresting characters that were poorly developed in the previous film. As before, the film is stronger when it focuses on what is going on in the Matrix and Neo's own struggle to understand his role and the fallout from his discoveries. It is a shame then that most of the plot centers around a large scale assault on Zion that quickly becomes tiresome as characters who we care little about face off against an overload of CGI machines that really needed cutting down. That the film grinds to a halt in its biggest action sequence says a lot about how badly thought through this part of the film was and without the juxtaposition of scenes within the Matrix that made the ""real"" world sequences bearable in the last film, it never really recovers from it, even if it does improve slightly as it shifts its focus back to Neo. It doesn't help that whereas in the last film plots elements from the ""real"" world were rushed, here it's the elements related to the development of the Matrix that feel rushed and forgotten about for large parts of the film which make the final sequence difficult to care about.

An awful excuse of a movie,"This movie is about as disappointing as an end to a trilogy can be.  The first movie was great, but these last two have shown what happens when the creators are two creative and are then given a massive budget to play with. Every stupid and ludicrous idea makes its way from the `genius' brains onto the screen because there is nothing stopping them.  That's exactly what happened to this movie.  To top it off, the dialogue is the worst it's ever been.  The Matrix was not known for it's great dialogue, but it did well enough.  Reloaded started to get bad, but Revolutions takes the cake. It's as if every character is required to say the most painfully clichéd things ever.  The so-called `romance' between Neo and Trinity all but fizzles. At least in Reloaded we got a steamy love scene.  In Revolutions, we get a few kisses and a really bad line of dialogue from Trinity.The plot in this movie has become completely convoluted and we are dealing with characters for most of the movie that were introduced in Reloaded. The plot becomes more of a philosophical debate on life, which is fine, except that little of it makes sense.  The highly sophisticated dialogues in the scenes with the Oracle are dumbed down completely by the simplistic actions the characters take.  It's hard to care about a lot about them because they say ridiculously stupid things and despite all that is going on around them, they are completely unmoved by it.  Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobi is particularly awful, as is Clayton Watson who plays Kid.  Niobi was the tough and confident expert pilot when we first met her and she is in the end. She doesn't believe Neo is the chosen one, and she still doesn't in the end. Kid is the exact opposite of her and again is the same even in the end.  I heard so many great things about Hugo Weaving's performance and then I saw the movie.  He actually does the laugh Dr. Evil does in Austin Powers.  He at one point makes his lips look like Steve Tyler's all while saying the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.  Someone said he should've gotten an award for his performance, and I agree, but probably not on which award he should win.  The whole idea that Neo must make his own choices is supposed to be a big revelation that draws you into the story.  Didn't we all learn that in second grade?  Why is it taking Neo so long to figure that out, especially when it already was told to him in the first two movies?  Many people have complained about the end of the movie, but that is not the worst part, the beginning and the middle aren't so hot either.Reloaded featured an amazing scene on a freeway and some good fight scenes scattered throughout, but Revolutions has only two hand-to-hand fight scenes, one of which being the climatic battle between Neo and Agent Smith. Technically it has three, but since one of them involves Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph shooting their way past guards in a room with columns, I tend not to count that one since we saw it already in the first movie.  The final scene looks good except that both Neo and Agent Smith have grown two powerful for their own good and the final scene looks more like a fight scene from Superman.  There is the battle of Zion, but the drab looking city is difficult to watch because you have no sense of where any of the characters are or what exactly the humans are fighting to save.  Freedom, obviously, but no time is spent getting the audience to empathize with the humans.  The machines the humans use to fight the machines look drunk, and the machine army seems more interested in flying around in pretty patterns than actually attacking anyone.  And if they are supposed to be brutal and efficient killing machines, then why are they oblivious when humans start firing rockets at them?  Also, if humans have learned how to generate such a large EMP without the use of a nuclear weapon, why do they still use machine guns?  The vague ending makes you wonder if there is a fourth movie planned for the future, which would be unfortunate given the quality of this film.Overall, the movie appears to be geared towards someone with higher intelligence than perhaps the writer of this critique commands, and if anyone does have that higher intelligence, then by all means share it with me so I may understand.  Unfortunately, the Matrix Revolutions appears to be a dismal failure in concluding what should've been an amazing trilogy. Its complicated philosophical implications are watered down with action that is less exciting than in the first two movies.  If you haven't seen Reloaded, then don't bother watching it or this movie.  If you saw the second movie, then you probably have no choice but to subject yourself to the third one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

While The Matrix introduced a relatively believable plot and sci-fi concept, this third sequel spins out of control. That ""world between the two worlds"" makes no sense and also Smith being able to enter a human mind makes no sense. You could see machines reading peoples minds and creating dreams for them (which the matrix is, a delicately constructed dream for all humans), but not themselves becoming human minds. Also, too many characters, I don't see any added value in the Frenchman/Monica Bellucci subplot except for more fights and more loud music. While I can see that The Matrix ""asked"" for a sequel, I don't think it asked for a whole trilogy.

The outcome in the end could have been better, but I can't complain.Pros-Still great matrix characters and action-Very engaging combat against machines-Disliked by some, but the ending was reasonableCons-Lack of martial arts and gun battles compared to previous films-Someunresolved relationships-Neo's some-what over the top powers",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"entertaining, fun and gripping","This film is definately worth seeing, just for the rollercoaster ride it gives you. granted that the end is somewhat... strange... I liked it because it's not some happily ever after disney junk. it's not as good as the first matrix, but then I doubt it was ever intended to be that way, finally one installment that takes place mostly in the real world!After seeing reloaded I remember coming on here and hearing all the same comments about ""what were they thinking???"". That movie had long unending fights and went on interminably to finally add some spice with the whole architect thing. All you sceptics thought it sucked until most of you started blabbing your mouths off about ""matrix within the matrix""... you made up that stuff yourselves and I don't know who started it, but you all bit and started fighting that line when it was clear that that wasn't so from the first time I saw the movie.I was gripped during the entire movie (save the end) and came out with a tense neck from the action. My girlfriend (who doesn't like action and war movies) liked this installment, and she hasn't seen the 1st one all the way thru and hasn't seen reloaded either. I'd dare say that this movie might have gotten much MUCH better critique than it's getting here if it had been a movie unto it's own, or if all 3 had been in the same tone, maybe like The Lord of the Rings although it comes off more like star wars. On it's own it's a good movie with amazing and 100% believeable SFX, in the context of the other 2, it's a departure and that I believe made all the matrix fans mad, but the wachowskis hit the nail on the head with a fitting if somewhat annoying ending.don't pay attention to the naysayers, this movie is worth watching and spending the 8 bucks to see it in a theater. I think that time will give it the credit it deserves in the matrix universe 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
best trilogy ever,"it's the best end that a trilogy can have , i'm sorry cause of neo and i'm wondering if this story continues what kind of ""the one"" is gonna take his place ... for me is keanu reeves the best actor could ever do a role like that of neo. and after all what is gonna happen with the people of sion , they have no real life , it's not the kind of life they want , to get to the surface and see the sun -this is a freedom everyone want's . but the question i'll always have , why neo ............why Mr.Anderson !!!!! is he a program error ??? or what??!!! i'd like to see the matrix once again .....maybe in 5-10 years it's a saga that worthy to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The only way to defend The Matrix Revolutions is that in 2003 they had never before charted this two films shot back to back/shared media universe.,"And although Reloaded/Revolutions paved the way for the many sagas to follow, the 'concluding' chapter is a painful reminder of the crushing demands of a blockbuster schedule, the diminishing returns of the Wachowski's unique, oddball, counter-culture proclivities, and the continued curse of the third film.For starters, the pacing is all off. If this was the second part of a mini-series, watched a week later, it would be perfectly fine, as a blockbuster cinema experience it's flat. It starts flat, it's boring and lumpy, convoluted and pallid at the same time. It has big chunks of exposition where Neo literally asks 'what the hell is going on' to which he gets 0 actual answers and, if anything, more confusion.Then the upfront action is a pale, poor and almost comical turgid retread of the lobby scene complete with Trinity's watered down signature kick, bullets spray about making them all look useless and each section is diced and spliced in between rushed, chopped up sequences where a lot of the best and most interesting action happens off screen.You know, there's some tremendous performances, theatrical readings of the theatrical dialogue; particularly the new Oracle and the scene with Smith. Agent Smith himself is one of the perfect evil supervillains of cinema history; foreboding, watchable, likeable, campy and utterly inevitable. The actor playing Bain who has a sort of dual consciousness going on with Smith is hilarious and pleasurable to watch, an idea underutilised but that could explode the lore so much if focussed on.So the battle for the dock is mixed bag, an uninspiring, drab location with uninspiring, drab characters up against some elite mech action and VFX that still holds up, expertly crafted, with some truly terrifying hellishly beautiful images and great beats with the unique villainous squiddies. It's neither good nor bad, loud, long, but as well made as any war in any movie. If only they managed to utilise the main characters instead of these chumps.The final battle is pure anime, unstoppable force and immovable object doing their dance through some cracking locations. It's unique to live-action (at least until the vastly inferior Man of Steel came along) and although it hasn't got the energy, kineticism and force of the first Matrix, it's a fitting end for these two equal and opposites. It's truly one of the greatest depictions of gods clashing that I've ever seen. It's 100% Mount Olympus.So there's a glut of excruciatingly detailed and iconic imagery and design work. Some deliciously rousing and unique music. Some of the best surround sound I've ever heard. Some stirring, leftfield themes and ideas. And the rest is just bunk.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The Wachowski's raise the stakes, and with it shorten the margin for error; as inconsistencies and frustrations mar the final installment of the Matrix franchise.","The Matrix Revolutions marked a sorry end for one of, certainly at the beginning, the most creative; most original science fiction films running on a smart premise we'd seen for some time. Where smarts; intelligence and well drawn nightmarish worlds complete with engaging ideas to do with life, existence, the universe and everything was once the predominant item on the menu, all has given way in the second Matrix sequel to flurries of ""What on EARTH!?"" moments; uninvolving love stories and dull causality culminating in a stupefying Tekken inspired fight sequence between two characters. The Wachowski's ideas featured in 1999's The Matrix were reigned in; they were kept in check, never feeling as if they were bigger than the project itself and explored in a dramatic and thoroughly substantial manner. The Matrix Revolutions appears tired with its origins, bored even; like the cleverest student in the class whom sits at the back just not feeling up to it on the day of the big exam, and falling just a little short of the pass mark when so much more was expected of them.As the piece crawled towards the end of its one hundred and twenty five odd minute run time, nearly all sense of immersement and respect for the trilogy was on the way out of the window, and I was praying their God-like Architect character would simply walk onto the screen, turn to the camera, hold up a remote control of some kind and just press a button that would make the screen go black. ""Now, we are finished......."" he would bellow in a gruff, low, robotic tone. What we get is something just as stupid, but less amusing. Revolutions is the point The Matrix ceases to be a science fiction film about ideas complete with an initial, original vision; now rendered a dorky war-come-action film which pastes on a dull love story or two involving the leads and their supporting acts so as to try and insert a bit of heart into proceedings, amidst the gradually less and less interesting teenage orientated spectacle.The war between man and machine has reached its crescendo, the ultimate showdown between flesh and blood and metal and A.I. has arrived after burning at the back on a hob throughout 2003's other Matrix sequel entitled Reloaded. The eponymous hero of this now chore of a franchise, Neo (Reeves), is stuck in a strange zone of purgatory masquerading as a subway station and cannot get out to aid in the overall struggle. His mentor, love interest and cohorts in the form of the usual suspects Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity (Moss) skulk around looking for him as all sorts of different parties, in the form of programmes trussed up in human-being form, knock back nonsense banter about whatever self indulgent; self gratifying themes and subjects the Wachowski's feel they need to instill into the film. One trip to an underground fetishistic themed nightclub contains a fight sequence with guns complete with a stunt that reminded me of the finale to 2001's 3000 Miles to Graceland, the instance in which a guy comes spinning into view from the ceiling with dual machine guns blazing – not a good thing. Having taken two whole films to establish guns are useless in this universe, and pose little threat to those whom fight, it's a wonder the characters still proceed in using them. But it's all spectacle, and most probably acted as good trailer fodder.There doesn't seem to be much in the way of spine to Revolutions, people flit and hop from incident to incident without much clarity nor apparent reason. One is left persistently wondering where most of the supporting acts stand in their stance on the war overall, the film's complete lack of a hierarchy in this world full of sides, warring existences and clashing ideologies exposing the film-makers' inability to go 'better' after having already gone 'bigger'. Where does a Frenchman and his girlfriend, of whom he seems to have forgiven for her betrayal in the last film, stand? What about the creator and aforementioned God-like character The Architect? Where does he fit into rouge Agent Smith's plans, as an army of machines and their tank equivalents named Sentinels brood in their bid to destroy the human city of Zion. Does any of it matter if The Architect is able to reset everything and play God – does it matter if Zion is annihilated? Nearer the very end, a middle age black woman named The Oracle mopes her way onto screen after some prior interactions with an array of people; where did she fit into all of this and whose side was she on? Whom outranks whom? What does the train driver think of everything? Something may be grossly at stake, but none of it actually matters.Further pain is inflicted onto the audience during the 'big showdown', a massive fight sequence between the mechanical equivalents of a large spider hybridised with a wasp and named Sentinels with the ground troops of the humans in Zion. Here, the film's shortcomings become grossly apparent in that archetypal mannequins in a young soldier out to prove himself; a General, whom comes complete with a Braveheart inspired speech to rally the troops, and the non-soldiers in the form of two women whom feel the need to take the fight to the enemy, systematically allowing the makers to make it look as if they're addressing the issue of female empowerment amidst this war-zone, begin to take over as central to providing us with human characters as the spectacle moves in. Agonisingly, amidst the millions of people in Zion at the end, it's the General and the grunt whom just happened to bump into one another. Small incidences like that only fuel the feeling of the film's robotic, metallic and dulling temperament; where once was freshness and excitement is now occupied by the droll and incidental, and it sure is relieving to know it's all over.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Satisfies in every way.,"If you're a Star Wars fan then you'll understand what I mean by this: Reloaded and Revoloutions are like the first and second halves of Attack of the Clones. The first just sets things up, the second half lets rip!If you want an all out actioneer, it's relentless! If you want to get your head around it, it's also very absorbing. Also violent, quite gruesome at times, but definitely true to it's beginning.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good... thou not better than those before,I liked the movie. Its fun and like another reviewer put it: Entertaining. The philosophy was left a bit aside... pity. The romance is a bit slapstick and silly sometimes. The directing was weak too.The film was lacking in respect to the other versions... but the action compensated IMHO. I like the series and I am prone to forgiving their less than good directing. Watch the first one more times to compensate and be happy... otherwise you won't provide enough battery power.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I have since re-watched all three films and have come to see the incredible depth and detail of this series.

"Not broke, why fix it.","This movie is vastly different from its predecessor, The Matrix.  The formula in the first movie was a balance of interesting plot with great action and special effects.  Most of the plot in the first movie was very deep and philisophical if you wanted to be, or you could take it at face value.  An excellent movie to think and think upon for weeks to come.  The special effects were awesome.Reloaded was a very deep storyline which turned off many of the non-hardcore viewers.  The first time watching this movie left lots of questions to think on.  I was 10 minutes behind thinking about things that I missed the action. As well, Mr. Smith had too many cheesey sayings.  Not to mention, the fight scenes were way over the top.  Fighting 100 Mr. Smiths was quite boring and I was just waiting for it to end.  And it ended poorly.I'm not as excited to see Revolutions now that I have seen this edition. I'll see it at some point, but I may wait for video.  If you were not a HUGE fan of the first, don't see this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Horrible,"I can't believe that this movie is at a 6.3 right now! The film is laughably horrible! The Wachowski siblings (one is now a chick) seem to be operating on autopilot here.  I loved the first movie.  I enjoyed three or four action pieces of the second, but there is no redeeming quality in this film whatsoever.  The dialogue made me laugh out loud at least 10 times.  The best being ""Neo, I believe!""  or ""I believe, Neo!"", i forget.  I couldn't contain myself at that point.  There is no reason for the kid to say that line during that part of the movie.  It is a tagline for tagline's sake and is pretty damn sad.  The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is the first half of the Neo/Smith fight scene at the end of the movie. It gets tedious towards the end but for the first few minutes it borders on brilliance.  Please, for the love of god, don't rent or buy this movie. If you do, come on this site and rate it a 1 so the rating will be lower.   If you are looking for something else to rent, rent Big Trouble in Little China.

What a waste of time and hope...,"After ""reloaded"", there might have been billions of possible thematic construction to continue this story or, to say it better: to come to a reasonable, half-logical end of this dystopic saga. But the Wachowski performed well in choosing the most trashy, completely clueless finishing you could imagine.Why is the war over now,  just because Neo did what none of the special files and certain programs in the machine's matrix-universe was able to - to eliminate the run-outta- control-program Mr.Smith, a kind of matrix super-worm??? In the first two movies, the main plot was the rebellion of mankind against the machines, not vice-versa, forgotten?What about the promising thought at the end of ""reloaded"", that maybe all the setting of the underground world and the machine-ruled earth surface were kind of another matrix themselves, including Zion and the characters of Morpheus and even Trinity? Why didn't they develop the continuing based on this idea? This would have become much more interesting, I bet.The worst thing about this movie are the pathetic, but completely dumb dialogues all the time. Come on - smalltalk about emotions of cakes, or laconic statements about hope and love in the face of one's world peril are not just uncredible; they are just nonsense.There is reasonable danger that The Matrix will come down to a second ""Highlander"": A great main movie followed by a bunch of worse and worse sequels, till even the bravest fans will turn away.2/10",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The only aspect of this film worth seeing the poster,"Even The Matrix franchise is not immune to the curse of the trilogies; a curse spanning generations involving the triumphant success of a first film followed by waning enjoyment until a dull and dreary finale. The Dark Knight, The Hobbit, and rumourdly The Godfather, all succumbed to a similar result.Following the cliffhanger of Reloaded, Revolutions fails to deliver what its successors could; namely: a decent plot. With a dull and boring script, this film drags from within the half-hour with minor appearances from the stars (i.e. Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving) leaving yourself to question why this film was made in the first place. Dramatic overacting on the part of minor-characters during overused gun sequences shifts the tone of this movie in a similar direction as Predator rather than the scintillating science-fiction narrative of The Matrix. Never mind the acting, the terrible choreography and extended action-scenes are over-dramatic, with each seeming like an experimental director trying to outdo the complexity of the first two films. With each dragging fight, you are left thinking to yourself: ""When is this going to end?"". The answer is never. The scars left by this movie leave senses of regret for two wasted hours, and moments that should conjure emotions of sadness or happiness, just conjure a feeling of relief that The Wachowski Brothers finally sparred us the torment of yet another cringy line.The film tries to be philosophical and ""clever"" when it is in fact just seeming to use lines you find inside a fortune cookie. It is annoying and frustrating to see a seriously good franchise ruined by the greed to secure more profit for the company.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The ending was a major disappointment,"The Matrix Revolutions is said to be the final installment of the Matrix movies and is said to close out the series. As entertaining as it was it leaves the viewer with unanswered question as the first two did but in a whole different sense. The film certainly puts to rest the rumors that Zion city was part of the matrix. It also has a climactic ending for the future of the city and the battle between Neo and Agent Smith BUT WHAT BECOMES OF NEO??? What becomes of the Matrix world now that the people it contains will have the option to be free...what is to become of those people?All in all it was a good movie but it leaves too many questions with infinite answers we shouldn't be stuck pondering. Quite simply the answers are boring to imagine with the gaping wound of an ending we are left to close. I myself would bet even if it's not for 5 years there just may be ONE final installment. This films plot was simple, the storyline simple and the ending was also very very simple. There was less explanation of things and the films primary action was the battle with the robots. Not a lot of hyped up Kung-Fu fights in this flick. Anyone satisfied by this movie as the final installment has low standards and wasn't expecting or asking for much at all for their dollar. That's quite sad really. Synapsis: dull storyline, great action and the thinnest plot of all three movies. I very much enjoyed it but was left feeling unsettled by the ending and yes some what disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highly Under-rated,"When I first saw this film back in Novemeber 2003, I expected more of the same from what I saw of the two previous installments...and I would have been very happy. But not completely satisfied. Then I went into this film, I sat through it and had an experience I have never had before (and most likely never will again). I was on the edge of my seat for the full runtime. Emotions I'd felt could not be put into words and when it finally ended I didn't know what to make of it. As I made my way home I could not stop thinking about what I had just witnessed. What was the purpose of this film? All sorts of ideas filled my head and I came to one final realization; The purpose was purpose itself. It exists to embody every thought and emotion we feel as we make our way through life. All our philosophical ponderings and revelations crammed into one brilliant trilogy. Obviously portrayed through extremes for entertainment value. But none the less concluded in supreme fashion. This is a modern classic. An achievement for the ages and a grossly under-rated flick. Best viewed with it's prequels in one sitting, the matrix trilogy is the most spectacular film saga I've ever come across. Depriving yourself of it would be a true loss.Even if you somehow miss the multiple messages and themes explored in this gem then you must take note of it's amazing special FX (which only help to emphasize the story and enhance the experience) and breathtaking visuals/direction. The acting is solid, and in some parts excellent. Hugo Weaving and Keanu Reeves both give great performances in this one. Morpheus is somewhat toned down compared to his previous performances (most notably in the first film). However with the misuse of Morpheus aside, the film is perfection in my eyes. What critics and people need to realize is that this film is not typical Hollywood film-making, it's something so much more. And it can only be appreciated if it is viewed through the eyes of someone who is willing to be more open, accept a wide array of themes and focus on the bigger picture, not minor flaws, which often blur your perception of the film. Take it for what it is, a great achievement in it's own right and definitely a landmark in film history. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good and ending as it could have been, but good none the less","Let me start off by saying I was disappointed in this film and overjoyed at the same time, why was overjoyed? Well because the Matrix: Revolutions answers allot of questions left in the second film. why was I disappointed? Well this film was a let down on a major scale it didn't feel like an ending to a great series it felt more like the season finale to a T.V. series, we'd see more of it next season and that didn't feel right to me, If they had given you more than just saying, "" Here you go! A half baked finale With a WTF ending and nothing to explain what happened afterward's."" That's what I felt The Wachowski brother's were saying to us loyal Matrix fans. They left us nothing in the end but the Matrix Revolutions. The half baked, exceedingly brilliant but ultimately flawed finale to The Matrix series.Was this a terrible movie? No, was it a great finale? Some would say so but I'd have to say it borders but this movie is not a bad ending to one of cinema's most complex and intriguing film series. But it leaves nothing to the imagination by this installment we've seen it all all the wire fu , all the philosophical meanings and all the preachy telling's of the war's end and Zion's victory. But is it that that makes this movie an alright finale Instead of an amazing one? Yes. Because Matrix fans have seen it twice already, by this time it's nothing new or anything cool anymore it's just the same stuff done over again. But don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie I really liked it I'm just disappointed there wasn't more. Disappointed that they ended it without no further explanation of Zion of the machines of NEO. It just left you hanging in the wind. The Wachowski brothers did gives us one wild and fun filled ride along the the way with the first two films and I think if you agree with me this one does the same as the first two. But again what it lacks is the eye popping grandeur and mythological sense the first two films, the first in particular, had it gives you a great sense of justice and moral strength but it falls short on the passion it had instead it's lack luster attempt is very cool and stylish but nothing to go ga-ga over.Keanu Reeves( who did well here.) pulls an ace out of his sleeve and again makes this third installment, much like the second, bearable to watch. Hugo Weaving does great with his lines and serves up a good third round as Smith, Fishburne does much better than he did in the second, not by much, but better none the less. Carrie-Anne Moss looks tired and unattractive in this time around(as she did in the second.) she also is again the downside in this third installment, just like the second, she drags along so badly that it's not even funny to watch her talk. Monica Bellucci is a major high point tin this film, as she was in the second she gives it it's worth and a little more strength. Although not in the film much her time on screen is very enchanting. But all in all the cast, most of them, made this film a pretty good third installment.The things you got in the first two movies are not all present in the Matrix: Revolutions. The theme is very much the same, that's in this one. The story is very consistent and connects well with the first two. It doesn't have the same energy that the first two did. But what it does have is great popcorn entertainment style and class. It doesn't quite soar above that but it does come pretty close so is The Matrix: Revolutions a terrible film? No, it's it great fun to watch over and over again? Heck Yeah!! This film is not bad entertainment, it's not great entertainment, but it's not bad. Id' have to call it good entertainment it's a film you can come out of and say, ""Hey that wasn't half bad."" So I'd say it's worth the look and the time. But it's nothing special.All in all Revolutions falls short of the The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded but it does soar above the average film and there is where the secret of it's success lies. This film will give you a great time, nothing mind blowing but a great time none the less. All in all The Matrix: Revolutions is not half bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix Revolutions,"I feel that this movie was unjustly bashed by mainstream America. ""Movie Buffs"" are always bitching that action films have too many explosions and not enough plot. Finally, a movie is released that has a massive plot and the movie buffs bitch that it too much plot(and even on top of that, they bitch that it has too much action). You people don't know what you want. i am ashamed to live in a society where the brilliant Matrix sequels are despised and the horrid Spiderman flicks are exalted to the highest level possible. The reason no one in the states liked it is because it did not have a mainstream ending. Rather, it took the path of a great anime. The ending of the Matrix Revolutions is in the style of pure classic anime, but mainstream America wouldn't know this due to the fact that most anime that is popular in the states is pure crap. Any true anime enthusiast would love the ending of the Matrix as did i. i am positive that this was the intention of the Wachowskis.

Not a bad ending to the trilogy,"So here we are at the end. Story continues straight from where the second ended and as they were filmed together, their styles are identical.As with the 2nd film, there's a lot of unnecessary padding which can be skipped without losing the focus on the main plot.With that in mind, they could have had a lot more focus on the machine city as for me personally, there were 4 elements to the film :1. Big battle in Zion
2. Zero one sequence
3. Final punch-up
4. FinaleThe film does well in completing character story arcs. Unfortunately, it's just three main characters we really care about so film time could have been used more wisely maybe?Overall though, a fairly satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and does make up for the weaker 2nd film. Yes, there are some pretty glaring plot holes but then if they did it all by the book, the film would only be 10 minutes long!A good yarn, some morality questions thrown in there but will always struggle to top the original film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A lie that is bigger than the Matrix itself,"I will start from the conclusion of it all: this movie is bad. Very, very bad. For a number of reasons, as follows.1) It is bad for people who haven't seen The Matrix (very good indeed) nor The Matrix: Reloaded (quite bad, better best avoided). To not-enough-Matrix-educated people, this movie is completely meaningless.2) It is bad for people who don't care about the pseudo-philosophic-religious-apocalyptic-hallucinating plot, but who are a lot into good special effects. None of the visuals that made the first Matrix a milestone in the history of SF movies is featured in the third instalment. You get a glimpse in the first ten minutes, but that's it. The rest is ugly Robocop-like machine-guns shooting and the usual metal squids. Oh, right...also an embarrassing face-to-face with a head-of-machines that reminded me of Tron (it was many many years ago...no Keanu Reeves there, but Jeff Bridges).3) Last but definitely not least, this movie is Bad (capital B) for those who cared even a little bit for the plot. Excuse me? Did I miss anything? Wasn't the One supposed to get rid of the evil machines and destroy the matrix? The ""Gran Finale"" of the Matrix Revolutions simply shuns everything that was left pending at the end of the first movie of the franchise.Shame on W. Bros.

So it comes it this,"To me The Matrix Revolutions is one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I have seen. I enjoyed the first Matrix film and whilst The Matrix Reloaded was rubbish on a plot level it was still good on an action-adventure level. I had hopes that everything would come together in the third part of the trilogy but like many Matrix fans I find it is best to ignore this film.Following straight after the events of The Matrix Reloaded Neo (Keanu Reeves) is trapped in a coma, with his mind in the Matrix like limbo. The machines are only hours away from Zion and everything looks lost for humans. When Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) rescue Neo our hero sets out on a suicide mission to go speak to the machines with Trinity. Morpheus and the rest of the humans go back to Zion. In the Matrix itself Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is taking over and becoming a threat to humans and machines.First the Matrix film was very clever, on a simple level its can be broken down to the world that Neo knew was a computer programme and for knowing that he was able to do whatever he wanted to help fight the Machines. The Wachowski Brothers were able to bring in other references, from 1984 and Alice in Wonderland to Plato to computing and cyberpunk, making complex ideas about reality manageable to a wide audience. But with the sequels however the films became to bogged with the philosophy with ideas of balance, choice, free will, fate, the meaning of words etc.. which felt so force, that the Wachowskis were trying to make the sequels film philosophical. The only people who enjoy it are the kind of young fools who pretty much say 'I'm so clever because I can understand this'. The plot of The Matrix Revolutions became bogged down with all it's subplots and it's ending was a real cop out: SPOILER ALERT that humans and the machines end up in peace together so Neo and Neo ending up defending Smith by becoming a part of him. The Smith part is able breaking the equation but it still was a big let down of an ending Spoiler OVER. The Wachowski seem to be loosing the plot by adding more and more random new ideas into the film, like the limbo train station with The Trainman (Bruce Spence) and Neo being able to see a flaming world and having powers beyond the Matrix. Things just happen for no real reason, there is a lack of a plot and film was an anticlimax.The action itself is decent and perfectly edited by Zach Staenberg, who edited the last two films. But the action can not compete with the levels of the first two films. The first fight between Neo and Smith should have been epic, Neo fighting dozens of clones. It was a fine well edited fist fight but it just lack power and the flying in the sky should have been between Superman vs. General Zod and remind the zero gravity fist fight in Inception (even though that was released 7 years later). I did however enjoy Don Davis operatic music when Neo and Smith first start to fight. The battle of dock was grand and will satisfy action junkies and was a fun sequence, almost like a high-tech Lord of the Rings. But the battle was full of stock characters like the hard ass Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) who gives words of encouragement to Kid (Clayton Watson), Charra (Rachel Blackman) who we never saw before was pretty much a red shirt (a character introduced so that they would die) and Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) is speaks in military clichés. The action in the Matrix world takes a backseat for the most part.A problem in the film is the dark cinematography of Bill Pope (who did good work on the previous films). It made many of the scene more difficult to see much of the action and gives the film a too gloomy atmosphere (which is really saying something). When I watch a film, I want to see what's happening, even in a scene in the dark.Acting wise Reeves is as wooden as ever but that quality works in The Matrix. Other actors like Fishburne, Moss and Weaving were strong, particularly Weaving as Smith, giving important speeches. Ian Bliss was also very good as a villain, giving a great impression of Weaving. And as stated Lennix was offering the most clichéd performance possible.My initial reaction to The Matrix Revolutions was complete hatred. My opinion has soften and I can enjoy the battle of the dock. But I still think this film is a let-down, an anticlimax and a cop-out by the filmmakers.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than the 2nd but still doesn't live up to the first one and again with The Matrix Reloaded, it had too much action and should focus on the story","I did like The Matrix Revolutions but it just might have a little too much action. I indeed say that the action was impressive but the 2nd and this one does not have much realistic 3-D as the 1st one. Again there was not much of a story either. If this had a story like the 1st one, it would've been probably as successful. When the sentinels were attacking Zion was a cool scene and when Neo was fighting Agent Smith for the last time it was indeed cool too. I did enjoy it though but I honestly think this could've been a lot better and I shouldn't of been that anticipated in excitement of seeing this.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And it is almost as if you need to see all three to get to the next level in what the movies were about.I am also thankful of the artful way they dealt with the Oracle.

"Sure, it starts out terribly... but it ends with INCREDIBLE action","Yes... ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a disappointment. Luckily, ""Reloaded"" lowered my expectations supremely with its lack of magic and cohesive narrative. After trudging through the embarrassingly stupid first quarter, I was absolutely FLOORED by Revolutions' last 90 minutes. It's the most incredible sci-fi action I've seen since James Cameron's ""Aliens"" - an adrenaline-pumping, heart- pounding set of tense situations that knocked me on my arse.No, the film isn't thought-provoking or philosophical. Gone is the original sense of awe and wonder that made the first film so fresh and cerebral. Yet the Wachowski Brothers end their series with non-stop CGI fun that was entertaining enough for this viewer to recommend ""Revolutions"" highly.(7 out of 10)P.S.

Throwing pearls to swine,"To all you mediocrities out there whining about how the Wachowskis have sold out and are milking a franchise for all it's worth - I would like to point out that:1. Taking over 60 days to film a 14 minute highway sequence and spending millions of dollars on a single scene is NOT selling out.2. Having your actors train full-time, 5 days a week for several months to meticulously choreographed fight scenes is NOT selling out.Selling out and milking a franchise would be making Friday the 13th Part VIII.If the Wachowskis wanted to simply cash in on your desperate, barren imaginations, they could've done it in 2 days and produced something like Wing Commander.If you're having trouble with all the loose ends and unanswered questions, then may I suggest something a little less straining on your limited intellect, like The Fast and The Furious.  I'm sure that movie has much less ambiguity for your jaded tastes, and will spoon-feed you the answers like you need them.I am by no means a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, nor did I find the last 2 installments particularly good, but Reloaded and Revolutions were, in their own right, entertaining and visually spectacular.  Get off your expectations and what you think Hollywood/the Wachowskis 'OWE' you.  If you're too cheap to spend 10 bucks or whatever it costs you to take a chance on someone else's efforts and achievements, then just stay home and watch TV all day. Like any notable work of its time, The Matrix series will be looked upon by history as something wasted on the cynical, uncomprehending and unappreciative rabble it was released to.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Craptacular!,"While Reloaded may have been simply a disappointing sequel, substituting story and originality with gonzo effects and 'coolness' so beloved in the first film, this film is a spectacular disaster. it is horrible on so many levels. The music in reloaded was derivative and lacked the energy of the first, but this film's music was just flat out bad. As in like annoyingly bad. Like I wanted to shoot somebody bad.The 'plot' is pretty non-existent and the film takes place mostly in the 'real world' and doesn't even involve the main characters. It's as if Keanu, Carrie-Ann and Lawrence filmed this around their golf schedule. well over half the movie focuses on minor characters who lack personality or development and none of whom we care one iota about. The film is so bad it even resorts to using the horrid cliché of the bumbling young recruit saving the day.I would rank the film as ""horrible"" if just for not answering a single question posed by Reloaded, however, the abysmal storyline, acting, music, editing and dismissal of main characters make it impossible for me to rate this film anything over a 2 out of 10 (and those 2 points are solely for a couple of impressive effects shots). This film is an F in every way, as bad and laughable as cinematic catastrophes like Battlefield: Earth or Showgirls.Perhaps the Wachowski's were truly just 2-hit wonders (Bound & the Matrix) and after that have nothing left to say.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

WHY THE MATRIX IS BRILLIANT,"In response to bad reviews of Matrix Revolutions film, I try and shed some light on its significance.  Despite practically every critic slamming it, I want to give you my perspective.  It does not give you all the truths to the film, but hopefully you will have a much higher appreciation for it.  I warn readers, DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED.From day one, the Matrix saga has kept up a theme that lived within the character's actions and names.  I am not talking about simple representations of names, but on a much deeper level how they react because of those names.  The first Matrix film opened up our eyes to another world and reality, and did it simply, and therefore it was good.  Yet, I ask you, does the finest poetry or best piece of art have to completely explain itself.  Of course not.  But, unfortunately critics are not ready for a film of this poetic magnitude.Reloaded and Revolutions gradually unveil the machine's true intentions and motivations through very, and I mean very, subtle cues.  Whether or not you'll be astonished by this truth, I am not sure, but the Matrix IS completely fueled by religious beliefs, which in turn give the human race hope and PURPOSE.  I am not talking about praying at mass here, I'm talking about everything we know about Greek mythology or Christianity lives and breaths in the Matrix, and was created by machines.  Why you may ask?  How else could they control an entire species of intellectuals who do not have a purpose or hope in enslavement.  How about the ones that specifically reject the matrix?  Will more and more keep rejecting it?  No, religion is made by the machines to keep humans in their slumber.  Yet, this is not necessarily a malicious intent.  If you watched the animatrix prequel you would understand the unusual sympathy that the machines give human despite their cruelties.  It is a war going on, BUT the machines keep the humans in their tubes until it is proven that peace is possible.  Machines are the logical creatures in the world, they do what they need to survive based on equations, and they are waiting for the time that they can once again co-exist with humanity without having it as a mathematical threat.  That's where NEO comes in.  Neo is obviously a Christ/ Jesus/ messiah character. Yet it is ironic that he is most likely less human than everyone else. Neo, meaning one, has no family whatsoever, he constantly questions as illustrated though Neo asking `why' every 5 seconds in all 3 films.  Neo is most likely 'grown' or constructed by the machines.  Whoa.  Too much to handle?  Let me give you some more background material before I go on.First of all, let's clear some names.  Merovingian is closely linked to Hades.  In fact he is Hades, and his wife as the tale suggests is Persephone, Monica Belluci.  He controls the passage between worlds.  The train man controls purgatory.  Seraph, the Oracle's protector, is defined as the highest level of angel.  What does he do in the movie?  He's essential a guardian angel that protects.  Now, the biggest truth. what is the Oracle? The oracle is the human god, in fact the New Testament God.  It is a program made by the machines with a lot of power to give us hope.  GOD must therefore have a human sentiment; unlike the Architect who represents the Old Testament God (the two are obviously very different in the movie and Bible).  Yet, the Oracle like the Christian New Testament God knows everything and is all-powerful, but can not control free will.  That is why she can not decide what CHOICES people will make, especially Neo.  Neo is the most interesting of them all.  Like Jesus who was made in our image but given God's power.  Neo is made in our image with god-like (the supreme god of everything is the machine god - face at end of film) machine powers. When Neo chooses to not make the LOGICAL, mathematical choice of choosing to save the human race, but rather picks the other door to save trinity, he does it for emotion; something a machine is not supposed to understand. Granted I can not argue that neo is a machine, but it's possible.  It's possible that he is super-genetically created by the machines. Nevertheless, the machines somehow give Neo his powers.  Likewise, Agent Smith is created like Jesus (through Death) but is his negative, or the anti-Christ, the being that will bring judgment day with it to destroy everyone (takes over everyone's body)As Neo starts to understand what he has to do in Purgatory, the train station, he can finally make the jump from hell (Zion) to heaven (machine city).  This stuff is highly Dante symbolized.  As Neo goes to the machine city, or Paradiso, he can not bring Trinity and he has to be blind.  Dante was blinded by the lights (think about all the lights that Neo saw) and could not face God, sorry it had to be a machine people. but it is.  Also for your information, Morpheus most likely symbolizes Virgil in Dante, because he can bring people back and forth through the worlds but not to heaven and he is the guide.  Neo then sacrifices himself, just like Jesus did, so that peace can be restored, and the gates (of heaven) could be opened.  The machines accept the peace because Neo gave away everything for the love of the human race, including himself.  If he is somehow machine, it is more powerful that he has learned to love his enemy (TRINITY) and proves that humans are now ready for peace.  Therefore the architect says at the end of the film that whoever wants to go will be able to, meaning that the Neo has finally opened the gates even if it is more of a figurative sense. The other 5-6 neo's did not accomplish this task.  They could not sacrifice themselves for emotion.  They did not understand love and they would not give up everything to make change, just as Jesus did.If you do not trust my convictions, research for yourself the Judgment day in the bible.  Research Dante's inferno, purgatorio and paradise.  Then look up and research each of the character's names and how that relates to the movie.  You will find yourself very surprised that everything seems to line up.  Obviously there are many more questions to answer, and I do not have them.  I find it completely fascinating that Wachowski brothers have created a modern Dante tale without anyone knowing it.  I think most people were not ready to accept that religion is both artificial and real in this film world, and that even though religion might be fake in the matrix world it still does its purpose even in the real world.  I find it absolutely fascinating that the Wachowski brothers have taken everything we visualize about the afterlife, and made it into a sci-fi universe, where heaven is actually a machine world and hell is a multi-leveled human city under ground.  These ideas are all just as profound as the first matrix, but they did not shove it into our face and give us definite answers.  The Wachowki brothers, on the other hand, had the ability because of their freedom (made so much money) that they could make art and not worry what the critics would say.  I apologize that this is a winded and more of some kind of Emersonian train of thought explanation, but hopefully this will help people change their minds about it.  Time will tell if the Matrix Revolutions is as profound as I believe it to be.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, but it Rocked","If you're not a fan of kung fu movies, science fiction movies, war movies, Keanu Reeves' flawless complexion, Laurence Fishburne's pocked complexion, or movies with strong biblical (the New Testament) references, then the final installment in The Matrix Trilogy is not for you. You probably didn't like the first or the second installments, and will be truly disappointed with the third.Let's get a few things straight first. Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, and neither were its predecessors. There are at least two plot twists that are cliched. There are some questions that remain unanswered from The Matrix Reloaded. The language is stilted, but that was a fault/plus of all The Matrix movies. (It is in my opinion that the stilted language was a stylization by the directors of the movie. It's supposed to flow along like a church hymn. You're supposed to follow the rhythm, and not necessarily the words.) The Matrix, the original, continues to be a stand-alone movie. The movie didn't really require 2 more sequels to answer its mysteries. With all that said, see Matrix Revolutions because it rocked.The Matrix is still the best in the series, but Matrix Revolutions wraps up things very nicely. I will not give away any plot developments, except to say that maybe you should read the New Testament. The pseudo philosophical and spiritual overtones of Revolutions are not as heavy, muddled or as vague as in the first two movies. The spiritual lesson taught in this movie is simple: You must never give up faith. As a person at the beginning of her spiritual quest, I appreciate the messages and questions the Warchowski (sp?) brothers throw into this series. However, it is a movie and not a religious text.Most of the scenes in the movie take place in the ""real world,"" so there aren't many visuals of Morpheus in his green 'gator shoes, Trinity in her liquid latex cat suit, or Naiobi in her to-die-for Bantu knots. What you do see is a group of ragged people fighting for peace, and trying not to lose their faith. What you do see is Neo trying to figure out his place in this universe. The Matrix Revolutions does have the hold-your-breath chases, fight scenes, and battles against the machines. (I dare you not to gasp when swarms of machines break through the walls of Zion. It is all at once beautiful and petrifying.)Matrix Revolutions is definitely a must see. The ending of the film will require some post-viewing analysis, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great action film to take you out of your self for a couple of hours. Even if the movie were to shed its religious pretensions, it would still be a great action film to see on the big screen. Don't listen to the haters. Have faith that it will be worth the $10 you invested to see it. Peace!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bizarro Neo,"Greetings again from the darkness.  OK, the trilogy is over.  Neither of the sequels stand up to the fascinating and ground breaking first, but despite the script flaws and oft-lacking dialog, all three stand as tremendous action/special effects movies.  Revolutions tries to tie up the loose ends regarding purpose and especially death.  Keanu and Carrie-Ann are off screen for way too long during the battle to save the dock.  Hugo Weaving, as Mr. Smith, is again both entertaining and frightening, but he also is off screen for extended periods.  Jada Pinkett Smith looks great, but could have probably pulled off her role in the last 2 without the hours of training. She gets to flaunt very little of her powered-up body.  The best movies rely on the story and characters.  The Matrix trilogy began with an interesting story and screwed it up.  Its best characters were there til the end, but somehow we are left unfulfilled.  The action, on the other hand, is probably beyond compare up to this point in cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best Possible Ending,"I have never minded being in the minority, so I'll just come out and say it: The Matrix Revolutions is an ending worthy of the Wachowskis' groundbreaking trilogy.The key to understanding the Matrix films is to unpeel the onion; reveal the layers.  I believe that you have to understand The Matrix before you watch Reloaded, and you have to understand (as best you can) Reloaded before watching Revolutions. Those who dismissed Reloaded after a cursory glance will certainly not be able to grasp the significance of the Revolutions.That said, it is certainly not a perfect film.  Its weakest point is in the action rising toward the climax.  There is a time, during the great battle, when we lose track of the hero's personal conflict.  The epic battle between man and machine is extraordinary, and unlike certain scenes in Reloaded, it didn't seem to be about showing off, but there is a time where we lose the momentum of the protagonist's journey.    Of course, it all ties together in the end, but when the audience has to work to connect the two plot threads, it weakens the payoff.The other problem that stood out was the introduction of ""Red Shirt"" characters in this film. (Fans of Star Trek know what I'm referring to.)  These are the characters that are introduced for the sole purpose of performing an important action and then dying. However, I can't really fault the Wachowskis for this, because no one has ever figured out how to handle these characters.Ultimately, the Matrix Revolutions answers many of the questions the first two films raised, but fortunately, not all of them.  It leaves some issues open for discussion, which shows that it's still possible to make a film in Hollywood without using a ""Hollywood Ending.""Bottom line.....watch Reloaded again, and then go see Revolutions!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
People are simply not ready for this kind of films,"First of all, we have to consider the great crisis that people are having with ""being critics"" in the film industry. Now a days we see people enjoying a movie just because it offers them a nice relaxing moment, no need to think about the story itself, but even worse, people still maintain their conception en thinking that a movie must have its traditional ending and easy going dialogs that don't include any benefit in the real world. Matrix is an exception, we have to consider that its the first movie to ever bring up a new conception of filming and even better, bring real time statements of humanity's problematic existence. I now that the the movie suffered many changes through its trilogy development (many because of the director's ambitions and the industry's demands), but the plot itself and the essence of the story is still there. Just because a great majority of the people cant get use to this kind of stories and this new way of creating cinematography, is a demonstration of the lack of interest from the audience in having real-dealing-problem movies. A person that considers himself a critic simply because he focuses in the superficial aspects, shouldn't be called a critic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More Action, Less Talk","I must be weird, because I haven't found anyone else that has the same opinion as I do about The Matrix Trilogy. The first one was obviously fantastic, but I hated the second one. Therefore, I expected to hate the third one, only to be pleasantly surprised by what I saw.My chief complaint against The Matrix Reloaded is that it relied too heavily on philosophy mumbo-jumbo that I just couldn't follow it; that is, if I really wanted to. This time around, things were still a little confusing. It started a little slow, and the ending was a bit questionable, but everything in between was action-packed.The Mechwarrior-like weapons the people of Zion used were quite impressive and fun to watch. The whole battle at Zion just had so much going on that you can't help but marvel at the level of special effects this movie achieves. The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was quite impressive also. After all the battles they've had over the trilogy, I didn't know how this one can be any different or any more special, but the Wachowski brothers definitely raised it up to another level.Like I said, this movie is still pretty confusing. However, if you read other reviews or visit some Matrix sites, things get a little clearer and will give you a different perspective. All in all, though, The Matrix Revolutions is a pretty fun, action-packed sci-fi extravaganza.My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nothing worth seeing...,"The downward spiral from Reloaded continues in this dreary conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. In short, the biggest problem is that it shouldn't have been more than one film. The original brought new exciting visual effects, and a story that had some interesting points. Also, the blend of sci-fi, action, and a noir-ish visual look, oozed of COOL.The sequels are just boring, and feel forced to begin with, as the first film pretty much showed everything you wanted to see, and managed a satisfying ending. Reloaded and Revolutions tries to expand on the mythology, and philosophy of the original resulting in a very heavy handed exposition of talky Oracles and Architects. It was much better just hearing about Zion, than seeing that it was basically a big cave where dreary zombies in a sort-of-Star-Trek counsel had endless discussions about if/why/where they would send ships. Suddenly, the audience was supposed to care about new characters (who does nothing more than look miserable) instead of following the heroes from the first Matrix (in this one Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are mere supporting characters).Revolutions was hyped for having an awesome battle in Zion as well as one final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith - but both these ""highlights"" are just run-of-the-mill CGI frenzys, that cannot stand up to any of the action scenes in the first film. The Wachowskis' seem to have been blinded by their own excellence, and the thirst for making huge sums of money. In the process, they've forgotten what made the first Matrix so great. Like the latest Star Wars films, Reloaded and Revolutions fail to bring anything new onto the screen.The actors don't look like they're having any fun, and neither had I.

Better than Reloaded. But not perfect.,"I have seen Matrix Revolutions on this opening day.

Adequate sci-fi,"On its own, The Matrix Revolutions is fine sci-fi. However, when it's inevitably compared to the original, The Matrix, it is disappointing. The more interesting comparison is to Reloaded, where Revolutions actually stands a chance. Unfortunately, even there, Revolutions is still a technical step down. The editing is less dynamic, the cast is watered down, and the overall direction is not as focused. Reloaded may have been misguided, but at least it had clear intentions. Generally, Revolutions feels somewhat generic. The action is more forgettable and the plot is average. The magic of the original is mostly lost here.Yet, Revolutions isn't all bad. For one, it is far more concise than its predecessor. Revolutions isn't as intellectually ambitious as Reloaded, but it's also less obnoxious. The film falls into common sci-fi tropes but does so with relative efficiency. Plus, many Wachowski staples are still present: the cinematography is striking, the music is dramatic, the sound is flashy, and the production design is extravagant. The Wachowskis may have fumbled the script, but this project was constructed with noticeable craft. Thus, despite the dichotomy of honoring/failing its origins, Revolutions actually lands in-between as an adequate film.Writing: 4/10

what was it about this movie?,"Was it the hype? Was it that people got so blinded by their love of the first one and (tepid toleration?) of the second one that they said they enjoyed this movie? I mean, Revolutions is up there with Gigli, in the ranks of the worst of 2003. Here we observe the utter disintegration of the trilogy - the characters are now forcefully and unnecessarily dramatic to add to the finality of this episode, the plot consists of primarily one extraneously long battle in which things die, noises are made and things explode (and tears are shed so as to dispel the rumor that special effects have entirely replaced storytelling and character development), and martial arts is almost entirely gone. In reality, there is nothing original about this movie. It spews its usual dosage of philosophical babble (which would be interesting, if not for the fact that it has become more of a fad in this movie rather than a sincerely thoughtful deliberation), it asks yet again ""is Neo the One?"" (Jesus, does it matter anymore?) and it answers its question with a wavering ""I can't make up my mind, but let's blow stuff up while I ruminate"" And it was boring. It was almost as if the Wachowski Brothers were attempting to stretch a dying ending into a two hour movie - and trying to spend a lot of money doing it. In any case, to sum up, after seeing this movie I yearned for the original Matrix, and my tepid tolerance of Matrix Reloaded turned to warm acceptance. But maybe that's just an experience in juxtaposition.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the master pieces of our time!!!!,"It was the second time that I watched the trilogy that I was able to appreciate its real beauty that lies in the way the story has been written by imagining the world from an entirely different angle and weaving such an intelligent plot around it. The first time I saw it, all I was able to appreciate was the action sequence and the stylish phones. But the second time, the dialogues and the plot made so much sense and I really really enjoyed it this time at an altogether different level.I must admit, there still are things that I don't understand and for those I am definitely going to watch the trilogy again because it's totally worth it.......",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Matrix trilogy ends on a disappointing note,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the third film in the Matrix trilogy. Picking up where the second film left off, this one is split between two separate attempts to repel the machine army: one spear-headed by Commander Lock and the other led by Neo.Much of what can be said about this film is a continuation of the criticisms levelled at the second film in the trilogy. Once again the visuals are top-notch but they are of little consequence in a film that gets bogged down in philosophy and trying to top the effects of the previous films.The cast is basically the same as in the previous film so you should know exactly what to expect there. However, the part of the Oracle had to be re-cast because Gloria Foster passed away while the previous film was still shooting. The screenwriters wrote this change into the script but I didn't quite buy it.The Wachowski's can't be faulted for the look of the film as it upholds the high standard set by ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The music is once again above average and fitting for the material as well. However, the film is little more than an attractive package with disappointing contents.I wouldn't necessarily say that the second & third Matrix films ought to be ignored but there's no question that they represent a noticeable drop in quality from the first film. They're still above-average action flicks but they don't come close to capturing the magic of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

missed opportunity,"I expected so much from this movie and got so little. I may be in something of a minority here but I loved Reloaded, maybe even more than the original. The complex exploration of the nature of the Matrix in that film widened the scope of the story arc into new territory, seemingly opening up a plethora of possible revelations to be revealed in 'Revolutions'. Disappointingly, the makers completely abandoned this approach in favour of what boils down to an almighty scrap. Granted, the film does resolve the question of Neo's 'purpose' in the Matrix and beyond, but virtually all the other tantalizing plot threads from the previous two films have been left hanging. Instead we get a story which essentially focuses only on the 'battle for Zion', and some extremely heavy-handed religious symbolism. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy films to leave endings open, but there's a difference between leaving the audience guessing and blatantly abandoning or losing plot threads. To me that just smacks of either poor plotting or, more likely, a way to get more cash from us. The previous two films were intelligent and thought-provoking, but the Wachowskis seem to have missed the enormous potential this story had, and have ended up with little more than a big, dumb action movie with a ridiculously simple 'conclusion'.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good action like before, but with average acting and a mediocre ending.","As with the prequel, the film does not repeat itself and the story progresses, but it's more or less the same thing. They fight, they talk, they get injured, and they fight some more. To be honest I'm a little disappointed by the way it turned out. The story is still interesting enough to hold your attention, and the action still engaging (though again, prolonged) but it doesn't really do anything for me. I'm following along, but I don't feel connected to the characters anymore.Keanu Reeves' character is pretty stoic and just so flat-toned, that to have most of the characters dependent on his character doesn't support the film enough. There are others, for example in Zion who fight the battle without really depending on Neo to save them, and that was a good addition. It was interesting to watch Gaye's and Watson's character develop and that was missing from the protagonist. Character development.The ending was pretty sad, but then again too easy. The thing is, movies only focus on 'the special one' and not on the previous failed versions. The film establishes that Neo is not the first, but we aren't given any credible information on to why the others failed and why stoic Neo is the special one – apart from the fact that he can love. Oh, maybe that's why he's stoic, because he's more machine than human?Still, the series could have been better with more character development, and instead of the similar happenings whenever certain characters meet.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i'm sorry the ending was awful,"I enjoyed the entire show up until the last five minutes, and the bogus hollywood ending blew the whole movie for me. What a beautiful sunrise, what a happy ending!There is apparently no consistency between the plot lines of the Matrix, Reloaded, and Revolutions. Wasnt the Matrix supposed to crash if the code Neo carried wasnt reinserted? The architect will free more and more people to join the folks in Zion who are going to be happy to live under ground forever and never bother the machines again? I dont think so.More likely, there will be another One created by the architect to stabalize the ever decaying Matrix, and the Machines will once again wipe out Zion as the humans try to branch out due to their ever increasing population thanks to the architect freeing people. This whole process will start over again so these movies really accomplished nothing plot wise.Dont get me wrong the first two are among my favorite movies of all time. I suppose thats what makes this one so dissapointing. The sunrise at the end almost made me gag it was so contrived and corny.I can only hope that the DVD will contain alternate endings.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than Critics Say,"For those that say that Revolutions destroys the Matrix series:What do you want? Really?Neo can't discover the Matrix...again (unless they did the idiotic thing of a Matrix within a Matrix...thank god they didn't).No can't discover that he is The One....again.These two facts ARE the origional movie.  Really, there isn't much else other than shooting up agents and other people. (which both of the other movies do much of).  It was very clear that the main focus on these people's minds were winning the war against the machines, and thats what the last two movies are about.My main beef with Matrix isn't what it is, but what it could have been. The Merovingian has a little part, and NO TWINS...sad I know.  There were also other possibilities that they didn't take advantage of.  However, saying that, this is an incredibly awesome movie.

When good ideas go bad in the fridge..,"So we come at last to the third part in a once promising SF series. After endless cod philosophy rot, bloodless Xbox battles in Matrix Reloaded and more pointless dialogue scenes than Phantom Menace (Another film that failed on almost every level).And speaking of battles, let's discuss battle fatigues. It's action movie 101. When you constantly have armies yelling ""Raaaahhhhh!!!"" at machines while shooting more bullets than John Rambo and John Matrix combined, man does it get old fast. The Wachowskis should've taken lessons from Peter Jackson's Two Towers. In the middle of the melee of Helm's Deep, it cuts to Treebeard with fellow ents, talking to hobbits.The point is, you have to give the audience time to breath or they suffer from ennui. It's exhausting sitting through the last 38 minutes of battles in Zion, battles with sentinels, battles with agent Smith. Sure, it's all very slick and well choreographed, but it's like being beaten over the head with a 2×4 while playing PlayStation.I understand movie goers want a big action spectacle finale, but not this excessive. it goes on for waaaay too long.

Huge Misfire & Huge Disappointment,"Like Reloaded, Revolutions pretended to be smart and philosophical by over-dressing it with obscure references to ""choice"" and ""destiny"" (oh the clichés), but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. The best thing they did was put a sock over Keanu's eyes for part of this movie.  At least we avoided seeing him try and act sad.  This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. This third installment rips off everyone from Daredevil to Jesus.  Their `savior' Neo... well it's obvious. We see blind Neo `see' using a strikingly similar shadow world concept. Daredevil anyone?

Quickly becoming a very underrated film.,"There seems to be a lot of controversy over what rating to give to Revolutions. It would seem that this is being fueled by a serious passion for the Matrix series and ultimately a big let down to many fans.I myself, enjoyed the film. There's no question that it wasn't as good as the Matrix, but few films have been. The concern I have is that people are becoming angry that it wasn't as good. Case in point, have a look at the user rating results break down on this site. Over 1,000 movie lovers have rated this film a ""1"". Another 1,000 see it as a ""2"" or ""3"".Keep in mind, these are no average moviegoers, these are IMDB members. Consider the absurdity of rating this film a ""1"". The Matrix Revolutions, in and of itself, is still a good if not great action film. It is well made... great sound... great effects... stunning costumes and set design... well choreographed fight scenes... so-so dialog and acting... still an interesting story, but no Pulp Fiction.Then what we are left with is a well crafted film with some minor flaws and an 800 pound gorilla on its back (Being part of the original Matrix franchise).Anyway, assuming you have already voted for this film and are still reading this, I would urge you to recast your vote with less retribution in mind. If you would like to see some movies that really might deserve a 1 out of 10, I suggest renting some classic Ed Wood films, or anything that stars Anna Nicole Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
one cliché after another,"The strongest quality of the original ""Matrix"" was its writing; none of the CGI or goofy political subversiveness or borrowed Asian mysticism would have patched very neatly to the dark, even ugly, ""cyberpunk"" reality envisioned in the film had the script been any weaker. But the dialog actually drove the story, and without a lot of fancy words.Outside of the fact that the direction is a mess, and the characters no longer know what they're doing there (and neither do the actors) and the CGI has become self-indulgent bloat, the weakest part of this film is its writing. The dialog is just one cliché after another - any Star Wars fan could have written it. The story, which no longer depends on the dialog, but rather on the flatulent visuals, is part Hong Kong action film, part old fashioned war movie, and part Star Trek rehash. The whole cyberpunk angst that made the first film fascinating, has utterly disappeared: in fact an ""explanation"" is provided (or rather hinted at) that all worlds are equally real - and equally false, since programmed by some intergalactic super race - a real cop-out.The ending of the film - I won't give it away, but it is neither as satisfying as that of ""Dark City"" nor as amusing as that of ""Men in Black"".Further evidence that Hollywood producers have nothing better to do with their money but flush it down the toilet.

The Best in my opinion,"The Matrix was born in summer of 1999, it opened up a whole new way of film making and created a buzz around Hollywood that had not been heard since the reign of Star Wars back in 1977, the movie opened to rave reviews by critics and among every filmgoer in the world asked the question `What is the Matrix'?   I am still trying to figure that out because the Matrix isn't the easiest of films to understand but there's nothing wrong with a little bit of thinking now is there.In summer 2002 we were treated with the Matrix Reloaded which didn't get the warmest of welcomes but in time and I think it will be appreciated for setting up the third instalment which has just been released The Matrix Revolutions which holds the tagline `Every Beginning has an End', I won't tell if that statement is true, you'll have to go and see that for yourself and it's fair to have you're opinion on films, but I thought he was being a bit harsh to tell you the truth, because I don't think Revolutions lives up to the first instalment but I am someone who didn't actually like the first one as it just wasn't a film I connected with and when I captured the grand ore of Reloaded and I found myself believing in the Matrix as it became more apparent to what the whole story was about and I actually think Revolutions is the epic film out of the trilogy we have been waiting for. It starts off where Reloaded finished and you are straight away sucked back into the war which is about to happen between the humans and the machines, but you do get the feel that you are watching a film which is way over you're head, but the longer it goes on the more we see what is about to happen.    Neo is in a coma after fighting off the sentinels at the end of Reloaded, Trinity and Morpheus are coming up with solutions to what to do next and Agent Smith is just trying to rule everything with his army of clones.    The acting is very good, not superb but you can't have everything, the dialogue is above standard with the odd giggle from time to time, and the battle scenes alone hold this film to be a contender to be one of the best films in the trilogy. The idea of the films was the first would be deal with Birth, the second would deal with life and the third would be about Death, so it comes across that Neo is Jesus in a futuristic land trying to save everybody except himself, because that's another thing that the films deals with and that's sacrifice.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They were simply brilliant. The plot was somewhat engaging, and many of the questions from the second film were answered. The film moves along pretty quickly, although it does intentionally slow down at several points.Overall, this was much, much better than Part II, which I found confusing and inappropriate at times (too much bumping and grinding for a franchise this popular).

Here we go.......again! Yawn.,"Less than 6 months after the underwhelming Reloaded, here comes Revolutions. And it's similarly underwhelming. Not quite as much as Reloaded, because it did have its moments. But all in all, not as good a conclusion as I had hoped. In fact, I begin to fear it's not a conclusion at all, but just the beginning of a long running franchise, possibly doomed to the likes of mini-series and TV movies, with unknown actors replacing the real stars and the whole thing ending up in an unhealthy, Galactica 1980 kind of stupidity.That said, Revolutions is better than Reloaded. The dock combat sequence was very interesting, though the combat mechanoids are not a new idea by any stretch of the imagination. In fact the APU's are not even particularly well designed, from a combat point of view - those dangling ammunition belts are just woefully wrong and entirely out of place in anything except a Rambo film.The sentinels swirled around like a shoal of fish, which was a nice visual touch, but I couldn't for the life of me understand why, once that many of them (thousands) had gotten into Zion, they didn't simply swarm over the defenders like bees from all sides at once. Would have made for boring cinema, I guess, but not very realistic. There were also a number of scenes involving shoulder launched missiles that reminded me all too much of Starship Troopers. Also, didn't the sentinels throw bombs in the first movie? Why didn't they do that in Zion?At least Revolutions didn't have the sickly sweet, everything turns out fine for everyone, ending that Hollywood tiresomely trots out again and again. A main character dies! Love does not conquer all. Good doesn't triumph over evil without batting an eyelid. All good points in an otherwise lacklustre movie. Other good things include fewer endless martial arts scenes where the fight goes on, and on, and on, like everyone has Duracell's fitted.A lot of plot points, which fans hoped would be explained, were glossed over, ignored, or given stupid answers. For example, Neo's ability to use his powers outside of the Matrix we are told is ""because he is the One"" and that's it. Pseudo-religious crap. And there's a limbo-like area between the Matrix and the Real World. More pseudo-religious crap. There are also several more ""psycho-babble"" moments where exposition goes crazy and you end up gritting your teeth, hoping the film will actually continue before too much longer, so that you don't start to nod off. Another thing which bugged me - the ships have EMP devices, but Zion does not? The number one way of defeating sentinels and the Zionists (yet more pseudo-religion there) don't think its a good idea to run up a few score spares? Instead they resort to men in armoured suits and bullets. Hmmmm. This kind of ""let's write an exciting story, but not think what people would actually do in such a situation"" writing is what really pi$$es me off with cinema today. Sure, the initial viewing may be favourable, because we can all overlook such things, but re-watch factor becomes less and less when we have our intelligence insulted by such awful plot failings.By the way, am I the only person who finds the Oracle to get increasingly irritating as the movies have progressed? So smug, so ""know-it-all"". Gah! Shame she doesn't get her program erased!On the bright side, my enjoyment of the film was boosted immensely by the appearance of Bruce Spence as the ""The Train Man"". Nice to see him on film again. A small role, but worth it.All in all another underwhelming movie that cannot live up to its hype, or the success of the original. Mostly down to the FX crews ever raising the bar of our visual expectations. The extraordinary is now ordinary and we demand something spectacular in order to be wowed. Revolutions has its moments, and is worth watching, but its nothing special anymore.The original will continue to have a place in my DVD collection, but I'll not be shelling out cash for the sequels.

"Honestly, what were they thinking?","Having seen ""Matrix Revolutions"" today at a press screening in Germany, I can't help to be disappointed, and very much so. Considering the vast possibilities of the storyline after the end of ""Reloaded"" (when the idea of a Matrix within the Matrix seemed almost certain and the fate of Neo had just gained an immensely multi-layered dimension), what the Wachowski Brothers now present as a conclusion is too simple and easy to believe. It almost feels like their audience understood better what potential lay in their story than they did themselves. And that can never be a good thing.An O.K. movie if you just take it for itself and judge it by the usual standards - and if you can still enjoy the awesome visual style and the pitch-perfect action sequences - ""Matrix Revolutions"" is almost a complete failure seen as the closure of the trilogy that has already revolutionized modern cinema.

"Maybe you just have to ""get it""","There are lots of negative reviews of this movie, yet at the time of this writing, it is running a 6.4/10 in the voting section, so clearly there are those who like it. Count me as one of them, despite going in with full knowledge of the beating this film was taking in the opinion arena.To preface, let me say that I loved Matrix, and disliked Matrix II.  Too much enigma-speak, too many unanswered questions, to much raver partying. To be fair, Matrix II suffers from 'tween syndrome, having to act as a bridge between the first and third movies.People say that Matrix Revolutions fails to answer the questions and mysteries raised in Reloaded, which is true to a certain extent. But some of these questions are answered and others are revisited but still remain unanswered. That's the way things are sometimes, folks! Sometimes you have to try to formulate your own interpretation of what you see. Some people, when not spoon-fed the ""answers"", become irate, and claim that the filmmakers were lazy or that the reason they can't figure things out is that there is nothing to understand. Wrong! This movie clearly has as much symbolism and as many references to classical literature and mythology as the first movie. It's up to the viewer to look for it.Granted, this movie is harder to follow than Matrix I. If your grasp of the storyline jumps the tracks before the end, the whole film may come across as a jumble of unconnected action sequences and empty mysticism. But if you ""get"" what's happening, you will see how things have consistently developed through the 3 movies and how the ending of Revolutions really could not have happened any other way. It's not about Zion, it's not about the Oracle, it's not about Trinity or Morpheus or any or any of the other humans. It's about Neo and Smith, not representing good and evil, but life and anti-life. In that situation, even the machines choose life.Is everything perfect? No. I wholeheartedly agree that the suspension of disbelief gets strained at times, particularly in regards to the lack of EMP devices at Zion and the curious behavior of the sentinels during the battle scenes. But compared to the real story of Neo and Smith, the actions scenes were just there to fill in the time.In summary, I found this installment to be a cohesive, well-crafted conclusion to the trilogy. Go into it expecting to apply a little brain power, because no one is going to hold your hand and explain it all at the end. But there are enough of us who ""get it"" to assure everyone that there are rational interpretations to what you see. We may not agree on what ""it"" is, but that sometimes happens with art.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A very good conclusion to an amazing trilogy of films,"OK, let me first say that the first ""Matrix"" film is a crowning achievement. It stands on its own, and can appeal to most mainstream audiences. Most anyone can understand the plot.But with ""Reloaded"" and especially ""Revolutions,"" even the most hardcore sci-fi fans who usually get these kinds of films walked out of the last two scratching their heads. When walking out of ""Reloaded,"" they assumed that they'd get clearer answers in ""Revolutions,"" so most people cut ""Reloaded"" some slack (even though it's just as convoluted as ""Revolutions""). This is why ""Revolutions"" is the most maligned Matrix film. The plots of the sequels was just too convoluted for mainstream audiences, and ""Revolutions"" didn't offer the clear explanations audiences were looking for.They couldn't figure out why Neo had power outside the Matrix. Why could he stop Sentinels by thinking it? Why could he still see after being blinded by Bane, and see in a different way for that matter? The first film established how to get power within the Matrix, but that outside of the Matrix he was just another ordinary, but machine-engineered human being. So what was all this about?Why was Bane also Smith? How could Smith be in the real world in someone's body?How did Neo separate his mind from his body and end up at the Train Station place? What IS the Train Station?What was the deal with the family of programs at the Train Station who were smuggling their daughter out? What specifically was Sati all about? They sort of make a big deal of her, especially at the end.Why did the Oracle's appearance change (aside from the original actress dying before the third film was made)?How exactly was Smith destroyed in the end? How exactly was peace made between the Machines and Man? Why not just have a plot where they destroy the Matrix?What was the Merovingian (the French Man) all about? What was his purpose?What was Seraph all about?Zion was destroyed 5 times before without the Zion peoples' knowledge? How is that possible? Why did it occur? How and why were there 5 ""Ones"" before Neo?Getting the answers to these questions is imperative to enjoying the plot. And yet, the answers are very, very vague in the film. So because of that, most people just thought that the Wachowski Brothers copped out and made a special effects film that's all style and no substance.But the answers are there, and if one thinks about it, the film makes perfect sense. They just don't shove it all in your face like we're used to seeing with most films. So if one can actually grasp what the directors were trying to convey in the plot, for me anyway, becomes a much more enjoyable piece of cinema.I won't go into answering all the questions above, but if you check out www.thematrix101.com , you'll find mostly what is needed to enjoy the plot.Get over your first impression of the film if it was negative and check out that website for some answers. Perhaps if you understand the film, you might like it after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the conclusion of the saga,"i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix Revolutions is a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wake Up!,"So many people have maligned this film and its sister, but have not given an intelligent reason as to why they have done so. If you find a movie too intellectually stimulating or complex for your enjoyment, this is hardly anyone's fault except the individual who cannot be bothered to think. The Matrix films are not designed to save the world or bring us to a higher plane of existence.  They are movies.  They are fun. The philosophies contained therein borrow everything from Socratic ""I only know that I know nothing"" to Sartrean ""I am, therefore I think."" (It's Decartes, not Sartre, who said ""I think, therefore I am."") These tidbits make an otherwise bang-bang shoot-em-up film evolve into something a bit more palatable.  If these meanderings are above your heads, insulting the film or the people involved will not somehow justify your existence or make you ""right.""

This was a good ending to a very creative and fun trilogy. 9/10 rating.,"I was apprehensive when I went in to see Matrix Revolutions. I think I liked Reloaded more than most people did, but it wasn't without its problems and I was hoping those problems had been solved in Revolutions. I was not disappointed. This review is going to focus on addressing some of the criticism that this movie has received, so be prepared.I don't really need to talk about the special effects or the fight scenes because I presume that every one here will have already realized that the Matrix trilogy has set new standards in both areas, so I'll skip that aspect of the review. The acting (yes, even by Keanu Reeves) was very good. I know that many people can't separate Keanu from Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, but that's their failing, not Keanu's and certainly not the failing of Revolutions.One thing that people HAVE to realize/remember is that Reloaded and Revolutions are one movie. Rather than have people sit in the theatre for four hours, the Wachoski brothers decided to split it up. The effect this had on the audience was a feeling of emptiness at the end of Reloaded. Characters that had been introduced weren't expanded upon in the normal way of most other movies. But, the Matrix trilogy is somewhat unique, so it breaks out of the traditional mold of the typical movie experience. For that, I'm grateful. Too many action and sci-fi movies nowadays are meant to only visually dazzle the audience. As a result, you have poop like Star Wars: Episode One. Critics tore episode one apart on that very point. ""No plot, only eye candy which gets old very fast."" So, the Wachoski brothers decided to put some thought into their story. What has happened now is that the critics and the audience are used to seeing eye candy with no substance. So, what were the critics complaining about in Reloaded? Too much talk, not enough action to hold their attention.Now I know, this is supposed to be a review about Revolutions. So, here it is. Revolutions is meant to finally fill out all the characters from the other two films, give the audience some semblance of finality and leave a few questions unanswered so the audience would still have something to speculate about after the movie was over. Since most of the characters were already known in the beginning of Revolutions, there was no need for character introduction. This lended more time to flesh out the story, which was done superbly. George Lucas should take some advice from the Wachoski brothers on how to wrap up Episode III.Maybe some people like having the ENTIRE story spelled out for them, but in my experience, the talk and speculation between people on the ideas of the matrix was half the fun of the trilogy. So, if everything was spelled out, there wouldn't be the fun of speculating and formulating your own opinions concerning the Matrix.More than that, I feel that this movie provided more closure for the trilogy than most other on-going movie series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Indiana Jones and the like.When all is said and done, I thought that Revolutions had much of the same wonderment as the first movie, the action of the second movie, and more story than either of its predecessors while answering several questions from the first two movies. Revolutions demands more of its audience than the usual empty, mass produced, cookie cutter action/sci-fi movie that Hollywood usually puts out. That's why the Matrix Trilogy will most certainly stand the test of time and delight audiences years from now. This movie wasn't without its problems, but if you're going to go into this movie expecting it to follow the usual hollywood, cookie-cutter ""third film"", you'll hopefully be pleasantly surprised. Revolutions transcends the confines of the mass-produced hollywood movie. It provides the eye candy while getting your brain involved.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An Intense and Enthralling Middle Act, but Underwhelmed elsewhere by Mediocre Writing","Struggling to pick off from the unworkable ending of Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions finds it difficult to stage good atmosphere and pacing, leaving the first act a somewhat forgettable mess.The film doesn't really kick off properly until its main city is revisited and the major battle commences. From there we get a legendary prolonged fight sequence on two fronts, which is both climatic and exceptionally well rendered; truly a tense experience to see the scale and perspectives from tiny humans defending their huge homeland against thousands of perfectly made CGI machines.However it's final act is problematic. Failing to capitalise on much of the premise of its two previous films, the result is a slow slog of overbearing slapstick fighting that should have been more delightful to the eye and more engaging as a finale.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The end of a messy trilogy -that now has a fourth outing ahead of the curve-,"'Revolutions' was the worst Matrix movie back when I first watched it in cinema. Over the years its reputation has grown and now, the weakest or not, I consider it to be a cerebral, complex, sad, dark and somewhat satisfying conclusion to the events built up in 'Reloaded'. I still award the original movie as the one and only that really stands the test of golden quality, but as a kind of a messy trilogy, this third entry works enough to keep the audience invested until its not-that-ultimate closure. Today we had the promising trailer of the upcoming fourth movie, one that may work as a reboot but one that follows the storyline of this movie as an actual sequel too. Let's see how the story goes after all this time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The second best of the trio,"Revolutions is the second best of the three movie for a few reasons, the makers went back to what made the first movie great great, human feelings, they second thing is they kept Reeves (who is terrible) off the screen most of the movie till the end.

Nice but not as strong as the other two,"The Matrix Revolutions, the concluding chapter of the Matrix trilogy, released in 2003, brings closure to the epic narrative initiated by its predecessors. Directed by the Wachowskis, the film strives to resolve the intricate plotlines and philosophical questions introduced in The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded.Visually, Resolutions maintains the high standards set by its predecessors. The captivating action sequences, including the intense battles in the real world and the climactic confrontation in the Matrix, showcase the Wachowskis' commitment to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. The film's cinematography, led by Bill Pope, continues to deliver the signature style that defines the Matrix universe.Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo, and his performance continues to anchor the film. As the central figure in the prophecy, Neo undergoes further evolution, and Reeves convincingly portrays the character's internal struggle and determination. The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, also maintains its strong presence, contributing to the film's emotional resonance.Revolutions seeks to answer the philosophical questions raised in the previous films, providing a resolution to Neo's journey and the overarching conflict with the machines. The film introduces new elements, such as the Machine City and the subplot involving characters like the Trainman and the Oracle, expanding the Matrix lore.However, the film's narrative complexity, while attempting to bring closure, may be polarizing for some viewers. The inclusion of certain characters and storylines can be perceived as convoluted, and the film's ambitious attempt to tie up loose ends may leave some wanting more clarity.Don Davis's score maintains its electronic and industrial tones, contributing to the film's atmosphere and emotional beats. While not straying far from the established musical style, the score effectively underscores the grandiose nature of the Matrix saga.In summary, The Matrix Revolutions serves as the concluding chapter of a groundbreaking trilogy, delivering visually stunning action sequences and attempting to provide answers to the philosophical questions posed throughout the series. While it may not reach the same heights as the original film, it remains a crucial piece of the Matrix narrative, offering closure to the saga while inviting contemplation on the nature of reality and the choices that define us.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It works:,"Matrix Revolutions ties up the details of the previous movies, but doesn't seem to have a new concept for us to think over.The concepts focused on in the first two movies were discussed in detail quite a few years ago in _The Real World of Technology_ by U.

If the three movies are taken as a single work, then it is an original and coherent piece.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not all that satisfying but still worth seeing,"Now the first movie in this trilogy was mind blowing. Unfortunately this is probably the weakest one in this trilogy. The build up has a lot of special effects going for it, but it just wasn't all that entertaining. The main part that actually stands out and is actually pretty darn awesome is the last 30 minutes. The final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith is memorable. Basically the whole premise of this movie is about the people of Zion preparing to stand their ground against the machines that found their location and is now ready to invade. And Agent Smith trying to take over and rule everything and Neo doing everything he can to stop him. But it's done in a very generic manner with some lame or corny dialogues, even the sci-fi philosophical aspects seemed cheesy. This just isn't a very satisfying movie as a whole but it's still a movie worth seeing, at least for the last 30 minutes. And I really like the soundtrack to this one as well and it fits right in with the Matrix world. Again it's a movie worth seeing but since the first Matrix movie was such a awesome sci-fi movie this one just seem to fall far behind.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I feel sad for some of you people!!,"It makes me a little sad to see how jaded some of you ""critics"" have become. After reading a lot of bad reviews on this web site I had lowered my expectations and braced myself before I went to see this movie. I was totally prepared for disappointment.  Instead, what I got was a treat in the form of one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen! I kept waiting for the part that turned everyone off and inspired all the hostile reviews and it just never happened.  All I saw was amazing visuals, a fun story that wrapped up nicely at the end. The ending was great in that it does not spell everything out for you. It does leave a little room for speculation at the end.  The studio probably insisted that it be left slightly open ended in case they just had to make another sequel, but it's still good because the way it is makes you think about it long after it is over. Also, people compare it to the original and say it is not as good. Okay, but keep in mind the first one had the advantage of being new and mysterious.  Now we have seen what is behind the curtain so the mystery is gone. Now we need to see how the story plays out, and man does it ever! Maybe people just don't understand it, or they just wanted to see something other than what they saw. I don't know. For those of you who don't get it, sorry. I would love to see you do something better, or even remotely close! You are really missing out by keeping your mind closed!  I know I am not alone when I say to the Wachowski bros ""BRAVO!!"".

"Stunning, but in the end who really gets it?","The Matrix has interesting philosophical ideas but they are so complex that they are not often executed well on film. The trilogy leaves a lot of for interpretation, which I personally usually appreciate in a film, but in the end, the philosophical context all becomes too epic to grasp and for anyone who can't put all pieces of the puzzle together (without reading like 5 threads on IMDb to ""explain it all""), it's a big mess.What happens to the too ""big"" ideas is also what happens to The Matrix: Revolutions as a film. The end part of the trilogy is far too epic and grand to keep one's interest. There are gigantic battles, magnificent fights and climactic scenes after another that desensitise you after a while. I found that this was largely due to the overblown score that played on in the background to most of the movie. It becomes very tiring.I don't know who did the conceptual art for Revolutions, but it looks like something out of a HR. Giger artwork and it's just so stunning it touches me. This film is truly a gorgeous science fiction triumph. This, of course, extends only to the visual part.

The battle for Zion is a long-winded but intense, immersive sci-fi military epic that is loud and tumultuous, raw and gritty, superbly filmed and immensely unrealistic. Glaring plot holes aside, it's very entertaining, but can also be tiring and drawn out. Neo's path excitedly compounds when he clashes with Agent Smith's ""new body,"" which involves a lot of great line delivery and quite an exhilarating twist. This twist continues to one-up itself in the third act, whereupon we get new levels of ridiculousness that we just have to roll with. It all amounts to one of the most drawn-out, unnecessarily long and repetitive fight scenes of cinema history, with so very few redeeming qualities. We get it, rain is cool in slow-mo.

Wow, now I need to transfer money from savings to cover that last check.

Thank the Gods they pulled it off (Barely),"Okay, this is my first review for IMDB, so you're going to have to forgive me.  I went to see Matrix Revolutions yesterday (I waited till it was actually out in theatres...) and I wanted to write as soon as I got home. I really hated the second movie's plot.  I was hoping for an action movie and I didn't get it. The third movie is also not an action movie, so if you're go there to see a whole lot of fights and things blowing up, you're going to walk away disappointed.  But, I rated it a seven out of ten because this movie has so much more in it than just action.  Sure, the plot's a little bit hard to follow if you're a complete idiot, but I'm not, so that wasn't really a problem.  The swarm-like entity near the end was awesome, in my oppinion.I wish there had been a few more fights, sure, but the fights they did have were pretty good.  I'm hoping that the DVD shows Trinity, Morphius and Sereph having to fight their way out of the Frenchman's club, it seemed to end far too quickly for my tastes.  I guess it's cuz I'm a DM.. But, on the whole, I think everyone who saw the first two is going to HAVE to see this one, just because it's a trilogy.  I think that it's worth the money I paid for it, but it's NO ""Return of the Jedi"".  So, for those of you that didn't go see it the first day (if there are any of you), you should go see it, but just don't have your expectations so high that they cannot be reached. There are two scenes that drag on a bit, especially one where Trinity trys to express herself to Neo right before his final confrontation, but though they do take away from the movie, the special effects bring enough to the table that they can be forgiven...eventually.

The Matrix trilogy has closed. Satisfying? Yes and no.,"Reloaded had its problems, so having been shot back to back this was bound to have certain problems too. Not so much similar problems in this instalment, whereas Reloaded essentially forgot that the first movies philosophical and religious reference was in subtle sub text, Reloaded brought it to the forefront of the movie in a rather ostentatious manner. The pacing and the dialogue was also a problem. In Revolutions however there are still problems with pacing and even more so with dialogue but there is a lot less philosophising.The two sequels essentially take on a hole different tone to the first movie. They don't feel like the same movie. When watching the first film there is no way of guessing where the next two will take the story and characters. It is quite an imaginative and at times exciting journey but understandable that many fans don't feel satisfied. The Matrix had one of those great endings leaving it wide open for another but looking back now having seen the two sequels I feel it would have been better off as a stand alone film, I mean much as I would love to see a continuation of Blade Runner it is a film that is best as a film of its own. What it boils down to in some ways is that the story the Wachowski's are trying to tell in the final two instalments are very complex ideas, essentially twice as much movie material than the running times of both together. It feels way to much like the two sequels have crammed information in, they've been cramming so much into the films, and the game and the Animated films, yet still the explanations need such time for the audience to fully understand that come the resolution of the final chapter you still feel you don't now enough about the Matrix, the relationship between the humans and the machines, Neo's purpose, Agent Smith's role and purpose, the Oracle. You get a basic gist of most of it but you never quite feel satisfied enough about certain characters roles, objectives and so on.These are the major gripes but at the end of the day the two sequels are still enjoyable action movies, they do have their slow points but then most action films do. The action is still fantastic. This has the awe factor of the second but this time I felt more emotionally involved. The battles in Zion are amazing, great displays of CGI. The CGI in this film is superb. The level of detail is amazing, the Machines city is particularly jaw dropping. Also the much touted super brawl between Smith and Neo is something to behold. There is no doubt that while the Wachowski's have had problems with the scripts of the last two they have not lost their visual style and their unique imagination. The fight that ends the trilogy is perhaps the best, it is not as emotionally involving as the fights in the first film due to story and character problems but for sheer spectacle they are astounding. The fight reminiscent of Dark City's final showdown but on acid, is just very exciting not to mention the fact that it really does look cool.The cast are good although for about a third of the movie Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss disappear from the film while the battle of Zion takes place. Reeves is more than ever a little bit wooden but Laurence Fishbourne is back on form from the last film. Also Jada Pinkett Smith has a much better role than the last film too and she is looking very sexy. Also Ian Bliss is excellent as Bane, his impersonation of Agent Smith is superb. Of course the man himself Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving steals the show. On a minor point Monica Bellucci is sadly wasted in a very brief one line role, although she does stick in the mammary, I mean memory for other reasons, I nearly shouted out `Holy Wazoombas Batman!' in the cinema, thankfully I didn't.Despite some flaws and the feeling it has been needless, I liked the much debated resolution to the story, and there were shocks in it and deaths for two major characters. I just wish I was 100% clear about the whole trilogy, I imagine the only ones to fully grasp everyone that has happened or been implied would be the writers themselves. It seems in some ways the two sequels are just too big, they seem so different from the subtle and self contained original. To sum up the original to me is endlessly repeatable and can be read in so many different ways, thanks to the intelligent scripting, while the sequels are good, they have some depth but the way the stories are told in two and three are problematic and the films will not be anywhere near as repeatable. Overall this is a good cinema going experience but still in the context of the first movie, sadly lacking. ***",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Grand Finale,"I have to confess that I went to see this film with fear and trepidation. I have been a big fan of the Matrix trilogy and I was afraid that the finale would be a major letdown. Sequels are a risky business at best. If you've seen Rocky V, Jaws 3-D, or any of the Halloween movies after the first one you know of what I speak. In Rocky for example, we meet characters, situations, and places that are fresh and new. The hero's quest is as old as mythmaking itself but the new contexts and characters allow us to approach old myths in new ways. As each successive sequel was made, the myth became trite and clichéd, the characters devolve into caricatures, and the formulaic nature of the films makes them mundane and boring.It is admittedly a difficult task to keep the mythmaking fresh and awe-inspiring. I am pleased to report that the Wachowski brothers succeed in doing just that. I read several reviews that were fairly negative about the film, but as I read the reviews it was clear to me that the critics simply didn't get it. They reminded me of the critic who criticized Field of Dreams for not being as good as other baseball movies. If you have seen Field of Dreams you know that that film is not really a baseball movie at all.As in the previous films, there is an abundance of special effects in the battle sequences. There are also more sparks in the relationship between Trinity and Neo. In my review of the original film I praised the film because of the abstractness of the mythology. When we try to literalize metaphors they lose much of their power. Neo-Marxists, Buddhists, and Christians could all walk away from this film feeling as if the film had strengthened their faith. If we look at the film as a commentary on the postmodern world, the Architect and the Oracle become perfect metaphors for the competing voices of modernity and postmodernity respectively.One of the reasons I was nervous about this final installment was my concern about the Messianic Neo character. The Christological images are fairly strong in the film, but I have always had a problem with Neo as a machine-gun toting Messiah. Once I let go of my literal reading of this metaphor I was able to appreciate the richer metaphors contained in the film. I resonate with the film's critique of the ""domination system"" (to borrow a phrase from Walter Wink's The Powers That Be), but I did not want this film to degenerate into yet another legitimation of the myth of redemptive violence. Fortunately, it does not . . . to say more is to give away too much of the ending.This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and more than a few viewers will leave scratching their heads or disappointed that there wasn't even more computer-generated mayhem. But for those who have eyes to see, this film is clearly worth a look.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Ending For An Amazing Trilogy,"The Matrix Revolutions is an awesome ending for the Matrix. The special effects in this movie are so great, it blew my mind, and I don't really care for those kinds of things. The fight scenes in this movie are also great and sometimes a little intense, especially the last fight with Neo fighting Agent Smith. As with the first movie, Keanu Reeves is cool as Neo and Hugo Weaving gives his best performance as Agent Smith in this movie.I am really confused at what the first 5 bozos who posted were talking about. This is a great sequel and conclusion to the Matrix. This is David, signing off.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Everything that has a Beginning has an End"", Thank God","It's now been four years since The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The two sequels that surpassed the classic movie The Matrix. Both were filmed back to back, and both had a huge amount of anticipation riding upon them. The Matrix Reloaded arrived in the summer, and admittedly it received mixed reviews. Those who said it was brilliant and as good as the original, and others who despised the movie, complaining it made little sense and was just one huge disappointment. I personally loved The Matrix Reloaded, I won't lie and say its as good as the original as it really isn't. Its a good movie, that only stumbles at the last hurdle when it randomly introduced a man called The Architect. The rest of the movie is pretty well done, and the Freeway chase is the stuff movies are made for. Then The Matrix Revolutions arrived. I never got to see this at the cinema, but instead forked out a bit of money to purchase it on DVD. Convinced it would be the conclusion I wanted. Alas, The Matrix Revolutions was an unmitigated disaster. A movie, that while having a few tiny brilliant moments, just felt like an anticlimax. A confusing, jumbled up mess, with dialogue so tiresome you struggle to stay awake. Now after four years I returned to it once again to see whether it had aged very well, alas it's even worse than before. Making this the weakest ending to a trilogy I have seen in a long time.So where do the problems with Revolutions start? Well it certainly doesn't start at the beginning, as the opening scenes of Revolutions worked for me. The sections in the Train Station, and the fight in Club Hell might not be in the same league as the first and second movie, but as passable entertainment it works. However after the brief jolt of energy the movie seems to die. The middle section is horrible, just plain horrible. Most people enjoyed the siege of Zion near the end, I really disliked it for some reason. My major moan with the movie is all about the lack of scenes in The Matrix. The highlights of the original and Reloaded all took place within the Matrix. Some imbecile decided to remove The Matrix from the final movie until the ending, and that really makes the movie dull as hell. Why anyone would want to save the dreary ""real world"" is beyond me, I'd much rather have the slickness of the computer programme. As I said the middle has little going for it, after the Oracle meeting which lacks of the spark of the last two Oracle meetings, there is nothing. Neo and Trinity seem to disappear for hours upon hours, and we're left with Morpheus, Niobe and all the others defending Zion. This leads to a special effects filled noisy as hell sequence that never inspires excitement. It has an epic feel to it, yet it never fulfils its full potential.The characters in the movie also have a very hard time. Keanu Reeves' Neo seems to disappear for half the movie, a shame as here he has some great moments. His character goes through a lot, and by the ending he is still a interesting character. Alas, he seems to be a plot placement now, by the final fight between him and Smith you've lost much of the respect you had for the character and movie. Carrie Anne Moss might have well have not been in the movie. After the finale revolving her in Reloaded you'd have expected her character to have been pivotal. Here she seems almost tired, my guess is she had already signed on for the third one before the script had been done. That might explain why she seems to be hanging around for the hell of it. Laurence Fishbourne is also sidelined, his character no longer the great leader as he was in the original, now he seems almost average. In fact the only character who comes out still brilliant is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. He does stumble in the ending, mainly because the fight scene is ludicrous, but his character is still the best thing in The Matrix series.So what does work in this movie? Thankfully the final fight that the trailers promised between Neo and Agent Smith is breathtaking, for a time. I say ""for a time"" as the fight seems to go on for way too long. When it begins you couldn't be more excited, its the one sequence in this movie that make you sit up and brace yourself for something cool. For the first few minutes it delivers, before it never seems to end and concludes in the most limp ending I have seen in years. The story also does manage to hold it together, and the death sequences have the impact the directors obviously wanted. But apart from a few sequences that work and sit strongly alongside the rest of the series, this movie is just a dreary mess.Revolutions has not aged particularly well, what was once an average movie is now a plain terrible one. Its well made, but the script and cast seem tired. When watched with the rest of the series the faults are all the more clearer.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pseudo movie,"I'm sure this appeals to a generation so wrapped up in video games that they only want to see more of that when they go to movies. But this is barely more than a video game. It has pseudo-acting, pseudo-philosophy, pseudo-science and a pseudo-plot. It surely couldn't have interested anyone past the age of 25. The first two of this ""trilogy""...really more like a puzzle with 3 parts, none standing alone but when put together does at least form a whole...were more ""real"" and interesting. But strip away the mumbo-jumbo and what we're left with is a lot of people wandering around looking like they are on massive doses of thorazine, amusing machines that look like they came from the old Star Wars trilogy and antiquated ideas of what weapons of the XXX century will probably be like (the idea that they will be firing bullets, nothing more than hot lead, at these futuristic all-devouring machines is truly silly science.) In fact there is not one thing that is believable ...maybe that appeals to adolescents, but to anyone who has seriously thought about the future, one would hope they would have developed more imaginative weapons, better speaking skills, better ability to emote and lead lives that have more meaning.

An OK ending compared to all the great hype it created,"Matrix Revolutions comes after all the hype provided by the previous part but ends up just as an above average experience nothing more nothing less. Although the film picks up from where the previous one ended, it falls short at areas and never does justice to its prequels. The only appreciable ideas are less use of Matrix sequences compared to previous movies which gave the audience the breathing space they deserved. Rest all are pretty same the philosophy, concept and the high quality CGI sequences which are a delight to watch. The two factors that uphold the movie are its Bloody fight, Zion action sequence and the beautiful climax sequence which somehow makes the movie a must watch end.In the end, an ok end to Matrix triology but not the one we deservedRating:66/100.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Interesting Movie...,"Well...after seeing Matrix Revolutions I can say that this movie was better than Reloaded, however that wasn't terribly hard to do.  In the end I was fairly disappointed with the ending...and various other things that were done throughout the movie, which much like certain scenes in Reloaded the viewer could have done without.  The movie certainly had some interesting special effects, however it seemed like they paid more attention to the 2 major special effect scenes (defending Zion and the Neo vs Smith) than they did to the rest of the movie.  I suppose if you liked the second one this would be an obvious see, and even if you just saw the second one...this is a decent conclusion.  However if you haven't seen the second one yet, and you liked The Matrix I have to agree with the above comment...and leave it at the first movie and walk away satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good right up until the end.,"This movie was considerably better than Matrix Reloaded. I think for the most part it tied things up nicely and left just enough loose ends to potentially extend the story. I would also say that Revolutions had a very ""Return of the Jedi"" vibe going on. The switching between multiple places worked almost as well as Jedi and the ending left me looking for Ewoks.The acting is lukewarm with one exception. Hugo Weaving earned his paycheck a few times over. Just when I think a monotonous character is doomed to getting an emotionless performance, Mr. Weaving proves me wrong.As I said before, my biggest beef with Matrix: Revolutions is the ending. The final fight is anticlimactic as is everything that follows. Sure there's peace between the humans and the machines but it felt like the directors were ordered to cut it short for fear of the movie running long.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"""The Matrix Revolutions,"" released in 2003, concludes the iconic sci-fi trilogy with a mix of spectacle and philosophical musings. As the war between humans and machines intensifies, the film delves into complex themes of fate and choice. Visually, it maintains the series' groundbreaking effects, particularly in the epic battle scenes and the surreal Matrix simulations. However, some critics argue that the narrative becomes convoluted, and the heavy reliance on action sacrifices the depth seen in the earlier installments. Despite its flaws, ""Matrix Revolutions"" provides a fitting end to the saga, offering closure and leaving room for contemplation on the nature of reality.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wachowski Brothers really drop the ball with this one.,We waited this long for this? A movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. Its seems to me that the Wachowski Brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. The mythology that made the first Matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.The Wachowski Brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The studio gave a mediocre script to a script doctor who rewrote the matrix into a superb modern action tale.

Okay,"This movie was a little confusing - but I finally understood it after watching it the second time. There were a lot of complaints about this movie - people were saying that it didn't make sense and it was a stupid ending. But if you really look at it - there couldn't have been a different ending than the way it ended. If it ended any other way - the movie would have to start over again with the original Matrix. This way both machines and humans come out the winners, and Zion was saved. If the Matrix had lost, all of the millions who are still plugged into the false world (our version of the world) of the Matrix would of died while still plugged into that world. This way - if they reject the fake Matrix world - they can become unplugged and join Zion.Choice!!!!!!!!!! Period. That was the meaning of this movie.

"Great, but can't live up to its billing","I will not spoil the movie for anyone, but Revolutions comes close but doesn't strike the iron.  What was billed as the third most anticipated movie of the year (after Reloaded and Return of the King) was a letdown for what I was expecting.  But let me make it clear that rarely ever does a movie so hyped live up to its billing, so while I was disappointed, Revolutions does indeed plunge down the rabbit hole.Revolutions started slow, I rode the edge of my seat waiting for the action and the plot to pick up, think the time spent at Zion during Reloaded for a more accurate description, boring and slow to point.  It wasn't until about an hour in that it really started to get interesting, and even then it spiked up and down until the war really began.  With the two main point lines, Neo and the war on Zion rarely crisscrossing, I found myself wondering what happened to Neo during the 30 minute Zion sequence.However, let me make it known that Revolutions is quite a good film. Unlike Reloaded, you can't as easily pick out the digitally animated scenes. And compared to Reloaded, you're not scratching your head quite as often. More than once during the war on Zion you find yourself thinking if you were right there, and the realism is fantastic.Overall, I rated Revolutions a 7/10.  But make this clear, do not wait for the DVD, see this movie as quickly as possible.  This is one of four trilogies that should only be seen in theaters, following Indiana Jones, Star Wars IV, V, VI as well as I, II, and upcoming III, and finally Lord of the Rings.  Slight tip, watch the Animatrix shorts that prelude the Matrix, then the rest of the Animatrix, then Reloaded, then go see Revolutions, that will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not everything that has a great beginning has a great end,"After seeing The Matrix Reloaded, earlier this year, I was quite hopeful on the third part of the series entitled The Matrix Revolutions. I was expecting that the characters I ran into in Reloaded would have some significance to the story of the Matrix and I was expecting that the story would take an original twist or two. Well, I must say that not unlike many others I was disappointed and I guess many others will yet have to be disappointed.The bad thing about the Matrix Revolutions is that it is neither The Matrix, nor the thing Reloaded promised us. The Matrix introduced us to some very interesting and ingenious new characters, who I thought (and perhaps others too) to have some sort of higher relevance in the Matrix story. Well, they do not! I expected that there was more behind Persephone, Merovingian and his henchmen, but there wasn't. But what is worse, I thought that after Reloaded, Revolutions could still be original and inventive cinema. It couldn't.The main complaint I have about The Matrix Revolutions, is that it is not what The Matrix was. It is not a cybernetic spectacle with high intelligence. It is rather an uninspired, destruction derby of the likes of Independence Day and other disaster / destruction movies, where everyone and everything within range is crushed and demolished, (in an attempt) to enjoy the viewer. Well, Mr. and Mr. Wachowski. If I wanted to see such trashing and demolition, don't you think I would have watched Bad Boys 2 in the cinema. Really, how unoriginal of you.Another thing that really struck me, while I was watching the film was the immense stupidity that was called Neo in this film. Sure in the first film he was rather ignorant, but he learned and by the time I watched Reloaded he had learned immensely and I would have actually thought there was some brain in the man, but that vision I held of Neo was completely destructed whilst watching The Matrix Revolutions. I mean, how can it be, that Neo (also called The One, as in our last hope) can sense things, other people cannot even see, while he still remains unable to figure out things any human being with the IQ of a biscuit can hear (you'll know what I mean when Neo is aboard ship with Trinity). That was such a lame scene and I saw it coming like 10 minutes beforehand (including an intermission of about 5 minutes though). Saying this, I'm already at my next point of complaint and isn't it easy today? What is that complaint you ask? Well what abut the fact that this film is too predictable at times. I mean not just the usual, I was actually saying the lines of the characters in my head, before they uttered them themselves. How about that? That does not only mean that the lines were not good, but also that the scenes were not always good, or why else would I be thinking about what the character might say next?So far, one could conclude that I had a pretty shitty afternoon, watching this multi-million dollar slice of film-making, but that is not true. I was neither bored, nor mad. Instead, I was only slightly entertained and a bit disappointed. Especially with the ending. I could have done dealt with it, if the film had ended, when The Architect left, but the part that came after he left, what the hell was that all about? It did nothing, but leave me with some odd taste in my mouth (this is a figure of speech).The thing with this film is, that the original, inspiring and truly great thing that The Matrix was (and that Reloaded built on), was (in my opinion) destroyed with Revolutions. For me (an owner of The Matrix), this means that I will hold on to that copy for as long as I can, for it is a truly amazing film, but that I will not have anything to do with the other two parts. As far as I am concerned the story about The Matrix begins and ends with the first film. Not only because after seeing that film, you have about as much questions left as you have after seeing all three films, but also because the other films are just not too memorable. I'm really disappointed that Mr. and Mr. Wachowksi made two sequels and I must honestly say that I expected more from men who could invent such great stories as Bound and The Matrix. You know if there is nothing more to show, don't show it, just because you can get the money, or because all the actors have their autographs on a contract. If the sequels are not up to the original (in Revolutions' case NOT EVEN CLOSE), do not make them. I hope that the Wachowski's learn from this, that not all ideas are great and that not everything should be turned into a movie and in a way, I guess I hope that 'we' viewers learn that too. But, maybe I am to blame for expecting intelligent film-making.7 out of 10post scriptum: while I was writing this comment I found out, that Gloria Foster, the 'original' Oracle, was not in this film, because  she died before her scenes for Revolutions were shot. I am very sorry to hear that, because she gave so much fun and flavor to The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded. I must admit though, that I was a bit astounded as well, because there was no 'In loving memory of.' right after either Reloaded or Revolutions. I could continue my criticism about this film at this point, regarding the new oracle, but I will not. I just want to reemphasize that Mrs.Foster did a great job as the Oracle and that she will be missed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Second Viewing,"I saw this movie for the 2nd time today, and I have to say that now that I have, I like it even more.This is one movie that really HAS to be seen twice to really be appreciated. There were so very many subtlties that whiz by so quickly, and upon subsequent viewing (where I was able to absorb them), enhanced greatly my overall enjoyment and appreciation of this movie.I think that you are meant to be left with questions and almost required to use a certain amount of interpretation of some things about it.  But I found that some of the larger issues that I thought were addressed a bit vaguely during the first viewing, I found were given their due, but your really had to be watching for it.  This time I did just that, and I understand enough of what I saw to believe this to be a fitting end to the trilogy.I have read a lot of user comments that basically stated that they were not sure what to make of it when they walked out of the theater, but after pondering it for a bit, came to a point where they fel they better understood it.  I never questioned that I enjoyed it, but I too needed time to absorb the deeper aspects.  So, I let a few days go by, and went to see it again.My advice to all, and especially those who hated it because they did not get the ending, would be to give it one more chance and see it again.  I think you will find something you might have missed the first time, and your perceptions of this film will no doubt improve as well.In particular, I felt I GOT the ending a lot better this time around.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than Reloaded,"A good tip for you to enjoy a hyped blockbuster movie, is to watch it without expectations as best as you can.

I felt like I was watching a video game and there were several other aspects of the movie, that just didn't live up to my expectations.Looking back at 'Realoaded' now, it seemed that that movie was just a set-up for 'Revolution.' So with this idea in mind, and hoping I would be seeing another video game movie, I was satisfied indeed with 'Revolution.'The 20-min battle scene was well-executed, and even the Kid didn't act like a looser anymore.

Surprisingly, it is even terrible for the vanilla genre-fi action movie it is. Weak.

SFX: 10   rest: 1,"Even the first Matrix movie was a disappointment for me, because i was being told by everyone and his aunt that (besides having very original fighting scenes) this is something unheard of in Sci Fi, such hyper-original story involving virtual reality and something that really makes you think. I went to cinema happily expecting a subtle interplay of virtual and ""real"" reality, finally a SF film worthy of best SF literature, only to find out that it's about stupid evil robots eating people (or whatever). Where i expected wit and originality, subtleness and philosophy, i found Hollywood clichés, really not so different from Alien type of movie, as everyone thinks it to be. But i'll grant them (Matrix fans) that at least in the world of SF _cinema_, Matrix did scratch a surface - but no more - of something interesting, which can't be said for 99% of other SF movies.As for Matrix Revolutions, i really thought i'll die of boredom. The forced pump-up to the siege of Zion was so shallow i was almost congratulating myself on seeing through the hype (and into nothingness) already in the first movie. These guys obviously don't have anything to say apart from hitherto unseen camera-angles and shooting speeds. I saw the film on DVD, and while i barely survived through the film itself, i enjoyed the second disk, which is all about how they made it, immensely. I really do appreciate all the effort put into special effects. It is all ground breaking, no doubt. But absent this insight into all the intricacies of virtual humans, computer graphics and miniature models, while you watch the movie it just boils down to ""yeah, nice effects, but...""My point being that SFX is NOT ENOUGH to make a good movie. And virtually everything else in this movie S U C K S. Acting? There is no. Characters? They're all carton cutouts 1 milimeter thick ans seen a zillion times. Story? Who can honestly say they got it? If it's about ""fight for what you believe in and believe in love"", as some here say, i think it takes some finesse if you want to make the message work - it's not enough that a character in the film says those words. In these fascinating ""the-making-of"" documentaries, most people were talking about what they did and how they did it. But occasionally, some would find it appropriate to talk about ""deep philosophy"" that this movie carries.The effects were great, but philosophy - please spare me.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the best in the series but possible the best way to end the trilogy.,"Well after the trailers and the hype i have to say that i was really looking forward to seeing the Matrix Revolutions. What i got to see was not as great as i expected, but it was not awful either, it was ok, just ok. But the more i started thinking about it afterwards, the more  i liked it...The start of the movie is almost perfect, filled with the usual Matrix action sequences and the explanation to what happened to Neo ,which is this movie's number one problem, you see after all the theories that have been posted all over the net, and in this site too, the explanation given by the brothers is a bit well... stupid and too farfetched... And then to the second problem, these first 20 minutes are the last we'll see of the Matrix... (except for the final showdown of course) But come to think of it that's not such a bad thing, you see the brothers used all their gunfighting and Kung-Fu fighting ideas in the previous Matrix films so these action sequences are a complete repetition of the other two films, the ""cloak room shoot out"" for example is identical to the ""lobby shoot-out"" scene in the first film, only that this time the bad guys are running on the ceiling... The second part of the movie takes place in the real world and for its largest part it shows us the last stand of the humans in Zion. This battle is one of the best i've ever seen, the CGI created Sentinels look excellent and most importantly, REAL! Every time they change formations i can guarantee that you'll be picking up your jaw from the floor! However, there is a big fault in the flow of the film here since for the duration of this battle we don't get to see Neo and Trinity at all, the last time we get to see them is in the Neo vs. Baine battle after which Neo is left in a very bad condition, so instead of showing us if the star is ok, they show us a bunch of extras getting killed by the Sentinels.. The last part of the film is the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith... Only one word can describe this epic confrontation...WOW!! We get to see a fight that most clearly shows the  Anime influence of the films... And that's exactly what it is like, like those epic confrontations in say.. Dragonball (only that it doesn't last a couple of years and it doesn't have any fireballs...) The ending of the battle as well as the end of the movie will surely give birth to many theories and discussions between avid Matrix fans... In conclusion, probably the Matrix Revolutions will not be what you expect it to be... If you really want to enjoy the film leave all your expectations at home and when you judge it, don't do so as if it were a standalone movie but a part of a bigger movie, and if you look at it like that then surely you won't be disappointed. All in all, although it's not the best in the series, it's the best possible ending for the Matrix Trilogy. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An epic tale of nothing in particular,"In some respects it isn't really fair to put down The Matrix because it doesn't stretch to three films. The third outing is a little better than the second, with better action and a modest Star Trek level plot.I did like the action scenes, which didn't always give way to the meaningless fast paced CGI of many films these days. They reminded me of Aliens, with frenetic life or death fighting scenes backed up by hokum characters. But Neo's journey now follows a separate and unhelpful subplot, much like the video game it is no doubt modeled for.After seeing the various short films in the Animatrix, its obvious that The Matrix as a whole remains a strong idea, even past the first movie.

The Creator is responsible for maintaining the balance of the Mother Body, while the Prophet is responsible for guiding the people within the Mother Body to awaken. Under the joint action of two people, the human society in the mother body evolves steadily, and robots also learn from it. This is also the ultimate goal of robots ""planting"" humans, not only to generate electricity from humans, but also to learn from humans and achieve evolution. The reason why Zion exists is also because robots intentionally let it exist. Robots cannot avoid bugs in the mother body (i.e., when someone wakes up), so they wait for them to wake up and wait for them to form a resistance army. The robot performs a thorough cleaning every once in a while, annihilating the rebels and then restarting the mother body. This kind of cleaning has already been done 5 times, this is the 6th time. The first five endings were all the downfall of the resistance army and the restart of the matrix, while the emergence of Neo brought a different outcome to the world for the first time - peace. Humans and robots coexist and evolve together. But how long can this peace last?",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the greatest motion pictures ever made,"When I entered the theater I was afraid that I would be let down. But all my fears were not fulfilled, only my expectations. The battle of Zion was one of the greatest action scenes I have ever watched. The last confontration between Smith and Neo was absolutely fantastic. Espacially the last appearence of Bullet-time. The plot was not as advanced as many of the theories here have suggested, but after having seen the film, I can't really think of another ending that would fit better. The brothers don't reveal everything, we still for instance don't know why the war began in the first place, but I think that's good. Thank you the Wachowski brothers for having enlightened me.

A bag of hot air after all,"In my review of The Matrix: Reloaded' I declared that it would be impossible to precisely rate it without first examining its resolution. Finally, with The Matrix: Revolutions,' that resolution has arrived, but unfortunately it turns out to be even less satisfying than what I could have possibly predicted in my most depressing nightmares.To call the Wachowskis' spiritualizing a bag of hot air would be anunderstatement of almost biblical proportions, as the ending most resemblesTron' run through a pretentious Anime filter (don't get me wrong, Tron' is a very fine film and infinitely superior to this dreck). Add to that a barrage of bad sci-fi clichés (even worse than the Asimov and Bradbury `inspired' SecondRenaissance Part 1 & 2'), hackneyed lines that will make you squirm in agony, headache-inducing action scenes, and characters one wants to die a mostpainful death, and you get a concoction fit only for the most fanatic Matrix' fan, devoid of even the most subtle smidgeon of taste.All of this wouldn't be so bad if the Wachowskis hadn't presented it in such a ponderous and padded manner. Let's face it: There is absolutely no goodreason to split this material into two films  it could have been easily told in two and a half hours (at the most). If brevity is the essence of wit, the Wachowskis are the most humorless filmmakers since Rainer Werner Fassbinder (don't getme wrong, his 15 1/2 hour epic Berlin Alexanderplatz'  still seems much shorter than what they delivered here).

probably the best one among all 3,First thing first. I never rely on others reviews and expect the same from others. Everyone has different taste so before judging the movie from other reviews better watch it by yourself. No doubt as all the hues and cries were evident also 2nd one was horrible still there were some guys who loved that movie. No wonder same thing is bound to happen for this part too. But after reading millions of reviews and after contemplating one million times I decided to take a bold step and bouight the ticket:-P..  but to my surprise this movie rocks. I'd say this is as good as the first one was. but since first one was totally unexpected and the idea and everything was introduced in that so no one can replace first one.Overall don't expect anything and then go for the movie with totally free mind. and you will really enjoy the show. not much fighting is here but it's enough. More of story wrapping thing and thought provoking stuff.Well still I have few questions unanswered but who cares as long as I enjoyed the show. Even Wachovski brothers are not super duper intelligent so I never expected that they will answer all the questions. they tried and they succeeded. 3 cheers for them and for those who really enjoyed the movie. Others please don't give your bad review to this part. If you don't like the movie it's better to don't say anything about it.and I'd advice once again dont rely on other's reviews.

Very much like part 2,"Ok, to start: the first Matrix was a classic - no doubt about it. The second was watchable but nothing too remarkable. Third part (Revolutions) is very much the same as the second: only a sequel. In the first Matrix you see lots of one-on-one fighting even when fighting a group. In the second part there's still the hand-to-hand combat only with one man versus large group. In the third part it's almost entirely groups. There's no ""slowing down"" like the second had with the Architect but one thing they should have realised is not to use too many closeups: there's many places where you see flashes of something happening but before you can grok what it was it's already gone - I call it the ""American Directing And Cutting"" -syndrome. The same problem was even more annoying in Jet Li films like Kiss of the Dragon or The One - only those movies had less capable directing. If you've seen parts 1 & 2 already you're probably going to see this anyway. If you haven't seen those parts there's not much point in watching only this part.

The end of a new beginning...,"Matrix Revolutions, part three of The Matrix trilogy, wraps the story up neatly This movie explains the unanswered questions, which Reloaded left many viewers with.Many people had complains about Reloaded, that it was too confusing, it contradicted the first movie, and so forth.  However, the `Truth' comes out in this movie and the ones who compare it to part one of the series will be disappointed.  The problem is, that The Matrix was released without any warning, and most people did not know what the matrix was about due to minimal advertisements.  When Reloaded was released the expectations were so high because The Matrix was a movie that revolutionized movie making.  Most trilogies are structured this way, including the classic Star Wars Trilogy, and I believe this was the best way to expand and finish the Matrix mythology created in 1999.  TheMatrix, the movie that began it all, remains to be the best film out of this trilogy due to its phenomenal influence of a new beginning of film making for future films.9/10  The Matrix / 7/10  The Matrix Reloaded / 8/10  The Matrix Revolutions",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Revolting.,"Horrible ending to the highly-popular, but very suspect series has Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and a faceless crowd of others trying to save the remainder of the human race at Zion from an army of heartless and ruthless machines. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" continues the seemingly endless journey by picking up right where ""Reloaded"" finished and confusion runs amok as Armageddon is the premise. Again Hugo Weaving is the primary bad guy as the leader of a race of controllers who want nothing more than to destroy Reeves for good. Characters appear and disappear and most are never developed or used the way they should have been (Jada Pinkett Smith and Monica Bellucci are prime examples). The undertones of the series keep on slapping us in the face and in the end we are left with a long and pointless special-effects heavy mess that has little coherency and even less intelligence. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is so full of chaos that every performer gets left behind in the dizzying maze that is the film. Not even Reeves gets as much screen-time as he deserved and the others just seem to be caught in a revolving door of crazed camera-shots. I never have been a huge fan of this series, but after the second installment I thought I might change my tune when I viewed this chapter. However I honestly came out feeling very cheated and highly disappointed. I saw no point in ""The Matrix"" , I saw a glimmer of hope with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and I felt like I crashed into a cinematic wall of stale, loud and uncreative ideas with ""The Matrix Revolutions"". By the finale of this I felt like I was watching whacked 1980s-styled cartoons where ""The Transformers"" were trying to save the Earth from evil robots bent on destruction. Completely empty, incredibly disjointed and very worthless, let's hope that we won't have to sit through ""The Matrix Reborn"". 2 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated Epic Conclusion,"The third and final movie in the Matrix Trilogy did not disappoint.  As controversial as that may sound to a lot of people, the Wachowski brothers ended it the way they saw fit, and I wholeheartedly agree with the ending. The first movie enthralled us with the fascinating philosophical concept of the Matrix, and once we had four years to pour over every detail of what the first movie wanted us to know, the second and third don't worry about fleshing out the world of the Matrix and concentrate on telling the story of the Matrix universe.Revolutions is not the first ""Matrix.""  It does not owe us completely different overshooting special effects or even more intelligent concepts to mull over.  The first movie dealt with the reality of the Matrix, the second dealt with the reality of Zion, and the final movie is the conclusion of the conflict between the two worlds.  It is an epic.  Those of us who want to pretend the Matrix is a tight, compact movie with a limited physical and mental scope are kidding themselves.  The trilogy is a massive epic spanning a huge universe (as fleshed out by the Animatrix) that concludes with a huge leap backward, looking back on all the involved universes of the Matrix, Zion, and the Earth caught in the middle.Spectacular cinematography... the choreography of the fights was beautiful, and the themes of love and ying/yang are proper.  The relationship between forces like Neo/Trinity, Morpheus/Naobi, the Oracle/Architect, machine/human truly pervades the last movie against a backdrop of an amazing fantasy world.  The action fits well with this final clash between machines and humans, and Neo's role as the intervention between both forces is spectacular.As controversial to fans of the first Matrix movie this ending may seem, take a step back and look at the trilogy and the Animatrix as one huge movie telling one huge story in one huge universe.  The climax of a truly well-done film is not always anti-climactic and deeply intellectual.  The Matrix is an epic; the innovate cinematography and mind-bending philosophy behind it make it stand out above many a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Elliot Gould & Chinese Food,"Did anyone ever see the Twillight Zone episode where Elliot Gould was a restaurant reviewer that wrote his reviews before going to the restaurant? That's what it seems like a lot of the critics have done with Matrix:Revolutions. It was as if the all knew what they were going to say in advance. Well, I'm no Oracle, but I have to tell you, the critics are damn wrong on this one. Revolutions is a complex, clever, and thought provoking film. It's certainly not nuclear science or anything, but I haven't read a single review that has even tried to make sense of the riddles posed and explored by the film. It really is like a wonderful puzzle and ends up echoing similar themes that have been posed by recent Japanese films like Princess Monoke and Final Fantasy Spirits Within about violence and war (as opposed to the Hollywood WWII formula of Us Vs. Them). But perhaps the movie critics, having been in an intellectual stupor due to over exposure of most Hollywood fare (Matrix:Revolutions deconstructs Schwarzenegger and perhaps reveals why no one's interested in seeing Ahnold's movies anymore), just can't approach the ideas in it and can only seem to respond to whether or not the action and special effects of the film are good (they seem to look for the visuals as evidence that Matrix:Revolutions has nothing to offer, dismissing the most delectable parts of the film as ""pseudo-philosophy gobbligook""). I'm sure if Revolutions were a French film, critics would be singing its praises. And that's too bad because it only means that some moviegoers will avoid this movie because of the negative reviews and instead spend their money on insipid fare like ""Elf"" or ""Master and Commander"".",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Matrix Revolutions or Mentally Retarded?,"You will rarely find any big-budget movies more venally opportunistic than the Matrix films. We've seen it all before in different packages: Pseudomystical claptrap about choice and fate; a machine intelligence and a beleaguered humanity with war between machines and people---reference the Terminator movies. Neo is blinded by Smith inhabiting Bane's body and so becomes able to ""see"" the pseudo-reality of the Matrix without jacking into it---reference Oedipus and the blind prophet Teiresias (hey, we have an actual glimmer of culture here!). But this is then interrupted by enough boring, overlong ultra-violent battle scenes, numbingly familiar pyrotechnics, and cheap-looking CGI for a shelf full of action computer games---which is in fact how this movie looks---and then how does it end? Like a Power Rangers show, with a one-on-one chopsocky fest in the rain that is no more advanced in inventiveness than the similar duel between Superman and Zod in Superman II. (You want to watch violence? Turn on CNN.) And then Neo wins out over Smith by becoming one with the computer intelligence---reference Decker and Ilia at the end of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.Keanu Reeves ends the series as he began it, with a performance worthy of an honors degree from the David Janssen School of Non-acting. His Muses are obviously the twins Hypomimia and Hypophonia. The relationship between Neo and Trinity has always been hindered by the fact that Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss have an on-screen chemistry that is tepid at best. Their lovemaking scenes in Matrix Reloaded were underwhelming. Furthermore, five years of Matrix movies have not been kind to Carrie-Ann Moss; she looks tired and haggard and has not aged well, although this actually fits her character, as you would expect the hard life of the unplugged humans in the Earth of the Matrix movies to do that to people. Mostly, however, she looks like she is bored to tears by what she is doing. Maybe that's why they brought in Nona M. Gaye to ""fill out"" the film, which she does quite well, if you get my meaning. Hugo Weaving pretty much steals the movie as Agent Smith. Too bad that the only other actor truly worth watching in the first two films, Gloria Foster as the Oracle, died before Revolutions was made and was replaced by Mary Alice, an actress of much less charisma. The handling of the introduction of the new actress, since it was common knowledge that Gloria Foster died, felt pretty lame.The Wachowski brothers have vision, all right: It's TV-Guide, Reader's Digest, back-of-the-cereal box vision.

Score 10: Excellent Sci-fi Trilogy (Can you name a better one?),"Score 10 out 10 (mostly for effort):Right off the bat, can anyone name a better sci-fi trilogy? I think not.

Then, pulling off a third movie on the same story, and tying it all together, is monumental indeed.And the bro's have pulled the trilogy off nicely. But, this has been done mostly on hard work. The first Matrix was excellent, and most viewers who saw Revolutions would agree on that. Now combine that first movie, and all the obstacles they had to overcome (critics with microscopes, viewer over-expectations, and myopic viewers) and you have no choice but to give the bro's have an ""A"" for effort.Altogether you have a movie that as one reviewer wrote, ""Has something for everyone."" The bro's told a rich philosophical sci-fi story by creating many story dialogue levels for varying intelligence levels of viewers -- a point missed by some critics. This technique was overdone a bit in Reloaded, but well synchronized in Revolutions.My fellow workers and I (ok we're all mostly computer geeks at my high-tech job), enjoyed going over the movie's messages and symbols the day after we saw it.This movie makes you think -- as a good sci-fi movie should.

Back to revolutions now i thought that it didnt have enough action  to satisfy me, not enough fighting in the matrix.

It takes place mostly in ZZzzZZion, although this time it's action that takes place there, and not long drama-like-your-mom-watches-on-tv scenes, like in the second movie. But I want to see stuff going on inside the matrix, not it that craphole of a supposedly ""real"" world they live in.

Ugh - The Case Against Sequels,"Having written a three part novel, it is my firm belief that before the writer begins the first novel, he or she should have a firm idea of how the third novel will end, as well as the connective tissue that holds the three together.

There are some movies that deserve to stand up as one time only. The first Matrix was a ground breaker in look and f/x. The next two were boring high budget films which require a cheat sheet to keep track of the plot.The best that one can say, is if given the choice of producing large scale crowd effects, the job should go to WEDA. Their software is positively awesome. As for the Reloaded and Revolutions, they are clinkers, pure and simple.

First off let's start with the action sequences, simply put they blew their creative wad on the first two films.  The Zion shootout was allright but felt too artificial, nothing like the rescue scene from the first one and the brilliant highway chase scene from the second one, and the final battle between Neo and Smith was allright but hey we have scene Neo take on a hundred agent Smiths in Reloaded how much fun is it going to be to see him just fight one.

But I always recognized it as a visual milestone in cinema.When ""The Matrix reloaded"" came out, I went to see it with quite high expectations. I thought it was OK, not as good as the first one, but after all, it was a sequel and those are hardly ever as good as the originals. I loved that it still felt like ""Matrix"" to me. It had a lot of the original style and most new characters fit into that. What I did not like was all that heavy dialog. The things the Architect said made me mad. Listening to it, I got the feeling that what was actually being said was something completely banal but the Wachowskys wanted it to sound profound and to have people talk about it so they made it complicated. Still, a nice movie and after the climax, I wanted to know how it would all wrap up.What a disappointment this movie was! Whereas ""The Matrix Reloaded"" still had a lot of ""The Matrix"" in it, this movie has barely any of the ""Matrix""-feeling in it, but mostly the bad things of ""the Matrix Reloaded"". I never cared much about all this Zion-stuff. Zion to me was the ideal that was built up in the first movie, not that Star Trek -influenced termite hill of the second film. And yet, most of this movie is about that. To top it all of, most of the film is about defending this city, which is done by characters which were all added later while the main characters just vanish or become cyphers.Only two scenes of the movie take place in the matrix, one in the beginning and one at the end. The rest is just robot wars in Zion and trying to get to the Deus Ex Machina.Now, like many others, I also felt let down by the ending. i felt it was a cheap way out of all the stuff the makers of this trilogy had hinted at before. But still, the ending was just the thing that assured me in my overall impression. the entire film had been ruined for me a long time before during all these ridiculous and redundant fighting scenes in Zion.This third installment is so terrible, that it weakens the entire trilogy and even the first movie as a standalone work.The only positive thing that can be said about it is that after that, all that annoying geek talk about the matrix allegories stopped. It seemed like the Wachwskies wanted to give a wake-up call to all those freaks.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Of The Two Most Amazing Series Of All Time,I am 24 and have watched over 600 movies over the years. Although I love movies very much.

"Sometimes, Good things should not be rushed","I could not believe how gutted I felt when I left the cinema...The W Bros had made a believer out of me after watching the first film and I had never been so damn keen to watch a film as I was with M3, only to be totally disappointed and unfulfilled.It has a definate rushed feel to it and nowhere near the quality and consideration of the first, The second was OK because it presented some depth and plot giving hope for a great third film, but the third looks as though it was put together in a couple of weeks and that everyone was just happy to get the filming finished and out of Australia quick time, severe lack of enthusiasm.I find it hard to believe that the W Bros let that low quality film out... I would have had all the cast back out in Oz (or anywhere) remaking it. I'm not sure where the first film was made but it had a totally different feel to it.Anyway I'm now watching M1 to clense my mind :o)Maybe it's time to hang up the Matrix Saga and return to ""ignorance is bliss""End of an era...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Massively underrated,"I nearly didn't watch this film because of the negative reviews, but I am soo glad I did.
I sincerely don't know why so many people don't like it...
The use of special effects is outstanding, the acting is extremely good, the storyline is solid, and it kept me gripped throughout the just over 2 hours of runtime.
Now, I admit there are a few parts which have discrepancies and maybe don't make complete sense, but so does virtually every sci-fi and non sci-fi film I've seen, and I really don't think those small bits which aren't explained affect the film at all. And also, even though many complain about the ending, I really appreciate the difference to most films, it's refreshing and just heightened my opinion of it.
Give it a watch, it'll definitely be worth it!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
wheres the conclusion?,"the conclusion to the matrix trilogy seems to be more of a cliffhanger than the end of Reloaded.  while the end of Reloaded was a dramatic high point, sort of a commercial break in the middle of a TV movie, the end of Revolutions left a feeling ""where do we go from here"" that one gets from an end of a chapter in a book.  there never is a conclusive ending to the question of the machine war.  there was more talking than action in this one compared to the other two, and while i loved the philosophical arguments in the other two, there isn't much philosophy in the dialogue in the third one.the movie bunked in places that it should have rocked.  the ending left way too many questions, not only unanswered, but unasked as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable and engaging.,"I liked Revolutions.  It had pace and tension, which was something I felt was lacking in Reloaded. I was emotionally involved with the characters, feeling genuinely threatened by their circumstance.  I don't understand the people who are disappointed when they compare this movie to its predescessors.  It doesn't make sense to compare each installment in a trilogy to each other, because they are meant to be seen collectively. Revolutions extends and develops ideas in the first two films and I feel takes these ideas to a satisfying conclusion.  For those people who claim it doesn't make sense, all I can say is you haven't been watching carefully enough.  In fact, watch all three films again and this time, as Morpheous would say, ""free your mind.""",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Different than ""Reloaded"", better, but not much (spoilers)","This one is louder than part 2 and more like one would suspect a sequel of ""The Matrix"" to be. The big confrontation of machines and mankind is finally shown and Neo is given the chance to prove that he is ""The One"". The questions left from part 2 are hardly being answered but it doesn't matter. We haven't understood them anyway. Our heads ached and our brains grew tired and we just wanted the whole thing to end with a bang. That's what ""The Matrix Revolutions"" finally gave us. At the very end one is more dissatisfied than ever, though. The character of Agent Smith, who has been given too much attention in part 2 already, is dominating the story more than he should.BIG SPOILERS:Why would the machines and mankind (or Neo in particular) unite to fight Agent Smith? And why the truce? A truce between the machines and mankind was the worst way to end the trilogy. I mean, what the hell? The machines tortured us, turned us into slaves and destroyed our world, let's just make peace with them and be friends in the future. Yeah, right! If they ever make a ""Terminator 4"" that entirely plays in the future, they better have the resistance kick Skynet's ass!END OF SPOILERSWhat did ""The Matrix Revolutions"" teach us? Firstly, it taught us that you only need big tits to be on top of the credits list, no matter how small your role in the movie is (I'm referring to Monica Bellucci here, in case you wonder what the hell I'm talking about). It also, taught us, that it's not enough to make sequels stylish if you're all out of good ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How can so many people be so WRONG??,"After seeing it at the cinema, I logged onto the IMDB website yesterday and found nothing but good reviews of The Matrix: Revolutions. Oddly, a lot of people were praising it's subtle use of symbolism and it's great script and story. A few went so far as to say that in concluding it the way that they did, the Wachowski brothers had made an almost perfect trilogy raising poignant philosophical, cosmological and theological questions such that it could be regarded almost as a contemporary version of The Bible.One guy even said that the battle sequence was better than any war movie he had ever seen and that Saving Private Ryan couldn't even compare to how wonderfully gritty it was! Were you people watching the same movie?Could people this deluded really be walking the earth? If so, how is possible for people so stupid to have survived to an age where they can type without having first been killed by choking on a mobile phone or batheing in petrol whilst lighting a cigarette, or even testing the trigger of a shotgun whilst simultaneously licking a spec of dust from the inside of the barrel. The only positive thing I could think to say about this movie, is that the money that these people spend on Matrix merchandise, DVD's etc, is money that they will not spend on food or heating, giving rise to a small chance that they may die of pneumonia or starvation and thus incrementally raise the average IQ of the rest of the globe.I know I'll be accused of being picky as really it was only lacking in a few areas, such as script, story, acting talent, consistency, and any reason not to get up and walk out of the cinema utilising the opportunity to moon the screen with contempt on departure. It appeared that each character had only one line that they kept repeating, but which the Wachowski Brothers brilliantly and subtly altered each time. ""It'll never work godammit!!"" then later... ""Godammit it'll never work"" - Genius.I'm going to try very hard not to mention the veritable treasure trove of movie cliché's that the brothers must've raided when writing the 'script', other than to point out that at one point I went over 20 mins without hearing a single line of dialogue that didn't make me laugh with utter disdain.Even the wardrobes were bad (in The Matrix?!!).  I mean, morpheus' Casio dealer outfit from reloaded was bad enough, but I almost walked out if the Odeon when I saw the Merylvingyn dressed up like a satanic Harry-Hill surrounded by a group of rejects from the Slipknot-gig that was apparently occurring across the road during filming. This movie is so terrible it makes me want to go out and buy a thesaurus just so I can come up with words that will adequately describe it, but then the majority of people who went and seemed to enjoy it would fail to understand such language, so I'll keep it simple.The Matrix revolutions is bad......

Biggest disappointment of 2003,"Imdb users on the Matrix Reloaded message board came up with better plot lines for this movie than the directors, the Wachowski brothers. Based on the message board discussions i was expecting to learn something new and shocking - Zion is part of the Matrix, Neo is a program not a person, stuff like that. Instead all we get is a futuristic gun battle, which is just fine in a simpler ""good vs evil"" plotline (Star Wars, for example). Smith should have stayed dead at the end of the first Matrix. As much as i loved Hugo Weaving's performance, the Smith plotline was treated as a distraction until the last fight.With this movie, the Wachowskis clearly show themselves to be one-hit wonders. One great film, and then no more good ideas, ever.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My vote goes with the 'thumbs down' reviewers,"A complete load of old tosh. The lack of any real plot, (with something between 'Theology for Beginners' and simple New Age gibberish competing to try to form this), leads to over-compensation in the special effects field. The latter are used again, and again, and again, and... to portray endless 'battles' between the (human) Goodies and the (Machine) baddies and fights between the three main protagonists and 'Smith', (who comes to represent...oh, that's right, because the plot is so poor, you never really understand what!). Of course, because these battles and fights are so similar and so protracted, they become, like the film as a whole, unbelievably b-o-r-i-n-g and by about half way into the film you really could not care less who wins ""the War"", you just want the thing to end and to justify your video rental money by enduring this torture until the closing credits. What also contributes to this, of course, is the fact that the characters are just human computer game figures by this stage, lacking in humour or any real discernible human emotion to such an extent that, when Neo and Trinity do show their 'love' to each other, it comes across as a scheduled 'emotion check' between the battle/fight scenes and just as authentic as a fifteen dollar note. No, this, (together with the other sequel predecessor, (which was bad, but not to the same degree as this turkey)), should stand as the all-time warning to any director/writer responsible for producing a truly brilliant film, (which the original 'Matrix' certainly was), and who is thinking of producing a/future sequel/s by calling up inside them a little voice, saying, ""Are you REALLY sure?""",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Snoozing through war,"This movie is a disaster. What it lacks in plot or even a decent script it tries to make up for in crashing, banging, whooshing, flying, dropping, spinning, blinking blinding bright lighting, thuds and - you get the picture. If it didn't have a beautiful multiracial cast I would give it a zero. As it was I shut my eyes to avoid the seemingly unending wartime strobe effects. The noise was constant and the fights were much too lengthy. Enough already!

It was a point of many discussions at the diner booth. The concepts were so fresh and exciting. I'm saddened to announce to fans the last two movies have been made to capitalize on the unexpected popularity of the first. If you're expecting an ending with a bang, prepare yourself for a mild sizzle. There is NOTHING innovative about this movie (except the marketing that went into the hype). Sure there were good action sequences that wows you superficially. It helped immensely that I watched it on a 8 story IMax screen. The fact remains the story was weak at best. I'm left feeling so empty. I didn't care about the characters like I should have. Merovingian character could have potentially developed into a key role. Wasted. Bane's potential. Wasted. Morpheus the father-like mentor just another warm body with lines of dialog.I tried to capture the essence of this film by staying away from previews, promotions, and hype. But it's so hard to abstain when they are throwing it in your face. Although the The Animatrix contained good thought provoking storylines than any of these sequels. If fact I honestly wished these 2 sequels NEVER came out.I cherish those days of ignorant bliss discussing all the possibilities the Matrix had to offer.

A trilogy better than the sum of its parts.,"For context, The Matrix is one of my top 5 all time films, but until recently I had never bothered to watch Reloaded or Revolutions because I heard they were dissapointing. One day I decided to watch both, and while neither is a masterpiece like the original, they're actually not dissapointing on their own terms.Revolutions is the final chapter in a classic hero's journey. I already saw what would happen at the end, and there were basically no surprises throught the film. The sense of desperation has reached it's maximum, and the creators honestly did a good job in holding nothing back, pushing every character to the limits of their strength and will. There is a lot of shooting in this movie, more than necessary. There are some questionable scenes in the second half of the film, and I dont know if I buy some of the ideas in it, such as bargaining with machines that have no emotional dimension. I only watched it once, but I'm also pretty sure they left a couple of threads hanging too.Finally, I think there was a missed oppurtunity with Revolutions, being just barely 2 hours long, for a more substantial ending sequence showing how humans plant the seeds for rebuilding earth. Things kind of just cut off toward the end and I think its wrong that the ending actually takes place inside the matrix. I would of liked to see something where people climb to the surface, or a literal break in the coulds, something like this.All of that is pointless to break down though, and I think this finale to the trilogy is overall a success. To sum it up. The first movie is a 10/10, and Reloaded and Revolutions are both a 7/10. This should average out to an 8/10 for the whole trilogy, but I would actually say its worth a 9/10.

Not the ending I'd hope to see,"A ""good"" conclusion for this trilogy, granted. However, having seen the second Matrix-film (The Matrix Reloaded), and now this third and last installment in the series, my opinion is that the Wachowski-brothers didn't have material to fill three full-length movies. The pace of the storytelling in Matrix Revolution is very uneven. Some scenes are rather dull and lengthy, and doesn't really progress the story anything. Compared to the first and second films, there isn't as much cool hand to hand combat to speed things up. All-in-all, it's not as interesting to watch, perhaps because you already know what's gonna happen...

Are we really this jaded?,"I'm not sure what movie everyone is watching, but I have two questions:1. What, exactly, were you expecting?2. Are we really this jaded, this over-stimulated, as a Sci-Fi movie going public?If nothing else, its a testament to just how fantastic this franchise is that people can be let down by what is, by comparison to all the other schlock out there, a fantastic Sci-Fi movie. Is it as mind-bending as the first movie? Nope. Does it answer all the questions of the second movie? Nope.No matter what the conclusion looked like, it wouldn't meet expectations. If they took the time to wax philosophical, it would be boring and ponderous, if it was all action, it would be devoid of thought. As it was, it was a sometimes awkward marriage of the two that still resulted in a worthy conclusion that is far better than anything else we've seen in recent memory.If anything, the Brothers are guilty of trying too hard to please their many fans, to understand and meet too many expectations. There are a lot of negative things you can say about this movie, but I challenge anyone to find a Trilogy that holds up so well, and delivers such a tight, fully realized world, philosophy and set of characters.The critics need to get over themselves, and the viewers need to stop listening to them, set their expectations at a reasonable level, and experience what is offered rather that spend the two hours trying to reconcile it with your desires of what it ""should"" be.This film is awesome, as are its two predecessors.

Basic character work of some side characters are really the only reason this movie works,"For a solid while this is probably my favorite Matrix movie. Its final act doesn't work as well as the rest, but up until that point the action spectacle works probably better than at any point in the franchise. I think it helps that most of this movie is set outside the Matrix and in the real world so the unimaginative choices of the previous film and the cleaner aesthetic don't really touch this one.I made the observation when writing about The Matrix Reloaded, but I think it bears repeating: It's amazing how badly both of these sequels start considering the great start to the first film. You'd think that that original great opening indicated that the Wachowskis knew how to ease an audience into an adventure, but I wouldn't be surprised if the original script was subject to a series of rewrites to tighten things up that the sequels were never subjected to. So, there's about twelve hours until the machines reach Zion, and Neo is in a coma after exhibiting some new powers over the machines outside the Matrix. In order to get Neo back, Morpheus and Trinity need to go on a fetch quest to find the Merovingian which involves a chase through a subway to get the Train Man, and an action scene that, while I do like it, feels like a repeat of the lobby fight in the first film. By the time the Merovingian is telling Trinity to bring him the eyes of the Oracle, the audience should be cheering when she undercuts everything by pointing a gun at his head and demanding what she wants. The extended dialogue scene that leads to the quick resolution is so ultimately pointless that it's a giant waste of time at the opening of an action spectacular.It takes too long, but the movie finally begins when Neo gets rescued and he needs to take one of the final two ships to Machine City. The other ship will go to Zion and offer support to the fight against the machines. From this point to when Neo faces off Smith in the final confrontation, I think The Matrix Revolutions embraces everything that works best about these movies: action spectacle. And, on top of that, the character work involving all of the side characters ends up paying off because we have characters with motives and goals that are understandable and not steeped in philosophical meanderings. The Kid just wants to help, so when he gets to help and contribute it works. Zee just wants to see her husband Link again, so when she can go to the dock to help in the chance that she'll get to see him again it works. It's not deep stuff, but it's basic character work that was largely missing from the second film in favor of philosophical conversations that drag the film down.The flight of the final ship, the Hammer, is taught, but it's the actual fight in the massive domed dock as the thousands of squid like sentinels flood in against the machine gun fire from giant mech suits that works best. It's a huge battle that simply looks fantastic as the nearly white interior gets steadily more hellish as it darkens and fires break out everywhere. The visuals almost get painterly at times with wonderful compositions and contrasting colors. Combined with the basic character work at play, it is one of the most fully successful action sequences in the series. The fact that it's so heavily CGI at the same time is kind of amazing.And then...we need to feel something as Trinity dies. So, a Smith who had possessed a real person blinds Neo, Neo kills him anyway because he can see the machines, Neo and Trinity fly to Machine City, barely get through, and Trinity dies as they crash. The long listless speech that she gives him about their love while she dies falls so hilariously flat because the romance between the two characters was never even close to convincing. And yet, the way the scene is written it feels like the Wachowskis had figured they had written one of the great romances. Neo goes to the machines who take his offer of peace for him to fight Smith who's taken over the Matrix by taking over every individual and program inside it.Now, the idea of Smith in these sequels is something I really like. He represents Neo's opposite. Where Neo is the embodiment of pure individual free will, Smith represents the collective machine where everyone is the same. It's a great contrast that gets surprisingly little dialogue treatment considering how much everyone talks about everything else in the sequels. However, the final fight, while wonderfully filmed, ends on such a weird note that must have some kind of explanation that I'm missing. Smith absorbs Neo, and that destroys all of Smith. I guess it's the collective ideal not being able to function with such a purely individualistic sacrifice and choice being absorbed. I guess, but I don't think it works dramatically. It's weird. I don't like it.And then the movie does another thing that bugs me about these movies and keeps the individuals trapped in the Matrix as an esoteric ideal rather than a dramatic reality. When the Smiths all get destroyed, based on the re-emergence of the little Indian girl/program that was introduced at the very beginning and absorbed by Smith halfway through, the people he had controlled were freed. And yet, despite having absorbed every person in the Matrix, presumably billions of people, we don't see a single one of them. We get a conversation between the Oracle and the Architect about them. Again, it's more talk where some showing would have been really well deserved. For all the talk about the fight to free the people from the system of control that is the Matrix, there's shockingly little concern for anyone actually plugged into that system. It's a fight over esoteric ideals in the end, not people. Which is why the dock battle works because that is a fight about some individuals fighting to survive.Yeah, most people dismiss this movie completely, but I think its middle section works almost as well as the best of the original The Matrix. The beginning is frustrating and the ending as well in different form, but the film is really dominated by the middle where it works really well. Like all of them, this could have been better, but on the whole, I think The Matrix Revolutions ends up being a pretty good action spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great story, but Keanu still can't act","Well,the trilogy is finally over- and although some people have been griping about the somewhat vague ending, I can't think of any other way that would have brought a satisfying resolution to the story- which is left wide open for a sequel in the future (although they should really just stop here.)What I liked: The Zion Attack scenes were amazing, there's no padding in the first half hour like in Reloaded,unexpected character deaths,the final Agent Smith battle put the Burly Brawl to shame, and the whole train station scene was touching and well thought out.What I didn't like: Keanu still can't act, Morpheus and Persephone had nothing to do, the confrontation scene with Bane was ridiculously stretched out.This was far more satisfying than the last installment, although everyone should really watch all 3 movies in a row before they start griping about it. The philosophy elements were toned down as well, but still intriguing (The Merovingian's ""cause and effect"" view, versus Neo's ""free will/choice"" view.)My Score: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Recycled Garbage,"I'll say this: The Matrix Revolutions is better than Reloaded, and that's not saying a whole lot. Basically, the plot was thin, the characters were flat, the acting was a joke, but the fight scene were awesome! The entire battle for Zion wasamazing. Agent Smith was the tops, as always and I really enjoyed theexcessive violence him and Neo endured in the real world. But overall, special effects can't save everything. I couldn't tell you how many times I countedsomething that was directly ripped off the original Matrix (like the ending with Smith and pretty much every fight scene). One thing (among many plot holes)posed a question: if Neo ""destroyed"" Smith JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME, what'sto prevent Smith from, once again, miraculously returning and being morepowerful?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Truly revolutionizing,"I thought this would be the worst film among the three. Its because, i rated the second one with disgust and so i thought this would be the worst. But the Wachowski learned from their mistake. We go to the a movie obviously expecting to watch a movie, not a circus, or mere fighting match, which was basically the content of the Reloaded. And fortunately this time, the movie was back. And the story was again in continuation to its final end.The eye-popping special effects is still their and i think its much better paired with the war scene. The balance is totally doing good, unlike in the Reloaded where too much special effects makes me wanna vomit. The love story between Neo and Trinity is pretty much interesting because its not like the ordinary love stories full of ""fantasy"" and far-from-reality-sweetness.And this time, the story is more clearer and no questions where left hanging. I give a salute to the Wachowski bros for its truly ""imaginative"" imagination..going beyond the human capacity i may say.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Want to ruin a good movie? Make it into a trilogy!,"I guess we are all greedy. The studios for more money and the audience for more of the same taste of cinematic beauty.Imagine the legendary status some movies could achieve, if they didn't have sequels. Wasn't 'Back to the Future' ruined by its 3rd sequel? The same goes for 'The Godfather'. Wouldn't 'Lord of the Rings' be the greatest movie of all time, if it was one movie only? And lets not forget about 'Star Wars'. Unfortunately 'The Matrix' was also ruined by its sequels.Now imagine 'Pulp Fiction' with a sequel. Tarantino isn't dumb you know. And the Wachowski's should have found another outlet for their productivity, instead of ruining a movie that demonstrated the most stunning visual style since 'Pulp Fiction' - and I am not talking about the bullet-time effect.Anyway trying to save their movie, they attempted to complete the trilogy in confusion. But if you watch closely, you will see that the ending is sadly simplistic. Please note that simple means clever, while simplistic means stupid.The visual effects are absolutely breath taking. The only reason to watch 'Revolutions'.I am not a 'Matrix' fan. I have stated many times before that it is a 'Dark City' ripoff. Still its excellent visual style, should be preserved in its original form and not be caricatured by its sequels.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Average Film which was rescued by Keeanu reeves playing an excellent role.,"Those of you who have seen the first matrix film would have been dasled by its special effects.When i saw the film i thought it did not do the main characters justice. I hardly ever saw Morpheus and the storyline was nothing to go by. Although these were infact the worst parts of the film i thought everything else did quite well. It was also reviewed in a newspaper i read and it said in no lesser terms that the film was rubbish and they had seen it all before. I think thats a bit melodramatic as there are a lot more poorer films out there with cheesy lines and poor special effects. Overall the film was good, not great but good. What i thought was great about the film was the part where Neo and Agent Smith are fighting i thought that was very good and that seemed to keep my interest. When it comes out on DVD i will definately be buying it. So for those of you who have not seen it, i urge you to see it so you can see if you agree with me or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
INCREDIBLE.,"I understand that a few people may be just a bit (or a lot) disappointed, but seriously, it does NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Hell, i wasn't expecting a traditional happy ending, though i know damn well i wanted one!! but the film is just so great, and groundbreaking, and innovative, and beautiful.i've read about ppl b@#%$*n' that the first moments r boring, which is obvious that they probably haven't even seen it. there's dialogue with such beautiful philosophical meaning, shorter and much more significant than the architect ranting in RELOADED. Agent Smith (brilliantly portrayed by Hugo Weaving) is just funny. And maniacal. And insane. But you'll love him at the end. There are scenes the fans of the first Matrix will love. You'll see what I mean.Will not say whether the ending is good or bad. You can talk about that on your own time. Revolutions will grow on you. It is an amazing conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. All the characters (and the actors who've played them) have done their jobs, excellently. As well as the Wachowski Brothers, their direction and the screenplay are brilliant in ALL 3 MOVIES.And by the way, let's get one thing clear.

The Greatest Story Ever Told about... Computer Viruses?,"This film, and its successor, have been ripped apart for their apparent lack of story and 'recycled' action.  Well, folks, I give you the American mindset- what have you done for me lately!This trilogy isn't nearly as bad as many make it out to be.  It is a wonderful story about two diametrically opposed computer viruses- one is Neo, the other is, of course, Agent Smith.  Neo inadvertantly created the Agent Smith virus at the end of the first movie.Revolutions pulls many of the loose ends together and paints a compelling picture of what exactly is the machine's motivation.  It also speaks to the nature of faith, belief and predetermination.  An awful lot of stuff for a science fiction movie, and not always clearly articulated, but its there none-the-less.If you think the Matrix Trilogy was confusing, check out a David Lynch film. Matrix will look like 'See Spot Run' in comparison.There is no revolutionary new effects, there isn't any additions to the Matrix way of fighting.  Neo doesn't fight all that much.  But the final assault on Zion is something to behold, and the Club Hell scene is rather juicy.  Naturally, the climactic battle between Smith and Neo is suitably over the top and viscerally powerful.Go see it and see it for what it is- a good science FICTION movie with a few, if somewhat muted, messages and plenty of food for thought.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A flawed film which ends the trilogy with a whimper.,"I was quite clear on what I thought about Reloaded, the action scenes inside the Matrix were good overall, but it was letdown by the scenes in Zion which I felt were mostly a waste of time. In that film, it didn't matter, I could sit through a few scenes I didn't like for the great car chase or the Architect scene. However in this film, I realised that Reloaded's flaws only emphasise the flaws in Revolutions.Firstly, this film is all over the place as it is. Not enough time is spent on Neo who is the pivotal character of the trilogy, there are extremely long sequences just showing the war between man and machine in Zion, which definitely would have benefited from a few Neo and Trinity scenes as intermissions. The battle between the humans and the machines isn't presented well and it's boring to put it bluntly. However, it is made even worse by the fact that these characters fighting the machines were not developed enough in this film or the previous one.Bottom line: The Matrix Revolutions is about a war between some humans and some machines which I just don't care about all that much. The Wachowskis had plenty of time to develop these characters in the opening section of Reloaded, and instead they wasted their time on a five-minute partying scene. By the time the war comes around, I don't know enough about these characters for it to sustain my interest in a short battle, let alone this massive attack on the city of Zion which takes up half of this film.I was sitting bored in my seat during most of this film, because despite the visuals and special effects, I needed someone to root for during this battle, and the closest I got to this was the kid who was seen briefly during Reloaded.This isn't the only gripe I have with the film, the whole thing is just bad to be honest. The ending to the trilogy was disappointing and underwhelming, as yet again the effects were great and everything, but I was expecting something really inventive to finish this whole trilogy off. Instead the final scene ends too quickly and it's predictable, recycling some of the ideas from the first Matrix film.The Wachowskis failed big time on Revolutions, it lacks pretty much everything that made the first film exciting to watch, and everything that made Reloaded at least passable as a sequel. It's boring and doesn't deliver a satisfying ending to the trilogy after three films, tainting all the good memories of the previous two.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mindless... and surprisingly blank as an ending.,"The most disturbing feature of this last installment is that it is very 'disturbing'... to our eyes, to our minds and most important, to our expectations. It was quite evident in ""Reloaded"" that the end will not be as fun as the start. But I thought at least there'd be something to watch, as in Reloaded. Well, ""Revolutions"" have got some stunning visuals (for those who don't know!) but they are no longer soothing to the eyes. Why waste bucks on special effects and stuff when people can't watch it? Cluster of machines swarming over underground city, in the same fashion and shown from same angles, it got so freakishly boring. And the last Neo-Smith fight? it looks good in trailers, not in the movie that shows it for ten minutes or so.The story, perhaps was not so bad altogether. There are few surprises hopefully to save my investment behind the matrix saga. The ending is done well, though basically rubbish as an idea. The one positive point of this movie that it at least sticks to a basic path, not wandering wild as in Reloaded. It should have been so, because there were so many questions to answer.It's easy to say ""It could be better."" but the fact is it couldn't. I believe the modern cinema technology is still not enough to create a satisfactory ending of the Matrix, even with good ideas. And also, probably, the goals of the producers got changed after the success of the first. It's promises for intelligent food for thought must have been compromised for financial success. But it turns out as an overdose of this decision.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A great conclusion to the Matrix Trilogy,"Matrix Revolutions was very good in my opinion. In some ways better than Matrix Reloaded. I won't go into detail and spoil anything for anyone but I will just say that the action/battle scenes were better than in Reloaded as well as the effects. Action wasn't as repetitive and the effects weren't quite so video game like (ie the ""100 Smiths"" fight in Reloaded).This is not to say that I didn't like Reloaded. As with any movie there are little problems here and there (the aforementioned video game-like effects and repetitive aspects to some of the fighting) but over all I really enjoyed Reloaded. I just think, in my opinion, Revolutions didn't have as many problems.As far as Revolutions goes I really liked how the story was told and concluded. Characters that weren't of real importance from the last film come into play more while the opposite for others. I had guesses about the ending and thought I had a few scenarios already figured out but they surprised me with this one. Not in a Shyamalan way though. Just a nice turn to things that I hadn't anticipated.I am sure there will be some out there that will hate it though. Some people just build up expectations so high that nothing could satisfy. But as for myself I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone who liked the previous two films even a little.One more final note. Judging the film on it's own it IS a little unbalanced. But as a ""part II"" of the Matrix Sequels it is great. In some ways I like to consider Reloaded and Revolutions to be one long film split into two pieces (kind of like Kill Bill). Rather than one being a sequel of another as Reloaded was to The Matrix.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Greatest Cinematic Event of Our Time...,"There is only one reason why one would not be in total awe of this movie.

Disappointing conclusion,"The second part was already borderline. 'Matrix Revolutions' goes one better and falls completely into a mindless story and an ultimate shooting orgy without sense and reason.Why exactly are there two parts? Targeted action interludes and a focus on the essential story (regardless of whether the story makes sense) would have made it possible to make both parts into one. It would have been good for the quality.'Matrix Revolutions' is a huge disappointment for me. The philosophical approach from the first part was half-bakedly taken up in the second part, but in the third part at the latest it is completely lost. The focus is now on senseless shooting, where people shoot at a crowd of guard machines for several minutes and try to scream even louder. There is no tension at all.What also struck me negatively is the character development. Neo has finally become the omniscient and invincible messiah and Morpheus has been degraded to an interchangeable side character.The ending is a joke and if you think about it for 3 minutes and continue spinning what was said you will realize that it can't work like that.

Slight Improvement over the last,"""Everything that has a beginning, has an end""A minor improvement over the last, and that's partly because of the closures we've been able to achieve. Even if we keep aside all these finer connotations, we have still got a perceivably enriched experience that shall and must entice an overwhelming majority of the audience.The pace took a massive hit though. I would go as far as to say, it comes to a standstill on frequent occasions. The chief perpetrator behind such insouciance is none other than the Screenplay itself. By deliberately surrendering its tempo, it set out to attain a certain degree of impishness; hence, focusing primarily on the visuals and the action aesthetics, which I did find appealing. However, on the other end, I'm afraid some aspects were blatantly disregarded.For instance, While the central figures have been well received in a sporting manner, it's the newly introduced characters who don't seem to hold onto their own. Mainly as a consequence of the ignorant write-up and the clear lack of self-sustainability on their sides. Fortunately, for our main protagonists, things were rather encouraging! Especially, for Neo and Trinity or should I be more specific and say it's the relationship I'm inclined to talk about.I'll have to confess, way back in the first film I wasn't so sure about this particular chemistry let alone the dynamic Keanu and Carrie-Anne shared. However, as the story slowly took its steps forward; I started to care. And now I can say with much certainty that I do care. Neo and Trinity, their affection gradually grew up in my subconscious.

dull ending,"I can't decide if the third film was better than the second. Both were not too good. The biggest complaint with this one was the solution to the war between man and machine. It was dumb and simple, and didn't make a whole lot of sense. It had so many CGI effects and no plot. What was the point of Jada Smith. It mainly showed her sitting down piloting a ship. And it didn't even make sense why they had to go the hard way to get to Zion. Plus, the ship kept hitting everything and still kept going. And Trinity was a waste in this film. Her character was so great in the first film. And why waste Monica Belluci. I don't think she even said anything in this movie. The Trainman was dumb. It was supposed to be an obstacle for Neo to overcome, and all he does is get on the subway when it comes by the second time. Real suspenseful, huh!And the final fight between Neo and Mr. Smith was silly. Why do they keep hitting each other when they both have superhuman strength. And when Neo turns into an agent but then isn't one anymore. That made no sense. So, some how in the real world the machines kept Mr. Smith from taking over Neo in the Matrix. I really have no idea.FINAL VERDICT: It's awful that they turned such a great movie as the Matrix into a very generic, boring trilogy. If you really want to see how the story ends, then go ahead and watch it. You really couldn't be more disappointed after the second movie.

"Confused for a while, but definitely not disappointed.","For the people complaining that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" had no story, they should be content with ""Revolutions"".  With the story line divided between Zion's war against the Sentinels and Neo's/Trinity's journey to machine city, your are far from bored or disappointed.  With exception of the ""Rings Trilogy"", I can't think of any special effects driven war as tremendous as the war with Zion.  The smart thing the Wachowski brothers did was play out each story arch in it's entirety before moving to the next, so when you witness the war with Zion there are no interruptions, with the same going for Neo's journey.       It's impossible to say that one of the Matrix movies is better than the other two.

"It is not the ending that the franchise deserved, it is a film full of ups and downs in almost equal doses, bringing great concepts interspersed with terrible executions","""Matrix Revolutions"" is already endowed with the enormous responsibility of knotting all the loose ends left by the previous film (the first is already closed by itself) and these were not few. Reloaded ends with a completely open ending, fulfilling the role of part one within a double narrative. It is an inglorious destination for a film that closes the saga of Neo, Trinity and Morpheus with academic competence. Note that the competency cited here has two meanings. The first is good, since the adventure ties ""most"" of loose ends, guarantees two hours of entertainment and still leaves ample scope for discussions. The other, bad, is the lack of innovation, which favors conventional solutions, already seen and reviewed in the cinema.
Revolutions expands the emphasis on Reloaded, focusing much of its narrative in the real world, where machines invade Zion in what would be the last battle of this long war. It is in these sequences, outside the Matrix, that the work really sustains itself, counting on an unceasing rhythm of action that suffers from an exaggerated duration, but that, in the last instance, manage to arrest the viewer. Evidently these do not lack their own defects, which, in general, boil down to an artificial drama created by the focus on certain characters (read Zee, his partner and Captain Mifune, the only ones who really do anything in the fight), which only diminishes our perception of the general picture of humanity's survival.The final fight between Neo and Smith - a street fight between Supermen - is great, the attack of the machines on Zion is exciting and the visit to the city of 01, the capital of the machines, quite satisfactory for those who checked ""The second rebirth "", episode of the Animatrix series. Also noteworthy is the writers' treatment of women in the film. Trinity has never been so determined and tough, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) eclipses Morpheus and even Zee (Nona Gaye) appears to save the day. Matrix women do not take offense at home and never lose their femininity. The long battle in Zion is interspersed, in parallel assembly, with the ship chase between Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the sentries. This second approach ensures that the rhythm of the work is not broken, while bringing greater tension than the repeated shooting in the human city. What does not go out of our mind as we watch the hordes of sentries invading Zion (emulating a swarm of wasps) is the waste by the creative team in inserting new machines into combat, which could insert a greater touch of dynamism into the fight. Still, some specific plans can be truly frightening, while revealing the fragility of the man around the machines.On the other side of this devastated world, we have Trinity and Neo traveling the dark surface of the planet to reach the city of machines. Here is the real highlight of the film, which provides us with true delights of science fiction. The human creation fields are again shown and remain as terrifying as their first appearance in the Matrix. In addition, finally, new machine designs are shown, also inspired by insects in order to quickly capture fear in the viewer. Despite Neo's ""messianic"" vision, the way he sees the world of machines inexplicably comes up with an interesting antithesis with our look at it: the dark is replaced by beams of light that make us forget that they are the ""villains"". When Neo arrives in the city of machines - a journey that, increasingly, proves itself without turning, it is phenomenal. After being provided with one of the most ecstatic scenes in the trilogy - the bomb barrier and the rise over the clouds - we fell back into the darkness of the real world. The little glimpse we have of the city only leaves us with a taste of ""I want more"". At the source of the machines, which adopts a human face in order to establish an element of identification with its interlocutor - what follows is a short and surprisingly human dialogue and one of the few cases in the franchise where a scene should have been extended. It is impossible, however, to fail to notice the respect for which the leader of the machines has towards Neo - the death of the protagonist is practically serene in his hands and his body is resting - and not thrown - on the ground, to be, in then taken to the unknown, corroborating the human side of its greatest enemies within this universe. The film should have ended at that point, dispensing with the unnecessary epilogue with Sati, the Oracle and the Architect.Matrix Revolutions proves the richness of the universe conceived by the two sisters by presenting new layers of virtual reality that serve as a scenario for action: the subway station, for example, reveals itself as a kind of ""dump"" of that complex operating system; while the elevator of the nightclub visited by Morpheus and Trinity contains a red button that, instead of indicating a floor, only bears the word 'Help'. In addition, the film introduces the curious concept that programs would also be able to love (discovering this, Neo questions: 'But this is a human emotion', and hears the great answer: 'No, it is a word').Here in the third film we have the creation of constant parallels in order to demonstrate that we are not far from the machines. The most obvious of these is Commander Lock, who has a more methodical thinking and dispenses with the beliefs of Morpheus, who, in turn, represents the more human side of the equation. It is clear that both sides are fighting for survival and war only exists because of a stone thrown centuries ago. The parallel extends to the Oracle and the Architect, both programs within the Matrix, but which have almost opposite thoughts (something made clear by the dialogue between Neo and the Architect in the previous film).But not everything is correct. Agent Smith, which was a very well-done concept in the Matrix, has already begun to undergo a dubious treatment in Reloaded, but it is only in Revolutions that the script really completely spoils the main antagonist of the franchise. You see, the premise of a corrupted program taking the place of the Matrix is not only acceptable, but quite interesting - the problem lies in the cartoon execution conceived by the Wachowski. Evil laughter, lightning falling behind the villain, catch phrases and threatening poses are just the beginning of this completely unnecessary outcome.At the end of the second chapter, for example, the viewer was surprised by a bombastic revelation: Neo had become able to use his powers in the 'real world'. Now, it is to be imagined that an important data like this (so relevant that it served to close the film) would be clarified in the next part, right? For this is not what happens, since the Oracle is limited to establishing the obvious: the power of the Chosen One can manifest itself in several worlds. What's worse, to prevent the public from realizing that no puzzle is being solved, the Wachowski create new mysteries, that is: they propose more questions when they should be concerned with answering those already asked. So, instead of implying an old - and completely expendable - relationship between Seraph and Merovingian, filmmakers should be concerned with clarifying who (or what) the latter is. In fact, they did not even try to maintain consistency between the last two parts of the trilogy: in Reloaded, Captain Lock stated that he would need 'all the ships to survive the attack' of the sentries, criticizing the fact that Nebuchadnezzar was released to leave. The curious thing is that, in the final chapter, no ships are used during the battle against the machines. And, after all, what happened to the Gemini who worked for Merovingian, and who were so prominent in the previous film?Featuring a grandiosity, almost epic soundtrack, Matrix Revolutions puts its strength in the great visual effects, keeping the viewer's attention with spectacular images of hundreds of thousands of Sentinels invading Zion. And, once again, the Wachowski prove to be masters in directing action sequences - since, in this regard, the film does not disappoint. Unfortunately, they do not show the same sensitivity when it comes to dialogues, which again sound pretentious and, at various times, simply laughable ('Hope is an indulgence for which I don't have time').As if that were not enough, the sisters are unable to find a plausible justification for the change of the actress who plays the Oracle (the original, Gloria Foster, died after completing the works in Reloaded): after saying that ""there is no easy explanation"" for the change in his appearance, the character says that ""had to pay the price"" for a certain choice. Now, if the new look is a kind of 'punishment', a consequence of a certain attitude, why does it remain similar to your old self? Why not radicalize and transform the Oracle into a deformed man or a very old woman (as if his 'effort' had robbed him of life)?However, the most frustrating aspect of Revolutions is the Wachowski's neglect in handling the plot's outcome - and I don't mean just the lack of answers to important questions (How did Smith get into Bane's body? What does Merovingian want?), But also to the solution to the conflict between Neo and Smith: what, exactly, happened there?Finally, ""Matrix Revolutions"" still fails to involve us in the dramas of its characters. And the reason for this coldness in the trilogy is obvious: regrettably, the Wachowski see their characters as the Architect sees humans: as simple pieces of a game, not as individuals. The feeling is that ""Matrix Revolutions"" has abandoned much of the philosophical issue and has been concerned with delivering a film filled with uninterrupted action. It is definitely not the ending that the franchise deserved, it is a film full of ups and downs in almost equal doses, bringing great concepts interspersed with terrible executions.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does not Disappoint,"Basically, this movie is better than `Reloaded', but certainly not better than the original `Matrix' or '96.  When I think back to `the Matrix', I remember that at the end of the movie, I could make my own conclusions as to whether or not Neo saves people of the Matrix and the real world.  If he does save the world, I could also imagine my own scenario of Neo saving everyone.  With `Revolutions', all that is taken away from me.With that said, I think that maybe a downer ending would've suited this franchise much better.  But hey, I'm just an idiot who's writing down thoughts about the movie.  I didn't make em.  A happier ending may appeal to some (perhaps wider) audiences, and I'm fine with that.  The ending to `Revolutions' isn't what I thought it would be, but it certainly is not a let down.Whereas `Reloaded' felt rather redundant; as the audience was almost 100% sure that Neo would live to see another movie, `Revolutions' makes the audience fear for him, especially since most of the time in the movie, he is in the real world.  He has special powers, but he is also human.The battle scenes inside Zion's walls obviously look a tad on the virtual side.  But come on now, we're talking about a bunch of flying machines invading an underground city, protected by giant machine-gun capable robots, controlled by humans.  Do you have the stock footage of this in your vault? I didn't think so.I thought these scenes were very thrilling because I'm usually the one that really puts myself into the shoes of the characters on screen.  When the machines breach the wall, I hope to God that they are stopped.  I couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose a battle like that.There are other chill scenes besides the one I just described, but I don't think any one raised the hair on the back of my neck than when Trinity and Neo fly above the dark skies of the real world, and finally see the sky the way it was meant to be seen.  I can't really describe it well enough; it was just a great moment as far as this story goes.Thankfully, in this movie, there isn't much in the line of monotonous line reading by the architect.  For the average movie going herb chuck, that was a monumental detraction of `Reloaded'.I don't care if there is a message hidden beneath all the blabbing of the Architect, the greatest movies work on both the entertaining and intellectual levels.But, while also getting back to my original problem with this movie, there was almost no sign of an original, intelligent idea in this movie.  Sure, there are moments that will make audiences go `Huh'?  But they're easily figured out when thought about for a second.I am no way endorsing, deep, thought-provoking, intellectual, philosophical dreck that usually occupies the `Best Picture' category, I'm just saying that all action isn't that great outside of a Sly Stallone flic (No, not Over the Top').Overall, I think the only thing I can say about this movie is that it was ok.  I don't think it was a landmark feature like `The Matrix', not by a long shot.  This movie was just a detailed description of how Neo does in fact save the real world.  To some, it will be a let down, others it'll be a little exciting.  For even others, it will be a little of both.  But what `The Matrix: Revolutions' will not be, is as great as the first movie in the series was.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Come on folks--meet them half way!,"It should go without saying that viewers are drawn to (and repelled from) the Matrix movies for a combination of reasons: special effects, action, theme, story, philosophy, soundtrack, cast, etc.In important ways, both Reloaded and Revolutions contribute to a great trilogy.  Each movie raises bold questions that have preoccupied philosophers--classical and contemporary--and that deserve a place in our present consideration.It seems to me that a key component to an appreciation of this trilogy is a modest exercise in suspending one's disbelief.  The campy dialogue, cheesy love scenes, and over-the-top epic battles can be stumbling blocks if one insists on staying rooted in skepticism--if one insists that the movie-makers come to him/her, rather than offering to meet them half-way. The elements just listed are also found throughout the world's best classic literature: The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Illiad & Oddyssy, The Bible, Paradise Lost, etc.We all can think of ways we think the movies could be better.  No one will argue that a movie production team who places special effects at the top of its list is going to fall short in other crucial areas (character & plot development).  It reads as if most imdb.com members had unwarranted expectations of the sequels in the trilogy, and communicated their disappointment through their votes.  Unfortunately, this distorts these movies merit.  Currently, Reloaded has an IMDB average of 7.3 and Revolutions 6.7--compared to The Matrix at 8.5.  It is my belief that a fairer, more reflective audience would rate these movies much more closely. My judgment, for what it's worth--in order of their release 10-9-9.  I express my gratitude to  the hordes of artists and laborers who were involved in the awesome task.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie was amazing.,"This movie made me want to kill myself.  Never have I seen something go sowrong so fast.  Well, maybe not.  The relative pointlessness of 'reloaded'foreshadowed the coming of this monster, but everyone believed that a bigpayoff was coming.The original Matrix was flawlessly constructed; it wasn't hard to follow and it was INTERESTING.  nothing like that here.  morpheus has become moody anddoesn't do anything but sit in the passenger seat and watch some characterfrom the second film drive around in the sewers.  trinity's death scene is like 10 minutes long just to remind us that she and neo actually liked eachother in any way.and zion?  everyone defending zion was an uninteresting and unimportantcharacter.  ultimately, who cares?  i hate this movie and gave it a big, beautiful 1 for it's efforts, because none were apparently made.  and i was forced to see it 3 times.  help.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great! but i waited something more,"I have liked but it gives the sensation of not being finished absolutely. The first episode open many doors and leave to see many possibilities of which happening, but in the second and third episode gives the impression that they are limited, no close the opened doors, putting barriers that themselves avoided in the first episode. History is very good but it seems that the world makes little when they leave matrix, hoped to see more about the world of the machines, something similar to Animatrix ""Matriculated"". The history of the end of Neo not is clear, there are several possibilities. I have liked, the film, the action, history but I think it lacks something. It can be that this fashion to do films of 2 in 2 or 3 in 3 is but better for the producers but not for the spectators, something already could be glimpsed in ""the Two Towers"".

Everything that has a beginning must (thankfully) end,"I'll never forget when I first saw ""The Matrix.""  It was a free sneak preview screening.  The price was right for me, because all I knew about the film was that it starred Keanu Reeves, and that had long ceased being an enticement for me to plunk down cold hard cash at the box office.  I had no expectations about the film and, much to my surprise,  it blew me away. It was thrilling and inventive; filled with mystery and portents.  And Keanu Reeves was surprising good.  For the most part all the script asked him to do was act bewildered, and he does bewilderment well.  All and all, it was one of the best science fiction films I had seen at the movies in a long time-- and remains so until this day.  Despite the fact that when you analyze the film logically, it doesn't make much sense.  But who cared? It isn't like the film makers had to weave a comprehensive logical world view from the basic setup of the movie.  No, they wouldn't have to do that unless they decided to stretch the film out into a trilogy.  (Shouldn't be too hard, they must've thought.  George Lucas did it, and was doing it again.)I anxiously awaited the sequel.  I saw it with a large group of equally-psyched friends and acquaintances on its opening weekend. Everyone hated it.  Except me.  They thought it was too talky, but, I found the free will versus determinism, chance versus purpose, debate interesting.  They also thought the action set-pieces were too overblown and self-indulgent to be enjoyed.  I disagreed.  I thought the set-pieces were some of the best I have seen in years.  Still, the criticism of my friends rang true in places. Yes, the actual Zion was disappointing, perhaps even ridiculous, compared to the place we imagined in the first film, and, yes, the conflict between Neo and Smith was considerably less compelling in an environment where neither of them could really kill the other.  (Freddy vs. Jason, anyone?) However, I kept hope alive.  ""Reloaded"" was only the middle film of the trilogy.  The stopgap.  The last one had to be better.  (Then again... The second film of the original Star Wars trilogy was the best, and, furthermore, the middle film of the Godfather trilogy was arguably the best too.)Thus came ""The Matrix Revolutions.""  Missed it at the theaters.  I wanted to see it, but I like to go to the movies with other people and no one I knew would see it!  Bought the DVD the first day it came out.  Anxiously put it into the machine, and discovered, to my surprise, it was freaking terrible. I can't think of a single good thing to say about it.  Why did I hate it? Let me count the ways...Neo and Trinity.  The romance worked better in the first film than the second.  Not surprising since romance is often more exciting to watch in its initial bloom of growth and longing than in its day-to-day application. In the first film, we watched Neo and Trinity get to know each other, and we learned about them ourselves in the process.  We wanted them to get to get together, and they did.  In the second film, they are together.  So what? Where's the growth and sense of discovery?  The third film simply takes their already static relationship and deifies it into a symbol of all love. They have stopped being people we can identify with.  Yawn.The pace.  Nothing happens for the first hour or so.  Stupid problems are created only to be dismissed simplistically.  Take, for example, the trainman.  Neo can't beat him and as a result could be trapped forever in limbo between the machine world and the matrix.  One could easily make a compelling movie about this problem alone, but they don't bother here.  It is simply a diversion to let the film makers position the rest of the pieces in the game.  Look how ridiculously easy it is for Trinity and Morpheus to get him out.  After a perfunctory battle shamelessly and lifelessly rehashed from the first film, they meet up with the great villain, the Frenchman, who waxes philosophically like a blowhard for what seems to be an eternity before Trinity simply puts a gun to his head.  I suppose this was supposed to be a comic moment along the lines of Indiana Jones just shooting the sword-wielding Arab, but, if that was the case, why not just get it over with quicker.  Then the Frenchman disappears from the movie.  The second movie went to great lengths to set him up, but now he's simply dismissed from the film.  Then again, I suppose he was lucky.  I had still had over an hour to go.The action set-pieces.  The machine attack on Zion had all the thrills of a great video game.  However, even the most exciting video game gets boring to watch when you know you're not going to have a turn at the controls.  I didn't give a darn about any of the characters involved.   Unlike the characters lovingly established in the first movie, the battle for Zion was being fought by a group of one-dimensional stereotypes established in the second film.  It was all special effects without heart.  However, it was not anywhere as ridiculous as the final battle between Neo and Smith.  I found their midair battles nothing short of laughable.  This is the battle I waited almost six hours for?  Give me a freaking break!I remember all the criticism of the first two Star War prequels.  Sure, those films had their problems.  There was too much Jar-Jar in the first one and too much Hayden Christensen in the second one, but they remained entertaining to a degree at their core, particularly on DVD when one can skip a chapter here and there.  That cannot be said of ""Matrix Revolutions."" Despite the millions of dollars spent, and the work of so many talented craftspeople, the film simply cannot even hold my attention.Everything that has a beginning has an end.Thank God we reached it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Please don't bother.,"I've just caught the first local screening of this film, and I'm sorry to say the news is bad.I've seen quite a few saggy, tired blockbusters this year and to be fair this film doesn't share the faults most of them have in common - the technical people have obviously put a lot of time and energy into this film, the production department have really carried things off (the sets are great) and there's no point where the effects overextend themselves.  It looks just fine.The main problem - and this is huge - is with the story itself.  This film has none of the intriguing ideas of the first film, or even the half-baked ideas of the second.  It simply exists to pay off the cliff-hanger established in Reloaded, nothing else, and it does so very poorly.If you found the love story aspects of the previous film overworked and dull, this film will simultaneously bore and nauseate you (and don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good love story).  The action is even dull, except as one reviewer has pointed out the scene in the dock, which will perk you up for all of five minutes.  Otherwise nothing you'll see here will compare with anything from the previous two films.The actors seem to realise there's no rescuing the film, and it's kind of painful to watch Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss (who carried the first film on their shoulders) looking sleepy and simply reciting their lines.  I can't blame them, they're terrible lines.  Hugo Weaving rants and raves and at least earns his paycheck.And worst of all the end just falls apart.  Very little is resolved or explained, it basically sort of finishes.  The lights come up and the audience can finally go home.  You should have seen the audience I was with tonight - not a single happy face walking out of the theatre, the movie just died in front of our eyes.I have a feeling half the world will see this film out of a sense of obligation to the first movie.

Great sequel to end the Matrix Trilogy!,"Really good sequel, I actually liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Story is good it picks up right after where the 2nd movie left off and goes full throttle with what was building up from the 2nd movie; all the characters makes a return and they are still memorable, especially Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Link; villains like Agent Smith is feels even more unstoppable threatening; the action is very awesome tons of them and they are all super engaging; CGI/Visual effects looks amazing; the scenery design for the Machine City looks fabulous; many intense shocking moments that had me jaw-dropped; sound effects are superb; soundtrack was a blast; emotional moments were very well done and surprised me; secrets gets revealed; characters has great chemistry; the dark tone felt very heavy but makes sense; a very awesome climax with a epic battle and a emotional yet satisfying ending. Overall I really liked this third installment of this franchise and I gotta say, even though there is a fourth movie I still think this trilogy ended perfectly. It gave the characters we all know and love lots of developments, it allowed them to show off their abilities and work together to defend humanity against the machines, and man I still have those showdown scenes in my head right now. The ending scene with Neo is what really got me like I've said it s quite emotional but also at the same time it felt very earned because of his heroic journey.

Delivers the Goods,"I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews for ""Revolutions"".  I thought it was much better than ""Reloaded"".  Why?  First, the pacing was much better.  ""Reloaded"" got really talky several times in the film. ""Revolutions"" keeps it to a minimum, and the action scenes keep coming at a steady pace.  ""Reloaded"" had two large set pieces with more of the haki saki kung-fu.  While well done,  they were kind of a yawn.  Too many other films have burned us out on that stuff.  ""Revolutions"" only includes it sparingly, and accentuates the ""Star Wars"" super big CGI scenes.  I heard complaints that many of the questions weren't answered.  Nonsense! There are many scenes of full explanation and resolution in ""Revolutions"".  Oracle spills her beans, Neo fulfills his prophecy, Zion's fate is determined, every character pretty much wraps up their story.  Lack of character development is mentioned.  Well, perhaps the commander of the ATU's needed some background on why he screams incessantly while killing off the machine invaders, but it didn't bother me.  All other characters were fleshed out in ""Reloaded"".  Some reviews say that they didn't care what happens to the characters.  I was tense at times, when some of the characters were in peril.  Everybody does something for reasons that are clear.  The climax is fulfilling, and in general lives up to it's promises.  One thing no one argues about, is the fantastic special effects.

This is Science Fiction,"The Matrix Revolutions is fabulous. No joke here, this movie is everything I hope for in a Science Fiction movie.I've read some pretty bad reviews about this movie and I can't seriously find what movie did those reviewers watch but I can't believe it was this one. The Matrix Revolutions is an amazing piece of cinematic history and closes the Matrix trilogy with the golden key. As anyone would expect this movie is Reloaded Part 2 so, if you didn't like/understand Reloaded, you won't like/understand this movie as well.The Wachowski's this time have fewer surprises in store so the story is pretty straight to the point in Revolutions. A noteworthy aspect to this movie is that all the questions that may have tormented you after seeing Reloaded are pretty well answered - there are those, of course, who will say they aren't simply because either they didn't understand, or it isn't how they expected.This movie is, for me, the definition of Science Fiction itself. Revolutionary special effects and a brilliant storyline that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. Although I could have hoped for nothing better than this closure to the Matrix saga, I must warn those that didn't like or see either of the two first Matrix movies that they should watch it before Revolutions to properly enjoy this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Straight to video if this wasn't a Matrix film,"As the summary says, I don't believe this film would stand on it's own if it were not lucky enough to have the Matrix in it's title. Most of this boils down to that I don't believe the Matrix was intended to be anything more than a single movie. The first movie was a trend setter, it inspired an entire new filming technique as is a classic in it's genre. I actually thought Reloaded was clever, at least it provoked thought and discussion. I can't think what kind of discussion Revolutions will provoke apart from discussions of disappointment. It is poorly scripted, lamely acted, and generally substandard. I am not even annoyed that 'my questions are not answered', it is just poor in comparison to the others.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Everything that has a beginning has an end...,"The Matrix Revolutions is the mildly disappointing finale to the excellent Matrix trilogy. The film is about Neo seeking to fulfill his task as the One and the citizens of Zion (the secret human city in the Real World) defending their home against an onslaught of Sentinals.The film's opening is extremely engaging and action-packed. Morpheus, Link, and Trinity have discovered that Neo is somehow jacked into the Matrix, despite the fact that he is not connected via the head-plug. Morpheus and Trinity enter the Matrix to find Neo and rescue him from wherever he is. They fight through a club to speak with the Merovingian, who, according to the Oracle, knows where Neo is. They persuade him to tell them where Neo is, and they save him.Following this opening sequence, the film is, unlike the other Matrix films, mostly a war film, since the majority of the film documents the battle between Zion and the Sentinals. The battle gets repetitive, but is fairly fun to watch, especially near the end.The film's finale falls short of expectations, in my opinion. I won't spoil it for you... so suffice it to say it's like eating a 10-layer Tootsie Pop, each layer better than the last, until you finally get to the delicious chocolatey center, only to discover it's not there. To fully understand the film's ending, you need to re-view it at least once... I had to re-view it twice before I fully understood exactly what had happened.The film has great acting and a great plot, but the visual effects seem somehow cheesier than Reloaded's effects (I think WB may have pulled some of Revolution's funding after it considered Reloaded a letdown). Also, a certain emotional scene towards the end of the film involving Neo and Trinity goes on FOREVER, never ceasing to pester you with its badly scripted dialouge (the only scene with bad dialouge). Otherwise, the film is great.So, in summary, Revolutions is a good film that, with a few tweaks, could have been a great film. Definitely worth a rental, and if you've already seen Reloaded, you should see Revolutions to find out what happens next.7/10 from zero-hour-ii",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The conclusion of a Trilogy that might have been a Masterpiece.,"The creators of The Matrix Trilogy had repeatedly state that this was conceived as a ""Trilogy"" from the start.Despite the increase of the available resources (money, artistic freedom etc.) the 2nd matrix is got lost in its own ingredients, so it was up to the 3rd to save the day.About the ending that of course I wont spoil you, it was a big decision and a risk for the directors to take such approach. The movie is the darkest of the 3. It is emotional and the prevalent emotion is that of the lost hope.I have seen many times the first Matrix but far less the 2nd and even fewer the 3rd. I know the first by heart, by I don't really remember the biggest part of the 3rd. Sure I remember the basic plot, but the movie needed soooo much more to be remembered and a worthy sequel.For me you have 2 choices. You even watch the whole trilogy one movie after the other until the end OR stay with the satisfying feeling the first one leaves and watch just that.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too bad they didn't stop after the first one !,"First of all let me say that first Matrix was, from my point of view, a real 'top-movie'. The scenario was simple and very well made and all the 'Matrix World' was cleverly introduced during the movie : every scene in Matrix 1 was bringing something useful to the story and was helping us to understand the movie and what was (really) happening from the beginning to the end. And I'm not even talking about the visual effects that were superb :-)And this is what he second movie and even more the third one lacks : a solid storyline. I have indeed the feeling that the spirit of the first movie has gone away and that there is only one thing left to make the movie interesting : plenty and plenty of special effects and awesome action. But even the best special effects and the best action becomes boring when there is nothing behind.To all those that have seen the movie, take time to ask yourself the following question : `How many scenes in this movie are completely useless and do not bring nothing to the story ?' This is at least the question I asked myself when the film was finished. Think about the first Matrix and you'll understand the reason why I asked myself this question : nearly every scene in the original Matrix had a sense, which is sadly not the case for the two others.Add to this some dialogs about pseudo-philosophical stuff that were completely ridiculous and there is only one thing left in this movie : the action.Good action but no story, too many characters that are not developed (and you just wonder WHY they are in the movie ?), too many scenes that you ask yourself, when the movie is finished, why they were there, what was their sense or what was the goal to have them there, and you'll understand why I rated this film with 5.It could have been a 6 but I was way too much disappointed :-)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am sorry that you will be disappointed.,"If you think Reloaded is not as good as Matrix, then Revolution is even worse.Movie has no new breakthough *again.  Same old fight again.

Matrix made easier,"Before I went to see this movie I read many articles in certain papers saying that this movie was not all it is cranked up to be.After seeing the movie for myself,I realise that you should'nt judge a film on what the majority of articles have to say about it.This film is packed with a great story line,written with great imagination and depth.Whilst watching this film you find yourself putting all the pieces of the film's puzzle in your mind.This is down to the fact that the film is explained in great detail,every aspects of the films outputs are all greatly put together so that it makes it easier for you to understand.I say this because in the second one,many people were baffled as to what the film message was trying to say (espeicially at the end!) so that is what makes this film enjoyable.I'm not going to say too much about the movie itself but i'll just say the actions scenes are magnificent and the ending is...........something you will have to see for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'Return of the Jedi' for the Internet Generation.,"It has been said by many that the Matrix Trilogy could be like the Star Wars Trilogy for the Internet Generation. By that rationale it would make 'The Matrix: Revolutions' our Return of the Jedi. To many extents this is true. It caps off the Trilogy with a definite ending but still allows some scope for sequels. The focus of the protagonists is to overcome a seemingly impossible enemy at a point where their very survival is on the line. But, unfortunately, like Jedi this is, in my opinion, the worst of the trilogy. Thankfully it is not for the same reasons as 'Return of the Jedi'. By which I mean it's not a cop out that shamelessly cashes in on the heartfelt sentiments of a potential audience. There are no fluffy teddies here to appeal to the younger female audience that would otherwise have gone to see 'Care Bears the Movie'. We were told through the hype that Reloaded and Revolutions were really one movie split down the middle. Experiencing the films in close succession didn't leave me with that impression. 'The Matrix: Revolutions' feels quite different to Reloaded in that the visual focus shifted from action mainly based within the Matrix to that based in the `real world'; the philosophical musings shifted from understanding `why' we make choices to understanding that we can and the main action content shifted from heavily Martial Arts based fight scenes to lead-fuelled fire fights. Even the techno-rock soundtrack has all but been replaced with an original dramatic score. What has been created is a very different kind of movie although saying that there is a transition between the two at the beginning of Revolutions as it once again includes the Merovingian and his entourage.Again, as with the previous Matrix movies, this film has set the bar for cinematic computer generated graphics. Again, unfortunately, as with Reloaded the CG parts are far too obvious and therefore fail in what they are trying to achieve. They should work by the rule 'if you can't transition flawlessly from human to CG then don't do it'. The CG is very good but it's not to the standard where we can't tell it from real life so they shouldn't rely on it. There were far too many scenes in which the main character was computer generated and it just doesn't look right when inter-cut with real images of them. The attack on Zion is very impressive, dare I say even jaw dropping in places, as thousands of `squidies' pour into the docking area and attack the humans in their gun-toting mechs. Although this assault on the eyes appeared very impressive at first it wasn't long before I could no longer suspend my disbelief enough to except what was happening. This is something I'm sure you will understand as soon as you have experienced it. It's very much a backs to the wall kind of affair for the humans as they attempt to stave of an insurmountable assault of momentous proportions by the invading machine army.Although, as previously mentioned, the CG was unbelievable in places it was nothing, on a scale of incredulity, when compared to some of the acting and dialogue. I'm sure it was more to do with what they were saying than how they were saying it. Unfortunately a lot of the dialogue, much like in Reloaded, plodded along and was delivered in such a way as to seem even less believable. Morpheus was reduced from the great teacher to an almost redundant peripheral character. Far too much emphasis was placed on the love between Neo and Trinity. Although this was obviously the intention of the Directors it's not what the majority of the viewing public and fans of the previous movies will probably enjoy. I think we all understood from the previous film how intense their love was for each other and I don't feel that they needed to spend so much time reiterating it in this one. I know that love plays a major part in all of Neo's decisions and is ultimately what allows him to make the choices he does but I think we all understood that from the second film.I enjoyed the film as it was a continuation of the Matrix story and because of expansion of its universe but it's not the conclusion I was hoping for. Watch it if you've seen the others but don't expect to be coming out of the cinema purchasing another ticket to be readmitted. This won't be joining the others in my DVD collection until the price drops to below ten pounds.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Blown away..awesome to the end,I agree it did not answer a lot of questions but maybe they were not meant to be answered...LOLOk the movie was not as deep as The Matrix which still remains the best movie of the three...but in and as of itself...it is one hell of a movie....Beautiful movie...loved it all the way. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
amazing,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" delivers a thrilling conclusion to the iconic trilogy, earning a solid 7/10 rating from me, and I must say, I loved it. Keanu Reeves's portrayal of Neo reaches its zenith, showcasing his unwavering determination and sacrifice. The film editing expertly balances high-octane action with philosophical depth, although the pacing could be more consistent. Its strength lies in its exploration of fate and the fight for free will amidst a world dominated by machines. The music, with Don Davis's epic score, enhances the film's grandeur, while the cinematography continues to paint a dark and mesmerizing cyberpunk landscape. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" may not have the same groundbreaking impact as its predecessors, but it provides a satisfying culmination to the epic journey and reminds us that the fight for humanity's survival is worth every sacrifice.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A BIG let down! :-(,"OK this was bad really bad. Ok I'm over exaggerating a bit, but it was not what I expected. I really thought it would live up to expectation and make a great movie, but it didn't.The storyline was pretty non-existent, very predictable from Reloaded, but even less story than in Reloaded. Pretty much, Neo saves the day, the end. No twists, nothing new from Reloaded.As in Reloaded, the acting was quite poor, no emotion on the actors/actresses faces, no real emotion that humans would show in this situation. Another poor acting performance from Keanu Reeves with some lines almost laughable.The special effects were good, you cannot deny that and there was a lot of action but this film is only good for that. If you just want to watch a mind numbing film of explosions and robots, this is for you but I really do think it has lost the original ""The Matrix""'s class, storyline and unique being as a film.Oh well, see it, you will see what I mean. So many questions unanswered due to the lack of story.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I liked it...,"If you liked Reloaded, you'll love this movie... if you didn't like Reloaded, you'll probably love this movie even more. It surpasses Reloaded in every way possible. The graphics are ten times better, the Wachowski's got rid of their ego trip and decided to make a movie, and the story line isn't confusing at all. It's straight up war against machines. There isn't too much kung-fu, there isn't too much war, it's nice and evenly spread out in the film. Some shots were visually incredible. The only weak thing about this movie would be most of the dialogue. Everything that comes out of Agent Smith's mouth is almost genius, but everything that escapes anyone else is pretty much guarenteed laughable dialogue. The ideas are cool, it's just most of the lines are predictable. I found many places where i would recite the lines before they were said. It is a great ending to a great trilogy, and makes up for any mistakes Reloaded did. Though you can't beat the first one, you sure can follow it up well enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I want my money back.,"What was that garbage?I would have thought that with a title ""Revolutions"" that some questions would have been answered.  But not in this slop-fest.  As others have, I will not reveal anything about the plot except this:  there are more holes in this movie than bad swiss cheese.  I felt nothing that was left unanswered in ""Reloaded"" was answered, and more question were posed, and these questions were not answered either.  Visual effects in this movie were simply astounding, the best part of the film.  But the constant action of the first movie was absent.  The dialogue was more slop from ""Reloaded,"" big phrases using big words that made no sense and were not essential to plot development.  I wanted my money back after watching this excuse for a conclusion to what started as an interesting and well-developed storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lame ending...,"The Wachowskis blew it on the ending.  Yes, its obvious they lost their plot focus in Reloaded, then in Revolutions it appeared they were going to make up for it, then a big letdown at the end.Sorry Wachowski apologists, thats the truth...Neo and Trin crash their ship into the the machine city, ""make a deal"" with the big cheese of the machines (where is the architect?) who acts more like a iron age tribal chief than the voice of AI supremacy, then a lame overdone FISTfight with Smith.

"A good film, though not up to the Wachowski brothers' par","""The Matrix"" trilogy comes to a bittersweet end with the final installment ""Revolutions"". Despite some acting issues along the lines of Reeves, the story remained solid. The Wachowski-like ending was a good twist and may have disappointed some, but I found it satisfying. Also, Hugo Weaving is incredible as Smith once again. His personality in ""Revolutions"" is comparable to ""The Interview"". He is a love-to-hate kind of actor. Revolutions produces some great fight scenes, especially with the Sentinals vs. the Humans in the 45-minute bridge of the movie, and of course the ""Super Burly Brawl"" at the end of the movie which was stunningly choreographed. Overall, this is the second-best in the trilogy, and I enjoyed it very much.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pretty eh.,"As usual, the original Matrix was the best. Reloaded was a solid follow up but didn't leave as much in question, or as much in replay value, as the original did. Revolutions however... I dunno. I got sick of the real world pretty fast in here, if you didn't like the real world in Reloaded prepare for some hell because about 75% of this movie takes place in the real world. Also, much like Reloaded, there isn't as much to learn about the Matrix as there was in the first one. It seems almost assumed that there is little left to learn about the Matrix which is more than just a little disappointing. Actors did just as good of jobs in this one as they did in the previous Matrixs. This one however I was most disappointed with. Mostly the ending is what made me frown but the final battle was another thing I yawned at. Sorry but leave a battle like this for the animes, it looks better. The Smith fight in Reloaded was 10 times better than this one. If you've seen the other two seeing this one probably won't do a whole lot for you. You'll probably end up frowning at the ending (much like I did). Movies with this much potential shouldn't feel so empty in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absolutely Brilliant!,"With all the bad reviews of this film I expected it to really stink!My worst fear was the it wouldn't answer all the questions it set up in Reloaded.Thank goodness I was completely wrong!In the first act, Neo visits the Oracle and asks her why he could stop the Sentinals at the end of Reloaded. She answers him in a very plain and simple fashion that only a fool wouldn't understand.Nearly all the other questions are answered as well, if perhaps sometimes in a more subtle manner.The brothers set up the trilogy in the very first episode to have Neo play the role of the Savior, and they follow through all the way - pulling no stops!It was executed brilliantly! I couldn't ask for a better finish!After another viewing, I'm certain ALL my questions would be answered and I would give it 10 out of 10. As is, I still am a tad uncertain about 1 minor detail: Who was the ""Mother of the Matrix"" that the Architect mentions in Reloaded?I am pretty sure it was the woman who shared the last scene with the Architect, but would need another viewing to be certain.After first viewing, my score is a very strong 9 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"One new idea, some muddle, unresolved","I scored a 7 out of 10. I watched on DVD, so I saw the entire unedited movie. I watched again just now on television.Overall, excellent acting.In all three movies, the idea is explored that both the physical ""real"" world and the Matrix worlds have deterministic rules but both worlds have beings with consciousnesses inhabiting those worlds. Hence, those consciousnesses, which have free will, contradict the deterministic rules. The philosophical concept added to the original and ""Reloaded"" in ""Revolutions"" is the concept of Neo's mind separating from his body in the real world, since, if it can happen in the Matrix, why not in the real world? After all, both worlds are electromagnetic stimulation of the senses.However, even after having seen all three movies in order, I still do not understand what exactly the program Smith does when it occupies some other Matrix inhabitant's matrix-constructed body. Does that kill (I assume) the person in the real world?I also like the concept of the Matrix, Agent Smith more specifically, affecting or infiltrating the mind of a person in the real world. This concept was initiated in ""Reloaded"" and developed in ""Revolutions"".There are other very small plot points that were not made clear, in ""Reloaded"" and in ""Revolutions"", which I really wished had been made clear by the end of the trilogy. Specifically, did Zion not have an EMP weapon to disable the sentinels during the big underground battle scene? Why did they have to wait for the Nebakenezzer to arrive to set off the EMP?However, my BIGGEST disappointment with this movie is that it felt completely unresolved. I expected and wanted to see all the individuals unplugged from the Matrix. The architect and oracle in the coda of the movie try to explain it away by saying they'll unplug those who want to be unplugged and questioning how long the peace will last. Well, obviously, peace will not last long as long as people are still plugged into the Matrix against their full knowledge and will.Otherwise, plot makes sense in ""Revolutions"". It moves along at an appropriate pace. I don't want to fault the movie too much, given the tension and excitement it creates. I admit that I felt slightly better about it upon a second viewing. But, I still do not understand why the biggest plot hole - immediate unplugging of all people - was not resolved at the end of the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More subdued and less cerebral but definately worth it!,"The 3rd installment took less time to absorb than the 2nd installment and spent a greater majority of the 2+ hours battling it out.

One more example of the last movie in a trilogy being below par,Most of the trilogies have their third part as the most badly rated ones and The Matrix Revolutions is not an exception. It felt like an average adventure saga that took place in a Star Wars universe.

too many cooks spoil the broth,"the basic problem with the movie is that they tried to do too many things at once (too much of special effects too many characters etc.) i think that the producer joel silver and the studio chiefs messed up the movie, they tried to do something spectacular with the movie which ended up in a disaster. the reason the special effects didnt leave audiences in awe was that they worked on two movies at once instead of one at a time, it took them so long that by the time the movie was released the effects became obsolete kinda pretty much regular effects that u see in any movie. they also thought of running this movie in oscar race so they tried to put some emotional stuff to make it look more serious(like the scene when trinity is dying. it just goes on and on and on).  the story isnt complex atall and the script isnt intricate which would be the basic characteristic of a matrix movie. u never find urself sitting on the edge of ur seat. after watching the scene where architect and neo meet i thought there is more to the story than we initially thought(like one matrix running inside other) but there was nothing more to surprise me. i would call this an average hollywood movie a typical joel silver production (cool action scenes, black people working with white, chicks dancing in night clubs in cool clothes, and people with lotsa guns). i will rate this movie a 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

TERRIBLE!!!!!,"This film is an absolute travesty.  It betrays the other pictures and makes a mockery of the entire franchise.  Part of the charm of the Matrix, was seeing extraordinary things happening in regular places.  People having kung fu fights on top of buildings, a showdown in a subway station, a shootout in a lobby, etc.  These kind of scenes were great, because the audience could connect with them, and the viewer almost felt like another world existed inside of their own.  This movie abandons that magic, choosing the force-feed the viewer with shot after shot of the `real world' (which I wasn't particularly crazy about in the first place), which looks less and less impressive every time you see it (the newer Star Wars movies, anyone?). All of the interesting characters from Reloaded are gone or forced into the background, including a certain Frenchman and his gorgeous wife.  The death scenes are corny and forced (with god-awful speeches to match), Hugo Weaving is given some positively rotten lines and the ending is abrupt and ill-conceived.  The philosophical dialog (which we all hoped would lead to some greater purpose or idea) is completely lost and the religious symbolism is overbearing and shallow.  Furthermore, Neo has ceased to be a human being the audience can relate with and is now cold and uninteresting to watch. The bottom line on this film is that is was under thought and over funded. It shows a lack of control in all regards.  To top it all off, some of the visual effects are particularly hideous, hindering this waste of celluloid even further.  My only hope is that the first film will survive this terrible ending and perhaps be viewed as a stand-alone movie, and not part of a trilogy (which it really isn't, although I thought that Reloaded setup the franchise for a great finish, but I guess I was wrong).  I was sorely disappointed....",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
