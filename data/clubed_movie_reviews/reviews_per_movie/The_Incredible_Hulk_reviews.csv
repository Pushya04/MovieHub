An underrated part of MCU history,"As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An MCU film that deserved better at the box office,"The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.Out of all the MCU films I've seen, the one that didn't make as much money compared to the others is this. Which is a shame because this is directed by Louis Leterrier, who would later direct the terrible Clash of the Titans remake, Now You See Me, and the recent TV show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (which I severely liked). And the acting from everyone involved is good. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler from The Lord of the Rings trilogy does a good job too as Betty as did William Hurt and Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson. Sure, the villain could've been developed more and the second act of the film could've been better, but everything else is done very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, the pacing is decent, the editing is superb, the music from Craig Armstrong is rousing, and the action sequences are solid.So, overall, this isn't a perfect film by any means but it's way better than the 2003 version (which isn't terrible but could've been much better). To those who have seen most of the MCU films or not, certainly give this one a go. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simpler but more entertaining movie,"First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.This Incredible Hulk version is a simpler story; however, with strong performances by Edward Norton, William Hurt and Liv Tyler, it entertains (yes the key word is that it ENTERTAINS) better than its predecessor.While it retains a more serious tone generally than, say Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk is definitely not a pushover when it comes to getting fans to enjoy a good movie. The action sequences, though not that many, were pretty good. Whatever lacking in action you think it has in the beginning, the climax between the Hulk and Abomination (you've seen that in the trailer so no spoiler there) should more than make up for it. It doesn't have many light moments (I only count about 3, really, cause they were quite few so I remembered them), but it wasn't as totally dark as the Ang Lee version.And to some extent, at least this Hulk is less CGI/cartoony-looking than the last one. While he does have those weird ridges/lines stretching across his body, making the muscles seem different than what you'd see on a big body builder, this Hulk is more realistic (but really, how realistic can you get with a CGI-made anti-hero?), so you at least have an improvement there.Edward Norton is more believable as the ""tragic-story-of-my-life"" protagonist Bruce Banner (no offense to Eric Bana, but he was just too muscular and less flawed-looking that Norton). The one actor I miss here, though, is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. While Liv Tyler's portrayal was credible enough, I don't think anyone can beat Jennifer's take on Ms. Ross.Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. Good enough to watch, entertaining and enjoyable without the complexities that the 2003 movie brought to the table, and a worthy addition to cinematic adaptation library that Marvel's adding every year. Hopefully, it will pick up steam after people realize that it's not the complicated, semi-psychological thriller (?) movie that the 2003 Hulk attempted to be. Rather an enjoyable cinematic achievement that's good enough to watch on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't make me hungry...,"Three cheers for Marvel for finally realizing that no one knows their material better then themselves. May they never sell another beloved superhero to a lesser being again.For the second time this summer Marvel has given us a superhero movie that just plain rocks. With the exact right amount of humour, character development and great action sequences, the Incredible Hulk is up there with Iron Man as one of my favourite films to be released so far in the summer movie season. While I didn't like it quite as much as Iron Man (Robert Downey WAS Tony Stark. Whereas something still doesn't sit right about Edward Norton as Bruce...) it was nevertheless a great, faithful adaptation of the comic books. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Possibly my favourite Stan Lee cameo yet.There isn't really much else to say besides, go see it for yourselves. If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk smash-hit!,"From that brilliant poster of Ed Norton dressed all in denim walking away from the huge frame of his alter ego the Hulk to the superb end fight that shows the makers of Spiderman 3 how it should be done this is a great film. Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create 'super soldiers'. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it's smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Attention - Origin Mixture!!!,"For those that know only of the original comic book Hulk, the TV series Hulk, or the regrettable Ang Lee Hulk, you should know that this new version is a mixture of origins.Without spoiling it, one of the larger ingredients in this new Hulk comes from a Marvel series that is an alternate universe. There are many differences in the Ultimates Universe. In this version, Banner did not get his gamma radiation from exposure during an experimental bomb explosion. I won't spoil it, but you can go to www.marvel.com and look under ""Ultimates"" if you wish to get the gist of it.I can truly say that this version captures a little of everything, so that no matter what your knowledge is of the Hulk character, there's tie-ins to everything.Personally, I felt this reboot was well thought out. It allows for any future connectivity by not limiting it to one version of the Hulk. This will allow future Marvel movie-makers the ability to pick and choose aspects from the multitude of alternate universes, re-tellings, and time spans to combine whatever they please.This was well cast. When the overall product can make me forget the fact that I don't like a specific actor, and truly appreciate the total entertainment experience, it's something to smile about. I won't mention which one I don't care for, since all that will do is spark useless debate.Story - intricate and intelligent, fast-paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. I surely was.CGI was great. Don't know why some have to nit-pick, but you can't please everyone, I guess. Action was wonderful with plenty of it! If you've ever read one of my reviews, you'll know that I'm a true fan of overall entertainment. While I have favorites, I don't base reviews on just one actor, writer, director, production company, genre, or whatever. So, if you don't like my opinion, so be it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's a good year for superhero movies,"Out of the five original Avengers, I always thought that the Incredible Hulk was the least interesting and therefore least likely character to be adapted to film (except Ant-Man, although he'll be arriving in 2010...look forward to that.) However, here we sit in 2008 with not just one, but TWO different portrayals of the less-than-jolly green giant. The main problem that the new film faces is that some people will believe it to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 effort, which upon release was blindfolded, made to stand against a wall and executed by public firing squad. The fact is that it is not a sequel at all. Instead, director Louis Leterrier has pulled a 'Batman Begins' and rebooted the franchise, and not just in name only. Everything about the 'Hulk is excellent. From the special effects to the characters to the reticent nods to other superheroes within the Marvel universe, the 'Hulk succeeds on every level.The film sidesteps the curse of the tedious 'origin story' by showing it to the audience in the opening credits. That should really be a law within superhero movies. It works so well: Bruce Banner works on a radioactive serum with love interest/scientist Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler's lips), he injects himself to see if it works, it transforms him into the Hulk. There, that didn't need to take one hundred minutes of screen time did it? This means that director Leterrier has free reign to explore how Bruce Banner lives as the Hulk and the attempts by the United States army to track him down and neutralise him, which leads to several action set pieces involving vehicles being thrown into walls and soldiers firing a nimiety of bullets at the Hulk, even when they can clearly see them bouncing off his body. Really, what is the best they are hoping for in a situation like that? ""Keep firing, he might develop a vague sense of moral ill-being and stop!"" Ultimately, the film boils down to a brawl in New York City between the Hulk and his evil counterpart, a special-ops soldier (Tim Roth being exemplary as usual) willingly injected with the Hulk genes, much like the climax to 'Iron Man.' The difference here is that the build up to this fight doesn't seem rushed like in 'Iron Man' because Leterrier has been able to utilise the whole of the film's running time to arrive at this natural conclusion, instead of being preoccupied with the origin story and tagging on an antagonist at the end.Whoever cast Edward Norton as Dr Bruce Banner is almost as much of a genius as the person who asked Robert Downey Jr. To play Tony Stark in 'Iron Man' (who makes an appearance in the film inducing fan-boy erections everywhere.) Norton plays his role with understated finesse, never resorting to overly pained facial expressions, intense eye contact or shouting to display the anguish which is consuming him for the majority of the film. He simply shows that the Hulk sized burden on his back is destroying him, crushing his will to live. He looks haunted and tired, but possesses a steely resolve not to succumb to the beast within, although it would temporarily end his struggle if he did so. He's so good that Christian Bale will have to turn water into wine in The Dark Knight to retain his title as King of the Superheroes (Tobey Maguire? Hahaha, you're kidding...wait, you aren't?) There are many minor elements in 'The Incredible Hulk' that elevates it above most movies in this genre. For example, for nearly half of the film the audience are only provided with fleeting glimpses of the Hulk, much like Batman in 'Begins. His presence is not overused, though it easily could be with the bravura CGI shown at the end. Indeed, the first chase scene does not involve Banner turning into the Hulk at all, it is just an exciting pursuit across rooftops in Rio De Janeiro. Also, the orchestral score lends an air of intelligence to the film and enhances the scenes much more than an overdriven guitar track (hello, Iron Man) would have done.The Incredible Hulk is one of those minority superhero films; it's good. In fact, with regard to any competition it faces, you (if you were looking to conclude a film review with a dialogue related pun) might be inclined to say ""Hulk smash!""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At least it's not as bad as the Ang Lee version,"With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie.Ed Norton doesn't really do much with the role. Yes, I know Ed Norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances, but he just doesn't do that here; Mark Rufallo's laconic Bruce Banner in the Avengers is far more interesting than Norton's here.Frankly, I was just bored. Not so bored that I stopped watching, but consistently restless and never drawn in.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A whole lot better than you think,"Honestly, as soon as I heard they were making another Hulk movie I was surprised. When I heard they had cast Ed Norton, I was shocked. So going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. Coming out, I feel like an idiot because it was really masterfully done. Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. If you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Far better than Ang Lee's attempt at the green man and as far as this year, it's definitely Marvel's year. No better way to make up for Spiderman 3 than releasing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk just a month apart. Thank you Marvel for cleaning the mess Spiderman 3 left and clearing your name.

Almost Incredible,"I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Far superior MCU movie than others,"This MCU movie is far superior than later ones. The story is good, the action is good, the cgi is good. I consider it far betrer than Iron man 2 and 3, the whole Thor trilogy and Avengers 2. The difference between this movie and better ones is that it does not have a forced joke every minute and a half like later ones. The reason that it has lower average rating is also because back then no Marvel fanboys existed. It is reviewed by pure movie and comic book fans. The other movies I mentioned were people getting on the MARVEL CAN DO NO WRONG bandwagon amd just rilled until today. Marvel is doing good, but this one deserves much more respect and recognition.
Also, Edward Norton is a better Banner than Rufallo. Sorry Mark",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An incoherent mess...,"Not all bad, but not very good either. For the most part i'm not sure they even knew what they wanted with this movie. The story is completely made up for the sake of the movie and hasn't got much to do with the comics.It is filled to the brim with archetype characters and people acting stupid (why oh why do they keep shooting the hulk with regular ammo??) In general your classic brainless hollywood action movie. You know it is pretty average when the highlight is a crazy cab ride.I liked the cameos and the few nodges towards the comics that were actually there.I honestly think it is a travesty that Ang Lees Hulk has an 5,6 average and this has a 6,7. Ang Lees was way better. It isn't even close. Then again i never understood the hate for that movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Despite a ton of smashing, this film actually was a tad dull...but watchable.","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.This film is a sequel (of sorts) and it's obvious from the beginning that the film has come after a lot of things have occurred. Bruce Banner is already the Hulk and how that all came to be was explored in the first film...or at least that's what I've been told. Oddly, he's in Brazil and perhaps he chose this nation because of their spiffy green flag. After a short time, the evil general (William Hurt) and his minions pounce on Banner and try to kidnap him. Not unexpectedly, Banner becomes Hulk and kicks butt. Later, they try the same thing repeatedly, but this time they give Tim Roth (why is an English guy playing a guy in the US Army, by the way--he certainly was no Rambo!) a series of injections to make him a super-soldier--and giving him a chance to defeat the Hulk. The only trouble is--who is going to control this new insanely dangerous nemesis.Despite my being a relative Hulk newbie, I was surprised that my opinion AND the opinion of both my daughters (including the comic book geek one) was pretty much the same. The film had some nice action but not a whole lot else. As for the rest of the film, it was a tad dull and the relationship with the girl really seemed to slow down the film. As a result, the film is a time-passer and not a whole lot more. I sure hope that the folks at Marvel think twice about all their many, many announced upcoming films. If you keep making mediocre super-hero films, you might just end up killing the genre. This is NOT a film of the same quality as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (yes, Marvel fans, I know this is a DC franchise--back off, nerd-boys!!!).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Forget there even was a 2003 rendition of the Hulk.,"While the storyline is predictable, I suspect that this flick (along with Iron Man) ushers in a new era of sorts for Marvel-based movies. While not as slick & witty as Iron Man, let's face it, the Hulk is not nearly as complex a character.I thought for a moment that perhaps this was the kind of flick I might dial up another friend to watch but I decided to take my wife which turned out to be a bonus for the both of us... I lucked out that I just so happened to take her to a movie that featured Portuguese (EN sub-titles on & off for about 10 minutes or so) but as it turns out she claimed to like it more than Iron Man (which I admit, I might have been a bit more partial to).Basic plot, good acting (on Norton's part), great special effects, and while I may have been more partial to Iron Man, the battles featured here cannot be compared.Keep 'em coming Marvel - great job!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not incredible, but rather enjoyable 'Hulk'.","My Take: Flawed but modestly entertaining, and compared to the previous HULK opus, a little better.Among the others, I was disappointed by Ang Lee's HULK. I have no problem with a more character-driven superhero/comic book movie, but in the expense of deepening the character's persona, it lacks the good ol' comic book action fans have grown to love. Louis Leterrier's reboot/semi-sequel THE INCREDIBLE HULK makes up for that. It's still a flawed experience, with some scenes that still pad out the better bits, but in terms of pure big-screen comic book experience, it's an improvement, albeit not a vast one.In case you actually liked the Ang Lee version, Leterrier and writers Zak Penn (and Edward Norton, who made an uncredited re-write on his character) doesn't really forget the events of the first movie, but still makes sure everyone else keeps up with a new and different story. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is now in hiding, still in search for a cure for his ""sickness"" with the help of an unseen contributor. Meanwhile, Gen. Ross (William Hurt) is still in search of our monster-transforming fugitive, this time with the help of a bloodthirsty assassin (Tim Roth) who is proves his more than a match for our hero (and we learn later, more than a match for the Hulk as well).Unlike Lee's artsy version, Leterrier isn't afraid to push through with the action for most of the time, even if his direction of the dramatic scenes are just as slow-moving as Lee's. The still-developing romance between Buce and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) just doesn't spark. Norton, a fine actor who does a good job in deepening the character, just lacks the charisma of even a doomed comic book character, while Tyler just doesn't add anything to the role. Hurt and Roth actually add some actual depth to the proceedings. While it won't compare to the Iron Men and Dark Knights of the same year, Leterrier does deliver the ""Hulk Smash"" fans expect, if very little else.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Grading on a Bell Curve,"About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

MUCH better than I even hoped!,"After watching the first couple of trailers for this I was very unimpressed and even began to doubt (big time) that this would be any good. Thank goodness I was SO wrong!Let me start by admitting I actually liked HULK (2003) aside from Nick Nolte and the last 10 minutes or so. Sure, it was a little short on action and heavy on drama, but I thought the effects were awesome and the acting very good.This Hulk blows that one completely away! It is so much better I couldn't even believe it! Maybe the reason I liked it so much was because of my very low expectations but this movie delivered in every way a comic-book movie should!Before watching I read the first 15 or so comments here on IMDb to see how people were reacting. Most of them positive, there were still a handful of negative reviews that had me questioning. However after seeing the film I must wonder what those people expected. I just can't imagine it being any better! Seriously.

Incredible indeed!,"OK, I didn't think the 2003 Ang Lee version was THAT bad, but you ever figure out the faults of a movie when seeing the sequel/reboot to it? Now I do with Ang's version and after seeing the new improved Hulk I must say this is 100 times better! We see more of Bruce ""Hulking"" out and less of the drama the first showed to us. No more of Bruce blaming his father for what happened to him.Also this presents to us something else the first lacked: humor. OK, don't want the movie to be a total laugh fest, but nothing wrong with a little moments of laughter, such as some nods to the comic and TV show (the purple pants, and of course Lou's cameo, dang he's huge!). A little humor made Bruce seem like a real human rather than Eric Bana's deadpan performance.Speaking of, the cast, like the story, is redone and redone well. As I mentioned, Norton makes Bruce Banner more human. Nothing against Sam Elliot, but Hurt gives off a better presence as Thunderbolt Ross. Liv Tyler is easy on the eyes (she does have daddy's lips, but still hot), and easy on the performance as well. Tim Roth just owns as the villain here.The villain of course is the Abomination and what a sweet villain he is (better than the CG dogs and the Absorb Man). And believe me, the fight scene between him and our green friend will bring out the inner nerd in you. Oh, and hearing ""HULK SMASH!"" will too!Overall, more action than the 2003 ""drama"" and more humor leads to what we WANT a Hulk movie to be like. Oh, and don't forget to watch for a surprise cameo (hint: not Stan Lee or Lou) which hints at a possible cool movie event in the future!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great and Entertaining Adventure,"Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is secretly living in the greatest slum of South America, the Favela da Rocinha, and working in a factory of ""cachaça"" in Rio de Janeiro. While seeking the cure with his beloved Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) and other scientists, he learns how to control his emotions and heart beat and to keep his human form for a long period. When General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) finds a clue of his location in Brazil, he sends a command leaded by the tough Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to abduct Dr. Banner. However, he transforms in Hulk and escapes to Guatemala. Later he contacts Betty and his colleagues and when he is close to find his cure, Blonsky captures him and transforms himself in powerful beast The Abomination. Dr. Banner has to decide whether he should remain human or transform in The Incredible Hulk again to stop The Abomination.After the ""Shrek-Hulk"" of Ang ""Brokeback Mountain"" Lee, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a wonderful surprise. The story and characters recall the comic books of my childhood, plenty of action and adventure. For Brazilians and more specifically for ""cariocas"" (people born in Rio de Janeiro) like me, it is funny to see Dr. Bruce Banner living in Rocinha, probably the most dangerous location in my city, where the police is afraid to go, chased by the American soldiers. In real life, they certainly would be murdered by the army of drug dealers. Further, I really appreciated the effort of Edward Norton speaking a couple of words and sentences in Portuguese. But the most important, the story is a great and entertaining adventure and the special effects are really good.

"Good, but not great","Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Most of them have silly names and often sillier costumes. But there's something so fundamental and human about the ones that have survived half a century. Spider-Man isn't just some dude swinging around New York. He's a young kid trying to balance so many competing parts of his life and spreading himself too thin. We all know what that's like. With the X-Men it's not just people with cool powers kicking the crap out of each other. It's about being part of a minority and others discriminating against you. Who hasn't had a taste of that? And with the Hulk, it's ultimately anger management. Literally having a monster inside of you and how difficult it is to control it. It's about being at war with yourself. So yes... his name is ridiculous. The idea of a giant green monster is a little out there. But when these movies have enough small character moments peppered in with the action there's a chance to really connect with them and allow yourself to forgive how unrealistic they dare to be because you're so immersed in their universe. The Incredible Hulk is not the best comic book movie ever made. It's not even in the top three. But it's a solid film and it could have been so much worse.I have fond memories of the old TV show. Back then it was a waiting game until the Hulk showed up. Now it's the hardest part of the show to swallow and I find myself really intrigued by David Banner's plight. I didn't hate the Ang Lee movie but I have no desire to ever revisit it. This new incarnation has elements of both but for the most part does a satisfactory job of establishing itself as something new. The first act was the best part of the film for me. Everything until the battle on the college campus. The introductory scenes of Bruce were really effective and the first Hulk-out was almost legitimately frightening. The later action scenes are bigger in scope but they're never as creative.Norton's been making headlines for all the wrong reasons lately but there's no denying he's got the goods. I have a feeling there were a lot of character moments left on the cutting room floor but what's left is still an admirable performance. And even though it's an underwritten role, Liv Tyler is a complete sweetheart as Betty. There's such a charming girl-next-door quality to her and even though I don't completely buy her as a scientist I totally believed in the connection she and Bruce shared. I felt like William Hurt and Tim Roth both received pretty thankless roles. They weren't bad by and means but the script (or this cut anyways) never allows them the chance to do much other than beg to fight the Hulk again or scream for more firepower.The CGI isn't fantastic. That's just a fact. But it only pulled me out of the film a couple of times. And the Hulk looks about a million times better than he did in the last movie. As expected it does take over once the third act hits and for me that stuff just isn't as enthralling. The film never lost me, it just never reached the heights of the opening thirty minutes. Not for me at least. If I were thirteen I probably would have drooled over the last fight scene.In the pantheon of comic book movies Hulk stands above Fantastic Four and Daredevil but never quite makes it to the top tier of films like Spider-Man 2, X2, Batman Begins, or even Iron Man. It's comfortably in the middle. I don't feel like I wasted my time or money. But I'm not anxiously awaiting a sequel either.You really could do worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Straightforward Hulk finally smashes,"When acclaimed director Ang Lee's cerebral take on comic book antihero the Hulk hit screens in 2003, the reaction was hardly a positive one. Fans of the comic books fumed over the script straying from its source material, whereas critics and audiences alike mused over the effectiveness of the philosophical ruminations in lieu of crowd pleasing action sequences. All of the above criticisms appear to have been taken by Marvel Studios (now producing their own franchises) in stride, revamping and continuing the green behemoth's tale with a more enjoyable, action packed focus and a quality cast. And while The Incredible Hulk may not quite live up to the no holds barred action epic its premise promised, it proves a satisfyingly bombastic smackdown to appease both fans of the comics and audiences alike.The inherent imbalance in the script lends credulity to rumours of creative disputes between Edward Norton's influence and that of the studio. While opening sequences detailing Banner's fugitive life in Brazil prove breathless, tense and tremendously gripping, taking more than a few notes from the Bourne series, upon returning to the United States, the promising start lags, as continual run ins with the military become increasingly repetitive and unoriginal, with the raucous fun of the periodic Hulk battles now saddled with a flimsy romantic subplot, entirely failing to compliment the intrigue. Here the script begins to falter, tripping over itself during certain crucial emotional moments with contrived lines and confusingly stilted character motivations, while the sidelining of certain characters initially presented as major players (most noticeably Ty Burell's Doc Sampson) reeks of hasty last minute cuts. By the film's obligatory big loud climax, it becomes clear that the creative reigns have shifted - all the prior gritty realism has vanished, replaced with a more conventional and less enjoyable action finish. As the occasional throwaway comic moments (some more effective than others) prevent the film from descending in the realm of melodramatic self importance, the film's primary redeeming factor emerges - despite the steady descent into excess stupidity, it is never afraid to have some fun, the quality Ang Lee's incarnation sorely lacked.Of course, the primary draw for superhero blockbusters is seldom the screen writing, and Transporter director Louis Leterrier's unapologetic ""smash first talk later"" approach does generate some exhilarating action sequences, but the increasingly unimaginative fight choreography and relative sparsity of action setpieces for an action focused film detracts from the glorious destruction that could have been, the attempted juxtaposition of emotional intensity only slowing the gleeful mayhem. Thankfully, after the paltry CGI in Ang Lee's effort, special effects have been amped up to make this new, grittier Hulk about as close to feasibly photo real as one could hope for, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Norton himself, though certain fluctuating details (the Hulk appears smaller or less muscular at various points) give the impression of patchy continuity, and the movement of both Hulk and monstrous adversary The Abomination appears too mechanically humanoid to properly capture the otherworldly feel of gargantuan muscular mutations - nonetheless, an impressive and exhilarating effort overall.Despite the laudable use of quality actors over conventional blockbuster stars, even the astutely talented performers prove they can only do so much with such a steadily flimsy script. Edward Norton of course proves the exception, his passion for the project and standard blistering intensity making tortured protagonist Bruce Banner a truly fleshed out and tragic character. Burning with nobility and pathos, his plight genuinely moving and his battle with the monster raging inside of him truly gripping, Norton truly convinces in the crucial role. In contrast, Liv Tyler is saddled with an embarrassing nothing of a role, exemplifying the worst aspects of comic book love interests, with nothing to do but scream the hero's name and stand around statuesquely looking worried - it is a shame to see such a normally talented actress descend to such banality. Tim Roth similarly suffers, infusing tragically two-dimensional antagonist Emil Blonsky with all the steely menace and petty arrogance and ambition he can muster, but his quality is still diminished by the overwhelming predictability of his role. William Hurt is appropriately grim as obsessive general ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, thankfully eschewing the scene chomping which could have resulted all too easily, and Tim Blake Nelson delivers a bout of much needed irreverent goofiness as overeager scientist Samuel Sterns, his brief but enjoyable role hinting at a larger character progression in any ensuing films. Finally, the film's slew of enjoyable cameos do not disappoint, from comical Stan Lee and Lou Ferringo appearances to the highly anticipated Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man lead Tony Stark, a fitting and classy way of bridging the gap between superhero franchises as well as planting further seeds for the upcoming Avengers film.While the film may disappointingly fall short of its true potential, comic book fans can breathe a hearty sigh of relief that the green behemoth has been firmly returned to his less philosophical and more action filled roots. If nothing else, Leterrier's more singular vision is laudable, never losing track of its true intent: even during the fumbling between dramatic clout and exhilarating action, the film never fails to entertain. While the superb cast may flounder with underwritten characters, Norton's incendiary lead performance and the enthusiastic action sequences make The Incredible Hulk a solid edition into the realm of guilt-free summer entertainment - despite the criticisms, Hulk finally smashes.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Smashingly good fun.,"This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.The story has Bruce in Brazil working at some strange soda plant or something. Looks like Mt. Dew, but has some funky name. Well, a slight accident leads to some of his blood getting into a bottle and this is how the military and General Ross track him down. Bruce is in chats with a man dubbed Mr. Blue in the hopes of finding a cure; however, he must find more data for Mr. Blue to create a cure. A crack team of soldiers try to track down Banner and he avoids them for a while, but soon turns into the Hulk, leading one of the soldiers, Emil Blonsky, wanted another crack at the beast. He is soon infused with super soldier serum and does quite admiral in dodging the Hulk, but it is still not enough. He craves the power the Hulk haves and soon this desire will create an abomination!The film is pretty good, but could have been better. The scenes with the Hulk are by far the highlights and better than any of the Hulk scenes in the 2003 film with the incredible expanding Hulk. That being said, I did not like the fact they tied Banner turning into Hulk with his heart rate as it is solely tied to his anger. The film also did not portray the Hulk becoming stronger the angrier he got and the fight with Abomination should have showcased this. In the comics, Hulk is stronger than Abomination because of the increase as he gets angry. Abomination though is a better fighter as he is more agile and that is why he gives the Hulk a good fight, not because he is stronger. The reason the Hulk wins is because he keeps getting stronger, not because he is a better tactical fighter.So, in the end, this film was more enjoyable than the Ang Lee film. That film was just strange in many ways as it played out in comic panels which suggests a fun film, but was so serious with virtually not humor that it was just a strange concoction. This one had some good action, but was not a perfect film. Hurt is the only actor from this film to be seen in a later Marvel universe film as he appeared in Captain America: Civil War. Most things from this film were pretty much scrapped though as the Leader looked to be coming, Abomination was still alive and various other things. Abomination was supposedly going to be in the second Avengers film and that would have been great as I felt Ultron was not enough, but they decided against it which sucked as something other than the exact same robot would have been cool. In the end, this film is kind of part of the Marvel universe and kind of not.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Way better than Ang Lee's version,"Let's start with answering the most pressing questionNo, the Hulk doesn't fight roided out poodles in this one.If you liked Ang Lee's take on the Hulk back in 2003 (ahhhhyou're the one) then you won't be happy with The Incredible Hulk. For the rest of us, you're in for a treat. A reboot of a franchise this new is unprecedented but it was worth the risk. Think of it as a $100 million first draft.It's rough for Hulk, coming on the heels of Iron Man. Iron Man was the best comic book movie since Spiderman 2 and quite possibly since the first Superman movie. While this movie isn't the roller coaster ride that Iron Man was, it was a solid cringe-free adaptation.After a breezy retelling of the origin story, the movie opens with Bruce Banner on the run in Brazil. He's being hunted by the government - as governments are wont to do. Banner is in hiding as a day worker at a soda factory.Ed Norton brings a brooding intensity to Banner but it's far from the star turn that Tony Stark was for Robert Downey, Jr. However, that is more indicative of the character than it is of Norton. Tony Stark is a drunk (on alcohol and power), loopy mess that has fun with his abilities and status both as Stark and Iron Man. Conversely, for all of the Hulk's power, Banner has virtually none. He's hunted, broke and tired. Tony Stark looks for cool robot technology to build cool robot suits. Bruce Banner looks for stretchy pants. It can be hard to compete.Downey as Tony Stark is like Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or Harrison Ford as Han Solo  a performance so instantly iconic that you can't imagine any other actor in the role. Norton does a good job but it never quite reaches that level. While some of that falls at the feet of the screenplay, he co-wrote it we so can blame him either way. (In his defense, he is unhappy with the final version of the movie and is refusing to do press in support of the film. There is allegedly a pending DVD release with a whopping 70 minutes of additional footage, so time will tell.) The movie is much more serious than recent comic book outings with the exception of The Batman franchise. Unlike most superheroes, Banner/Hulk is a threat to the public NOT it's savior. This has always been a hurdle for the comic book and it's the main reason the show ended up as a green-tinted version of The Fugitive.This movie definitely has more of the tone of '70s show but with less cheese and better effects. We get the footage of Banner ripping through his clothes and his eyes turning green as his inner-beast finally wins out. The score, while different, has the same sense of melancholy. And we get the same lingering shots of a lonely Banner walking dejectedly into the distance down an empty road.The movie is a little slow paced in the first half. I took my 8-year old son and he got a tad restless around the 45 minute mark and he is a very good movie watcher (not to brag or anything). But the second half brings the noise, as it were, and we all get to see what we paid for: The Hulk smashing stuff. The final fight sequence clocks in at close to half-an-hour as The Hulk battles Tim Roth as Abomination for, um, wellI don't really remember what for. Does it matter? It was Hulk vs. Bigger Hulk and there was much smashing and crunching and car throwing and it was good.Overall, The Incredible Hulk was definitely worth the price of admission. Marvel Studios was smart to reboot the franchise. Judging by the hints they've been dropping and cameos that have been popping up in this movie and Iron Man, they appear to be laying the groundwork for the biggest comic book movie in the history of comic book movies: The Avengersand I for one, can't wait.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Superman and 1 being Condorman, The Incredible Hulk gets a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How much dumber can American script writers get?,"I have to admit I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this pathetic B-movie disaster just pales in comparison to Lee's film. To begin with, the plot (if it can be called that) is so shallow and full of holes that it's embarrassing to see respectable actors like Edward Norton and Tim Roth involved with this mess. An American military airplane heading towards Rio? Brazil is not Iraq. It would have been put down by the Brazilian Air Force in a minute. A vehicle with half a dozen armed guys in a Brazilian favela? The local drug bosses would have gladly used them as target practice. And the cream of the crop, a ""for export"" bottled juice factory INSIDE a favela? This will become the joke of the year in Brazil. As to the reviewer from Singapore who wrote ""(...)the crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro(...)"" - for mercy's sake, get a clue and your geography right before writing this kind of nonsense. The scenes take place in a FAVELA, which are poor, isolated parts of the city, not the city itself.There are far FEWER action sequences than on Lee's film, and what there is is so pointless, badly executed and less exciting that the average popcorn eater above 6 years of age will be bored to death. Any self respecting fan of the Hulk comic books will rate this abomination of a movie as low as possible. I gave Ang Lee's film 9 stars, and this one gets 2 only because the CGI work on the Hulk is very well done, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star (since IMDb doesn't allow a 0 star rating).",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hulk Is Back With A Smash,"'The Incredible Hulk' sort of takes of where Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ends. It's not an exact sequel as a few events are changed but arguably it serves well enough as a continuation. This one succeeds in parts where Ang Lee's film failed. Leterrier's direction works for an action film as it's got all the required ingredients. It's a lot slicker and full of action. The pacing is comparatively well set. The special effects are an improvement (but the CGI is still very prominent). The camera-work is solid and the score is wild. The story isn't as effective as say this year's 'Iron Man' because the characters aren't well fleshed out and the dialogues are a bit clichéd. Edward Norton fits the role of Bruce Banner quite well but we don't see much of him because of the CGI hulk. Eric Bana wasn't a bad choice for Ang Lee's Hulk either so I wouldn't compare the two actors. Actually, the Bruce Banner in Ang Lee's version was better fleshed out and gave Bana more scope to perform. Liv Tyler, however, is a little too weepy and she shouts a lot. Clearly Connelly was the better choice. Tim Roth and William Hurt are adequate. Overall, this is an enjoyable action flick even though it's no 'Iron Man'.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just. Not. Good,"Although this has a place in my heart, it is a dreadful film.Not sure where to begin, so I will start with the one positive which was the semi-rogue agent feel to it. I am a sucker for man-against-the-government vibe, and on the whole, certainly in the first hour, this worked.And then hulk was introduced, and that's where it went down the drain. He is just so...I dunno, puny almost. It wasn't helped by the fact that it had 2008 standard effects, but he looked like he was from a video game, and it felt like it roared for the sake of roaring.The acting was average at best. Ed Norton is just too Ed Norton to be the Hulk, Liv Tyler should just stick to Lord of the Rings and Tim Roth just didn't have that edge he had in his Tarantino days that would have worked so well!The script was the worst about it as well. It didn't know if it wanted to be super dark or light hearted, and it just ended up being a kinda spoof of a Marvel film.Needs to be watched if you're a Marvel but forgettable on its own.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Back to Familiar Ground,"As many know, Ang Lee and Eric Bana tried to do a Hulk movie in 2003. It didn't work. Brooding and arty with limited action. So this time around they went for a ""reboot"" - new director and cast and approach. For other movies, the word 'reboot' means an update from what we've seen before. For 'The Incredible Hulk', reboot simply means getting back to the basics - more action and a brisk and easy to follow story. In other words, this aims to be be meat and potatoes and that is what it is.This movie offers up much that is good and solid but not spectacular. The plot is simply designed to enable what we want to see. Nearly all the cast do fine. I wouldn't mind seeing them reprise their parts in any future movies. However, I'm not 100 percent sold on Edward Norton as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. He's a fine actor and there's nothing wrong with his acting here. It's just his approach to the character. Bruce here is quite solemn and repressed. He seems to be thinking deeply about his predicament, but not really in a battle to control his rage. Therefore, it never really feels like a smooth transition whenever he transforms into the Hulk. His chemistry with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross is pretty good though.On the action front, the film is very good. It gives us what we want to see. A whole lotta Hulk Smash! The finale is definitely kickass and The Hulk versus The Abomination delivers. The film ends fairly abruptly after that. Now that we've had two movies in close succession basically introducing The Hulk and the major characters, now is the time to move on and start pushing this series into high gear.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nutshell Review: The Incredible Hulk,"The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.And it's not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as ""don't- make-me-angry-you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry"" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I'll leave that to you to find out.But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang's version, we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gwapa Débora Nascimento,"Before watching this Hulk movie, I should have taken the time to watch the one released a few years back that was directed by Ang Lee. Instead, I was given the chance to watch this and I had to take it. Seeming that this was going to be one of the year's better films, I thought why not. And it lived up to a lot of its billing.The origins of the Hulk are given, although not as explained as I would have liked. His fleeing to Brazil in the beginnings of the film do make for some good scenery, including the introduction of Débora Nascimento to the film stage. Though I doubt she will be given a lot of time on the screen for now, she certainly is a beautiful woman and made Liv Tyler pale in comparison.The action was good, but I thought it was flawed. The military operations against the Hulk just seemed to come out of the blue at times and did not explain it as much as one would hope. Even the final fight seemed a little bit of a mess. Still it was enjoyable.Overall, it was a good film. I am hoping I see more of Débora Nascimento in the future. ""B+""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Questionable Re-Reboot is a Hulk-Sized Leap Backwards,"There ought to be a law for relaunches of a franchise less than five years after the last attempt: every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being even worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a functional story. Knocking out the Hulk's fabled origin story during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce Banner never comes off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk, and actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brains. That effectively kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that should be fueling the story. Both characters are mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors - this blew up in Marvel's face.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Incredible Reboot,"I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was ""That's IT?!"". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For the fanboys,"Rebooting a franchise that was unsuccessfully rebooted only 5 years prior seems to be an incredible risk, but The Incredible Hulk proves that Marvel knows their material better than Ang Lee. While Lee's Hulk was a more ambitious, creatively daring picture, it just wasn't the Hulk fans know from the comics. The Incredible Hulk, on the other hand, is as comic-book as a comic-book movie can get. That's not to say it's the best comic-book movie ever made (far from), but by the time it's over you'll be tempted to wipe quad-colored ink from your fingertips.This is a big, loud celebration of the green behemoth and all the toys that he loves to smash. The first action sequence featuring Hulk himself is one of the better staged action scenes of the summer -- if not the year. The hulking hero is introduced to us just right. He's an angry monster in the shadows. A glimpse of something moving in split second sprints caught only by your peripheral vision. His introduction had me thinking Hulk as a horror movie may be the best idea ever. But that would, once again, go against the Hulk fans know from the comics.This movie is nothing if not fan service. Stan Lee shows up (in more ways than one). Lou Ferrigno has a memorable moment. They even manage to work in a cameo for deceased actor Bill Bixby. If you're a die-hard fan of the comics and don't like this movie, you accidentally stumbled into Sex and the City.Marvel goes as far as to make the same mistakes as they do in the comics -- the climax is too hectic to be enthralling and the last 20 minutes are as busy setting up a sequel, a spin-off and a crossover as they are a decent finale to a once entertaining movie. Still, complaints aside, this is a fun movie for the fans and this review could have been just as easily summed up in 2 words: HULK SMASH!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An  Enjoyable Yet Unfulfilling Blockbuster,"The Incredible Hulk is positively jam packed full of action and excitement. It contains impressive CGI visuals, a malevolent & power hungry adversary and scenes which will have you on the edge of your seat. But unfortunately this is not enough.The Incredible Hulk is a film which isn't terribly diverse. It seems to only switch between the fugitive lifestyle of the protagonist & some sort of conflict; where he is being either being pursued, or engaged in a fight whilst in Hulk form. It didn't seem to branch out enough from a linear form, nor did the pace of the film crescendo.The acting however is well done. Edward Norton plays the worn out but nonetheless strong and enduring Bruce Banner in a convincing manner. As dos William Hurt in playing the emotionally detached military General.Whilst The Incredible Hulk (2008) is in no way a continuation or sequel to the movie Hulk (2003)... It's hard not to compare the two in order to decipher which one has the most potential.'Hulk' has a much more cartoony style in it, which i found much more engaging. In contrast, 'The Incredible Hulk' decided to follow a more darker and gritty style. The comparison is similar to comparing Batman Begins with the older Batman movies. You can't help but ask 'Is a guy who turns into a green, muscular beast when he gets angry really something that's meant to be taken seriously?'Overall the movie is good for some thrills, decent acting & impressive eye candy... But not much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Incredible Hulk= Incredibly Incredible,"Remember Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk? Well we can all forget that film now. This movie sure hit the spot for a Friday night. First of all, Norton pretty much dominates any role he is in, after all; he was a crazy Nazi turned goodie in American History X, a schizo in Fight Club, and a complete psycho in Primal Fear. He fills his role as Bruce Banner with complete control over the part. William Hurt has been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw A History Of Violence, and he keeps me entertained in this movie. Liv Tyler at times seems a lil bit too emotional, but believable just that same. I've heard some people on IMDb bash Tim Roth for his part in this film, but I don't see why. Some say he was supposed to be an insano nutcase in this movie. I loved his part and his subtle cruelty and demeanor. To me, he is not the perfect Emile Blonsky, but he sure is close to the best.The action scenes in this movie aren't held back or exaggerated. Not like in Transformers when there was so much going on you couldn't see anything. This movie honed in on everything without crowding the shots. One of my favorite parts about this movie is that the Hulk is mean looking. I hated the Ang Lee Hulk because he was really smooth like and comic-book looking. This Hulk is mean green, with veins popping and ripped muscles showing, with some cool hair and an awesome ROAR!. The Abomination was well done too, but I don't want to give much away about him. Another little thing that I noticed that I really liked was, when the Hulk or the Abomination run, it looks as though its actually just somebody running, its so damn real.No real spoilers in here, and I have nothing to bash about this film. Well actually I do, I don't like Mr.Blue. His cocky, ignorant, comical behavior is not suited for this movie, which in a way relates to Batman Begins with its more serious mood. Seven out of ten stars for a great job by the cast and crew, lets hope the sequel kicks ass. One last thing, don't stay after the credits, there is nothing there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fun summer flick!,"I always had concerns about how good this movie was gonna be. One thing for sure, it's more entertaining than the first. But it is not a great superhero movie (Iron Man was more rounded). But it's not really fair to compare it with Batman or Iron Man. Hulk is a far less complex character, so it was always going be hard to make a great movie on him. There are some cheesy & unexplained scenes, but not enough to hurt the film too much.However, there is enough in this movie to make it a good 'popcorn' flick. I liked how they did not rveal the Hulk fully till later; showing him through shadows was cool I felt. Norton was convincing as always, & there is some subtle humor here & there. The CGI is really good for the most part of the film, and the final fight was awesome (beats Iron Man's hands down). Abomination was a really cool adversary, & I hope to see more of him (yup a spoiler!).Overall, an entertaining summer flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hulk version that won't leave you turning green,"When rumours of a new Hulk film began to surface after the Ang lee version, reservations set in the hearts of many of movie goers, however, when it emerged this was to be a reboot, curiosity began to grow and after setting foot out of the cinema having heard the words “Hulk smash”, any reservations about this film had indeed been smashed.With the remnants of Ang Lee’s 2003 Hulk still prevalent in people’s minds, Louis Leterrier’s take of ‘The Incredible Hulk’ draws influence from the 80’s TV serious, with nostalgic music pieces and recreated scenes. Since the creation of the hulk from gamma ray exposure was commonly know, rather than invest heavily in to an origin story, write Zak Penn condenses it down to a neat little montage incorporated into the opening credit to allow for the story to take full steam from a spectacular opening shot of the slums of Brazil. In his new fugitive life, genius scientist Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton leads a solitary life seeking a cure and some control for seemingly incurable condition. All the while he is evading a US government search for him led by General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross and his new recruit Blonsky, a 39 year old unaccomplished soldier trying to make a name for himself wanting the power of Banner, which he inevitably gets to become Abomination.Taking influence from the Bourne films, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ opens with an edge of the seat chase through Rio leading to a brief opening glimpse of the Hulk and is an excellent setup to what continues as a well thought out film. When Hulk finally makes his full appearance on screen we can see that a much more generous input has gone into the CGI work. The actions sequences that follow will leave you in awe and the brute force, sumo style culminating fight will ultimately satisfy the child in you. Norton is excellent as Banner and able to bring a sense of desperation and inner torment to this role, but the film doesn’t really attempt to develop this or take the same risks to any level similar to what Ang Lee set out to do and we only see really see one side of Norton character. Liv Tyler as Elizabeth ‘Betty’ Ross, playing Banners empathetic love interest left a sweet feeling and gave an overall decent enough performance. Even with the obvious ‘bad guy’ stereotyping of Blonsky being Russian and British, the talents of Tim Roth still managed to come out of a one dimensional character.So, with Leterriers playing the right cards are there any faults? Well, asides some unnecessary cameos and limited character exploration, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to hit all the right buttons – it is a comic book adaptation done well with themes that not only make it work on screen but allows your average view to get involved with the central character, if only slightly. With comic to films adaptations having no end in sight and the as we enter the new dawn of marvel films with darker themes and crossover universes ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to keep the bar raised high and is the best possible pit stop to the climax of the summer blockbuster...The Dark Knight.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Monstrously Entertaining,"By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's originWhen I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like ""Wow this movie looks cool"" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee's Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I'm glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright. Overall this movie is Incredible not an Abomination.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk Smash!,"And smash he does. Let me first off say that anyone expecting intelligence, a sophisticated plot, and well-developed characters should look elsewhere, because The Incredible Hulk has none of those things. However, those hoping to see some exciting action, a touch of romance, and a lot of the big green guy tearing sh** up will find this very enjoyable. This is a pure matinée popcorn flick, the kind that Ang Lee's 2003 movie should have been but wan't. And in that respect, it is great! In terms of a hero movie, The Incredible Hulk probably isn't as satisfying as, say, Iron Man or Batman Begins, but it's up there. I for one am relieved to have finally seen a faithful adaptation of the Hulk. Let's face it, he's not that complex of a hero. He gets mad, he throws a tantrum, he smashes things. Your inner little boy will be grinning. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Engaging, Dumb Character Decisions","The Incredible Hulk is sadly a massive downgrade from Iron Man.The protagonists are not as likeable as they should be, I rooted for them, but didn't really feel connected. The antagonists are not layered. The General is a realistic figure, who doesn't care about people, only his achievements, while Blonsky is just evil. He wants to destroy, but why? He wants to have more power. I get it, but it could've been a lot more layered. The story is simple, nothing surprising.The cinematography, the editing was unnoticable for me, which means they are neither terrible, nor good. Visual effects are overused and I don't like that. I didn't like the casting. I didn't know Hulk was recast, so I always thought it would be Mark Ruffalo, so I was surprised. The acting is just what you can expect. Good actors, mid performances.The Incredible Hulk is a pretty bad movie. It can be enjoyable, but it's flat and simple.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spit out the 2003 version of Hulk like a bad taste in your mouth! This is an exciting movie,"I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.I also must say the cast is a lot better this time around. Edward Norton is far more convincing as Bruce Banner than Eric Bana was. Liv Tyler does a good job as Betty, Bruce's girlfriend, though I do like Jennifer Connelly a bit more. The supporting cast is also great, and they all deserve to at least be nominated for some awards. My favorite performance is tied between Norton and Tim Roth.Now, to the special effects. Predictably, they are magnificent. With recent superhero movies, the effects are always brilliant, and they certainly adapted the Hulk character more closely to the original comics from what I've heard. The action scenes are cool and fun to watch, and fans of the comic books will be on the edge of their seat in excitement.All in all, it's a great movie that comic fans should enjoy, and even if you don't really read them, you'll still like the movie, as I did. While it's not my favorite superhero movie, it is a whole lot better than Ang Lee's version, and a fun time at the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unbelievable waste of money and time,"Some people say, that the first try of a new Hulk Version from 2003 was too much intellectual driven, which gave the film a too complex story and emotional background to believe in and not enough room for action.In fact this new Version of the Hulk theme could not even keep up with the first one in any possible discipline. It lacks nearly anything, except a slightly better CGI. The cast was really promising, but the whole story is totally empty and lacks of any surprises at all. The whole intention of a movie with a believable plot supported by actors and good directing is simply not used in this one.You can easily skip the middle 70 minutes of the film, because everything is so obvious to happen. Compared to the storyline of the first one this new version lacks of any depth and drama. It's like being told a story with a 10 point plan what is going to happen now and then and finally the good spirit wins.So, what is good in this new version? Nothing at all. There is even no real humor noticeable, no emotional ups and lows, and we will never know why Tim Roth did all this silly stuff. I did not like the first one too much at the time i saw it, but in comparison to this new one it's a quite good movie after all.I don't know where the good screenwriters are gone in Hollywood. For this new Hulk there was definitely none involved.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great...as long as you like the Avengers plan,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun, loud, and reminded me why I enjoy going to see movies in a theater.As many have said, there are plot holes. But they seem intentionally done. It is well known that the powers that be are intending to create several superhero movies with a culmination of an Avengers movie. It is dreadfully obvious within The Hulk that the focus was to have different story elements tie into that final project.The acting was alright. I preferred Eric Bana's version of Bruce Banner over Norton's. But, as we have come to expect from good ole' Edward, he puts up a decent front as a cowardly scientist. Live Tyler gives the most generic performance of her life, complete with her trademark breathy voice and all. But, having her not be in the limelight so much actually worked for this movie.The two stand-outs in this movie are William Hurt and Tim Roth. Hurt plays a great General. While he didn't do a whole lot with the role, he made it believable. Tim Roth is superb, finally finding a role for himself outside of the shadow of Mr. Orange. I loved him in every scene of the movie.The CGI was never completely amazing, but it does its job. Best part, though, is the Hulk has a five-o'clock shadow. Seems like no big deal, I know, but it was just fun to see an ""edgier"" looking Hulk (as opposed to the far too clean Hulk in the last movie).As for the director, he knows action sequences like no one else and flaunts it here. Each battle was uniquely and interestingly handled, with the final one being very satisfying. Granted, the ending may not have been to everyone's taste, it heavily ties into my statement in the first paragraph. The intimate scenes weren't perfect, but they do their job to help push the story.I recommend going to see this movie...that is as long as you intend on seeing this Avengers plan follow through. Basically, it is like Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest: it's a good movie if you plan on seeing all of them. The Hulk proves to be an awesome superhero, but he's lucky that there are tie-ins to the Avengers project.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Has it's points, but...","I have to admit, I really don't know why I went to this. In a venue saturated with CGI and somewhat crappy scripts and story lines, this installment over what was released just 5 years ago seems somewhat nonsensical. On top of that, Louis Leterrier has only directed only 2 films in his carer: Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and The Transporter II. Granted, both films merit a smile and a nod for actually being quite good films, however to hand over $150+ (which is incredible seeing at least almost 1/2 the film is done in CGI) seems also a little nonsensical in this case. It just seems to me that these movies are quickly becoming ordinary and harder to watch unless there are some great innovations in them, or at least a solid story line and a good ending.I like Ed Norton in this role though. At times you could see some striking resemblances to Bill Bixby at moments, and his mannerisms are more in tune with the original Bruce Banner character. I'll state right here that I am not going to do cross platform comparisons with all the various Hulk remakes and episodes, sorry. Liv Tyler seems a bit sappy in her role. I think she gets picked because she knows how to squirt those tears when needed, and on demand, and I didn't know what to make of William Hurt as her estranged father. Try as he might, I just can't see him in a ""tough guy"" situation.The CGI is probably what takes this movie into a more plausible realm. In the beginning, you meet Bruce banner, and there is a counter for the important scene changes that tell you how long it's been since his last ""episode"". The director brings in Hulk fairly early, but they leave him in shadows for the most part, only delivering the objects of his rampaging to the audience. This movie really has no start or finish, it is more like we are dropped in as observers into a struggle that aspires to be normal but seems to be a futile objective, and when we finally get Hulk so steamed up to yell the famous ""HULK SMASH"", it comes across climactic, but lacks that which should be sending electricity through your body.And that, for me about sums it up: It just didn't give me a charge. It was OK to watch, actually it was much better than the 2003 remake, but as far as being up there with this year Iron Man *cough* (could be the closest thing to a spoiler I can get to) *cough*, but probably by far not the worst movie we will see this year. The audience was quiet throughout the viewing, which also supports my lack of charge contention. Let us hope that they don't remake this one for at least another 20 years. Maybe by then we will go HOLO!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally a Romantic Movie for Guys,"So often us guys have to endure going to romantic comedies, or date flicks so we can entice the lovely objects of our affection to continue to spend ""quality"" time with us. And more often then not it comes at an expense that goes beyond the mere dollar value of the excursion. That expense is having to tolerate some rather dubious plots, dialog and an ending you could see coming a mile away on your way to the movie theatre.Now for a guy a long comes ""The Incredible Hulk"", and it so lovely a date movie for guys. It has a beautiful intelligent girl, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who stands by her man. And no matter how angry and destructive he gets, no matter how unfashionable and tattered his clothes get, she stands by her man; Hulk that is, (Eddie Norton), and though he now only has a rain drenched cave for him to sleep in Betty stays by Hulk's side and even snuggles with him; and together they hold the cold, wet, and lonely dark night at bay.They wake to face hostile world together.I sincerely enjoyed this movie, and I am probably the only one who also enjoyed Ang Lee's thoughtful ""Hulk"". I think that is all right to enjoy both, though they are different interpretations, they both were quite satisfying to me....now if I could only find me a Betty Ross, and I wouldn't have to watch my temper, worry about my ragged clothes, or the dark lair I live in.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cornball climax tops off another been-there, done-that film.","Fans of The Incredible Hulk rejoice! This is exactly how the Hulk should have been portrayed five years ago. I still have nightmare visions of Nick Nolte flailing his arms about as Bruce's father, followed by his ever-famous prison photo. And no one can blame Ang Lee for wanting to quit movies entirely after that film. He ended up getting revenge on all of us for Brokeback Mountain but I'm straying from the real topic here...Fans of movie-making and films rejoice? Well ... this 'reboot' is a better version than the original but not by much. There are elements of conflict, terror, action, and tension, all crammed into a melodramatic musical score with somewhat way too obvious (hence, boring) direction and screenplay. What keeps The Incredible Hulk from a total belly-up is Edward Norton, William Hurt and Tim Roth can still pull a heck of a performance in spite of everything. The Incredible Hulk's updated look deserves a note too, but five years later, it is to be expected. I'm just happy the Hulk's back I guess.

Thats what we wanted!,I've just came back after seeing the latest hulk movie hoping it would be much better than the last but still loyal to the comic book and the TV series.It was!!!!!! This is why.1.The cast were brilliant Ed Norton made the role his own and even looked similar to Bixby especially the green eyes bit. The supporting cast was just as superb. The only negative bit was not seeing Jack Mcghee. But he did get mentioned.2. The special effects were superb and making the hulk a more realistic size and strength rather than a light coloured green blob that is taller than the empire state building and can jump from city to city.3.Lou Ferringo did the voice of the hulk which I think was fantastic because lets face it he is the hulk. It was also great to see him in a different role and also Stan Lee appearing in another cameo.4. The depressing piano music was used albeit only for a minute or two. It was a shame they didn't use it at the end that would have been quality.Overall it was fantastic I don't think any hulk fan can argue with it. I cant wait for the sequel!,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'm trying to be fair... but it's hard,"OK, let me start off with a confession, I do not like Edward Norton. I do not like him as an actor, and I do not like him as a person. I believe he is the product of all the worst aspects of the misused and misunderstood practice of method acting, and I think he's an egomaniac and a terrible ""Film maker"", see ""American History X"" for what I mean. So lets get to ""The Hulk"". This film was of course going to be compared to Ang Lee's commercial and critical failure ""Hulk"". I myself did not like ""Hulk"", but I have to admit that it had more to do with the writing and the story than with the actors and film makers. ""Hulk"" actually had some original ideas in how to present the mythology of a comic book on film. The cast i felt in that movie was actually good, they just had a crap story to work with. ""Hulk"" was really an overwrought soap opera between the title character and his father, which to be fair in 80's the comic did explore Banner's relationship with his father and it explained his anger issues.Now we come to the new film ""The Incredible Hulk"", he we have a story less melodramatic, but somehow even more hollow and lacking in any intelligent subtlety. Edward Norton can not write. let me put it this way, as a writer Norton is a great actor, and as an actor, Norton is a great paralegal (please someone get that joke). Much was made about Norton writing a draft for the film to give the character more depth, but its not there. Also, Norton has made a huge deal out of not promoting the film as he feels its poorly made, the editing in particular. On that we can agree, but I have no doubt in my mind he could only make it worse. With ""American History X"" the director found it unbearable to work with Norton and left. Norton than re-edited the film, and gave himself more screen time and took the focus of the story from the white power movement and it's complexity and frightening aspects, to his acting abilities. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is edited perfectly naturally and well, so all Norton could do is add more footage of himself, and less of the actual Hulk. There are no opportunities to do and dialectic Eisenstien editing in Hulk, or and Bressonian elliptical editing, its just not that kind of movie.I understand not every film needs to be ""Au hasard balthazar"" or ""The 400 Blows"", but even the summer blockbusters can be smart and entertaining, but ""The Incredible Hulk"" is neither. Unfortunately I believe most people don't care how crappy a movie is, just that is has lots of CGI and explosions, and they'll be happy. I on the other hand will be making better use of my time watching Willam Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" on DVD, or ""Mon Oncle Antoine"" when it comes out on CC.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not too shabby,"I watched this last night and it is a decent enough film. You can tell that this was cut down a fair chunk to make it what it was: and in doing so I think they may have ruined what could of been a top notch movie ( there are some significant time leaps between shots). Still not a bad film, they could have done a bit more with Blonsky's character and included a bit more of the hulk hopping between buildings like an ungraceful Spiderman. That was great to see. One downfall is that there is no hulk pummel. But there is a hulk smash: which is what made the movie for me personally.

Action movie but politically dubious,"In many ways this was an amazing cinematographic work of art, the action scenes were fantastic and the military force and co-ordination used to try and catch Banner/Hulk was superbly done. Yet this was the slightly disturbing aspect of the thing. Here was the US portrayed as gung-ho again, being able to ""invade"" other countries at will, endanger innocent lives and permit a rogue general powers that were way beyond reality. Okay so it was only a fantasy story in the Batman, The Incredibles genre, but I nevertheless found myself despising the US Government and its power which so easily could be turned to evil, perhaps it was a warning! Nevertheless with these feelings aside the story was far better executed than in the last Hulk offering (2003) though I have seen better acting from the main stars it has to be said. Liv Tyler (Betty) kept reminding me of Arwen in The Lord of the Rings though John Hurt's performance as the power-crazed army general was awesome. I did sit riveted throughout but came away feeling disturbed and the somewhat ""open"" ending (no spoilers) clearly left the path open for follow-up movies in the future, though I'll not be holding my breath.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the same...,"The Incredible Hulk is a dumbed down version of the Hulk character and story and simply pales to the Ang Lee movie not only in casting, performances, seriousness and writing but generally by being just another run-of-the-mill action movie. Having said that, the movie is actually rather entertaining.The first third of the movie is probably the best and even though it is a very distant nod to how the first movie ended I'm happy that Banner's escape to South America was referenced at least a little bit. The continuous references to the comics and ultimately the future Avengers Film, as well as moments of comic relief keep the movie fresh and going but it's hard to look at the film as anything more than a big budget blow out to get Hulk fighting another monster.My problem with this film is the same as with Iron Man, the film deteriorates into a big over-blown CGI battle rather than trying to actually tell a good story. Unlike in Iron Man, this movie doesn't even have a secondary plot theme to keep it afloat which only manages to enhance it's rather meaningless existence.Still, this is a fun action movie and I'm sure the sequel might actually be just as good. Here's hoping that the Hulk's next big screen appearance will have a little more weight to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pardon the pun, but this is incredibly good!","X-Men: big franchise. Spider-Man: ditto. In fact, even Fantastic Four was granted a sequel. But not good old Hulk: despite the best efforts on behalf of director Ang Lee and a cast that included Eric Bana and Nick Nolte, the green giant's big screen outing, though lauded by most critics and, to lesser extent, fans, wasn't big enough at the box office to convince Universal another installment was a good idea. Now, with the studio merely distributing (Marvel itself threw in the cash, which is also why there are no legal obstacles to having other characters from different comics in the film - more on that later) and a completely renewed cast and crew, The Incredible Hulk is a noble and for the most part successful attempt to reboot the series, a bit like Batman Begins.Technically, this is not a sequel to Lee's film (the opening montage depicts a completely different explanation for the Hulk's origin), but it is indicated that five years have passed since Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) disappeared from the United States (and there is a five-year gap between the release of the two movies), and the story begins in South America, where the previous version ended. To be more specific, Banner is hiding in Brazil, trying to control his rage and having no contact with the outside world, except for occasional e-mails with a certain Mr. Blue (Banner calls himself Mr. Green, obviously), who might succeed in finding a cure for the protagonist's condition. But while he may avoid others, others are looking for him, and a radiation-related accident (which has to do with Stan Lee's mandatory appearance) enables General Ross (William Hurt) to locate him and send a team, led by the slightly insane Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), to get him. The rest of the plot is rather basic: Banner is on the run, he becomes the Hulk on a few occasions, returns to the US and has no ally besides Mr. Blue and old flame Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Oh, and did I mention Blonsky decides to become a monster himself in order to bring a little fairness to the game?The script, which is largely influenced by the '70s TV show, with the addition of Bruce Jones' comic-book cycle (the Mr. Blue subplot is lifted from his arc), aims to solve the one problem many think caused Lee's take on the subject to alienate fans: there was too much psychology/emotion, not enough action (some people made the same remark about Superman Returns). For that reason, hiring The Transporter director Louis Leterrier seemed like a logical choice, although there was doubt regarding his ability to handle what little ""deeper material"" there has to be in a picture like this. That he succeeds is nearly all thanks to Norton: not only does he play Banner with a conviction few would have in a role like this (then again, he's already dealt with multiple personalities in Primal Fear and Fight Club), but he also co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn (the sole credited writer), his deep knowledge of the comic proving a great asset when it comes to finding the right mixture of action, drama and humor (the ""hungry/angry"" joke is one of the best). But this isn't just Norton's movie: Roth, the actor formerly known as Mr. Orange, is joyously manic, and Tim Blake Nelson's sequel-suggesting presence comes close to marvelous.Any complaints? Actually, yes: Tyler, despite her fair share of blockbuster experience, brings very little of significance to her character, not counting a couple of scenes, and the inevitable climactic showdown between ""hero"" and villain could have been reduced by at least five minutes. But hey, at least we get a Hulk that looks a lot better than the ""poor man's Shrek"" seen in the 2003 version. Plus, he finally utters the famous line ""Hulk smash!"" (with Lou Ferrigno's voice, no less). That, in addition to a really great cameo by Robert Downey Jr. (which, unlike Sam Jackson's role in Iron Man, has not become a post-credits ""surprise""), indicates that if a second (or third, depending on how you interpret the connection between the films) movie gets made, it's gonna be pretty, well, incredible.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Bigger, Greener, and Back With a Vengeance","Going in thinking that this film would be a sequel to the first one, I was happy to say I was mistaken. What the first one lacked, this one surely fulfilled. Most of the reason that I believe that this did better was not adding characters that would only be fillers to the film. In this film everyone had a purpose and they did not over step that by adding twists and turns leading you to the wrong direction. Edward Norton is not too bad as the Hulk and plays a troubled hero quite well. Liv Tyler is a great actress that did provide a few comic moments for this film. While I did believe that this film lagged in some areas, it did have a plot and purpose. The CGI was awesome and the Hulk probably looked more as a hero every time he appeared. Though he was feared at first, society finally looked past the green exterior and saw compassion. By that, we see a different side of Hulk and welcome him as a truly incredible being.

The concept, and the initial storyline were rather promising, but they are never quite built upon, and the focus is, instead, on mind-numbingly dull, repetitive special effects that are neither aesthetically pleasing nor that revolutionary in terms of technical wizardry. The whole movie is basically about the hulk- running away from a military that acts as if it owns the planet, roaring loudly, and smashing things. Its yet another generic mindless action movie targeted at 12-15 yr olds; and indeed, if I was a twelve year-old I'd be in love with this movie..trouble is I ain't twelve years-old, and neither were my fellow cine-goers, who were laughing throughout the overdone action sequences and positively jeering by the end. the only redeeming quality about this movie is Edward Norton's performance, William Hurt is moderately tolerable, and everyone else, especially Liv Tyler, are wasted. besides, its 30 minutes too long.

A Great Tribute to the 70s TV Show,"I loved the way this film paid tribute to the 70s classic. A movie about the Hulk should have some references to Bill Bixby's Hulk and this film had them. It was great to hear some of that music again, see Banner do the lonely walk and see him being given radiation in the way that was done to Bixby. We all loved the 70s version, so why stray too far away from it? The filmmakers had the good taste in deciding not to.With the tone set to more like the 70s show and less like Ang Lee's version, this film was instantly engaging. And along with an interesting story, gripping action and great special effects, this film was thoroughly entertaining. I also liked that it explained how the Hulk has always been able to keep his pants on. I'm not sure if it was explained in the comic books or anywhere else, but this was a nice touch.Edward Norton was an excellent choice to play Banner. No one could be more opposite to the Hulk. (I suppose the Jekyll/Hyde character he played in Primal Fear prepared him for this.) And Liv Tyler was fine. But as much as I like William Hurt, he didn't seem to have much energy. Perhaps it was the script, but he just seemed detached.The CGI effects have come a long way since Ang Lee's Hulk. When I heard they were still going to use CGI for the Hulk in this version, I had my reservations. While it can render reptiles and all sorts of creatures fairly well, computers have always had trouble making humans or human-like creatures look real. But it seems they have come pretty close for this film.One thing I would have like to have seen kept in this film from the 70s version was Banner's reason for getting the radiation-- so that he could become stronger to protect his loved ones. Here, this film went with the comic books' version-- to become a super soldier for the military. I liked the 70s version. It just seemed to add more empathy to Banner's character, and it was just plain more romantic.Well, all in all a great film, and I'm looking forward to the next.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great interpretation of the Hulk!,"The new Hulk film was well made for a number of reasons. Without giving any major plot details, their were some really good reasons to see this movie.The movie was packed with action, had a believable romantic element to the film, although the plot was slightly rushed in the opening credits the remainder of the movie did a good job clearing up lingering questions, and of course spotting other famous comic book/ex-comic book stars is always fun.Overall, Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth are believable in their respective roles and the energy throughout the film keeps you wanting to watch more. I definitely would recommend this movie along with Iron Man if you like to watch exciting action packed comic book movies!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am crying because I cannot give it 0/.10,"This film simply breaks all the rules of storytelling. The characters are empty, the plot-line is empty and the makers must have been on holiday and allowed a primary school to manage the project. Maybe the whole thing is a Louis Leterrier joke on the stupidity of humanity - for dignifying this by forcing us to comment on this piece of garbage.The shots of the Favela in Brazil are the high point. If you have a Blu-Ray player that shows this shot in its glory, then you can have enjoyed that, take your copy with your tail between your legs to a store where they will give you 'pre-owned' money for it. This is the most favourable outcome for the victims of the 'Incredible Hulk'.As someone who knows a bit about CGI, I can say that creating these characters without any reference to the immutable laws of physics that govern our universe is lamentable stupidity. I cannot go on. I am utterly disgusted. Please let this be the worst ever. Do not test us with new precedents film makers.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I just like this movie,I know its not the best movie when you consider dialogue ar story or even action scenes.But i think the connection between Ed Norton and Liv Tyler is just so well done.

Not the Purple Pants,"Greetings again from the darkness. Kind of a return to roots for the big green guy. The action scenes are grittier, louder and bigger than in Ang Lee's version ... all with a scaled back, more believable Hulk. This time Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner and Liv Tyler is Betty Ross, his scientific partner and love interest.An unlikely casting decision puts Tim Roth as Hulk's nemesis, Blonsky, and finally as The Abomination. And a very creepy looking Willliam Hurt is the military guy attempting to cover up his mis-deeds. Somehow, Hurt's character has access to every military weapon known to man ... and the authority to use it on a college campus and in the middle of NYC. Hurt looks a bit too much like the new Burt Reynolds. I guess that adds to the list of mutants in the film.Actually, I was impressed with the action scenes ... they were what I had hoped for. Plenty of fighting and chasing and ""smashing"". The dialogue in the non-action scenes was pretty lame, but that's not really what anyone comes to see.A couple other points of interest: creator Stan Lee gets temporarily juiced off the Hulk's blood, Lou Ferrigno shows up twice - once as a pizza chomping security guard and also as the voice of Hulk, Ironman Tony Stark (Robert Downey, jr) shows up for a scene that sets the stage for ""The Avengers"" and the late, great Bill Bixby (TV's Hulk) has a creative cameo via TV and ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"". Speaking of setting the stage ... watch out for Tim Blake Nelson's character in the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Horrible, horrible, horrible","Horrible, horrible, horrible I can't believe how miscast this movie is. What was Ed Norton thinking when he signed up for this? Okay, it's a remake. If you saw the first hulk, you don't need to see this one. Feel free to avoid this one. And feel happy that you did.Couldn't they have found a shorter Special Forces guy to fight poor Ed? LOL. As an SF veteran myself, I can tell you that we all weren't 8 feet tall, but I was short at 5'10''. Tim Roth looks like a hobbit standing next to William Hurt. And why does Tim Roth, the super soldier, have a freaking beard and long hair? With all of us coming back from the Middle East, couldn't they have found any veterans to square this douche bag away? I mean come on, give one of the PTSD guys a few hundred bucks for god's sake William Hurt should NOT, I repeat, NOT play Army officers. He looks asleep as he is delivering his lines. His hair is too long and his mustache is past the edge of his mouth  the gas masks can't seal of you have hair past you lips.There are some who would defend this junk. To them I say, ""Taxi scene, researcher scene, lines delivered by the super soldier, Tim Roth"" The only shining moment in this piece of crap is the cameo by Lou Ferrigno. Great to see you Lou.

Finally a true Hulk movie.,"I saw this movie when it came out and i think it was so awesome. I saw the 2003 movie when it came out on opening night and i hated it. When i hear about the new movie i careless until the i saw the trailer which look good. The acting in this movie was very well done and Edward Norton as the Incredible Hulk did a great job. His acting fit very well with the role as Burce Banner. The fight scenes with abomination where awesome and very well done! The CGI in the movie was really good and it not bad as everyone said it was because The CGI in Hulk (2003) was bad due to the skin texture was crap. In the 2003 film, when bullets hit him, his skin ripples and wobbles. But in this new Hulk movie, the skin texture look better and more realistic then the design in the 2003 movie. The story is very simple to flow and the opening credits for the movie shows how Burce became the Hulk, so you don't have to worry about the story being slow.This movie is awesome and it worth checking out.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A much better start to the franchise,"The incredible Hulk tells us the story of a scientist on the run named Bruce Banner (Edward Norton). We get glimpse of an experiment gone wrong and catch up with Banner in Brazil. Banner is looking for a cure for something and since we all know what the film is about it isn't much of a mystery. Through an accident at the soda factory Banner works at a drop of his blood makes it to the US in a bottle revealing his location to General Ross (William Hurt) who is hunting Banner. An elite group of soldiers is sent to Brazil led by General Ross and a special forces legend, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). As Banner is pinned down he transforms beating several special forces agents and Blonsky. After his escape Banner seeks out his lost love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to help him find a man who may be able to help him. As General Ross, who is also Betty's dad, closes in on Banner he convinces Blonsky to take part in several super solder experiments to help him fight the Hulk leading to the creation of another monster.All in all this film is far better then Ang Lees 2003 train wreck the Hulk. The FX were brilliant and the Hulk looked great. The Hulk was very real looking and felt like a character not a cool addition to the film. The action was smooth and we got a good villain instead of hulked out dogs.I thought Edward Norton was perfect as Banner both in his stature and quit desperation for a cure. It was really cool to see a skinny and weakly looking Banner turn into the huge and powerful Hulk. Tyler, Hurt, and the other actors also do a fantastic job of contributing to the story. Roth is great as an aging soldier presented with the chance to become everything he used to be and more. He provides a great glimpse into how power corrupts.The script flowed well getting rid of the cheese the seeped out of Ang Lee's Hulk. It was funny in a realist way and still communicated what was happening. The only real issue with the story was how crammed everything felt. At times I wished I had seen more of Banners time alone and how it got him to where he was. I guess I also wished Norton had had the opportunity to really let us see Banners pain in being alone.I must say there were a lot of tips to Hulk fans as well. The scenes that mirrored the old TV show, the use of the TV show theme, Lou Ferrigno included in a cameo and as the Hulks voice, the purple pants, Hulk in the rain with Betty. All of those things pushed my geek buttons which was a lot of fun.The only problem this film really had was that it came out in the summer when we got Iron Man and The Dark Knight. I think that those two films helped to bury a very good story. Not that those films are evil it just may have not been the best idea to release this film in the same summer as those two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than the first, eagerly await second installment","This movie was awesome! After the monstrosity that Ang Lee created in 2005's 'Hulk' I was really not expecting much from this movie but I got exactly what I wanted and more. Firstly for those complaining that the Hulk looks fake from the commercials, don't worry, he looks a lot better on the the big screen and so does the Abomination which is the villain for this piece. This movie succeeds action wise with some really good stunts and lengthy battle sequences to the point where I was never bored in this movie. The only problems i had with this movie were very minor. Firstly, the dialogue was very weak. I like Louis Leterrier's directing style but Zak Penn's screenplay was really weak. I like how they tried to quote some of the famous lines from the TV series eg. 'hulk smash!' but when you are making a live action superhero movie it does not fit. Another thing was William Hurt who I was if no one else was hoping to love in this movie because i think he is a terrific actor. It was not that he was wrong for the role, he was perfect but his acting was almost lazy. It felt like he was acting on the basis of 'oh its a superhero movie, who cares I am probably going to get a big paycheck.' Aside from this everything worked really well. Ed Norton was perfect as Bruce Banner and even though i liked Eric Bana and thought he did a good job, Norton kicks his ass! Awaiting this movie I was prepared to really hat Liv Tyler but she turned out to be better than expected. I am not going to go as far as saying she was better than Jennifer Connelly but it felt like she was giving this movie everything she had which the audience realized and appreciated. Overall, a definite see!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Green Cheese,"The first Hulk movie was a major disappointment. Ang Lee is a great director, but he fundamentally misunderstood the character. The Hulk is not about Bruce Banner's unresolved Freudian conflicts with his father. Nor is it about fighting giant, gamma-irradiated French poodles.Now along comes Hulk 2.0. Director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn don't have Lee's talent or budget, but have created a more enjoyable, albeit cheesier, movie by sticking closer to the source material. Watch for cameos by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby, and Robert Downey Jr. in his Tony Stark role.The first half of the movie works best: after an efficient opening sequence that gets the origin out of the way, we switch to Bruce Banner as a super powered fugitive, on the run from the US Army, and hiding out in São Paulo. (A nod to the first movie, which ended with Banner hiding in Latin America.) Ed Norton looks sufficiently haunted and emaciated to make this work. The Hulk is wisely kept in shadow and only shown in bits and pieces.The second half of the movie starts showing some cracks. The Hulk doesn't look like Shrek this time, but he still doesn't look believable. Maybe it's impossible for CGI to render a nine foot tall, two ton green giant convincingly. Worse, the personal conflictsBanner with Betty Ross; Betty with her father, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; the General with Bannerfeel perfunctory, as if Leterrier and Penn are just filling time until the final throwdown with the Abomination. Here, they could have learned a thing or two from Lee, who excels at personal conflict.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Inferior to Ang Lee's 2003 version,"This reboot is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but very underrated 2003 ""The Incredible Hulk"".Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). To this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tell how strong the ""force"" is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.In his quest to turn it into a ""fugitive"" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. To him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director picking up on Ed Norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt, Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary.The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However, even as I am a fan of the comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much upgrade over the 2003 Hulk,"The Incredible Hulk starring Edward Norton is quite easily an upgrade over Ang Lee's Hulk released in 2003 for several reasons. Having watched both films right after one another, it is clear this version is superior.First off Edward Norton's performance as Bruce Banner is more convincing than Eric Bana as he shows much more emotion and range as Banner, and is easier to root for. Same with Liv Tyler, as she is quite easily an upgrade over Jennifer Connelly's Betty Ross.More action and this film doesn't feel as forced as the 2003 version. Also more humor and some unintentional funny moments for comic relief.This film also doesn't drag its plot along and doesn't have the same abusive father storyline with flashbacks. It gets right into the story and immediately becomes quite thrilling and entertaining.The CGI of the Hulk looked better all around. The battle scene at the end was a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Panel Pens,"I'm not sure what it is about Marvel comics that turns their movies into unsuccessful films. There's some profound consistency in the approach. It clearly originates in a specific concept of what the essence of comic books are about so what matters in translating to the screen.My theory is that Marvel had a fan base in the 60s and 70s (when the form we see was established). The fans and artists reinforced a style which was more spefically rooted in the comic books of the 30s before comics became essentially cinematic.I'm talking about superhero books here. DC was the first to become exclusively cinematic and the first to market that to TeeVee and Movies, which in this context are equivalent.It's precisely the uncinematic nature of Marvel that made them successful as books. The design of the panels is profoundly static. The postures and even the builds (which are the main defining characteristics here) are not derived from any stage. The physical humanness is deliberately removed so that the characters and stories can be more abstractly pure.It's the same crowd that is producing these movies. Unlike, say the Batman series where artists are given great freedom, this production shop controls the approach tightly. That's probably good for the brand, but it makes for pretty tepid movies. Oh, these can be as loud and colorful as the next guy's. But they will never have the power over the soul that  yes  the comics have.And gosh, if Liv Tyler's job is to just look appealing, why would they photograph her so poorly?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as Ang Lee's Hulk,"There, I wrote it. The inevitable comparison, this Hulk film isn't as good as the 2003 version. Ang Lee's film was flawed, with a horrible climax and too much ham from Nick Nolte. Flat acting throughout, the previous film still exhibited heart and intelligence, obviously planted by Ang's thoughtful direction. Even the emerald green skin color was preferable to the swamp green of the new version.I really looked forward to this reboot, but I was disappointed. Even with an action flick, great acting is necessary to bridge the gap. Sadly, heavy hitters like William Hurt, Edward Norton and Tim Roth just don't get it done. Most of their failure has to be due to the uninteresting screenplay.Liv Tyler is one of the most beautiful women on film, but there's no way she's credible as a scientist. She comes across more like a lovesick schoolgirl. Her lispy, and Norton's tinny vocal deliveries, combined with inane dialogue, makes their scenes together no more than fluff.The action is decent, and the back story and buildup in the Brazilian factory are pretty good. I am tired of the super soldier plot device. Maybe it's fresh to moviegoers, but it's been over-utilized for 40 years in the comic universe. To me, a reboot would take a fresh approach to the gamma radiation.Tony Stark's (Robert Downey) cameo was nice, but unnecessary. This Hulk has no business in an Avengers movie. Until the Hulk gets his proper treatment, he should not be rendered on film again.I realize I'll be in the minority with my preference, but I've watched both films a number of times, and I always end up with the same conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Incredible, but pretty Good.","Before I start this review I just want to say that I actually liked the hulk film that was made a few years ago in 2003. I liked this one too and it is better in some aspects than the other hulk film and worse than the other hulk film in some ways also.The story is basically involving Bruce Banner and how he must be on the run constantly. THis is because there are some in the military who want to use his mutation into the hulk to aid the military. One soldier in particular is infected by the same type of mutation and becomes a hulk monster whom Banner must battle to save humanity.First I should say that this film tends to try to ignore the other hulk film completely. It is a remake of sorts not a follow up. I guess this is because they felt that the other hulk film was a disappointment.I thought the beginning of the film really lacked in story. THere are some brief scenes during the opening credits that show how Banner became the hulk but for the most part during the whole film Banner is the hulk already and they do not explain how he became the hulk at all. I guess this makes sense but it got me confused. If they wanted to redo the hulk film completely wouldn't they want to show how he became the hulk in the first place? But this does lead to there being more action and I guess the people assumed that most people who are watching this film do not care too much about how Banner became the hulk and just want to see action.THere is a lot of good action in this film. I really like the bad guy in this film and how the main bad guy is another hulk like evil looking creature. The battle between Banner and the other hulk is a pretty good battle.The acting is good. Not outstanding. I liked Edward Norton a lot in ""American History X"" and ""Rounders"" and I thought he was a good choice to play Banner in this film. He really does an effective job portraying a man who must live with the problem he possesses and must deal with other people who want to find him due to the problem he has.Liv Tyler never has wowed me in any film I have seen her in and it was more of the same in this film. Nothing outstanding and sometimes lacking. COuld have chosen a better leading lady actor.Quickly I would just like to say I thought it was interesting how Robert Downey Jr. appears briefly as Tony Stark. That cameo I thought was awesome as it may lead to more great Marvel Films in the future.So this is a good film. Does not really do a good job explaining how Banner became the hulk but I think they did that on purpose. But the acting by Norton was good and there is a lot of good action.

"Incredible, no, but worthwhile, thanks to a touching performance by Norton, a great supporting cast and fabulous special effects","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been living in a barrio in Brazil for the last year. This is because he is a wanted man, after a laboratory accident that went awry. As you may have heard, Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and when he is overly ""excited"", he turns into a nearly all-powerful monster called the Hulk. In his monstrous form, he killed several folks in the United States. But, unbelievably, that is not exactly why he is being pursued. A bonehead military man, Ross (William Hurt) is after Banner so that Bruce's blood can be used to generate another super-being, rendering the American army invincible. Ross' beautiful daughter, Elizabeth (Liv Tyler), a biology professor, was once involved with Banner and is still the object of the fugitive's affections. To help capture Banner, the elder Ross enlists the aid of a Russian-turned-Brit, Rambo-type (Tim Roth) who is very successful at snaring his prey. But, Banner still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he seeks the aid of an online scientist who may have a cure for his condition. So, who will emerge victorious, Banner or his misguided seekers? This is a good film with unbelievably great special effects and a wonderfully touching performance by Norton. It is on these two strengths that the film succeeds, for the script is uneven and inferior, the direction is one-handed and the events a series of implausibilities. No, it is not the science that is lacking, it is the supposed intelligence of the military. Knowing what this man-monster can do, how could anyone possibly believe that humans could claim victory? Yet, Hurt's character is built on that misguided belief. As stated, Norton is a wonder, for he infuses his character with courage, smarts, and sensitivity. The rest of the cast is quite fine, too, as Tyler, Hurt, and Roth fulfill their roles nicely and the lesser actors do a good job as well. The opening chase scene in the barrio is exciting, even though the viewer feels Banner was deliberately placed in Brazil so that the scene could happen. All other scenery is quite wonderful, too, as the viewer is transported to Guatemala, Mexico, D.C. and even to British Columbia. Costumes are fetching but of small importance. Noteworthy, too, are the fabulous special effects, as Banner's transformation into the Hulk is most impressive and the havoc that ensues when he is in action is mind-boggling. However, the storyline is not worthy of such dazzlement, being, virtually, one long hunting excursion. Should one skip it? No, not at all, as it has enough good elements to make it worthwhile. But, it is far below the bar set by such wonderful movies as this summer's Iron Man or the original Batman.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A fairly decent job was done this time, unlike before","It was five years ago this month I went to see Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" in the theatre, and like many others, I was not too impressed. I last gave it a try on the small screen last year, and it certainly didn't improve. In fact, I probably noticed more flaws in it than before. However, when I learned that this second adaptation of the ""Incredible Hulk"" comic book series was coming, featuring a different cast and director, it was a film I intended to watch. Before I went to see it on the silver screen today, I knew it seemed to be widely considered superior to the 2003 film, so I was expecting it to be, and it was, even though it's not one of my favourite comic book movies.Bruce Banner is now a fugitive from the U.S. Military in Brazil, and has managed not to turn into the Hulk for quite a while. He currently works in a bottling factory, and is learning anger management techniques. He also has conversations on the Internet with someone he knows as ""Mr. Blue"", discussing a possible cure for Bruce's condition. Unfortunately for Bruce, the military manages to track him down, and while they are after him, he is attacked by fellow factory employees, causing him to finally turn into the Hulk again! So, the military doesn't catch him this time, but he is once again on the run from them! He finds himself in Guatemala the next day, and soon makes his way back to the United States, where he meets his former girlfriend, Betty Ross, the daughter of General Ross. From here, his conflict with the military continues, and more trouble arises when another powerful giant green creature appears, The Abomination!Things that sunk Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" include bad acting, some laughable lines in the script, Talbot being a fairly annoying character, and silly multiple scene framing. Fortunately, I didn't notice any of these things in this second attempt to bring The Incredible Hulk to the big screen. The acting isn't really anything to rave about, but at least it's better than before. The script may be a tad weak at times, but at least there are no lines as low as what Betty says to Bruce after he survives gamma radiation in the first film. Aside from that, we don't have any characters as annoying as Talbot, and there's none of the multiple scene framing. 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is also more exciting. I had trouble staying into it for a while, but eventually, the action had me in fairly consistent suspense for probably most of the rest of the film, starting with the battle between the Hulk and the military on the university campus. To add to the entertainment, there's also a bit of humour in this film, such as the crazy taxi driver. Some of the fight sequences may be a bit overlong, but I don't think any of them have anything on the tedious sequence with the Hulk fighting mutated dogs in the 2003 film.With all its merits, this comic book movie is not the greatest one to reach the silver screen since the '90s (there have been lots of those), but it certainly does show a vast improvement after the first ""Hulk"" movie adaptation, and is definitely superior to certain other comic book movies of the decade, such as the Razzie Award-winning ""Catwoman"". Like Ang Lee's 2003 film, this one is dark, which some would like and some wouldn't, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the quality of the film. Unlike its predecessor, this 2008 version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" is actually a fairly decent dark film, and if you're a fan of these comic book movies and were displeased by the first Hulk movie adaptation (like many others were, myself included), well, that's no reason to avoid this second one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"When He's In Hulk Mode, Watch Out","With The Incredible Hulk Edward Norton can now take his place in the superhero genre besides such contemporaries as Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey, Jr., and Ben Affleck all of whom have played comic book superheroes. It's the in thing to do in Hollywood these days and I have to say the films for the most part make money.When we meet Norton he's living in obscurity in Brazil trying to control his emotions because the experiment that turned him into the green guy have already gone horribly wrong. Norton is scientist Bruce Banner who made the mistake of experimenting on himself. Now if you get him mad it's not a pretty sight both to look at him and to see what he can do.General William Hurt wants him back at any price. His scientist daughter Liv Tyler wants Norton back as well. She's carrying a Statue of Liberty size torch for Norton who when he's in Hulk mode would use that torch as a matchstick.To track down the Hulk, William Hurt has imported a real bad dude from the British Royal Marines in Tim Roth. At some point Hurt decided he'd like a lot of what Norton has and of course the final confrontation is with them. I'm still not sure why we had to import him from the United Kingdom, but the match between them reminded me of Andre the Giant versus Big John Studd back in the glory days of the WWF.Though the cast looked like they were having a good time, I'm not sure The Incredible Hulk gets beyond the comic book stage. TV's famous Doctor Banner, Bill Bixby made a cameo appearance via a clip from another old series of his, The Courtship of Eddie's Father. And when the late Mr. Bixby was in Hulk mode he was Lou Ferrigno who plays a small bit as a security guard who can be bribed with pizza.If this film succeeds I'm sure there will be a sequel, in fact one was kind of set up during this film. Let's see if we get to explore that in the next Incredible Hulk film.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can't Wait The Director's Cut ... Deleted Scenes Would Make It a Perfect 10,"I really enjoyed this movie until I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD. Then, I realized that including some of those scenes would've made this film a pure masterpiece. I hope they give us a director's cut or that ""Norton"" cut we have all heard about. As is, even in an era when an explosion of comic-book superheroes are hitting the big screen, Hulk stands alone. This has nothing to do with being a blind superhero fan. It has everything to do with the classic Jekell and Hyde story with a great twist and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe. The concluding battle is one for the ages. What's special is that it is held together by some great acting and a sci-fi but believable story (so very rare for a summer ""blockbuster"") Banner is likable and the Hulk isn't some victim, he's the hero this time around. I really like this movie but would love it if they put a few of those deleted scenes back in to the film.

A shame it came out when it did.,"This was a very well done movie and I was very happy to re-watch it as part of my MCU marathon. It is unfortunate it came out when the MCU was not very well established because I think the result would have been a lot better if it had been released just a couple of years later. Not that I dislike Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, I think he did a great job before Ruffalo took on the role, and the special effects still hold up very well. But later MCU movies found a certain formula that give them a sort of 'epicness' this movie could have used to bring it to an even higher level. That said, I still really recommend it as is.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Bad, Bad, Bad","What on earth do we have to put up with these days, a huge budget feature where the script was written with as much finesse as the hulk himself would, if you gave him a piece of a4 paper and a kids crayon! The set up from the previous film was played in the opening credits and then we had to endure laborious romantic interludes with some science thrown in, in between some predictable action scenes. This film could have been cut down to 28mins and would have still seemed floppy. Even the CGI was poor, Ray Harryhousen did better with some old left over plasticine!! As a point in fact look at the scene in the cave, they don't even line up the Hulk and his love interests hands properly, when they go into yet another romantic interlude.Overall this was a terrible film even on the scale of Spiderman 3 terrible.

Do You Hear The Thud Of A Dud?,"It's a bad sign when you hear members of the audience groan! But its not hard to figure out why! This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but if the filmmakers were honest they would have marketed The Incredible Hulk strictly as a child/young teen flick, instead.It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One thing is for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!Memo to Hollywood: I know your going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make you next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, the last Superman film or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much?

Will leave your movie-going senses on high! Great Film!,"You'll not have a more enjoyable two hours in a movie theater all year. I applaud the creators of this movie that looks and feels like a live action comic. There are some cerebral moments but when it's time to Hulk out... run for cover! With ""Iron Man"" and ""Incredible Hulk"" hitting box office gold, this is beginning to look like the golden age of super hero movies. This movie will leave your movie-going senses on high, just like a Hulk movie should.This film works because of the great cast and the fact that the director took this subject matter seriously. Casting a perennial Oscar contender like Ed Norton was perfect. Veteran's like William Hurt and Tim Roth really shine in their roles. What can you say about the stunningly beautiful Liv Tyler? She's just fabulous.Incredible Hulk was much, much better than I expected and much better then the last film. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre but this movie ups the ante. I look forward to seeing it again and I hope it does well enough to be worthy of a sequel.

A pity that the better Hulk movie should come out second.,"The Incredible Hulk - A reboot of the franchise after the Abomination that was ""The Hulk"", Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) evades the military after a mixture of Super Soldier serum and gamma radiation turns him into the jolly Green Giant we all love.I didn't like the first movie, for several reasons. It was slow. It was boring. Nick Nolte's heinous over-acting, and Eric Bana's aversion to acting. Oh, and the Poodle. Did I mention the Poodle? Who hasn't? It's become synonymous with the Bat-nipples at this point. While Incredible Hulk is no Batman Begins to Batman and Robin, it stays truer to the roots of the character than it's predecessor, and acknowledges the TV show, a wise move.This film gives the fanbase a little more of what they expect and deserve from a movie about a monster that destroys property. There aren't the Banner-father issues that the first film had and didn't need. There're also more explosions, noise (Jesus is it loud), action, humor and movement. It unfortunately retreads a little too much familiar ground. I've seen the Hulk get chased by the military. I've already seen this love/hate triangle between Ross, Banner and Betty, though it's actually interesting here I read there's a scene where Bruce travels to the North pole and contemplates suicide. Now there's a scene I haven't seen before, and would like to see.The trouble with the Incredible Hulk is unless you're a very very creative writer, The Hulk is a rather two dimensional character. He gets angry and then smashes crap up. The only memorable villain he ever has was The Abomination because the other secret to The Hulk is that he's a better villain (it's taken most of the Marvel universe to bring him down at varying points) than a hero. I applaud Norton for his creativity and the depth he brings to Banner. He also adds vitality and intelligence, whilst Eric Bana was having difficulty grasping the American accent. Liv Tyler adds a sweet sadness to the romantic interest. She is Banner's only connection to humanity when he transforms. Tim Roth plays the heavy pretty well, though I caught him overacting blatantly a couple times. The effects are pretty good and I enjoyed the action sequences.It's unfortunate that the better Hulk movie should come out second (and behind Iron Man no less) which should be a lesson to Hollywood. Put your butts in gear and get it right the first time. Good, not ""Incredible"", The Incredible Hulk gets a B.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But then the new Dr. Banner grows on you from ""The Avengers"" still the story can be connected through Dr. Blue as he was turning into some kind of Big Brainac monster. Which can lead up to a new villain. Movie's overall tone is serious. But Hulk CGI is amazing, not so much of the abomination.

Take cover! Mayhem Ahead!,"So Hulk it is..Great!!! First of all, Norton was the best choice. A shy small man that becomes a beast? Smart move. Plus he is a good actor, which adds to the role of such a movie, where you are not supposed to take it seriously.As with Iron Man, the protagonist is a remarkable actor, although in Iron Man the action was lame, the story repetitive, the usual boring happy ending and overall the only thing worth mentioning about it is the performance.What we have here is a movie with good pace, interesting characters and exciting action (FINALLY). Liv Tyler was OK. Norton great. CGI awesome.WHAT STANDS OUT IS THE ACTION.

powerful action flick...special effects are rock solid,"I have not seen the hulk, the first one but i did not miss anything while watching the incredible hulk. The movie is an entertaining action flick.The story is very easy going, predictable and almost self explanatory. The movie starts with edward norton as part of an experiment which goes wrong and turns him into a green monster.The general who wants to use hulk as a military weapon with the intention of creating more like him, chases hulk. His daughter, Liv tyler loves patrick norton. General has tim roth as the military leader who hates hulk. Tim roth turns himself into abomination with the help of a biologist who is initially trying to cur e hulk. Now in the initial part edward norton wants to get rid of the monster inside him. But later he wishfully turns into one wto stop the abomination.Now the movie has certain cliché where only tyler can turn him back to normal with her expression of love. The director just missed showing her kissing norton to convert him back into a normal person from a monster :-) . The climax has been compromised a little by giving hint of another sequel. Although i liked the final scene where patrick norton is practicing yoga.tyler is lost and ordinary. Tim roth overreacts most of the time.

Strike two,"Hero origins in the Marvel universe are often hard enough to believe on their own. (Radioactive spiders are more likely to give you radioactive blood poisoning than super powers.)The Hulk, being basically Mr. Hyde on super-steroids, is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Lou Ferrigno, despite not being as brawny as the comic book character (and who is?), nevertheless did it well. The CGI character in this movie, not so much.In fact, the CGI is the main killer for this movie. On its own, it's not convincing at all. There are almost no scenes in which you're not aware that you're looking at a video game character interacting with normal humans. The result is that the movie ends up looking like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" crossed with an X Box game.Whoever designed the Hulk obviously never heard that less is more. A hulk larger than any living bodybuilder would have been fine, but this is one gigantic, over-detailed brute. If motion-tracking technology was used, it didn't show up in the final product. This Hulk moves awkwardly, at times much too fast considering his bulk. His skin is ridiculously over-detailed, as if the producers were afraid anything less would result in a plastic-y look. The result is that the Hulk looks like he's got the world's worst skin rash or something. Muscle striations are visible everywhere except the Hulk's eyeballs, and his overall size is just WAY overdone, like some homoerotic bodybuilder fantasy.Poor CGI also afflicts things like helicopters and other vehicles, which is puzzling considering people have been doing these things for years now.That leaves us with story, and unfortunately, the old ""the army wants to turn me into a weapon"" trope is getting really, really, really tired now. Some ingenuity might infuse fresh blood into this idea, but you won't find it here. The baddies are about as subtle as a fart in an elevator. One ends up wishing that the Cigarette Smoking Man from ""The X Files"" would show up to concoct some devious, shrewd plan to capture Bruce Banner. But no, we go full-out tanks-and-troops. And the less said about Blonsky, the better. It's all might and no brains. There are no surprises in this movie, only the assurance that you can see the next turn of the plot in this movie coming a mile away.Norton does a serviceable job as Banner, but you can tell that even he knows that this is a paint-by-numbers plot. Overall it's just old, tired and overblown. Adam West's Batman reached the same level of camp, except that the producers of that show did it intentionally and with gusto.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Jolly Green Giant Can Hold His Head Up with Pride This Time Around,"If you were hoping for a big-screen version of the Hulk that would clear the vomit taste from your mouth left by Ang Lee's debacle a few years ago, you're in luck. This new film that starts over with the Hulk's story is lean, mean and green, much like its titular troubled soul. That troubled soul, who exists under the geeky guise of Bruce Banner during his more laid back moments, is played by Edward Norton, and that's largely why this film is better. Superhero movies are a dime a dozen anymore, and they all, to a lesser or greater extent, look and sound the same. One of the only things that distinguishes one from the other is the quality of the acting, which is why this film can hold its head up with that other surprisingly good superhero film from earlier this summer, ""Iron Man"".Along with Norton, ""The Incredible Hulk"" features William Hurt, as the standard slightly crazy Army general that we all love to hate, Tim Roth, as the Hulk's nemesis, The Abomination, and Liv Tyler as Betty, the love interest. Tyler and Hurt get put through the usual acting paces their roles would suggest, which means Tyler must look worried and Hurt must glower, but they look worried and glower well, respectively. And the idiosyncratic casting of Roth as the film's villain actually lends the film a bit of novelty.By the end, the movie devolves into an action film indistinguishable from any other, all deafening sound effects and been-there-done-that CGI. But everything leading up to that is slightly better than average for the genre.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Much better than Ang Lee's ""Hulk""","Damning with faint praise or not, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is far superior to Ang Lee's 2003 effort ""Hulk"", if only for its opening hour. The film opens with one of the best opening credit sequences I've seen in a while, a hook that immediately grabs the viewer. Many of the following scenes are also superb, with director Louis Leterrier handling the early scenes superbly well, and the first appearance of the Hulk in this movie is among its best scenes. In general, Bruce Banner in South America is far more interesting than Bruce Banner back home.Back home Bruce Banner is chased, gets angry, turns into the Hulk, and destroys stuff. Oh, there's a poorly-handled and rushed love story as well. Liv Tyler is the most criticized aspect of this film in general but I found her performance effective. Then again, I'm one of the idiots who believes she should be in more major films. In general the acting here is superb all around with Norton being especially effective in the lead role, which he handles far better than Eric Bana did.""The Incredible Hulk"" stops being very interesting around when the film turns from an absorbing and entertaining science fiction film into a bunch of excuses for the big ol' green fellow to destroy things. At least that's how this film feels in its latter half, and instead of being entertained I'm watching a solid script deteriorate rapidly.Of course, ""The Incredible Hulk"" could turn out to be something of a comic book-to-film masterpiece when we get to see the original cut of the film that Leterrier and Norton wanted. From what we've seen thus far it is definitely clear that had this film gone the contemplative drama route it would have worked much better than Lee's ""Hulk"". Could the added minutes that we might get on DVD help this film reach its potential? I don't know. Until then, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a good summer flick worth watching but not much more.

Hulk's body looks more defined; I am not sure if they hit the spot with his face, but it's improved technique-wise.Overall it is not AS lengthy as the 2003 version, they improved some things.

An Honest Review,"It's darker than the Hulk and that works well. Darker as in literally darker, darker as in it is dark enough to hide a lot of the CGI that made The Hulk look fake and boring in the action.It also has a better cast. Anyone that has seen The Avengers is going to prefer Mark Ruffalo, because he nailed the part, but Edward Norton is leagues better than Eric Bana. So now you have a Bruce Banner that can actually add depth to the role, something that was seriously lacking in The Hulk.Liv Tyler as well is a breath of fresh air given that Jennifer Connolly seemingly needs the tightest of scrips to actually emote and Tyler can act even in the worst of films. For her playing a believable Betty was a lot better than Connolly's cardboard cut out.The approach was refreshing for a comic book movie. We've seen the Wayne's get killed over and over again, we've seen Uncle Ben die too often for his own good. We've seen the introductory stories told so often we can repeat them with our eyes closed.The Incredible Hulk assumes that we already know how things came to be and doesn't spend a life time retelling the same old story. It starts off assuming that the foundations are well in place in the minds of the audience and that allows the movie to come in on its own.We have more movie than rehash in the Incredible Hulk and that too adds to its charm.Still, you are ultimately going to get a lot of mindless carnage and that can be a bit...dull after a while.On the whole though, The Incredible Hulk succeeds where the Hulk failed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Incredible reboot overall improvement over the original!,"The Incredible Hulk (2008) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action superhero Film! This film is miles way better than The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2003 film Hulk! I take this movie over both Avengers films and 2003 Hulk! This movie right now is still to this day, the most underrated Marvel movie of all-time. The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film. Watching this, I was highly enjoyed, the movie was entertained, not bad at all, it was pretty good. Not boring, not to over long, I have enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is awesome Action superhero comic book flick that does the job right! I am not a big comic book reader fan, I have not read Hulk comic books, but I did have watch the original TV show The Incredible Hulk (1977 - 1982) as a child. Been the biggest fan of that show, I know that in the TV show that, there was a reporter Jack McGee who was chasing Hulk trough the state, in this film Jack McGee is mentioned but as a journalist reporter student.Edward Norton did a solid job as Bruce Banner, he was even more convincing than Eric Bana. A massive improvement from the last movie. Edward Norton gets the character right all the way through. Eric Bana was the worst choice for playing the most iconic character Bruce Banner. The original bored me to hell, I will never watch it again. But this one I will it is my favorite flick alongside Iron Man 1 & 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor: The Dark World and Thor. Liv Tyler did amazing job as Betty Ross, but I still love Jennifer Connelly to death, I have enjoyed watching her in the Original flick Hulk. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination is great and fantastic in this flick, he was the most awesome villain in this film, unlike original who had none villain in the movie except David Banner (Nick Nolte). This movie has a heart and Edward Norton is the best, but Billy Bixby will be the only David Banner around here not Nick Nolte or Paul Kersey!:P. Lou Ferrigno was respectfully in this movie who has play the ""Hulk"" in the 70's TV Show, I have mentioned before he was also in Hulk (2003) original he played the same Security Guard that he have played here. I remember the scene where Bruce comes dressed as a pizza deliver boy on the campus and brings security guard a pizza, that security guard on university campus is Lou Ferrigno! I have recognized him immediately. Lou Ferrigno even voices Hulk, his first words where after the original film ""Betty"" where changed too: ""leave me alone"" and ""Hulk smash!"" really great lines.Right after Iron Man (2008) was finished and released out, Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) made a cameo scene on the end of credits towards Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: (William Hurt). Director Louis Leterrier did a great solid job directing this fast paced action flick. He expressed interest in directing Iron Man but he couldn't because Jon Favreau was already MARVEL's first choice to direct the flick, but instead he was brought on board with writer Zak Penn who started to work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. And they both proved and did made a great solid job working together.Things I love about this film that work so great: The chemistry between Bruce (Edward Norton) and Betty (Liv Tylor) were great and amazing. The suspense, a c t i o n, drama, romance, comedy, special effects all perfectly blended to create this spectacular superhero flick. The hulk himself is portrayed as he should be. A rampaging monster with heart and a creature who is misunderstood. The fight scenes between Hulk and Abomination where really great, just like was in Iron Man movie, Hulk defeated Abomination but did not killed him, when Betty told him not too and she stopped him.The Incredible Hulk is the second feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series (the first being 2003's Hulk). Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner, who goes into hiding as he tries to find a way to reverse the mutation that causes him to become the green beast. This film was directed by Louis Leterrier and is part of ""Phase One"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. The rating I am giving to this movie is 9, it is great superhero flick!

a heart felt 3/10 for trying,"Back in 2003, filmmaker Ang Lee released ""Hulk,"" the hugely budgeted adaptation of the Marvel comic book series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Starring Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner and Jennifer Connelly as his true love Betty Ross, the film was considered a box- office disappointment and mainstream audiences complained that the picture was too slow, ponderous and heady for their liking. Having just watched 'The Incredible Hulk' and then re- watched ""Hulk"", the 2003 film now comes off as an astoundingly misunderstood achievement a complex, multilayered, visually extravagant, and ultimately quite moving operatic tragedy that transcends the norm of the genre. If all viewers really wanted was just a big, dumb, by- the-numbers action flick, then their wishes have been granted with ""The Incredible Hulk,"" a creatively dull reinvisioning that pretends ""Hulk"" never existed.Following an opening credit sequence explaining the backstory of how cellular biologist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) was involved in a genetic accident that left him with the unstoppable ability to transform into a nine-foot-tall, green-skinned superhuman whenever his heart rate and rage level were raised, the plot proper picks up five years later, with Bruce in hiding in Brazil. As the hulk, he was responsible for multiple deaths and mass destruction, and General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt)father of Bruce's now-estranged girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler)has made it his life's mission to find and destroy him. When Bruce's whereabouts are finally located, he once again must go on the run, secretly returning to the U.S. in the hopes that the data he has collected will be enough to reverse his infection. With a reunited Betty once again by his side, they head for New York City to visit a scientist who may be able to help them. Hot on their trail is not only General Ross, but also cutthroat British soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), himself now injected with a strain of the same dangerous serum.Because ""Hulk"" is only five years old, it is virtually impossible not to compare it to ""The Incredible Hulk,"" particularly since the unwise decision was made to start the series over from scratch. ""Hulk,"" as directed by Ang Lee, was rich in character work, narrative depth and a provocative subtlety that spoke louder than any words or explosions could have. At the same time, it was also gorgeous to look at, complete with comic book-inspired aesthetics and an overall sense of wonder and poeticism. ""The Incredible Hulk,"" helmed by Louis Leterrier (2005's ""Unleashed""), hasn't any of those characteristics. The film is grittier, to be sure, but it is also emotionally wooden and visually forgettable, a CGI-heavy grab for the attention of teenage boys that has no concern for finding an identity of its own.The screenplay by Zak Penn (2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"") is unimaginative and the story that is woven feels unnecessary, with little forward momentum taking place and none of the characters really growing any through the course of the running time. The special effects used to bring the Hulk to life are pretty good, and detail in body musculature and facial expressions are strong, but he really doesn't have much to do once the transformation occurs. The film lacks scope; the underwhelming action set-pieces have all been given away by the trailers and television ads, and they are all suffocating in their onslaught of CGI and dreary camera-work. The climactic battle on the streets of New York City between the Hulk and a now-monstrous Blonsky reminds of a poor-man's ""Cloverfield,"" especially ironic since ""Cloverfield"" was made for a fraction of the budget that ""The Incredible Hulk"" had at its disposal. Watching two giant creatures face off, both whom are one step away from being invincible, just isn't very interesting, and director Louis Leterrier is additionally unsuccessful in bringing a grandeur to the proceedings or a rooting interest in how things turn out. Like 2007's ""Transformers,"" it's just a lot of mindless chaos and freneticism lacking a heart or soul.Edward Norton (2006's ""The Illusionist"") is a committed and passionate actor well-equipped to tackle the role of Bruce Banner, but the finished product does him no favours. It has been extensively documented in the press that Norton was battling the studio for final cut of the moviehe apparently had edited a 135-minute version that he much preferred to the 113- minute cut being releasedand all evidence points to him being valid in his opinions. As it is now, the film is dumbed-down and deficient in personality. As love interest Betty Ross, Liv Tyler (2008's ""The Strangers"") shows a fiery flair in her reading of a character whose relationship with her father is strained and whose love for Bruce is the only thing to tame his out-of-control alter-ego. That Betty drops her current boyfriend (Ty Burrell) the second Bruce shows up without so much as a good-bye, however, seems awfully insensitive.""The Incredible Hulk"" has a few effective scenes, such as a touching one between Bruce and Betty in a cave and a very funny one that makes a succinct comment on New York City cab drivers. What is so disappointing about the film, though, is how much of a lesser experience it is than ""Hulk."" From its uninspired writing to its plodding character interplay to its stock action to its horribly cheesy ""Hulk Smash"" moment, the picture is mundane, predictable and empty. The title oversells the output. ""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't incredible at all. In fact, he's discouragingly ordinary.The only high point came right at the end where a cameo appearance from Tony Stark (Iron man) propositions general Ross in regards of putting a 'team' together. So I guess in the coming summers we'll be sure to have a ""Captain America"" and maybe a 'Thor' film building to an ""Avengers"" movie. It put a smile on my face until I realised just how disappointing ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" have been.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk and Tim Roth: Two reasons you should see this film.,"Well Marvel fans, it's time for the unofficial sequel to Ang Lee's HULK, and this time...it's a darker more menacing looking Hulk that is unleashed.The Hulk, and the awesome special FX that bring him to life have made the mean green machine as ripped, shredded, and jacked to the most ultimate degree. I'm pretty sure the FX guys created muscles to add onto the Hulk's already massive build.The beginning is actually the most solid part of the film, as the filmmakers do a very nice job of showing the lengths Dr. Banner has went to in order to steady his excitement factor. Though moving to Brazil  a country fraught with smoking hot babes  and working in a factory  with all sorts of dangerous equipment  might not be the best choice.Of course the sh!t hits the fan and Banner is forced to leave South America and head home. Once he arrives home, he meets up with the sexy Liv Tyler and plans to meet a fellow scientist who may be able to cure his affliction. But General Ross and Emil Blonsky have different ideas, and make it very difficult for Banner to do anything...without getting very, very irritated.The Abomination is revealed at the film's climax and the action that fills the film is monstrous to say the least. Big explosions, big punches, and big roars fill this movie! So why is it a little disappointing? The writing is not very good, the FX wane, dumb choices are made, and it seemed rushed at times.Why is it good? Very mean looking Hulk. He is truly a monster. And because of the Abomination, and Tim Roth. Roth will always play a great bad guy.So you see, this film is pretty damn good. But I thought the first was also pretty damn good (better as a comic book stylized film), so..see it for your self.ALSO: It has the best cameo of the year by ease. No not Stan Lee. None other than Rickson Gracie as Banner's Aikido teacher. Nuff' said!!!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Underrated, Edward is the GOAT","""The Incredible Hulk"" smashes onto the screen with Edward Norton embodying the green rage of Bruce Banner. The acting, particularly Norton's portrayal, adds layers to the tormented scientist on the run. The film editing captures the kinetic energy of Hulk's rampages while also delving into Banner's internal struggles. The strength lies in the film's ability to blend action-packed sequences with moments of introspection, showcasing the human side of the monstrous hero. However, the weakness may be found in the occasional pacing hiccups that interrupt the otherwise thrilling narrative. The music, though not as iconic as other superhero scores, complements the Hulk's destructive ballet. With a 7/10 rating, ""The Incredible Hulk"" stands as a green-hued chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, delivering smashing entertainment with a dash of soul-searching.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Feels like three films in one, and none of them get enough time to shine","""The Incredible Hulk"" starts strong - after a, admittedly, bizarrely edited opening credits sequence that is highly reminiscent of the frantic editing a la ""Saw,"" the movie begins almost as a political thriller, following Edward Norton's Bruce Banner as he is running from the U. S. government. It's an intriguing, exciting start, culminating in a parkour chase set piece that leads into our titular character making an appearance, all the while shrouded in shadow, as if we were watching a horror flick. And then, the tone shifts.2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" feels like three movies in one, each of them, while entertaining, never fully developed enough to be truly enthralling. After the tight-knit drama that the first 30 minutes developed, the film turns into more typical fare - the tone, which was deathly serious and dark in the beginning, is now more lighthearted, with off-putting jokes and character moments that just don't mesh with what was previously shown to us. The action, too, is more loud and bombastic, which is, granted, a welcome change of pace, as you'll be privy to Hulk in all of his destructive glory.In this film, Hulk is out for blood - as the military attempts their best effort in capturing Bruce, the Hulk is unleashed upon them, with all of his bloodlust present. He obliterates tanks and helicopters full of soldiers, attempts to slice people in half with car doors, kicks people so hard that their bones pulverize from the impact, and is just all-around a villainous killing machine, and it's highly entertaining. I thought this was a very unique take on a superhero film, where the line between hero and villain was blurred. That is, until, the tone shifts again, and Hulk becomes a clear-cut hero who fights a clear-cut villain.The last act of this film is incredibly action packed and exciting; it is also typical of what you'd expect from a superhero film. The movie, which did its best effort to subvert audience expectations regarding what they expect to see in a superhero movie, now turns into exactly what the audience would expect to see from a superhero movie. This is inherently bad, as the action is genuinely thrilling, and the special effects still look great to this day. However, it is jarring, especially since the movie did such a good job of avoiding the cliche.""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't a bad film - it's actually pretty fun, if you can get over the fact that you're most likely watching multiple people's visions compiled into one film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better movie than it is given credit for,"This is the only movie from MCU, which I haven´t seen before. (I am currently having a post-phase3 MCU marathon). I always brushed it away because of the change of Norton to Ruffalo in the long run and because i heard that this was not a good movie overall. But I must admit that this movie is such a breath of fresh air after the typical superhero movie: the nearly horroristic setting of our protagonist hiding something very dangerous, raging against the clock to save himself, then returning to the place of his previous peaceful life. It is a shame that the MCU went for a more formulaic approach while designing their universe, it would be quite refreshing to see more bold and strange approaches to the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An step up from the original,"Watched Hulk (2003) and thought it was good. I grew up through the late 2000s hearing much more about The Incredible Hulk (2008) and seeing it as a major step up from the original. Many people knew Edward Norton from Fight Club (1999) at the time this movie came out. This time, he plays Bruce Banner and his performance is excellent! I'm not really a big superhero fan and the only superhero movie I really obsessed over was the first Iron Man movie back in 2008. Used to watched it on iPod Touch. Iron Man (2008) was a huge success and is considered the greatest superhero film of all time and it surpasses every other Marvel movie. The Incredible Hulk is the second movie to be released in the MCU and the second film of Phase One. It's not as great as Iron Man (2008), but it's still a very good movie and I think you will enjoy it if you're planning on watching Marvel superhero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Incredible Hulk"": FAR better than ""Hulk""","When I first saw 2003's ""Hulk"", and the travesty that was the Hulk using his incredible rage and power against... poodles...

I will admit, there were a few slow and ridiculous parts, but I heavily enjoyed this movie.

Incredibly Embarrassing,"The Incredible Hulk is the black mark in the MCU that we don't like, but I'm going to.This film reaches new levels of terrible. The CGI is abysmal and the acting is at best awkward and at worst blatantly robotic. And I know this movie is 12 years old and that CGI has come a long way since then, but Iron Man puts this movie to shame. And The Incredible Hulk had a bigger budget.The amount of action in this movie is overwhelming. Like I criticised Iron Man for not having enough, but The Incredible Hulk goes too far the other way with action scenes lasting far too long and occurring far to frequently. Furthermore, I thought the lighting made it hard to see what was going on and the staging of the scenes was over massive areas that we couldn't actually tell what was happening.And finally, I cannot fathom why the ""villain"" was designed to look so similar to Hulk. I found myself having to struggle to work out who was punching whom and who was dragging whom.The Incredible Hulk is about two hours too long and I hate it purely for it being the reason we haven't got a Hulk movie since.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Movie,Great film 100% better than the first one thank you Louis Leterrier and Zak Penn. I won't give anything away but the acting was great Edward Norton plays Bruce banner very well and Liv Tyler is hot. In parts it was a little over the top but you have to expect this with this type of film. I would recommend anyone to go and see it even if you was not keen on the first Hulk film as you will be surprised. I always thought the incredible hulk was David Banner until I googled it and found David was the guy from TV series and Bruce is the one from out of the comics. I wonder why the TV series did not just call him Bruce. Go and see it you won't be disappointed,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk smash!,"I really enjoyed this movie. This is the version of the Incredible Hulk that I wish they had kept throughout the MCU. That's not a slight on Mark Ruffalo, his version of the Hulk is good and more ""fun"", but when you compare the two, CGI quality aside, this version of the Hulk is meaner, stronger and looks more like a monster. The story is pretty straight forward and basic and the pacing is a bit slow as they explore character relationships but the action sequences are well done and you really do get a sense of the Hulks strength. There's also a little bit of humour, but it's subtle like when Bruce explains to Betty that he needs to remain calm at all times and then the very next scene they are taking a New York cab across town and his heart starts beating uncontrollably as they weave in and out of traffic. It's kind of funny to think that Banner could turn into the Hulk because of a taxi ride when usually it's from being beaten up or seeing his friends hurt! I also wish the MCU would revisit some of the plots established in this film because there is clearly a scene setting up the emergence of one of Hulk's greatest foes, The Leader, but it's never been mentioned again in other films that I'm aware of... Edward Norton played the role of Bruce Banner well I thought but the standout in this film for me was William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross. He did a fantastic job and no wonder he stayed on to continue portraying the character in the MCU. My favourite scene was the end fight between Abomination and Hulk, the actual end of the fight itself was a little bit of a let down but the lead up to it and the back and forward feats of strength were fun to watch.It's not the greatest film in the MCU but it's much better than some critic reviews lead you to believe. It doesn't really play too much of a role in the MCU anymore as you can easily bypass it and still understand and enjoy every other film in the franchise. In saying that, I reccomend this film to all superhero or comic book fans as it's a great interpretation of the Incredible Hulk with some decent action.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pale shadow of Ange Lee's infinitely superior version.,"Ang Lee's version had the nuances of a classic Greek tragedy. And, in the end, that's what superheroes are: they're the modern day equivalent of the Greek and Norse Gods of ancient times. We don't love Superman just because he can fly and lift heavy things. We love him because he is a symbol of the best in humankind, and yet also suffers from the same doubts, fears and unrequited love that plague us mere mortals. Superheroes are supposed to be fun, yes. But it does not have to be ""turn off your brain"" fun. But, then . . . ""turn off your brain"" fun has its place. While being painfully aware of its cheesy weaknesses, I had a great deal of fun with ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", and even confess a great fondness for Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"". But that's just it: The Incredible Hulk, as directed by Louis Letterier, was not that much fun.The new film is not a ""Batman Begins""-style reboot as was long rumored. No, it's actually more akin in many ways to ""Batman Forever"" (though Letterier does use the opening credits to set up a slightly different version of the origin story than we saw in the previous film). We open with Bruce Banner (now played by Edward Norton) on the run from the government, who wants to use his alter ego, the Hulk, as a weapon. The government forces are lead by hard as nails, blood and guts, shoot first and later, cigar-eating General William ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, played by . . . William Hurt? Seriously? WILLIAM FREAKING HURT. The ultimate stuffed shirt. The man who put the ""ass"" in ""pomp-ass"" (we know it's not spelled or pronounced that way, but in Hurt's case, it should be). As a piece of casting, this is akin to watching Kelsey Grammar portray a rodeo cowboy. It just doesn't work. In Hurt's defense, he does provide the film with its greatest moments of tension: we wait with baited breath to see if his mustache is going to fall off. But the smug self-satisfaction he seems to be taking in his own overracting makes his performance unbearable. And it doesn't help that most of his scenes are with Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, a soldier with Captain Ahab-like obsession with defeating the Hulk, but an annoying tendency to slouch and shuffle like a 1920's Jazz musician with his shoes on the wrong feet when he walks. Roth, after his Academy Award nominated turn in the underrated Rob Roy, underwent some sort of bizarre religious conversion and gave up his talent for lent. Hurt and Roth are engaged in a titanic struggle to see who can chew the scenery more egregiously. No one wins, but the audience certainly loses.Banner, desperately seeking a cure for his condition, is lead back to his lost love, General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Norton and Tyler have an easy, breezy charisma that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly may have lacked in those roles, but do not approach the same level of depth. And, besides, far too little of the film focuses on them. This is one of those comic book films that seems more interested in the villains than the heroes, but we're not talking Jack Nicholson as the Joker here. We're not even talking Scott Paulin as the Red Skull. We're talking WILLIAM *^@$# HURT AS . . . sorry. That was just a piece of casting that really didn't work for me.But the bottom line is, after two-time Academy Award Winner Lee's cerebral human drama failed to connect with mass audiences, the goal here was not to delve deeply into the characters, but instead to provide a series of exciting action set pieces. The was supposed to be the ""hulk Smash"" version, and I went in embracing that and prepared to enjoy it on its own merits. After all, I've been arguing since 2003 that Universal Pictures and Marvel Studios were foolish to jump to the conclusion that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made Ang Lee an action director. That film featured eye-popping fight scenes, but in its heart and soul wasn't that far removed from Lee's previous Oscar-nominee Sense and Sensibility.But Letterier's direction makes one yearn for the steady hand of Brett Ratner or Mark Steven Johnson. It was as if Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay chose to band together and combine weaknesses. And darn it if Ang Lee didn't give us much better action sequences. Truth be told, while there may be more action senes in this film, in terms of quality, they don't even come close.This is not a film that is likely to make anyone desperate to have two hours of their lives back. It's not terrible. It's just . . . really not very good.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk??,"This movie bucks me in the most irritating way. I love Hulk, but this movie really is irrelevant if you think about the bigger picture.

A Downplayed Gem In The Early MCU,"Because Mark Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton as Bruce Banner in all subsequent Marvel Cinematic Universe films, 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" has become a retconned sophomore feature in the epic superhero franchise. Other than William Hurt's General Ross, Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark and Martin Starr's then-unnamed Mr. Hammond (the latter two receiving nothing more than cameos), none of the cast has returned to the MCU, and despite ending on a couple cliffhangers, this movie never received any proper follow-up.All this is a real shame, for it is a solid movie.""The Incredible Hulk"" is not a sequel to Ang Lee's divisive 2003 ""Hulk,"" but strangely, it picks up right where the previous film left off. After watching a title sequence depicting Banner's origin story - how the brilliant scientist underwent a gamma experiment gone wrong to become the Hulk - we find the protagonist living in Brazil, hiding out from the United States government while learning to control his powers.When a drop of Banner's blood makes it back to America, though, alarms sound and General Ross deploys military force to abduct Banner from a Rio De Janeiro favela. Banner manages to escape only once his temper gets the best of him, and his green alter ego comes out to wreak violent havoc. From there, he travels back to America, where he reunites with his former lab partner/love interest, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)- who is also the general's daughter - and they continue outrunning the law while seeking a cure to Banner's condition.Essentially, it is everything that a Hulk movie should be. There is high action, wonderful special effects, and lots of smashing. Banner only becomes the Hulk thrice in the movie, but each occasion delivers immensely. There's also the Abomination (Eli Roth), a soldier that the government tries turning into their own Hulk for military purposes. Through him, we finally see a Hulk villain hit the silver screen and in the film's climax, we witness the two green monsters duke it out over Harlem.Some might call the on-screen destruction gratuitous, but I hardly believe there is a different way to make an effective Hulk movie. Obviously, a few buildings are going to turn to rubble.Meanwhile, in between the action sequences, Banner and Ross have necessary conversations about how it feels to be the Hulk. These dialgues satisfy our curiosities, but they also help us understand Banner on a deeper level. Unlike most superheroes, Banner is burdened with powers that he cannot control. ""The Incredible Hulk"" thus does a good job depicting Hulk as a disease that its poor host just wants to control.Overall, the movie doesn't feel quite like a Marvel movie. Released just a month after ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" came out before Disney bought the franchise in 2009. Therefore, it doesn't have as much of a cartoonish aesthetic and makes no reference to the universe's more fantastical elements. It's a grounded superhero film, playing out like a Jason Bourne movie with a dash of sci-fi rather than something occupying the same canvas as Thanos and Thor.Marvel fanboys might not appreciate ""The Incredible Hulk"" for lacking direct continuity with the rest of the series, but if they can look past that, they will find a very strong standalone Hulk movie. While director Louis Leterrier is not the auteur that Ang Lee is, he seems more suited for creating a comic book movie. Likewise, I prefer Norton's Banner to Eric Bana's.I don't know if Norton would have jived with the rest of the MCU. Mark Ruffalo is great at deflecting quips and adding a dose of normality to the Avengers motley team. Norton's energy, by contrast, is a bit more intense.Nevertheless, I do wish that ""The Incredible Hulk"" received a sequel. Hulk is one of the most widely known (and fun to watch) characters under the Marvel umbrella, and I'd like to see more of his independent stories brought to life.To call this movie incredible is a bit of an overstatement. But it is definitely underrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

My initial reaction to it was, really that's it? 11 years later I am now 21 and I have seen every Marvel movie besides a select few. I recently just bought MCU Phase 1. I decided to give The Incredible Hulk another chance, while I still see some negative points to the movie. its not even that its a bad movie its just that compared to the other marvel movies it doesn't compete on the same level. For one and probably the biggest thing anyone will point out is that ""Bruce Banner"" in this one is not the same Bruce Banner in The Avengers.The Incredible Hulk does have a huge backstory and origin for this hero this character, but how can they explain the fact that two to three years later when The first Avengers movie came out why is there a new actor as ""Bruce Banner.""The second time watching this definitely opened my eyes to the fact that overall this is still an amazing movie just not to the standard of the other Marvel movies that I have a huge love for.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You're making me sleepy... You wouldn't like me when I'm sleepy!,"HULK SMASH! Yes, the Incredible Hulk does utter those lines in this newer, updated version of the comic-book superhero movie. He does the Thunder Clap, uses two halves of a squad car as boxing gloves and does not fly for miles. The studio has spent a lot of money, hired an A-list star cast, got a famous director and even distanced itself from Ang Lee's critically-panned outing five years ago. Edward Norton re-wrote the script and Marvel has made sure the movie is littered with direct references from the Hulk comics and the Marvel universe that fan-boys will geek over. Yet, this movie misses the target quite spectacularly. It suffers from the same problem that X3 did  the movie just does not come together due to extremely poor execution and hence seems mediocre at best.The movie starts with Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) hiding away in a Brazilian town doing small jobs while researching for a cure. In the next tedious 100 minutes, we see Banner/Hulk returning to USA, fighting the US army, reuniting with Betty Ross, and facing & triumphing over arch-nemesis (a grayish, spiny, talkative Abomination).Now you hardly expect Ed Norton to go wrong, especially when he's writing as well, but this has to be the vainest attempt by the actor yet. Bruce Banner's portrayal fails because his green monster brings never brings any sense of threat to his scientist. We see him suffer without clothes, money and shelter but we never really see him suffer under the weight of guilt or responsibility for the force of destruction within him. This not only makes the Hulk that less effective, but his oft-repeated roar and mayhem seems superficial. A bimbo Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and reluctant semi-pacifist Gen. T Ross (William Hurt) don't help matters much. Tim Roth (pre-mutation) comes as a huge saving grace though. His Russian-born, British-schooled operative Emil Blonsky may just be the one of the best supervillain characters yet. Without much of a backstory, and with absolutely no insight into his psyche, he still makes the vile and single-minded Blonsky a formidable opponent  one that I cheered for! Yet, the bad CGI and campy dialogues bring any momentary expectations crashing down. (It has one of *the* worst dialogues this year: ""You're making me hungry you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry""!!) It comes as no surprise though that the deathmatch finale is all mind-pollution. The numerous plot-holes and the unforgivable sin of using Hulk for comic relief just plunges the standards of this movie lower.One thing though  with Ironman and now with Incredible Hulk, Marvel studios has hit the perfect formula to close these movies. Even if the movie is bitter or bland, you finish with a touch of excitement.My rating --> 2 of 5 p.s.: The movie can't help but make references to Ang Lee's movie through out its running  the starting notes of the theme music, the opening scene, the dialogues (""he has managed to stay unseen for five years"", HULK released in 2003). IMHO, I think it is about time the world revisited HULK, and give it its due.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not a brilliant film but a big enjoyable blockbuster without any pretensions to greatness,"Dr David Banner is hiding out in Brazil having fled the military unit led by General Ross who wish to study his genetic mutation and utilise it to create a race of super soldiers. Banner continues his studies into a possible cure for his condition with the discrete help of the mysterious scientist Mr Blue. A slip up in the bottling plant that Banner works alerts Ross to his presence and in goes a small unit led by Major Blonsky to tranquilise him and take him into custody. However when Blonsky and his men trap Banner in the plant, Banner's pulse races and soon Blonsky learns firsthand why Banner is such an important asset to Ross.The Incredible Hulk was sold as more of a blockbuster experience than the Ang Lee film was and from the very start this approach is laid out in the rapid back story in the credits. This continues across the whole film with some good sequences, comic book references for the fans and plenty of impressive special effects. What that does for you will depend on you but for my money it produced a solid summer blockbuster which is much like Iron Man in construction  ie it doesn't pretend to have ""substance"" or complexity in the way the Batman franchise reboot does. Instead it is all about the basic blocks that make up the film and delivering those in a way that is fun without being too demanding or too complex. Hulk delivers on this and has plenty of good action that are greatly helped by the effects being very good indeed, with the decisions made about the look and size of the Hulk working to stop it being silly. Without a doubt it is a ""money up there on the screen"" sort of affair.Having said that though, essentially this does mean that the film comes down to big computer effects hitting one another with New York City taking its traditional summer-time pasting and it did make me wonder about Norton's involvement. I respect him a lot as an actor and his scenes do appear to suggest that he sees more in the material than comes across on the screen. As it is he must have spent more of his time doing motion capture than doing on-screen acting and while his presence suggests that he has ideas of depth, nothing worthy of him is forthcoming. The opposite is true of Tyler, who is perfect for this material-light film but is not still that impressive. Roth was a strange bit of casting but he works in his character and is convincing in his transformation. Hurt and Nelson are both good additions who I assume more will come from. The cameos are not too obtrusive (although why can't Stan Lee do more of background cameo) and it is really hard for me to fault a film that gives a bit of time for Williams  who even in ""normal"" clothes as he was here will always be Omar from The Wire.The Incredible Hulk is not a particularly dark or interesting film but, like Iron Man it is a fun and energetic comic-book film with good effects, good action and a general sense of good humour running through it. It won't blow you away outside of the realms of being a summer blockbuster but for what it does it is a perfectly enjoyable film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's all the Hulk should be.,"Not the best movie ever made, but it doesn't disappoint.The performances are all quite good, Tim Roth's in particular. Though his character isn't overly deep, his acting certainly makes him interesting. Norton's portrayal is pretty monotonous and boring, but considering the character he's playing is a scientist that's trying to keep himself from getting excited, it works.The fight scenes are well done, and really the best part of the movie. Why else were you going to see a Hulk movie anyway? A slo-mo running scene (which you see in the commercials) seems a bit cheesy, but it's not overdone so I can look past it.The CGI... could have been better. But this is a movie where the main character is CG, he has a lot of screen time, therefore you have a lot of time to examine him, and any CG will be clearly fake after that much examination. He's a big green monster, I don't expect him to look real anyway.Overall, pretty good. The story of the Hulk isn't a great one in my opinion, and they've done about the best they could with it. It would work for someone coming in fresh, but has plenty of geeky tidbits for the nerds like me.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A pointless movie that can't figure out its own plot.,"This was an excruciating ""reboot"" of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which was a far superior movie in my opinion. Had I known that the writer of ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Last Action Hero"" was responsible for this, I wouldn't have watched. This story really doesn't bother with the comic book Hulk, and mostly just takes from the TV show. The one nod to the comic book is the return of the Betty and General Ross characters (which could just as easily been lifted from the last movie, without referring to the comics at all). However, this Betty is pretty ineffectual as a character and the General is nothing more than a dimwitted antagonist. The General's brainless plan involves capturing the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, and returning him to the military for study. His reason is that Banner's blood is the result of the army's experiments to create a ""super soldier"". However, we find out in the first act that the army already has the serum for this super soldier and injects it into the Generals lackey, in order to better conquer the Hulk. So why are they trying to capture Banner then, instead of just shooting him in the head? Later, the General finds another doctor that's been helping Banner, and has a storehouse of his blood. So they have everything that they need and decide to just leave it in a lab with no more than one army official and a Royal British special ops grunt. This has got to be the stupidest general in the U.S. Army. I would love to see the report that he sends to his superiors in Washington after all of the unnecessary carnage that has occurred under his watch. These are just some of the major flaws with the poor writing and execution in this movie. A big laugh happens when the British Marine has a few scenes wearing U.S. Army officer attire, complete with U.S. badges and medals on his lapel. If you want to watch a really ambitious super hero film, complete with character study and depth, watch Ang Lee's version. If you want to watch a CGI demo reel that's not really better than Ang Lee's version, have fun with this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good,"""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) represents a significant shift in tone and approach for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it may not be as celebrated as some of its contemporaries, it effectively reinvigorates the Hulk mythos for a modern audience.The film's strengths lie in its grounded approach and focus on Bruce Banner's internal struggle. Edward Norton delivers a nuanced and compelling performance, capturing the character's constant anxiety and desperate search for control. The film explores the psychological impact of Banner's condition, portraying him as a man on the run, constantly one misstep away from unleashing the monstrous Hulk.The action sequences are well-executed, featuring impressive CGI and a sense of scale that befits the Hulk's raw power. The climactic battle between the Hulk and Abomination is a visual spectacle, showcasing the sheer destructive force of these titans.However, the film is not without its flaws. The supporting characters, while serviceable, lack the depth and charisma of those in other early MCU films. The plot, while functional, feels somewhat generic at times, relying on familiar tropes of government conspiracies and military pursuits.Despite these minor shortcomings, ""The Incredible Hulk"" remains a solid entry in the MCU. It successfully establishes the Hulk as a formidable force within the shared universe, laying the groundwork for his future appearances. While it may not be the most groundbreaking or innovative film in the franchise, it effectively blends action, drama, and character development to deliver an entertaining and engaging superhero experience.In conclusion, ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) is a solid entry in the MCU that effectively reinvigorates the Hulk mythos. While it may not reach the heights of some of its contemporaries, the film's grounded approach, strong performances, and impressive action sequences make it an enjoyable and worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Incredible Hulk...Incredibly Bad!!,"I'm sorry to write a negative comment on a film which cost 130 million to make... I went into the cinema with an open mind as I'm definitely no Hulk fan, my son of 15 wanted to see this movie. When the film finished I had the feeling of being let down, the CGI of the Hulk is like looking at a CGI character, I never had the feeling that the Hulk was real in a movie sense, the Abomination was far better as a visual image, the Hulk doesn't even have the slightest resemblance to Edward Nortons facual characteristics. The special effects and camera work was sometimes extraordinary, but this was not maintained. I was very disappointed with the look of the Hulk, Edward Norton was fine as Banner, as he is in most films... I wonder what motivated him to take this role? obviously the money, but what about his reputation as a serious actor who takes roles that demand great talent. This film didn't ring my bells at all... Iron Man is a great film and with Robert Downey jn in the title role brought depth and emotion to the character which I didn't feel with Norton. Sorry to be so negative...",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of my favorite superhero movies.,"Wow, this was so much better than Ang Lee's 'Hulk' from 2003! 'The Incredible Hulk' is among my favorite superhero/comic book movies.I enjoy this movie for so many reasons. Firstly, the casting. Edward Norton is excellent as Hulk. He brings a sense of realism to the fantasy character, that was absent from 2003's 'Hulk'. The script is also really good, with well set-up characters I cared about. The visual effects are also incredible. I mean, damn, they're stunning!'The Incredible Hulk' is action-packed and entertaining from beginning to end. The film also has emotional depth, making me root for the Bruce Banner/Hulk all the way. The love interest between Hulk and Betty (Liv Tyler) at times reminded me a bit of King Kong and his love for a woman. Tim Roth makes a credible villain, as Emil Blonsky, who becomes a creature himself, Abomination.The editing is good and the film is well-paced. There's a really exciting finale with mayhem galore! I love this film. This seriously is a lot of fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Incredible Ed,"Edward Norton has always been my favorite actor, and here is one of the reason why: he can take crap and make it look good. Case in point: The Incredible Hulk. After the 2003 Ang Lee disaster, Norton stars and writes this superhero epic, which is just as good as its companion Iron Man, which I also loved. Norton makes us care about the Bruce Banner character. We actually want him to find a cure for his ""illness"" and not just break out into a Hulk fit at any random time.Instead of boring us with a dull backstory like Eric Bana's Hulk did, director Louis Lerterier (The Transporter) opts to show us the backstory in an opening montage during the credits. That way, we get right to the action. Bruce Banner (Norton) is living in Brazil, seeking a cure for his ""incident"". However, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who want to use Banner's substances to create ""supersoldiers"". Eventually, Blonsky takes some of the supersoldier serum and becomes like Banner, only evil. Banner teams up with girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) to find a cure for his rage.In addition to Norton, it was nice to see Tim Roth finally get a starring role in a film not directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tyler portrays Betty well, and she and Norton have good chemistry on screen. Hurt's Ross was a huge improvement over Sam Elliot's, and Nelson is a fun character who comes off likable.Fans will love the cameos in this film as well. Tony Stark, aka The Invincible Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) shows up at the end, and Lou Ferrigno makes a cameo. But the real star is Norton and his big bad green self. A Perfect 10, and I cannot wait for The Avengers Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Has not aged well at all.,"I have more fond memories of watching this film as a kid than rewatching it after so long.It is perhaps the most skippable MCU film out of them all, in terms of how dissimilar it feels compared to other MCU entries. It plays closer to the early 2000's Fox Marvel films, and not in the good ways. The story is boring and drawn out, with a few interesting details throughout but overall really forgettable.I'm not a fan of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, as I prefer Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers (2012) more, even though after that film Hulk gets completely forgotten about for the most part. This is a mostly forgettable film with a few interesting set pieces that hold it together such as the action scene in the middle of the film and the final one between Abomination and the Hulk.All the CGI has aged very poorly and looks like something out of a 2005 cinematic video-game trailer.

a definite upgrade over the initial installment,"Research scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has the weight of the world on his shoulders; a genetics experiment gone haywire could potentially turn him into a monster if he loses his temper, thus making him the target of a relentless U.S. government. Living in isolation in South America, Banner seeks out a cure for his unstable condition, but in order to complete his research he must return to the States and seek out his long lost love (Tyler) with her bloodhound Army general of a father (Hurt) in tow. Reimagining of Ang Lee's 2003 Marvel Comics adaptation succeeds by avoiding needlessly convoluted story tangents, instead relying on a more straightforward approach with plenty of destructive action scenes, superior special effects, and characters who make sense. It wouldn't be as effective without the work of an excellent cast, with Norton perfectly vulnerable as Banner, Tyler warm and empathetic as Betty, Roth chilling and tenacious as Bronsky, Hurt callous and cold-blooded as General Ross. Climax is a bit noisy, but it's still solid entertainment. ***",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Marvel finally cares about it's product...,"After few dreadful movies based on Marvel comics, I went to this movie with low expectations, but I was wrong.

He never disappoints me as an actor, and this was no exception. Tim Roth was awesome as always and climax fight between Hulk and Abomination was fantastic. Great CGI and action sequences which last for about 20 minutes were more then enough for me... Ending was also well done and ""opens the gate"" for many more elements from the comics. I wonder what we will get in the sequel.It seems that Marvel finally understood that their movies were terrible, so decided to take more serious approach to their movies since IRON MAN was also great (in my opinion better then Hulk) and this gives me hope that upcoming movies will be also great, and possibly we will get more serious reboot of some other awesome heroes like Daredevil, Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four (which was entertaining, but bad.

"Better than the first, much better","This far more action packed and stylized film reboot is more angry and action packed than the cerebral and slower 2003's Ang Lee directed Hulk( which I prefer over this one.) The Incredible Hulk is very fast paced and hurtles trough it's story at lighting fast speed ( which doesn't hinder the film at all.) the pace makes it easier and harder to follow, what makes it hard is the fact that it just doesn't take it's time to explain allot of the minor details and explore the story more.On the flip what makes it easier is that it's complete fun form beginning to end and has a likable and well know actor at the helm as the main character, namely Edward Norton. Who did an exceptional job as Bruce Banner, Norton had the right mannerisms that Dr. Banner had in the comic. He put the his obsession with getting rid of the Hulk, he put his strong love for Betty Ross and his hatred for General Ross in there too.But here was one thing they didn't put much effort into Norton's Banner, his genius. This reboot focused more on the action then the story of it all, but hat doesn't mean this was a bad film, no in fact this was a well made and well acted comic book film. Louis Leterier directs an exceptional cast to a whole new level of action and style in the incredible Hulk. This reboot should not be looked down on it's great fun and very well done,albeit it's got more of the 80's series in then the comic's, but still nothing to frown upon.

Better than the Ruffalo Banner/Hulk,"This will be a massive unpopular opinion but here goes...There are so really good scenes in this movie and you really get the sense that Banner doesn't want to be the hulk (which he doesn't) the stuff where he's living on the streets, feeling lonely gives it more character depth like the bill bixby tv series which is done well. The man is in turmoil and you feel that unlike the Disney Ruffalo version which has no depth at all.The CGI hasn't held up on the hulk but at least it's the closet to the savage hulk we have seen. This hulk would have ripped Thanos arm off and beat him with it. The hulk we all wanted to see in Endgame.Ultimately it's not great in places but you got the overall feeling of a man suffering and a hulk that was actually enraged rather than mildly ticked off.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"This Hulk not exactly Incredible, but decent","Marvel isn't one to let lackluster box-office and mixed reviews keep a good superhero franchise down. In the case of the the Hulk, one of their flagship characters, Ang Lee's 2003 film proved to not be the potent blockbuster they were after, so, five years later, Marvel has rebooted the character with The Incredible Hulk, featuring none of the cast or creative principals of the previous entry. So, what is the verdict of this do-over: a decent entry, featuring more action than the previous film, but not quite as deep in regards to character development.The Incredible Hulk opens with a title sequence that wipes the memories of the first film completely away, re-establishing the origin story, albeit in a more compressed form. The film proper then opens in Brazil, where Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding from the government agents that are attempting to locate him. Bruce, it seems, has used himself as a guinea pig for a super-soldier serum, which, when his heart rate goes too high, leads to him transforming into a not-so-jolly green giant. While dodging the head of the super solider project, General Ross (William Hurt), Bruce is attempting to cure himself, with help from an unseen ally he communicates with over computer named Mr. Blue.After an accident at a soda bottling factory leads Ross to him, Bruce goes on the run, returning to the US and seeking out his lost love Betty (Liv Tyler), while being tracked by Ross's chief lieutenant, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), who has volunteered to also take some of the super soldier serum to attempt to beat the Hulk at his own game, but quickly becomes addicted to the serum, and leads to him seeking more and more, with possibly disastrous results.One thing was certain with this version of the Hulk, and that was that action, lacking in the first film, was to be more of a priority, and, for the most part, The Incredible Hulk delivers. There are no less than three major action sequences in the film, and each is reasonably well done, delivering decent thrills and energy. The Hulk, once again computer generated, is sufficiently convincing, a bit beefier and more muscular than the 2003 version.While the action has been ratcheted up, the attention to character detail has been scaled back a degree or so. The romance is there between Bruce and Betty in the script, but their chemistry is mostly dead. The friction between her and her father also rings a bit hollow, and the face off between Bruce and Blonsky is almost exclusively physical, with no deeper level to it. While those searching for more fisticuffs will be pleased, anyone interested in greater depth to the proceedings will find The Incredible Hulk a bit lacking.The Incredible Hulk boasts a strong cast, but they are used with mixed results. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana, but there is no real shift in quality. Norton delivers a good performance, but nothing exceptional. Liv Tyler is a step down from Jennifer Connolly's turn in the first film, not tremendously convincing as Betty. William Hurt doesn't give the best of performances as General Ross either, over the top in the wrong kind of way. Tim Roth gives another effective villainous turn as Emil Blonsky.The Incredible Hulk proves to be a good comic book film, but not pushing the envelope at all. Marvel has proved that they can turn a lackluster showing of a character around by starting over, but it remains to be seen if this incarnation of the Hulk will be back for a second round. If you are looking for some well-done comic book action and decent special effects, then The Incredible Hulk will deliver the goods. If you want a film that stretches the boundaries of the the comic book film, then look to Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A dull green hue,"The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rebooted Hulk that pretends the 2003 version directed by Ang Lee never happened. One of the virtues of this attempt is that it doesn't spend much time on Hulk's origin story, mostly dispensing with it in the opening credits montage. I think this is the filmmakers at least acknowledging that, yes, we all saw this story a few years prior and we really don't need much detail. Another virtue is Tim Roth, whose rat-like Emil Blonsky injects some much needed verve into the proceedings, as does Tim Blake Nelson in the smaller role of Samuel Sterns. The rest of the cast is saddled with playing one note each in one-dimensional roles. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler seem like they would be more convincing as a pair of siblings than as former lovers. Neither are quite as somber or severe as Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were in the same roles, but neither really manage to make Bruce Banner or Betty Ross terribly memorable. (We get a brief shout-out to Bill Bixby in the form of a television clip from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"" but that just brought home the sad fact that we haven't had a finer Bruce Banner than Bixby in the 1970's Hulk TV show. Sorry, Mark Ruffalo, thanks for trying.) It seems that most of whatever creative energy was spent here went into rendering a convincing Hulk who can convincingly smash stuff and interact with human characters, and on that score the film succeeds. If only the human characters were more interesting, we might have something here. This isn't the worst film in the MCU (the worst, to date, would come next), but it is the most boring.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Just when you thought superhero movies could be a little more than a string of clichés wrapped around tons of shattered CGI glass and rock, comes the new Hulk....","THE INCREDIBLE HULK on the other hand takes a hamfisted James Bond route. It somehow creates a sprawling adventure mess that takes us through a tired string of horribly cliché scenes from a Brazilian favela all the way to Broadway. As a result the only way this revamped HULK can sustain our interest is by staging bigger, louder and more CGI laden action scenes - by the time the Broadway showdown was in full swing I simply couldn't care less. As if the stock characters and stock dialogue weren't enough (we even get the stock zany NYC cab driver, a NYC establishing shot all by himself - where have I seen that before?!!), we have to further suffer through Liv Tyler's idea of acting - her mere presence on screen instantly makes a scene bland. In fact I wager that you could intercut a shot of Liv Tyler within every classic scene in the history of cinema and those scenes would be ruined beyond all recognition. Any attempts at humour or romance fall flat on their face, she has NO chemistry whatsoever with Ed Norton who in turn is in full paycheck mode. HULK is everything the superhero movies I saw as a kid were - exercises in shattered glass, broken walls and loud explosions. Beyond that the void.

"Entertaining, but not up to Marvel's new standard","It is undeniable that Marvel has been on a winning roll lately since it has become it's own independent studio. They have started from scratch to make their films more enjoyable to all audiences. With Ironman, the proof is in the pudding and most can agree that the movie was pure fun and a great film to boot.With our boy Hulk, I think Marvel missed the mark a bit, but luckily when Marvel misses, its not such a bad thing. The movie was entertaining and had my eyes glued to the screen during the sneak peak. The effects were dazzling, only looking cartoonish for a couple scenes. The Hulk is more human than in the Ang Lee version and it adds a nice element to the movie. Unfortunately, I could not get past Liv Tyler's horrible exchanges with Ed Norton and William Hurt. It was like watching a 7 year old pitch to Babe Ruth. She just can't at, and as an integral part of the movie, it strained me (and viewers around me). The saving grace is that mot people aren't going to see this movie for the acting, but Ironman set a new standard for acting(though Spider-Man has good acting) in recent comic book movies and Batman has followed the trend too. The dialogue was border line ridiculous, and the one liners that worked so well in Ironman did not in Hulk.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and it was an excellent summer popcorn flick, but as I said earlier, These newer comic films all feature more serious tones and more serious acting from more serious actors. No more Alicia Silverstone and George Clooney as our heroes, so why should we settle for Liv Tyler. Liv has roles that make her shine, this was not one of them. Norton and Hurt shine in every way they can, but the script was weak.See this movie, it will blow you away stylistically, but even the less nit-picky people will laugh at the bad lines.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Liv Tyler Disappointing,"The movie was good... the action was ""Incredible"", but I swear if I hadn't been there with friends I would have walked out. Liv Tyler is definitely the weak link in this film.I loved her in the LOTR's trilogy, but she completely blew this part. Jennifer Connally has her beat by a lot shot.Apparently they told Liv not to speak but to ""coo"" and ""whisper"" the lines and I've got to say that got old really fast! I think she screamed once or twice... the rest was the ""seductive coo"" which really had no place in this film. It works for some parts... but not for the Betty Ross part. Connally had it down without making you gag.If they do another... I'm praying for a cast change for the Betty Ross part.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty dang Good movie.,"To steal a line from a man of infinite wisdom, Welcome True Believers, to another exciting Kingdom Heartless review! Alright then! Time for what is essentially my first review of any relevance to current times. And I'm more than happy to be able to do it on a summer superhero movie. Before the real review gets under way, there are some things that need to be cleared up. Firstly, I don't mind Ang Lee's Hulk movie of 2003. When I first saw it I didn't particularly enjoy the movie, but on subsequent viewing I found appreciation for it. Secondly, my knowledge of the Hulk comics and such is far from perfect. I have a few comics floating around and I've read a few from libraries, but I am by no means an expert on the subject. So I guess you could call this a review from a semi-amateur. And Lastly, I am a simple man child. Put a lot of action and fun in a movie and I will be happy. This is evident from my love of movies like Transformers and X-Men: The Last Stand. Alright, now that we have those details out of the way, Let's Get Green. (Yep, I went there.)I will start off by saying that the general opinion of this movies could really go either way. I'm not a very good judge with this sort of stuff. You could hate it. Myself, I enjoyed it quite a bit. No, it wasn't a perfect movie by any standard, but I still enjoyed it a great deal, and it's been added to my mental list of DVDs to be purchased. But it does appear like a movie that will have mixed reception. And I plan to give a few reasons why soon enough.A big worry people seem to have with this movie is the CGI. To me, this was not a problem at all. It seems they have gone to a great deal of trouble to ensure that he did not look as cartoony as Ang Lee's Hulk did, and in that respect I feel they succeeded greatly. The detail of his facial expressions and body tone were done very well, and he didn't look as fake as some CGI does. The Abomination looked pretty damn awesome as well. But it's clear that there will be people who want to hate on the CGI. And as I was hoping for in the movie, there was enough explosions and missiles flying around and such to make Michael Bay wet himself. As stated above, simple mind to please. Also, this is no way like a sequel. I wouldn't think of it that way in the least. It is completely different in terms of background and such.Edward Norton played his role pretty well. In fact the acting was pretty good all around, with solid performances from William Hurt and Tim Roth. And I will be honest, I thought Liv Tyler was great, and I know how much people like hating on her. I thought she was charming. I also thought Hulk's mindless roaring and stuff was cool. Heh. Of course there was a couple of cheesy jokes and self references, as we should all have come to expect from Marvel movies, but all of them were genuinely amusing and didn't distract from the story at all. I did notice at times, there was some weird camera shots that changed into another angle and just seemed a little off, in terms of timing.The human side of the story was pretty good, albeit with a few pacing problems at times, but nothing to get Hulky about. The action scenes were really cool. Lots of Hulk randomly tearing things apart and causing carnage. I did notice some problems with some of the action being over when it just seemed to be getting revved up. Maybe it's just that I heard some different information regarding lengths. And similar to the earlier summer hit, Iron Man, the main villain didn't really seem to get as much screen time as expected.I would also like to mention I enjoyed the score, and would like to note the presence of the original somber theme. Cool little thing for people who were fans of the original show.All in all this was a largely enjoyable movie for me, and I'm hoping other people are able to enjoy it as well. The action scenes should be pleasing to most people at least. It's not the best Marvel movie for sure, but it is up there with the better ones. I'd like to give this movie about a 8.5 rating out of 10, and recommend you see this one at the cinemas. Well worth shelling out ten bucks to see.Also, I would like to mention that people who whine about how illogical Bruce Banner's pants are can be quiet now. It doesn't go unexplained in the movie. All is well in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pleasant surprise!,"HULK SMASH! 'The Incredible Hulk', while not without it's flaws, is a much leaner and meaner version of the comic book tale than Ang Lee's disappointing 'Hulk'. Instead of delving too deep into psychological issues and family trauma, the new film keeps moving and never strays from the action.Now let's get something out of the way that bothered me a lot. 'The Incredible Hulk' cheats here by being a sequel to a film that doesn't exist! It's not an origin story but it's not a sequel to Lee's film either. The opening sequence recaps events that didn't actually take place in 'Hulk' and this makes the first ten or fifteen minutes especially awkward. It's almost like you have to do your homework on HOW the Hulk gets created before turning up, which is OK I guess because it's such a well known character.Now onto the positives. The opening action sequence in Rio's shanty towns is amazing, up there with something out of the Bourne movies, except with the added bonus of including a Hulking-out scene! Ed Norton and Tim Roth are both good as enemies while their digital counterparts are also rather impressive but more on those in a sec. There's some nice humour thrown into the mix, stopping the film from getting too serious.With ten times more energy than 'Hulk', the movie leaps from one action sequence to another and although it gets a little bit choppy later on, it's much better than the incoherent finale of the other version. The effects range from fantastic to that kind of gravity defying look that most comic book movies seem to pick up. But on the whole I was impressed and every time the Hulk gets mad (which is a lot in this film) it always makes you smile.The final battle between Hulk and Roth's Abomination is savage stuff, with the pair roaring and growling like wild beasts. If you a bit let down by the Transformers-lite showdown of Iron Man, then you might prefer this one which I'd say is better.Sorry if this review is all over the place, I just felt I needed to say that 'Incredible Hulk' is a pleasing entry into the genre and I'm actually looking forward to the inevitable sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weak,"The battle scenes were great, with a lot of excitement, bringing that expected action. However, the film had a weak plot. Highly predictable scenes. The performances were regular, but Liv Tyler had more security in her character.Film reviewed on February 22 to February 23, 2021.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Insight to the Incredible Hulk  ten minutes after viewing the film,"Chances are if you are looking at ratings or comments of the release of the The Incredible Hulk then you have seen the film or are thinking about it. Well if you are the later then spend the eight or nine bucks on the ticket to go see it, it will be well worth it.I had heard many reasons of why some people did not want to go see this film and many of them reverted back to the 2003 film The Hulk, I unlike what seems to be many other people have this film and enjoyed seeing it many times. I do understand though that many people were not impressed with fight scene time or with the C.G. of the time but overall I still think it is a decent way to spend a rainy night.If you had some concerns about The Incredible Hulk based on some let down after viewing the 2003 film, DON""T! The fight scenes are longer, the Hulk looks more realistic, and he is still a bad ass. Marvel in my opinion is 2-for-2 this summer and that is what they are going to need going up against the July 18th release of The Dark Knight by D.C.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What even is this?,"Effects - The character design of the Hulk is absolutely terrible. I was laughing every time he was onscreen. This movie is worth watching all the way through just to see the awful CG fight in the finale. Its absolutely hilarious. The effects in this film are the very definition of ""dated.""Characters - A lot of the acting was ok. None of it was too terrible, but there aren't really any great performances in this movie. The characters themselves aren't very interesting and are best described as ""passable."" Bruce Banner on his own is a bit boring. I don't think that he works well as a main character.Plot - This movie is drawn out. Most of the scenes are too long, and there are a few that could've been cut. There is a lot of stupid in this movie as well. If this movie was shorter, it probably would've been a bit less boring.Cinematography - There are a lot of interesting shots in this movie. The way this movie looks (aside from the effects) is probably the best thing about this movie. Visually, this movie is fantastic.Score - The soundtrack for this movie is absolutely terrible. Some people underestimate the power of good music. If someone competent was writing the composition for this movie, it would've been so much more entertaining. The music in this movie is so boring. It takes away from any of the excitement there is to be had.Overall this movie is teetering on the edge of boredom and fun. This movie suffers from a bloated runtime and a bad soundtrack. That being said, I was entertained. This isn't the worst movie ever, but its also not anything special. If you like this character or this franchise then go see it. Otherwise I'd recommend skipping it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not a sequel,"when i first heard about The Incredible Hulk coming out again i thought it would be a sequel of the first one with Eric Bana, but when i heard they had brought in Edward Norton i knew then that this is going to be a different type of film and i was right. The Hulk looked a lot more realistic than it did in the first one and instead of having it just about Bruce Banner and how the Hulk was destroying his life, they shown how it effected other characters as well most notably Betty Ross.Overall, all the acting was superb especially Edward Norton (The Hulk), Liv Tyler (Betty Ross), Tim Roth (Emil Blonsky) and William Hurt (General 'Thunderbolt' Ross), the cameo from the original hulk (Lou Ferrigno) brought humour to the film.so my rating of this is a good 9/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than I expected, but still could have used improvement","Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Ang Lee's Hulk. Yeah, there was not nearly as much action as any other comic film at the time (or since), but the psychological undertaking that Lee envisioned for the character, to me, worked out quite well. It was boring at times, but it was a much more artistically driven attempt at a comic character that we probably will never see again.So enter The Incredible Hulk, a sequel/reimagining of sorts. The film picks up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil, searching for a cure to his ""disease"". The American government are still searching for him of course, and he is still trying to stay as far away as he can from them.What is interesting about this film, is that if they had done away from the flashback sequences detailing how Banner became the Hulk, it could have easily been a flashier sequel to Lee's original film. But unfortunately (or fortunately for most), the basic skeleton of a storyline is just about the only thing that holds these two films in the same realm of contemporary comic film adaptations.As said, this film is incredibly (no pun intended) flashier than the original. There are three huge action sequences involving the Hulk himself, and at least two other sequences where the Hulk appears not fighting others. These lengthy actions scenes are fairly well filmed, and nearly flawless in their use of CGI. The Hulk interacts with his environments excellently, and there was very little by way of him looking fake (whereas Lee's film struggled in a few scenes to make him look real). Making him smaller is an obvious help to the creators, and clearly allows for better character interactions. I was actually genuinely impressed by the action set pieces, and marvelled at how far special effects have come since Lee's film (obviously, he does not need to be hidden in shadows throughout the majority of his appearances).What is also done well is how nostalgic the film feels. Yes, Lee had Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee show up, but that was about it. Here, director Louis Leterrier has added the two of them back into the mix, but as more than just small cameos. They actually have parts to play in the story, and Ferrigno even gets to voice the Hulk again. Not to mention the use of the theme song from the 1970's television series.But for anyone looking for any sort of exposition, they may be in for a bit of a disappointment.The story is interesting (about as much as a film that is primarily dictated by being an extended chase can be), and not just a typical sequel story. But it never delves into anyone's motivations for their actions. There is never a real reason why Banner wants to be cured, other than to lead a normal life. No reason for Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) to get Banner back to the US, other than to retrieve what he believes to be ""government property"". No reason for Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to go to the extremes he does, other than to take out the Hulk. It just seems all very one-dimensionally based, and any interactions just seem to be placed to move the film from one action piece to the next. Hell, as amazing as the actions scenes are, they seem extended simply to avoid having the characters engage in any development (outside of dropping obvious things that people who already know something about the Hulk would know).For all the controversy leading up to the film's release, even to the naked eye, it looks like Norton is being held back in lieu of his green CGI counterpart. He never gets a real attempt to chew scenery, and never looks comfortable in any of his scenes. His brilliant repertoire of films suggest that he would have truly made something of this role, but it looks like it was either cut out, or he just failed to take the time to even try. Any character building scenes he has (especially when interacting with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) are either cut short, or begin and end faster than they started. I will say that his emotions and body language do a lot for his character, but unfortunately, not nearly enough to make this role be on par with anything he has ever done in the past.The supporting cast is much the same. Roth really makes at attempt at making Blonsky to truly feel villainous, but he just seems too over-the-top to make it seem like anything other than a villain straight from the pages of a Hulk comic. I liked him in the role, but he too could have done with a bit more backstory and motivations for his later actions. Hurt is great as always, but only because he has very little to do with the material he is given. His obvious relationship (or lack thereof) with Tyler's character is almost entirely missing and we never truly understand his actions outside of their obviousness. Tyler is almost entirely devoid of anything to make her character feel worthwhile at all, and Tim Blake Nelson's character feels tacked on as a mere indication of a sequel.It may sound like I hated the film, but it was so much more enjoyable than I imagined it would be. Leterrier had a huge undertaking to make his film feel completely different than Lee's, and whether I like his alternate vision or not, it cannot be said that he did not do a hell of a job making it come to life. It does not help that the film merely feels like a piece in the grand scheme of Marvel's attempts to bring an Avengers movie to life, but the film merely makes the most of what it was given. And it only could have been better if it was given more.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hulk of Summer Blockbuster,"You've probably read that the movie in some people's opinion is a glorified chase scene for two hours with not much substance and overblown CGI effects. Or you've read that it delivers and The Hulk (franchise?) has been redeemed and that the action scenes are awesome, the pacing good, and The Hulk's roar loud. I would say that the truth, or my opinion, lies somewhere in between. While the CGI is at times egregious and fakely applied, so much so it could possibly take you out of the movie, so is the whole premise of the thing. But it is a comic book movie, and if you can suspend your disbelief for that, it is not too much further a stretch to just take the CGI for what it is: that is, a part of a nicely paced, entertaining chase film, with moderate character development and substance, that happens to be incorporated with comic book characters. The good guys most likely win--barely; and in the sequel we'll find out if the proverbial 'beast' or 'mutant' will be reunited with his 'girl-next-door'. All the while a new villain is making devious and disastrous plans, for what else would a comic hero do if not?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More blam, less blah","I may be in the minority here, but I did like Ang Lee's take on ""Hulk"". I appreciated how it chose to be introspective and how it traded off much of the action for character study of a tortured individual. But I also know that such attempt, however earnest, seems more at home with art theaters and film festivals (or at least with late year releases) than with mainstream theaters in summer packed with audience looking for nothing more than a big popcorn movie. Thus, this immediate reboot of this Marvel comic book franchise.Now helmed by ""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier, ""The Incredible Hulk"" completely ignores the existence of the 2003 film - heart, introspection and all - and goes for a more action-packed route. It's what fans are clamoring and the film delivers in that regard - it's definitely bigger, faster, and stronger.Edward Norton now plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who exposed himself to gamma rays during an experiment gone awry, and now turns into a rampaging green giant when angry or overexcited. Now he's on the lam because the father of his flame Betty Ross (a wooden Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt), wants what's inside of him to build a team of superhuman soldiers. When General Ross tracks Banner in a Brazilian shanty town, he sends eager test subject Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to chase Banner and bring him back. More colossal action scenes and nods to the Marvel Universe ensue.Despite the low risk approach and a pretty much straightforward plot line, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has its merits. The film clocks in at less than two hours and for most of its running time, it manages to be entertaining. The CGI is serviceable and Edward Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, though with the script's lightweight treatment on his character, much of the inner conflict is gone and non-action scenes are more of obligatory fillers Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn are too eager to be done with. Incidentally Norton, who is reported to have done rewrites with the script, is unhappy with the final cut, but then...I'm not going to be hypocritical and say the absence of profound inward contemplation made the film less enjoyable. It does, to some degree, but all things considered, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has everything a fan of the series could ask for a summer movie: more smashing and less talking.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very well done!,"Though I'm not a big fan of Edward Norton he does a great job in this movie. It's darker and more emotional and dramatic than most superhero movies and I think that fits in well with the Bruce Banner tragic story. Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend ""Stanley"" being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic. That fight is being hyped up the entire film and I just didn't think it was that great. Nonetheless, this was an outstanding movie and most people would enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Packs a punch (and not just fight-wise),"At the very beginning there were some issues with the projector, so the opening title sequence was sadly never seen in its ""full glory"". But once the movie got rolling, it was surprisingly captivating.Edward Norton really gives us his Hulk-film - and as involved with every facet of it, he delivered a damn good one. The story is a simple one - even if you're not a fan, you could probably tell us what it's about in less than five minutes. But here it's (finally...) told with characters you feel for and care about. The humor is almost subtle, not overplayed, so it's funny without getting ""goofy"". The score and emotion is also beautiful - has there ever been a better suited main theme? It also has little in-nods (including four cameos of sorts and three other Marvel references) which is great to see.Edward Norton as David Banner plays to the part that matters. Loneliness, isolation, slight obsession (maybe desperation). He's picking up what Bill Bixby did so great, and paying homage to it. Liv Tyler is usually all smiles, but when her emotions get going, they hit you where it matters. I was skeptical about Tim Roth, but for the most part he does just what he should be doing.The action is loud and frantic, and the mostly CGI fight scenes were probably the biggest letdown of the whole thing. For me it's really worked out as a dramatic story with action, not an action movie with hints of drama. So after going through it with the characters, you mostly just find ""oh, it's time for another fight I guess"". (But I'll admit a few moments in particular satisfied the 8-year old Hulk-fan within).If your choice is between The Happening and this, you might find as I did, that (maybe surprisingly) The Incredible Hulk tells a really involving and exciting story, while The Happening remains pretty hollow.Give this not-so-jolly green giant a chance, folks. It's a truly entertaining movie-going experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Marvel movie yet!,"This film is amazing! You can actually tell that the director, Edward Norton, and Tim Roth are fans of The Incredible Hulk unlike most Marvel films. The Incredible Hulk is such an underrated comic series, I would probably say Bruce Banner is the one of the most emotionally intriguing characters in Marvel. So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most ""fun"" film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of ""The Lonely Man"" and ""Hulk Smash"". The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry. I believed Tim Roth was an aging mercenary that was power-hungry and wanted to find the fountain of youth, and that William Hurt was a corrupt General...but to him Hulk is the bad guy. William Hurt totally gets into character here as always, he doesn't look or sound like himself, crazy.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You've seen it done better a million times before,"Unlike the other reviewers here I was REALLY disappointed with this film. Admittedly I felt similarly disappointed after seeing Ang Lee's take on the big green monster - but that was my fault for having ""traditional"" expectations going in. That earlier film improved with subsequent viewings, and at least had a sense of originality going for it.I'm a fan of Ed Norton's work, and so was looking forward to his take on things, particularly when it was announced he was writing the script and would be concentrating on the Banner character and his inner psyche.Alas, the endless reports of a troubled shoot, culminating with Norton's name being removed from the writing credits of the film earlier this week by the WGA set off alarm bells that have proved all too true.This is a lazy, formulaic, 'do it by numbers' mess of a superhero film. It's not a patch on ""Iron Man"" which was Marvel's first ""in house"" production, and it suffers terribly when compared to that offering. When the standout sequence is a rehash of the rooftop scene already done (and to much better effect) in Bourne Ultimatum you know you're in trouble.Ed Norton is, unfortunately, totally miscast in this take on Bruce Banner. He's far too bland to command leading man status. The action scenes are tired and lifeless, with poor fire FX and some terrible ""eye line"" work on the CGI. Only the end scene fight between The Hulk and The Abomination look vaguely convincing. And it's the sort of fight scene that we've seen endless times before in other, better superhero movies.Other missteps include having Mr Blue (Samuel) playing everything for laughs, and the complete lack of a proper ending. The fight scene ends and then the makers don't know what to do. In fact the ending is so bad they end up having to add the same coda they added to ""Iron Man"", but this time before the credits. Lame, lame, lame! Kids will enjoy this, and I guess it's truer to the comic book than Ang Lee's take was. But really it just comes across as a ""between series"" TV episode expanded out with a movie budget. There's nothing new here and Bill Bixby did it better on TV.I'd be surprised if there's a sequel. And if there is I hope it's a whole lot better than this mess.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good Comic Book Film,"This comic book film I was pleasantly surprised with. I missed it at the cinema and when it came out I bought it on BluRay and put it into my PS3. Now I'm not a major fan of the Hulk, I know of the comics, but I've never read them. Also as a kid I used to catch the show on a weekend, which I thought was fun. Then in 2003 I watched the HULK on DVD one night and I was a little disappointed, as a film I found it quite boring, and not on the same level as Spider-Man, Blade and X-Men that had been released prior to that. So here came the new rebooted HULK, which I'd only saw one trailer for and I thought it looked decent. I put the film on, and I enjoyed it from the get go, the scenes in Brazil are very gritty and Edward Norton does a good job letting us feel what he's feeling as he's trying to hold the HULK inside of him. The film picks up soon after when the army track him down and the adventure begins. The films action set pieces are very well done, much improved on ANG LEE's version, and the dramatic scenes play out very well as well. The special effects are good, not perfect but very good. The cast all do a very good job on the film. It wasn't obviously as great as THE DARK KNIGHT or IRON MAN but its a very entertaining film and I hope that they get to take the story further in another adventure for the HULK. 8/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Comic-To-Screen Masterpiece...,"As I had stated in the title of this review this is truly a comic-to-screen masterpiece. I am a religious Incredible Hulk comic reader and fan and it takes a lot for me to be impressed by anything adapted from the Marvel universe. And I am happy to say that this film is nearly perfect on all accounts staying quite faithful to the comics and the classic Bill Bixby live action TV show.The story is pure brilliance and in my opinion was written in such a way that could only work for an Incredible Hulk film to be acceptable and enjoyable to the masses. You may hate me for this but I really don't want to go into great detail about the story because I really don't want to spoil anything pertaining the story because I really want you to be as thrilled and surprised by the story as I was when I first experienced this masterpiece.

No expectations going in makes this good.,"I wanna start by saying that i liked the original Hulk movie. I think The actors were way better. Sometimes nolte was over the top but comic villains are supposed to be over the top. The hulk itself looks lightyears better then the ang lee version. The villains were better as well in this one. i loved the fact that this one was more or less a sequel to the other one. People forget that though the ""Hulk"" was such as disgrace it did manage to get positive reviews from every major critic. The problem with the original is that Lee tried to make it more of a drama then a mindless action film. This new one is not mindless but it has a lot more action. The special effects are really good and that was my problem with the last one. I thought everything in the lee version was great except for the villains and the CGI.

big and loud but with a certain amount of heart,"Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don't already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors). Though far from perfect, that earlier ""Hulk"" was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all). Well, most of that ""problem"" has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem. The good news, though, is that ""The Incredible Hulk"" boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.For the most part, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today. Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be ""hulked."" The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV's ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."" The controversy over which of the two ""Hulk"" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come. I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest ""Hulk"" is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level.

Hulk a much better film version than previous attempts,"I can't say that this film blew me away but I must give credit to the producers and actors who made it a much better version than any previous attempts.The romantic parts were a little overdrawn and found no problem taking bathroom breaks during those portions.The film seems to borrow a little from a lot of other action films. I can see elements of King Kong, the Bourne films, First Blood, and others.But it is a 10 of 10 if you are a Hulkster. If you are not I would rate it 6 of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Movie,"I had a great chance to see The Incredible Hulk yesterday and I wasn't expecting much, after the total flop that was The Hulk in 2003, I wasn't too sure that this was a good idea. Now, granted, Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of all time, he is just terrific and has such a wide range of characters. Seeing him for the first time in a super hero movie was going to be interesting. But from the trailer, this looked once again like it was going to be over the top and not really entertaining. However The Incredible Hulk was actually... incredible! It was highly entertaining, the CGI was a thousand times more believable than the 2003 movie, the actors were great, and it pays great homages to the TV show and comic book for the fans. The Incredible Hulk does have small flaws, but the story keeps you interested and Edward Nortn couldn't have been a more perfect choice as The Hulk.Bruce did a new experiment that made him into the hulk, causing every angry reaction he has turning him into a green nine foot monster that is virtually indestructible. But he has run off to South America until he can find a cure for this ""desease"" and be with the love of his life, Betty. But when the FBI surrounds him, he heads back to America with the promise of a cure from his friend, Dr. Blue. But as soon as he heads back, an army experiment gone evil with Blonsky turns him into an evil hulk and Bruce must face him off.The Incredible Hulk is a great summer movie and I highly recommend it. The story can be a little slow at times, but I thought the effects and acting was just fantastic. I really loved watching The Indcredible Hulk, this is a summer block buster that I have been waiting for, I know a lot of people are rooting for Iron Man, but I feel like The Incredilbe Hulk is in a class of it's own. Edward Norton and Tim Roth were great on screen and had a real presence. Tim was so frightening, he was awesome and his villain couldn't have been more on key. I highly recommend The Incredible Hulk, this was a great movie that I'm sure any one could just have a blast with.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't make you angry? Well don't make us angry first Marvel.,"Scouring the earth looking for a cure to his gamma ray poisoning, Bruce Banner is in Brazil when the army, who want to harness the monster within him as a weapon, locate him. General Ross and the power hungry Emil Blonsky will stop at nothing to capture Banner and his significant other angry half, but Banner's true love, Betty Ross, and the mysterious Mr Blue, are allies hoping to cure Bruce of his ills, but is it all in vain?Those who hated Ang Lee's thoughtful and emotionally driven version of Hulk in 2003 will find this a far more rewarding experience, a mere 20 minutes in and the green one arrives to raise the pulses and set comic book enthusiasts hearts a racing. Not skimping on action or in fact an emotional core, the makers here have managed to blend both the fundamental aspects of the duality being and almost pulled off a great movie, but it's still some way short of being a comic book adapted classic. The pluses do however far outweigh the minuses, this Hulk incarnation is one you can take the kids to see and they can't possibly be bored, the introduction of the wonderfully named The Abomination as a Hulk nemesis ensures the audience is eagerly awaiting the big smack down, thankfully when it arrives it's thrilling, totally daft and entirely within the spirit of the Hulk origins. Major kudos to Tim Roth who as Blonsky, soon to be the monstrous looking Abomination, delivers a delicious line in ego driven badness, and with a fact of movie life being that a film of this type is only as good as its villain, Roth steps in to keep the film above ropey waters.Annoyingly, considering the cast list here, the film is not without problems. Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors of the modern age, and his restrained showing here as Banner is certainly not at all bad, it's just an odd casting choice to me, almost as if this role is far too beneath him, watching his turn was like an itch I just couldn't scratch. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross steps into the slender shoes vacated by Jennifer Connelly in Lee's 2003 version, it may be unfair to compare the two, but where Connelly had much emotional heart in her portrayal, Tyler has nothing, and her emotional play off with Norton in the crucial scenes just lacks the spark needed to make it work to the full. William Hurt works well enough as General Ross, following on from his bad boy turns in A History Of Violence and Mr Brooks, Hurt is finding something of a working resurgence in devilment characters, while Tim Blake Nelson perfectly dons the caricature hat of scientist on the edge, Dr. Samuel Sterns.The CGI of Hulk has vastly improved, still a borderline problem, it just may well be that we all should accept that Hulk as a character is never going to be a CGI dream? With that in mind it is perhaps churlish to do down Incredible Hulk based on its entertainment value? Which is certainly very high. Yet it's notable that Edward Norton offers nothing by way of a commentary on the DVD package of the film, Tim Roth joining director Louis Leterrier for the gag track only fuels the fire that apparently leading man and director were well at odds about the direction the film was taking. So is Incredible Hulk recommended to the average thrill seeking movie lover? Most assuredly yes. Is Incredible Hulk a worthwhile comic book adaptation? Well sort of: Better than Daredevil and Darkman, but well short of Spidey and The Bat. At times looking like a cheap knock off of Peter Jackson's King Kong, Incredible Hulk has a willingness to entertain, and maybe we all should just focus on that and enjoy the ride? 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Dumb and big but obviously entertaining.,"Seems like I'm one of the very few who actually liked Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". It was a movie that failed to attract and please the majority of people. Still they obviously thought there was lots of potential with the Hulk character for further movies and therefore 5 years later this movie got released, which is not a sequel to Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" and instead is a re-telling and re-establishment of the Hulk character. It ignores the facts from the first movie and doesn't very much concentrate on the Hulk origins or emotional aspect of Bruce Banner but it's more a movie that comes straight to the point and cuts to the chase immediately, so to speak. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is bigger, has more action and far more potential to please the mainstream crowd. It also of course obviously has as a result that the movie is rather simple.Not only the director is different this time (Louis Leterrier) but also the cast is. Edward Norton seems like an unlikely choice for such a big mainstream blockbuster but he of course is more than a capable actor and therefore also pulls off just fine. Still I liked Eric Bana's more humane and emotional performance of Bruce Banner in ""Hulk"", despite the fact that I think Edward Norton is a better actor. But to be honest I liked every actor and performance from ""Hulk"" better than was the case with this movie. Liv Tyler replaced Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and William Hurt replaced Sam Elliott as general Ross. Completely new characters are being played by Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky and Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns, who are again, two actors who don't seem like very likely choices for such a big summer blockbuster but work out just fine for the movie. Of course especially Tim Roth, as the movie its main villain. Still funny though that a supposedly Russian character speaks with such a fat British accent. It was good though to see him in a big production again. He had been out of the picture for too long.Of course this is no movie that pays particularly much attention to its story. Once you start over-analyzing it you'll find plenty of plot-holes and the movie leaves more questions then answers. But of course you shouldn't think too much about this though, for ""The Incredible Hulk"" is just not this kind of movie. It's a movie that is supposed to bring entertainment and at this it really does not fail.This is obviously a movie that cost some serious money to make. With its budget around $150,000,000, this is a real big summer blockbuster. The money can mostly be seen back on screen with some big action sequences. I actually have to admit that some of the action is the best I've seen in recent years. It's of course also a movie that relies heavily on its CGI, for its Hulk character mostly. The special effects are simply great though so it shouldn't really ever 'trouble' you that this is a CGI heavy movie. This is also due to the directing approach of the movie, that shows the Hulk often more as a mysterious and dark creature who moves around in the shadows. The camera doesn't zoom all the time right into the Hulk or the villainous Abomination. They often instead more walk around in the background and the camera doesn't get a clear focus on them, as if it's 'bigfoot' footage, or the Loch Ness monster. This amateur, shaky, unclear looking style that has become recently popular for movies and is a style that I like very much for movies and also truly works out well for this particular movie.It's a movie that shows that the Hulk and superhero movie genre in particular still has plenty of potential in it. The movie also hints at possible sequels and even for movies in which multiple Marvel comic book heroes are going to team up. I would pay money to see it happen all!Even though I don't think it's the best the genre has to offer, it simply was a movie that I very much enjoyed watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Hulk returns with more effects, less soul","Very few Hollywood action movies get it right. In this age of computer generated images in blockbusters, far too often, depth of character is sacrificed. They might thrill but fail to resonate emotionally. ""The Incredible Hulk"" has plenty going for it with its action, but just ends up being an action movie with very little to care about.This movie seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to the Oscar winning director Ang Lee's more cerebral, brooding and introspective ""Hulk"" (2003). Hard-core fans were put off by the psychology of it all and wanted more action. So, director Louis Leterrier falls into that trap and unfortunately goes the other extreme. It is clearly more interested in the action and loses out on a potentially touching if not more visceral underpinnings.The Hulk does not want to be a monster again and his love tries to help him against the wishes of her father. This plot line could have been further delved into without taking away from the action. The movie fails to do so.The opening credits encapsulate the story of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) when angry turns into the Hulk. It then continues from where the earlier movie left off. We find Banner in a South American town trying to find a cure. He also learns to control his anger. The army general, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), is hell bent on finding him and extract that which makes him the Hulk and use it to make a weapon.He eventually finds Banner with the help of a mercenary Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) but the Hulk escapes and returns home. But Blonsky also turns into a Hulk like monster called the Abomination and they face off in the end.There is a new cast for this movie who really don't get much material to work with. Liv Tyler playing the love does a decent job and her scenes with Norton are tender. Roth playing the cold and ruthless Blonsky shines and injects the movie with some refreshing human edginess. Norton co-wrote the movie with Zac Penn. There were rumours that Norton was upset that the story of Banner was compromised for the sake of action and he even refused to do initial promotional work for the movie.The action sequences are clearly better staged than the earlier movie and even Hulk looks much more believable. The film makers have clearly worked on the CG imagery. But it is very hard to look into the Hulk's soul and see any kind of anguish and turmoil the character is clearly going through. The only emotion that seems to be relayed is anger. This struggle between Banner and Hulk is woefully under worked and the movie's biggest failure.The script is damp and could have done more with the humour. The other Marvel comic super hero movie ""Iron Man"" was well served with a witty script and thismovie could have done with more light hearted moments. Since the film makers seemed intent on satisfying fans, for those looking for a thrills and not much brooding this move will deliver.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"An all right reboot of a superhero and TV legend, even if it seems comical and arduous.","""The Incredible Hulk"" clearly this time around is a much better version than the one that Ang Lee made in 2003. As this time we see a film blended with more comedy, action, and less dramatization. From the start we see Ed Norton looking graceful and well prepared as he fits the role perfect for Bruce Banner the research scientist turned angry Hulk who will hide out in the slums of Brazil. Plus a good theme of character study is shown as Banner must do his own anger management control. Banner himself we see as a conflicted man not wanting the power of the Hulk yet his power is wanted by the service of the army enter Gen. Ross(William Hurt)who plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon in which leads to a showdown that goes across the globe. Memories are brought back by old ""Hulk"" fans as Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee have cameos. All during this action feast the Hulk is a rampaging force that can blast off even the biggest and baddest weapons the military has. Good chemistry is found in the film with his love interest Betty Ross as Liv Tyler does a fine job. Overall a better take on the green giant it's worth a watch if you want to see some roaring action.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's good. Lots of action, not much story or character development. But lots of action.","It is structured as follows: chase, battle, short pause for talk, chase, battle, short pause for talk, big battle, the end. So, they may have set the bar a bit low, but they have certainly achieved their target. And it must be said that the few short scenes of character development are very good and make me wish Norton had won his battle to make it a longer film. Roll on the DVD release! (The blu-ray version will have 70 minutes of extra footage, according to the director!) But, missing scenes aside, what we do get is still good. Sure, it's not Iron Man, but then it's not trying to be. More than anything else, it's just trying hard to be different from the previous Hulk film (which I loved). This film wants to entertain you every step of the way, so it rarely pauses for breath. Somebody is always running, jumping and hitting someone else. And the producers are hoping you are invested enough in the characters as it is, without them stopping to talk very much about what is happening to them.And it mostly works. We do know these characters, so we do care. And even if we don't know who they are we can see that Banner looks sad, keeps staring at a picture of pretty girl and has a nice dog, so we are going to like him. And Blonsky shows up and is mean to the dog, so we know to dislike him! (It's not rocket science, people. Pay attention!!) The film also manages to tie itself to the superb Bill Bixby television series in a million different ways (something the previous film chose not to do). Which makes it seem like a very humble film, approaching us with head bowed offering gifts to please us. The first film is a favourite of mine, but it wasn't a crowd-pleaser. This one has a real air of ""Hey, sorry about that. Look, there's more to the Hulk than that. He smashes stuff! Remember the old TV series? The Hulk can be fun!"" And...It was. I hope there's a Hulk 3 and they keep everyone from this one on board. ""B+"" http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk smash?,"I saw a preview of The Incredible Hulk today. I kept my hopes low after being disappointed with it's predecessor and with the last blockbuster release of the year, Indiana Jones.We are placed right in the middle of the action when the film gets underway.This is a welcome change from the drawn out explanations of other superhero movies.Quite simply we don't need one for Bruce Banner.The action we are dropped into is slow burning. Perhaps not wanting to overload us, we are instead left with a little less Hulk than one would like.The way the action sequences were shot was a bit all over the place, reminiscent of Transformers in terms of not really being able to tell what's going on.The film was enjoyable.Norton makes a great Banner and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky is, as usual, fantastic.It is not as fun as Iron Man, Hulk falling closer to Batman Begins in terms of tone.There's plenty to enjoy though and Letterier's mark is definitely left on the film.If you are already an Incredible Hulk fan, you should love this (there are cameos of course for Lou Ferigno and Stan Lee), if not, sit back and watch Hulk smash.(If anyone else is reminded of Peter Jackson's King Kong in one particular scene, let me know I'm not the only one...)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The *only* Incredible thing about this movie:  Incredible how pathetically bad the CGI is.,"The Incredible Hulk has Incredibly bad CGI. That is the one and only incredible thing about the whole movie.The CGI looks like the paid an amateur video game modder 5 dollars, total, to make the best CGI Hulk he could.In reality, they may have spent a bit more than 5 dollars and hired more than one amateur video game modder. But the end result *looks* like they *didn't*, and that is the only thing that counts.The Incredible Hulk is rivalled only by I Am Legend, and the Ang Lee movie version of The Incredible Hulk from 2003, for having the very worst CGI of all-time.Even the television Hulk from the 1970's looks *vastly* more believable and realistic than the CGI green turd Hulk in the Norton movie version does.Some criticize the TV Hulk for being corny. Sure, he could be a bit corny, but *even so*, he is *still* INCREDIBLY more immersive and believable than this movie's 5-dollar-looking CGI fake green blob of crap is, which you *won't ever* believe is real for even one single second.Besides, it is possible to use a human actor to play the Hulk *and* make the Hulk have a gritty, dark edge. Just because the TV Hulk was lighthearted and family-friendly, it doesn't mean that that is so *because* they used a human actor to play him. This is a huge fallacy in logic that defenders of the CGI green turd Hulk frequently make. But it's time to put that fallacy of logic to rest, permanently. The Hulk as played by a human actor could easily be every bit as gritty and dark as Batman or anyone else if the writers, director, and producers made him be so.Movies like Iron Man and Transformers have shown that it's entirely possible to make a great movie using *good* CGI that does not in any way detract from the believability and quality of the movie. The Incredible Hulk with Norton is the exact opposite of that. The CGI green fake turd 5-dollar-looking blob of crap Hulk completely destroys the movie in every conceivable way.The Hulk in this movie looks so awful, that by even putting it on the screen and expecting people to pay to see it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewing audience.Bottomline: there is no excuse whatsoever for how pathetically bad the CGI Hulk in the Norton movie looks.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Take out Zak Penn and you'd have a brilliant film,"This has been a summer of superhero flicks. Ironman, Hancock, Incredible Hulk, The Dark Knight and Hellboy II have all topped the box office and all in all, none of them were really bad (I have yet to see Hellboy, though). The Incredible Hulk is no exception.The Incredible Hulk starts off with about a five minute background story during opening credits, just to quickly tell the origin of the character. If you don't already know, Bruce Banner was experimenting with radiation, he gets exposed, and now whenever he gets angry (or excited) he turns into this big green monster known as the Hulk.If you compare this reboot to its 2003 predecessor, you'll be able to clearly see the good things this film did. Ed Norton, playing Bruce Banner, is a great actor, and he puts on a great performance. The film is also extremely well paced; you should never get bored, because the action scenes (about 3 big ones) are so well balanced and spread out. Liv Tyler, playing Banner's love interest Betty Ross, does an alright job but it doesn't really take away from the movie. I'll just say that the whole beginning of the movie, where Bruce Banner is on the run from U.S. forces and trying to find a cure for his problem, is probably the best part, but the movie stays pretty decent throughout.The worst aspect of the film is likely the dialouge. The was (mostly) written by Zak Penn, known for the last two X-Men movies and Behind Enemy Lines. I'm not going to say he's a terrible writer, but he's got a lot to learn about dialouge. Particularity during fight scenes; characters constantly exchanging silly taunts that take away from the action. The Hulk talks, and it sounds god awful.All in all, this film is very much worth watching. Great visual effects, including the coolest helicopter crash I've seen in awhile on film, good acting and great story progression. If you're looking for a very good action and superhero film, this is it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Incredibly Average Hulk,"After testing an upcoming project on himself, Dr. Bruce Banner becomes a giant green monster, known as The Hulk. The father of his girlfriend is a general who wants to capture the creature and create an army of these monsters.After The Hulk disappointed fans in 2003 because there wasn't even 'Hulk Smash', the people in suits decided to give it another go, this time less talk and more walk. This time there were changes all around. New director, new leads and a new HULK all together. This time we have a more gritty and mean hulk, yet at the same time it has that campy feel that throws back to the old TV show. While the new version is better then what Lee gave us a few years back, it still isn't an eye popper.Out is Bana and in is Norton. A stronger actor, yet he is in unfamiliar territory. Norton is not really a blockbuster star, which begged the question ""Are they really going to make a blockbuster Hulk, or another artistic piece"". Norton brings more depth to the character, yet with the ongoing drama that plagued the film it is hard to tell what more he wanted to do with the character. William Hurt replaces Sam Elliott as the General, he chews the scenery he's in and plays up the comic book bad guy role very well. Finally Liv Tyler steps in for Jennifer Connelly, much like the last film that character isn't given too much to do except cry for Banner. Tim Roth makes his way into this film playing a bad guy yet again. He isn't given much to do here either and the reason behind him becoming what he becomes is a bit eye rolling.Another problem the first film had was that the Hulk itself was too fake looking. This time they tried to ground this beast in reality a bit more, yet it still feels out of place. He is less green and a tad bigger I believe. While I still am not a big fan of this character he works better here. The Hulk finally sees his match here with the villain and no he does not battle with rabid overgrown dogs. The fight between these two beasts is action packed as they tear up the city (half of which was filmed in my hometown).As decent as this film is it doesn't leave a lasting memory. It's a loud and fast paced action film, which is exactly what it should be. It will please those who might have wanted more from the first one, which took itself way too seriously. There's fun to be had here, watching a giant Hulk destroy army vehicles will please action junkies. But we are now on a high lever for comic book films. No longer can you just make a decent comic book film, you need to wow the audience and leave a lasting impression. The Incredible Hulk doesn't do this. You walk in, enjoy the two hours and then leave and don't really talk about it anymore.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is the hulk incredible? Maybe. Is his movie any good? Not really.,"The Incredible Hulk is poised to be a reboot of the popular comic book character, after the previous attempt at a Hulk movie a few years back bombed at the box office, as well as amongst fans. Marvel has done everything possible to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself: Louis Leterrier, a director known for his kinetic, hyper-violent Transporter flicks, helms this version as opposed to Ang Lee, the director of the original Hulk, known for making ""artsy"" films. Academy award nominated actor Edward Norton stars in this one, as opposed to Eric Bana in the 2003 version, who was a relative unknown at the time. Despite Marvel's best efforts, The Incredible Hulk is still a disaster this time around. It shows promise in the beginning, but quickly delves into nothing more than a $100 million B-movie.Quickly skimming through Bruce Banner's transformation into the Hulk by gamma radiation overdose during the opening credits, the movie jumps right into the meat of things, with Bruce living in Brazilian slums, hiding out from the U.S military, particularly General Ross. General Ross has made it his mission to get Bruce's blood, which is radiated with gamma rays and causes Bruce to turn into the big, green monster whenever he gets excited. His plan is to use it as a weapon, creating numerous other ""hulks"", and he'll stop at nothing to get it. Most of the movie is an on-the-lam take on the superhero genre, with Banner evading Ross and the U.S army, while KGB agent Emil Blonsky begins taking gamma radiation doses so he too, can turn into a monster, and take down Banner for Ross.The Incredible Hulk starts out with promise, showing Bruce dealing with the effects of his ""condition"", trying to learn how to control himself and maintain a low profile at the same time. It's interesting to see how Bruce tries to deal with the infliction, and it's filled with the right mix of drama and humor (one particular lost-in-translation moment had the audience cracking up). Not before long, the military shows up and a chase overtop the roofs of the slums ensues. It's easy to see why Marvel chose Leterrier during the chase; he knows how to handle an action sequence, without delving into shaky-cam or redundancy, despite the long length of the sequence. However, by the end of the scene, Bruce ""hulks"" out, and that's when the problems begin.The first apparent problem is that the Hulk looks like he's came straight out of the video game tie-in. There's been a lot of detail put into certain aspects of him, including scars and muscle tone, but nothing has been done to give him any sense of realism. He looks like a cartoon and his movements and actions are similar to those of a CG-animated character. Yes, the ""hulk"" is created almost entirely using digital effects, but after movies like Transformers and Iron Man, where the effects were almost seamless, the hulk seems more in line with Sci-Fi channel level effects (for those who aren't familiar with the channel, it specializes in schlocky, cheap science fiction such as Python Vs. Boa).The bad CGI appearance of the Hulk marks the movies descent into cheese. From that point on, the film no longer provides anything of interest about the characters or their situation: it serves only to show stuff blowing up and the hulk smashing things. Despite Edward Norton being a gifted actor, he has nothing to work with here. There's no emotion, no depth to the character of Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler is given even less as Bruce's ex-girlfriend, Betty. She's pretty much relegated to following Bruce around for the entire film, not showing any personality or character whatsoever. When the movie isn't going for cheap thrills and action, it makes a few flaccid attempts at evoking emotion, such as having Bruce and Betty hug each other in the pouring rain as angelic music chimes out in the background. Or having Bruce, attempting to provide thoughtful insight on his condition, say it feels like ""having LSD poured into you"".There's nothing wrong with a film, especially a superhero movie, going straight for mindless thrills and action. However, The Incredible Hulk doesn't deliver on that either. The action sequences are too cheesy, too over-the-top and ungrounded in reality, to be remotely thrilling. Take for instance, the Hulk's second battle against the U.S military, as well as a gamma ray enhanced Emil Blonsky, General Ross's right hand man. The hulk stops smashing through things and tears some metal chunks off a vehicle, and wields them as blades, spinning them through the air. Blonsky begins doing back flips and moves out of the Matrix films to dodge each of the Hulk's attacks. It doesn't fit in with the style of the movie to have them partaking in a hyper-stylized fight more akin to a Jackie Chan film. It's completely out of character for the movie and just plain ridiculous.Then there's the finale, in which Blonsky, fully transformed into The Abomination (a hulk-like creature, but with more strength) fights the Hulk on the streets of Manhattan. The fight looks as convincing as something out of Kung Fu Panda, with a jumble of badly animated monsters leaping around the street, using cars as boxing gloves and chains to strangle each other with. It's just silly. It could be thrilling if it was more grounded in reality, if we cared about the characters whatsoever, if there was any sort of depth to the situation beyond Bruce deciding to go beat the monster up. There isn't. It's the type of scene some B-movie director would shoot if he had the same amount of money.The Incredible Hulk doesn't add any depth to the story of the hulk, yet also fails as a mindless action film. It shows potential, but ultimately fails. Marvel had their chance, two actually, and it's time to put this series to rest.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Incredible Hunk,"I knew that this movie would be on the same lines of Iron Man, Spider man etc. with the latest hi-tech visual effects; just for the change of having one more hero on the big screen doing incredible things, I went to see Incredible Hunk.Dr.Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is experimented on plasma cells by US defence to develop super - HERO soldier out of humans; things go wrong  and Bruce becomes an incredible huge monster and escapes the lab. The experiment leaves a pattern to Bruce's behavior  that whenever he gets angry he turns to an incredible hulk. The US defence is out to get him back. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is so fascinated while seeing, facing and fighting the Incredible Hulk  that he wants to be one. The result is - he becomes a Monster Hulk, and in the end, Incredible Hulk fights the monster Hulk to save New York City. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) plays the love angel of Bruce.There is not much to the movie except the incredible action sequences and fights. They are a treat to enjoy on big screen. Edward Norton is okay, Tim Roth is better as a villain and Liv Tyler  whenever she comes on the screen  distracts the attention by her big upper lip. I had mentioned in my earlier review that she might have done plastic surgery or botox; there are many who think that way  but we do not know for sure; and would not be interested to know. The fact is that whatever her acting  her lips are a hindrance to her acting skills  if she has any. Coming back to movie This is Director Louis Leterrier third movie after Transporter 2. He has done good job to raise the bar from a B-grade movie to at least an A-grade look. The cinematography of Brazil Rio de Janeiro is breath-taking and wonderful.Overall it is a good and better adaptation of the comic novel and previous film. With possibility of Iron Man joining hands with Incredible Hulk  we would wait for that movie next time.Go and see it if you are an action movie or Super-human type of the movie addict.

Definitely Not A Bore,"I believe this version of the Hulk is to eliminate viewers memories from the first Hulk directed by Ang Lee. Definitely A LOT BETTER and more entertaining. It is a must see for Hulk fans and trust me you won't be yawning. I think you shouldn't even bother with the Ang Lee version and should consider this version as part 1 and not sequel to the other version. I would consider this version as a remake, a second chance to make it right.I also like edward norton and believe he is a great actor. He did a good job. I am looking forward to see more sequels of the Hulk and hopefully it'll be directed by top guys such as Sam raimi, Wolfgang petersen or my FAV James Cameron.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hulk movie I've always wanted!!!,"This was without a doubt one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen simply because it is awesome to see one of your favorite comic book characters on the big screen in all his might.The 2003 version was beyond disappointing because it was far from the source material,too long and boring and of course not enough Hulk smash action.Thank God director Louis Leterrier fixed the mistakes Ang Lee made and created one of the best comic adaptations ever.The cast is great and Eddy Norton once again proves he's one of the best actors of his generation and the perfect man to play the tormented Bruce Banner.The rest of the cast is great also:Liv Tyler is a great Betty and is really sympathetic with the monster just like in the comics.Tim Roth is a great Blonsky and an even better Abomination,he's just pure badass evil.William Hurt is the best General Ross ever!!!He is literally pulled from the pages of the comic-divided between the duty to capture the rampaging monster and the love for his daughter he really nailed the part.One of the biggest improvements from the previous film is definitely the CGI-The Hulk looks as real as he can be-the skin coloring,textures and shades are all superb bravo to the effects guys they did a fantastic job.Abomination looks great too.His final clash with Hulk is something to talk about for a long time.This is what I call an epic fight.In conclusion I'd like to say that if you are a Hulk fan you must absolutely see this film and I bet you will love it.If you're not a Hulk fan you will enjoy it still.One of the most entertaining action packed movies for years.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't fink just fight.,"Ang Lee is Barton Fink. Back in 03 Ang/Barton comes to stay in Hollywood hell to write a script for an inherently silly movie. However... Ang is talented and sensitive and tries to show us something beautiful and different. Ang/Barton thinks that movies shouldn't be dumb with uninteresting characters, or be full of mindless action or be cliché ridden and full of terrible dialogue. So Ang really puts effort into working in an unfamiliar setting attempting to transform and transcend the usual genre clichés.Hollywood and cinema goers are not pleased. What they really wanted was a Wallace Beery wrestling picture with lots of action! So Hollywood brings in a director who specialises in Wallace Beery wrestling pictures with lots of action!, and together they give the cinema goers what they wanted all along.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pointless,"I just finished Hulk, expecting something similarly entertaining than Iron Man or at least F4. I was disappointed, and I wonder how bad Lee's attempt really must be if this is one is considered the better one.There is nothing original or surprising in this movie. It's made with absolutely no spirit at all, bland as a mouthful of flour. The story is extraordinary simple, the acting is wooden and characters act stupid more often than not (even the non-hulky ones), the music sounds as if stolen from any number of previous movies.Sit this one out and wait for yet another sequel, one day they have to do it right.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I preferred Ang Lee's version,"Ang Lee's 2003 version of the Hulk had flaws aplenty: hulked out puppies, plastic-looking CGI, an inexplicably ""acid-trip"" climax, and a baby-faced hulk design to name but a few. This reboot attempt neatly avoids many of those flaws but sadly introduces a whole new set of it's own.On the positive side, the relationship between Banner and Betty Ross is far more palpable and emotional here - thanks mostly to Norton and Tyler's fantastic acting. The hulk design itself just looks cooler, with more realistic CGI (though still far from perfect), and more adult facial features. There are some great cameos and worthy homage paid to the TV series that many of us enjoyed when we were kids. Tim Roth is excellent as always. In other words, director Louis Leterrier has definitely gotten some things right.For me though, this version falls down in two major aspects. First, there seems to be a lack of rising action in the script. The plot certainly escalates, but somehow the finale is no more exciting or interesting than the opening scenes. Each action scene, though fun in it's own right, does not increase the conflict, tension, or drama of the previous scenes. The result is a mechanistic emotional flatline. Put a simpler way, when two giant monsters are on-screen, battling and destroying a city, and I catch myself glancing at my watch, something, somewhere, ain't quite right.The biggest problem I have though, is that the essence of the Hulk is watered down here. Traditionally the Hulk is the raging, uncontrollable, dark side of man. And its strength and power increase according to the depths of its anger. The madder the Hulk gets, the stronger the Hulk gets. Ang Lee's Hulk did this - the bigger the threat, the bigger the Hulk! We saw him take out military helicopters and fighter jets as if they were children's toys. We saw him toss 70 tons of Abrams tank off to the horizon! This was the true essence of the Hulk. This new take, however, sees the Hulk diluted to a Disney version that flinches at bullets from a .45 handgun and hurts his head when he bumps it on a cave roof. The largest thing he handles is a small forklift truck.It's a small gripe, I suppose, but an important one. I would think that if a film about a creature with superhuman strength is to be better than it's predecessors, surely the creature should be... well... better than it's predecessors.In conclusion, if you want to see a better *film*, see this version; but if you want to see a better *Hulk*, then Ang Lee's version has that nailed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Norton has difficulty emoting in cartoon movie.,"This movie feels more like a reboot, such as ""Batman Begins"", but it is missing the ""Alfred"", or Morgan Freeman's character, an ally. Here Bruce Banner is alone, with virtually no one to reveal his inner psyche to (at least for the first half of the movie). Poor William Hurt can't seem to find the soul of his character, and doesn't make a great villain either. I understand that 70 minutes of the film was removed, and I can only assume that the soul of these characters were lost in the editing room. As for the monster itself, that never felt like Bruce Banner. During the opening credits, we see the whole lab episode to show how Banner became Hulk. A great innovation during this sequence was ""Hulk Vision"", and eery POV shot that gave you an idea how it felt to be the Hulk. Sadly, this vehicle is never used again in the movie. There might need to be a change in the Hulk universe, where perhaps Hulk can speak a bit more, which works well when Tim Roth undergoes his transformation. Frankly, it's still too unbelievable that a man turns big and green, and back again when working it as a feature film. It still feels cartoonish.So a delicate balance is needed, between the accepted reality these characters live in this movie, and the bizarre creatures that require a leap of imagination. Ed Norton, an Oscar calibre actor, invested a lot into internalising this character, so he is understandably upset that nuances were removed. As for the action set pieces, they are fun to watch, and the cinematography surpasses almost any other comic book movie, even better than ""300"". What the studios wanted with this reboot is not a lot of luggage, not another Ang Lee, and for that they get my approval (you can read about my ongoing rant about 2+ hour movies in my other reviews). I would have settled for perhaps 10 more minutes of Bruce's psyche, what helped make ""Batman Begins"" so good.The problem with William Hurt; perhaps it was the moustache, or his non-military sounding voice, or the ambivalence of being both the bad guy and the father of the Bruce's romantic interest. He did not possess the tenacity to be feared and despised. Sam Elliot fit the bill very well in the last movie (and the moustache was even real). Tim Roth ends up being the only interesting character of the bunch, and his screen time is limited. This is a muddled effort to reboot the franchise, but I am happy that Ang Lee's disaster has been overlooked. I'm confident that a sequel will be made, and perhaps Ed Norton can show more psyche, and maybe someone more fierce can replace William Hurt (perhaps a friend of Tony Stark).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"No better than Ang Lee's version, but if you want action, you'll get action","A ""reboot"" of the series, following Ang Lee's disastrous (performance-wise) Hulk. I'm one of those who thought that film wasn't that bad. I'm not one who thinks it's great, either, but it was entertaining. I don't think The Incredible Hulk is any better, and I'd probably rank it a tad below Lee's film. This one is more action-oriented, although I honestly think the percentage of running time the action lasts is similar in both movies. The Incredible Hulk wraps its thin story around three giant action sequences, each better than the last. It's a lot of fun during those parts. Other parts, eh, not so much. It's fine, but it's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Okay, blow something up already."" I still have the same major problem with this one that I did with the last one: CGI. Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, if you're familiar with my point of view already. I especially don't think CGI works when the animated characters are supposed to be humanoid. When the Hulk is standing next to Liv Tyler, to me it's no more convincing an interaction than when Mary Poppins dances with cartoon penguins. I liked the nods to the TV series, including a hitchhiking scene, the sad piano music and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even the special effects stink,"If this version of the Incredible Hulk was done in the fashion of an animated cartoon perhaps I would have liked it better. Graphic artists really know how to draw monsters.Here the monsters look like some kind of monster suit a kid might get for Halloween. They are so obviously artificial! The special effects of the monsters throwing cars about also seem ridiculously artificial. Am I being picky expecting a comic book character to appear realistic? Well, they did it in the original TV series. They used a simple technique. Instead of costumes (or whatever) the TV series used super-sized Lou Ferrigno as the hulk, just painting his skin green. But a Ferrigno sized hulk apparently was too small for the makers of this film.In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit I am not a big fan of action films. There are some I liked, including about everything by Quentin Tarentino. I liked Superman and Batman films, but got bored by too many sequels. But the main reason I wanted to see the Incredible Hulk was to see how the they handled the transformation, expecting something outstanding what with all the technology advances made in the past decade.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This dramatic and rousing film features the Hulk that everyone knows and loves.,"When The Incredible Hulk came out back in 2008 I watched it in a movie theater. I remember thinking that this is the best film portrayal of the Hulk yet. It's by no means a perfect film but it gets a number of things right. It definitely has replay value. Casting Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was a curious but inspired move. Norton is a good actor. In this film his Banner is a likable and charismatic character from the beginning. This reluctant hero gets a dramatic treatment like never before in film. In addition to the well-handled romance between Banner and Betty Ross (a perfectly cast Liv Tyler) we're also shown how he relates to his work. Since this is a beginnings story Banner can't yet control the Hulk and he wants to rid himself of the green monster. This drags down the action scenes a bit because the Hulk fights against Thunderbolt Ross' (William Hurt) army units. It's not very exciting stuff because he isn't facing a supervillain. So he smashes some armored cars and brings down a chopper. Only at the end of the film do we get to see some real Hulk action when he faces Emil Blonsky. But, surprisingly, the action involving the Hulk isn't even the best aspect of this film. It's more interesting to see Norton play Banner while he's on the run from Ross. The inclusion of some good natured humor is also a plus. Hurt lent an air of respectability to the film in his role as General Ross just as Jeff Bridges did in Iron Man (2008). It's unfortunate that Norton didn't get to reprise his role as Banner in The Avengers (2012) because he made Banner a believable character. In The Avengers Banner is often used for comic relief while the Hulk is used only for action. Sure, the fight featuring the Hulk and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is exciting. But when written by Joss Whedon and played by Mark Ruffalo Banner has none of the mystery and charisma that Norton brought to the role. Norton said that his dispute with Marvel producers was about money, while Kevin Feige claimed that they didn't get along with Norton. Perhaps Norton disagreed with Whedon's comical take on the character, or perhaps Feige thought that the box office returns were below expectations and decided not to spend more time and effort on Hulk films. It's too bad because out of all the Marvel superheroes I was most excited about seeing the Hulk. The Incredible Hulk achieved what it set out to do. Norton and director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Now You See Me) successfully revived the character and did it in a smart way. The CGI was provided by Rhythm And Hues and not by Industrial Light & Magic, the company that created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). They succeeded in making the Hulk a vivid on-screen presence. Craig Armstrong provided a memorable music score, and if you want to get it it's available on two discs. There's a significant amount of footage that wasn't included in the final cut of the film. For example, the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide was cut out. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Some of the flashbacks that were placed across the film were compressed to the film's start. I would have liked seeing these in the final cut though. I recommend The Incredible Hulk. It's one of my favorite Marvel Studios films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Doesn't convince me to go green forever.,"It wasn't a tall order to improve upon Ang Lee's disastrous 2003 effort, which was simply horrible in every way. Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Meh..,"This movie is a good example for great casting in a mediocre film. Edward Norton was a really good fit for the Hulk/Bruce Banner, but the movie didn't really give him enough to work with. The villain in this movie is a literal abomination. So dull and boring, that nothing could make him interesting. The visual effects seem pretty dated and the movie isn't shot very nicely. Plus, the fact that he doesn't turn into the Hulk when he is angry, but when he is excited makes it seem really weird. Wow. Enough from the negative. Even though Edward Norton isn't given too much to work with, he makes the best of it and you can see it. The action is pretty decent, and the relationship between Bruce and Betty is also fine. I would watch this movie again, but under special circumstances.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Comparing the '08 and '03 versions,"I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps – almost flying – as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area.Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the ""super soldier"" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.Great soundtracks in both versions.So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (sorry)Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much Better...They Actually Get It Right,"I can say that almost everyone's expectations were low on this film ever since Ang Lee's Abomination (no pun intended) that was known as ""Hulk"" So now it's been 5 years since that film and already we've gotten a Reboot sequel from Universal once again.Now the one thing I was looking for in this film, was not an excellent story, but at least some good action, acting, and a movie that was far more superior than it's predecessor.Well...with ""The Incredible Hulk"" I got just that. If it had not been for Edward Norton and Tim Roth, then the film wouldn't nearly be as good.But still, they finally get it right. The Hulk this time around is meaner, stronger, and resembles the comic book character a lot more.Yes the CGI makes him look unrealistic, but what do you expect nowadays? But still. The Hulk in this film is a freaking monster. He'll tear up anything and everything when he feels threatened. He's like a wild animal.The action sequences were good as well. The final fight scene is definitely the highlight of the film. I won't spoil what happens but It's definitely worth the price of a ticket.Within the story, which has a few problems, Edward Norton really became Bruce Banner. In fact he felt so much like Bill Bixby.Overall, The Incredible Hulk was a good Action Summer film and a movie far better than it's predecessor.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Incredible Hulk (2008) - Hulk Smash!,"After receiving harsh reviews for 2003's ""Hulk"", starring Eric Bana, Marvel immediately decided to reboot the Hulk franchise with 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"", this time, starring Edward Norton as the giant, raging green monster. Now, the Hulk isn't my favorite Marvel superhero, but is rather considered as one of the coolest superheroes. Set with a new back-story on Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk, Banner travels from place to place, to help find a cure to prevent himself from becoming the Hulk, while making sure to not be spotted by the military. Although this isn't the best portrayal of the Hulk that I've seen in a while, Edward Norton does deliver a fine quality and relativity to the Bruce Banner character. But the visual effects perform a weak job at making the Hulk effect look like Edward Norton. Besides Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell, and Tim Blake Nelson round up the rest of the supporting cast. Tim Roth shares a pretty decent portrayal of Emil Blonsky, a.k.a The Abomination, and William Hurt does his best playing General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, obsessed in capturing the Hulk. But Liv Tyler brings out the weakest performance of the entire cast, playing Norton's love-interest, Elizabeth Ross. She spits out her dialouge in such a cheesy manner, and she delivers bland execution to go along with it. I honestly don't know why she's even in this movie! This movie does deliver some impressive action scenes that are quite enjoyable to watch, but they're placed in the wrong place at the wrong time. These scenes are just placed in random elements of the plot, and they don't fit appropriately into the story as it progresses. It feels like it's just there to promise the audience for there to be an action movie. For example, the final battle scene between the Hulk and the Abomination was entertaining to watch, but it just didn't develop into the plot precisely, so that the audience can see a fight scene already. But those scenes are enjoyable to watch, however, and worth the price of admission. ""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't one of the best Marvel films I've seen in my life, but it's still quite an entertaining movie that sometimes knew what it wanted to be. I just wished that the movie would have been so much better at arranging the action scenes at a more precise moment, fitting perfectly in the story itself. But it's still a pretty damn fun movie to watch with your friends. ""The Incredible Hulk"", in my review, ""poorly executed, but undeniably entertaining"".",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does Not Deserve the Hate It Gets,"Following up the astonishing success of Iron Man, the MCU adds another hero to its blossoming universe with The Incredible Hulk. After the mixed response of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003), director Louis Leterrier takes the character in another direction and focuses on the monster aspects, rather than the sorrowful loner. While I quite enjoy both versions, I still feel that we have not seen the perfect balance of the character being a brute, as well as longing solitude. Edward Norton takes the role of Bruce Banner and, while he is a great actor, is not quite suitable in the role and fails to fit into the scientific genius that is Banner. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) sticks out similarly, as her love interest is little more than a damsel in distress, not being given much more to work with. Standing against the Green Goliath, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) captivates as his devilish jealousy grows throughout the film. Blonsky had always been perplexing absent from the larger MCU and rewatching this acts as a reminder to his dastardly performance. The action sequences are creative and crafts real and believable issues for the near unbeatable behemoth. Having read his comics for years, it is immensely enjoyable to watch the Hulk go wild and showcase the true strength of his monstrous side. The Incredible Hulk works well to explore the characters savage nature, but miscasts and still fails to capture the emotionally torturous balance of the Hulk.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk is a smash,"OK fight fans here we go. First let me get started by declaring I am the only person I know who actually liked the Ang Lee Hulk movie. So for me this is not an essential remake. I thought that movie had a magnificent sense of pathos. But here we go the great things with modern super hero movies is just like the comics we can re-imagine them as and when the film makers see fit, and in this case it has been done well. Marvel is on a bit or a role here as they have now surpassed my expectation with both this movie and 'Iron Man' This movie seems to cleverly run on from Lee's version whilst giving you an altered history in the opening credits. We have Bruce Banner now holed up in Brazil a fugitive trying to understand his so called disease. Whilst General Ross is desperately searching for him to cultivate his research into a weapon. Where this film differs from the first is that it is action pretty much all the way and very well done it is too. Hulk seems a little smaller and therefore more accessible but the CG is good and the rainy sequence trick is used once again to help the blending in of scenes. Also where this film will work for the fan boys is in the appearance of a proper comic book villain in Abomination. Abomination's back story is handled well and Tim Roth gives a good hammy performance to match the stellar efforts from the rest of the cast. (I have heard Edward Norton is unhappy with the cinema cut and would like to see the cut he preferred, and would really hope he makes himself available for any potential sequels). There was some good homage's to the past with a TC clip of Bill Bixby, a cameo by Ferringo and the inevitable Stan Lee cameo and a real plus for me they even worked in a little bit of the old TV theme tune.

Much better in retrospect.,"The Incredible Hulk (2008)With Universal flexing their distribution rights, The Incredible Hulk (2008) was notably absent in Marvel's MCU on Disney+. It also seemed, for years, that this movie wasn't quite a part of it either. Thankfully, Disney regained those rights in 2023, and the movie made it to their streaming services. I haven't seen the movie since it was originally released, and I have now watched the second film in the MCU and found a new appreciation.Edward Norton, in his only appearance before Mark Ruffalo took over, did a better job of playing the Hulk than I think he was recognized for. I know that he was difficult behind the scenes, and was all ridiculous about refusing to continue the role, but I still liked his Bruce Banner.The film introduces Thaddeus Ross, the Abomination, Betty Ross, and a freaky Ty Burrell that all I could see was Phil from Modern Family. Bruce is on the run after using an experimental super-soldier serum on himself, causing him to transform into the Hulk, an uncontrollable and unstoppable creature. In this film, instead of gamma ray exposure, the MCU ties this together with the same program that created Captain America. In fact, Tony Stark, in a cameo, even mentions that the program was ""on ice"", a nod to Steve Rogers' fate after World War II.Stan Lee's hilarious cameo was the impetus for Ross finding Bruce hiding in Brazil. Blinsky (later the Abomination) becomes exposed to the same serum after failing to contain the Hulk allowing for a legitimate fight between two unstoppable creatures.The film gives Bruce and Betty, his former girlfriend, a romantic touch when she immediately works to aid in Bruce's quest to remove the Hulk from his body. It's a little clunky, but as a comic book fan, it was fun to see. Betty, being General Ross's daughter, also brings more dramatic tension as she disagrees with her father's methods.In typical Marvel fashion, the themes of scientific progress being weaponized by the military / government bring to mind the Manhattan Project, which was also referenced in Iron Man. Blinsky and Ross discussing that scientists don't deserve to be a weapon, instead of soldiers, continue this theme of arrogance.With another reference to the gathering of ""Avengers"" at the end, the movie ties into Iron Man, which was a nice touch. Now knowing that the characters pop up throughout later films, my referenced appreciation above allowed me to place the film back into the greater narrative after initially dismissing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just boring,"I honestly don't think many movies that I watch are boring BUT already a few minutes in I realized this was going to be a very boring and slow movie (note that this is a SUPERHERO movie).

Good. Very very good!!,"The Incredible Hulk continues Hollywood's list of 2008 Summer Blockbusters, as it does the number of comic book to celluloid adaptations for the year. With Iron Man already smashing the box office to become the first film this year to get over the 200 million dollar revenue mark, and with Berg's Hancock, Del Toro's Hellboy 2 and Nolan's The Dark Knight to come out next month, The Incredible Hulk has a lot of expectations on its head, especially after the failure of Ang Lee's The Hulk, five years ago.Unlike in The Hulk, where Ang Lee put in a lot of effort to bring forward the origin of the Hulk, Louis Leterrier's new adaptation does that in less than 3 minutes via the opening credits. They probably did not want to show us what we had already seen and not appreciated in Ang Lee's version. There is no Nick Nolte here freaking us out with his creepy (not great!) performance as Bruce Banner's father. There are no gigantic poodles and bull dogs here. There film is not two hours and fifteen minutes long. It's doesn't even get to two. All that, added with a couple of good performances, great visuals, a gripping plot, and one helluva final showdown make The Incredible Hulk a brilliant movie! Louis Leterrier isn't a very well-known director. He directed The Transporter 2, and thats about all his resume says. The casting here is good. With Edward Norton capturing the essence of Bruce Banner very well. William Hurt gives us a the rather obsessive General Thadius Ross, where he acts like he owes no one nothing as long as he able to capture the green beast. Liv Tyler, however, is quite flat. Her dialogues don't really have any feeling in them. Now, I haven't seen Tim Roth in a long time. His portrayal of Emile Blonsky is the pick of the lot in this movie. Not only does he effectively act insane, but that part-Russian accent does wonders for him.What they did, and did correctly in this film was the fact that they gave us a very raw and very real Hulk. (Read: No clinging on to a fighter jet till he reaches space!). Although all of it is CGI, it is very well done. The effects are mindblowing. The expected showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger which was given amiss by Jon Favreau in Iron Man, Marvel makes up for in The Incredible Hulk. The final fight between the Hulk and the Abomination is really something! Control - that is what the objective of this film is. How Bruce Banner takes control of the beast inside of him. He is desperately seeking an antidote, hiding from the Army, who have labeled him 'A fugitive who stole military secrets'. His living in tranquility for months and months so that he can grasp his anger instead of letting it lose. He even wears a heart-rate calculator. 'Can't get too excited', he says while on a kissing spree. Yes, it does have its fair share of comedy; and also eye-candy. Read: Débora Nascimento who plays Martina. She's there only in a few scenes.Incident - is what they call the transformation in this one. They even show you a timeline that says - Days since Incident. The shots of rural Brazil in the introduction of the film are very nice. The Hulk too seems more lifelike. Not as rubbery as he did in the previous adaptation. Also, The Incredible Hulk hints at a good many other films that could be in store for us. Tim Blake Nelson plays Samuel Sterns - The Leader, a character from Marvel. There is also a small cameo by Robert Downey Jr. And yes, he is Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man. The weapons too, if one notices, are all Stark Industry products. Who knows.. this film might be an excuse of a movie just to introduce numerous other adaptations. Think - The Avengers! The Incredible Hulk does justice to one of Marvel's most famous characters. Although unexpected since most associate it with a rather comedic version of the Hulk, we finally hear the green beast say 'Hulk Smash'. And he really does..8/10. Good. Very very good!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not horrible but doesn't stand out.,"The movie had some interesting sequences for sure, and provided the main character with a unique backstory and adventure, but it just didn't feel like enough to fully satisfy. They messed up Hulk's hair and I think the movie would've been better if they maybe casted Mark Ruffolo from the very beginning instead of recasting him later. Not a bad movie but definitely one of the worst MCU movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Marvel mutant hero packs one heck of a punch ...,"Just got back from the cinema after choosing to see this on opening day, rather than Mum's choice of the overlong Sex and the City. I'm glad I chose this.While I can't speak for comic book fans, as I'm not one and even the 90s cartoon series was my least fave as a child, I enjoyed this retelling(not a remake) of the Mavel comic book a lot.Acting: Ed Norton was good as Banner - he shows vulnerability well (but I thought they could've given him more chance to showcase his 'inner conflict' abilities in the script - which seems to, almost expectedly be mostly channelled into his green alter-ego), and I thought had some chemistry with his love interest - Liv Tyler. Poor Banner can't even be intimate without fear of turning green. Liv Tyler gives the film it's emotional heart and she's quite subtle to me (thankfully not OTT). She's involved in helping Banner find a cure. William Hurt is very good as the rogue general who dispatches soldiers and weapons to use against Hulk, so he can use him as a powerful super weapon. Another experiment he does with Tim Roth's character to create another Hulk though he does, quite catastrophically learn the consequences of his actions. Tim Roth plays his creepy, corrupt and greedy antagonist well - who later turns into The Abomination as aforementioned from a botched op. I thought his character could've had some more development. Other mentions go to who to Mr Blue(who banner instant messages for help with a cure). We find out he's an over enthusiastic scientist, but is somehow interesting in a way, as he's so fascinated by Bruce's infliction ( even calling it 'God-like').Pacing: Starts with a view of green cells, and tells banner's past though a series of brief Bourne-type flashbacks. The scenes themselves runs at a expected pace. Liked the way it was shown on screen the number of days Banner had not had an 'incident' of turning into Hulk and if he had, it would start again at 0. the film dwells less on the angst of Bruce banner and more on the action, unlike the Ang Lee one.Cinematography: The special effects were overall quite good and Hulk looked solid most of the time(as solid as CG can sort of look, even if it doesn't have that physical mass to it), apart from the odd shot where I thought I could tell it was blatant discernible CGI(in action sequences - particularly the full-on war battle on the uni campus). The fights those were too fast and a lot of it was a blur. It's pure spectacle these scenes though. The standout one for me was probably the uni campus turned military battlefield, with explosions aplenty. All the main military defence is used against this green monster, yet Hulk destroys them so easily. My sheer amazement and Hulk's strength(especially when he first transforms in the bottle factory and we see men go flying through the air) made me yell 'bloody hell' a lot.Music: Pretty standard score. It did it's job really, but wasn't standout from my point of view.Overall: An explosive, engaging action film, that while I don't think it necessarily does anything that innovative with the comic-book film genre, as a popcorn film to sit down and see, I think it works well. It has a subtly knowing script, and a majority of good acting in it. And I found the action scenes more satisfying in length(and the final fight between Hulk and Abomination smack down better) than Iron Man's action scenes and climax. It could've had more sense of fun about it though, as it was quite brooding and serious in tone. Only a handful of laughs (shopping for stretchy trousers in Brazil, 'you don't like me when I'm ... hungry' etc). There's no real connection between the two very separate entities of Hulk and Banner. It could've slowed down the action a bit, especially between the two creatures at the end(charging towards each other), and it did feel a bit generic. Again, it had the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, which i always like to spot in these sort of films. Tony Stark even makes a cameo at the end to make a tip-off about another forthcoming Avengers film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The last credible version of the hulk,"No question that the MCU has ruined the Hulk and made him a caricature of what the hulk is supposed to be. No rage, no scary monster. This movie at least takes a stab at capturing the essence of the character. It's a long way from perfect - but it's the last time we see any version of the Hulk that's credible in the MCU.Compare the Hulk you see in the factory scene to anything you see in She-Hulk, the fall from grace is severe.This movie is far better than people would have you believe.Personally, I also like Norton's take on Banner.Roth also gives a credible performance as Blonksi and is a far cry from the version we see in She-Hulk.Hopefully the MCU start to pull back to this version of the Hulk in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good one!,"I'll start by saying that I actually liked the 2003 Ang Lee Hulk and was initially disappointed when I heard they were rebooting rather than continuing, but when this movie was over and my friend said, ""that was a zillion times better than the first one,"" I had to agree.With Louis Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, you get a much more down to earth streamlined version of the Hulk everybody wanted the first time around. This is not to say in the least that it's nothing but a CGI fest, all the contrary. The script is smart, not just in its science but in its dialog and handling of the otherworldly subject matter. Letterier, with the help of Edward Norton and company do a remarkable job of convincing you that this could actually happen, even though we all know it couldn't. Characters are strongly developed with well paced tension that eventually builds to a heart stopping climax on the streets of New York. Your movie ticket's gonna buy you heart, humor and loads of thrills and action folks.It's a little disheartening to think that this film's success may easily be hampered by movie goers who still have a bad taste in their mouth from 2003, I wanna address that. This is not a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 film. This is a complete reboot, they started again from scratch, to make amends and they have succeeded. The movie does a great job of starting over by giving you only snippets in the form of early flashbacks to show how the Hulk was created and what sent Bruce Banner on the run from the law. This sets the movie into action in record time. We catch up with him some years later, he hasn't seen the love of his life, Betty in all that time and she has yet to see or even realize what Bruce's problem really is. Bruce is hiding in Brazil and has been off the grid for about six months, but when a freak accident catches the attention of his pursuers in the U.S. he's on the run again, and eventually forced back home.Ironically, considering a common complaint of the original movie was its inaccuracies to the comic book, this film draws more from the 1970's TV series for its back story and the tone even follows suit somewhat as well. With Bruce on the run we get a lot of action and suspense even when he isn't green and we get our heart from his relationship with Betty. Some comic relief comes from this as well. The movie is much darker in tone than some of the more recent superhero movies and the action gets pretty intense too, they definitely push the boundaries of their PG-13 rating. If you've liked Marvel's other ventures you will probably like this film, but if you're a fan of the original series, the comic and or cartoons, or quite frankly a fan of action adventure movies in general, go see this movie, you WILL like it. I'll say it again, cuz I want Marvel to continue with what could easily be an amazing franchise. Go see this movie!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not great but better than Ang Lee's version,I enjoyed this film i thought it was exciting and a good summer film When i compare it to Ang Lee's version overall this is better i did however think Eric Bana was a better Bruce Banner but what the first Hulk lacked was a poor story and was instead of an exciting summer action film it was a weak drama The new version however lived up to it's promise and had a much more exciting and had a lot more action. It wasn't as good as other recent comic book movies e.g. Iron-man and Batman Begins The special effects were quite disappointing they were fine when with the hulk and the other monster but when it threw a jeep or whatever it looked much more poor. So overall the first Hulk may had better acting by Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly but the weak and long story which began to drive your patience and lack of the hulk was too much of a let down while The Incredible Hulk had most of what the first one lacked and was much more enjoyable and focused much more on Bruce Banner trying to get rid of the disease instead of understand it which was more enjoyable so The Incredible Hulk was better and a good summer movie.,5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Flawed, But Still the Best Live-Action Hulk Film","The story was really solid, the action was spectacular, and the performances of Norton and Hurt were perfect. Even the cgi and designs really hold up, but there are still issues. While I did say that the story was good, there's still the issue of no proper explanation as to why anger specifically triggers Hulk transformations, just heightened heart rate, while it's 2003 predecessor explains it expertly. Not only that, it's bogged down by the supporting cast of Betty who is really uninteresting and has no personality whatsoever, along with Blonsky a little who isn't fully fleshed out enough to be a proper antagonist. Still a good movie that I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Iron Man came out the same year and the CGI is leagues above.I like Hulk's insanely shredded design, but he always looks fake. He is too shiny, rarely does he blend in and look real.

The true Hulk Film!,"Let me start off by saying that for those of you who liked the Ang Lee version ( the minority) you may not like this. For those of you who didn't this is the movie for you! The Hulk is back in a reboot not connected to the Ang Lee's in anyway. Edward Norton is a great Bruce Banner, but it seems like he could have used a little more dialog and development to make him stand out better. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was passable but nothing really special. General Thunderbolt Ross and Emil Blonsky were both great in their roles as villains. Although Bruce isn't the Hulk for the majority of this movie the action scenes are very intense and I have to admit I liked them better than Iron Man's. The ending with Tony Stark was a nice surprise and will help build excitement for an Avengers movie. The CGI was a good improvement over the 2003 version. Abodmination was especially cool looking.

Why does Hollywood think they can get away with it?,"I would have given this effort a 7 or possibly an 8, were it not for the fact that when the film is supposed to be being shot in Brazilian favelas (slums), they speak anything BUT Brazilian Portuguese there. Why????As Hollywood enters an era of ever-increasing tangible realism (cf. the latest Bond films. Hmmm, the guy is human, cries and gets bruises), why oh why would a multi-million slick production of Hulk skimp on authenticity when it would be so so easy to attain it? The initial scenes in Brazil rang as hollow as a cheap production of an NYC gangster film with the ""Family"" characters sounding Mexican instead of Italian. WHY!?!?Apart from this annoying and glaring, gaping error, this version of the Hulk strikes a much better tone than the 2003 attempt. It is short on humour but big on heart, and absolutely huge on sequel potential.I can't wait for said potential to materialise. But only if they treat the audience with respect and don't cut (silly) corners.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
He traveled from where to where in just over two weeks!?!?!!?!?,"It is never a good sign for a franchise to receive a reboot after just one installment. However, Hulk gets a second chance with the latest film from the Marvel team that has brought us this summer's biggest hit and best film thus farand that's an answer that shall not change by the end of this review. The Incredible Hulk handles just like a comic book: bad dialogue, plenty of action, massive-sized plot holes, plenty of cameos, and ends with us asking for more. The movie fails to really lift the franchise from the ashes of mediocrity as yet again we receive a sub par Hulk movie that fails to bring out the best in our green hero. Good acting and decent CGI is hampered by too many other errors, setbacks, and disappointments that turn Hulk into nothing more than an American version of Godzilla. Yes, there's more to Hulk than meets the eye, but Louis Leterrier and company fail to deliver this to us.In a well-scripted prologue, we see Bruce Banner accidentally kill people and injure others after an experiment gone wrong; which we all know turns him into the Hulk. He hides in Brazil (Not the best place to hide if you are light-skinned, I know) as he tries to find a cure for his rage. While he hides and runs (In this movie, traveling from country to country and state to state on no money is no problem), the United States army is after him to use his accident and turn it into a successful innovation in warfare.This isn't a continuation of the original Hulk, it's rather a refresher, or a reboot; in the sense of Batman Begins and Casino Royale. After the prologue, the dialogue goes downhill in a most awful way. Whether its lines that aren't supposed to deliver a laugh, to lines that should not have been said at all, there are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in Hulk just listening to people talk. The acting doesn't exactly help either, as only Tim Roth and Edward Norton pulling off respectable performances. The two actors are well-known for their versatility and breathing life into any role, and they are no exception here until the CGI gets mixed in.While the trailers do promise action and more action, The Incredible Hulk is mostly running, hiding, talking, and preparation for the final act in the movie. The opening chase sequence is good; the rest of the action doesn't quite live up to it. When Banner becomes Hulk, it's like watching a very angry toddler wreck havoc on a town of Legos. Banner/Hulk just fails to have the charisma of Stark, the coolness of Batman, and the emotional depth of Peter Parker. Things get destroyed, and then Banner's love interest (pretty but meh Liv Tyler as Betty) stops the carnage; the formula doesn't quite change. Even the carnage itself becomes repetitive.Hulk does lack the dimensions of a deep character, but it's hard to like the main character when he becomes the vicious being. Being able to calm down for only the love interest in the entire movie doesn't exactly garnish brownie points from the audience; luckily the audience wants to see epic fights and destruction to the nth degree (These people should not question the appeal of Godzilla).Bottom Line: The Incredible Hulk is nothing like the Ang Lee version, but it still fails to live up to most Marvel comic book movies. There's so much that went wrong here, its hard to praise anything going on. Most of the acting is bland, the final fight isn't as epic as one would hope, and it lacks the fun of Iron Man. Perhaps this character was never meant to be in a movie; that or needs a strong supporting role to help him entertain the audience. Another major drawback is the amount of wicked cop-outs and sudden disappearances of supporting roles. Luckily the final scene gives us all hope, as we are seeing the beginning of something potentially awesome. In the meantime, we have to suck up another second-rate Hulk movie.At least its no Batman and Robin.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Better than the first HULK....but,"For old time HULK fan, the story didn't quite make it. Whenever Hollywood messes with Stan Lee's plot, it always seems to come out worse. The plot is pure Hollywood - movie trying to put one action scene after another, but nothing innovative about cars being tossed around or chopper coming crashing down, or soldiers chasing Bruce Banner. What I'm complaining here is - it didn't capture the essence of the HULK. It was just a busy movie. HULK CG also didn't capture the subtle character of the HULK either. Good was Edward Norton as Dr. Banner. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was somewhat of a mismatch also. I think they teach method acting to the actors, but do the actors really have the time to assimilate the characters that are fleshed out so well by Stan Lee ? Maybe that's not the point since Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow did a pretty credible job of portraying Tony Stark and Pepper Pots in Ironman. I think Ironman's success was it wasn't a Hollywood production, but Marvel had ownership of the production. So I guess my wish for the future of the HULK is - Marvel will take on the production, and nail the great story with subtleties that only the owner of that culture can put into the scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but lacks the depth of the first.","I think this version gets it easier than Ang Lee's Hulk because most already saw the origin story in Lee's attempt and see Leterrier's as a continuation of the series. There's slightest attempt here at an explanation or background, just small flashes and fragments in the opening credit sequence. And to my understanding this was just a ""re-imagining"" ? so where's all that? Seems like they're exploiting Lee's HULK in that department. All that aside, this version does provide what the original was lacking; the showdown between two big monsters. And we are supplied with a lot more action than in the first, if my memory serves me right. Pace is clearly faster, because they don't have to worry about building up any kind of background story (Hey, I can't just let it go if this is being labeled as a ""re-imagining"") so the emphasis is on other things.I think this version has what the first lacked, but it lacks what the first had.

You Will Like Him When He's Angry,"Second time lucky for this marvel character. The first outing much hated but slightly underrated was if I'm being honest a little disappointing. Then it's no surprise that this surpasses it in almost every respect. ""You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry!"" Bruce Banner mumbles in mangled Portuguese at the start of this all-or-nothing stab at reanimating the DOA Hulk franchise.Delivered to a bunch of gringo-hating factory workers at the Rio bottling plant where the fugitive scientist is working undercover, it's the first indication of the bold new direction French director Louis Leterrier (The Transporters 1 & 2, Unleashed) wants to take with what is, for all Universal's protestations to the contrary, Hulk Part Deux. Out go Ang Lee's comic book panel-replicating visuals, his ponderous art-house sensibilities and those long, lingering close-ups on his stars' anguished features. Instead, his successor does something very different  he brings the funny. Whether seeking out elasticised trousers in a Mexican market or trying to keep his cool in a speeding New York taxi cab, it's a tactic Edward Norton seems more than happy to run with. As both leading man and pseudonymous co-writer (a sign of a mooted dispute with Leterrier and producers Marvel over the final cut), the Fight Club actor has more riding on this than anyone else and responds with what may be his most appealingly quicksilver performance to date.It's hard to imagine anybody making a runaway boffin poisoned by gamma radiation trying desperately to contain the raging id within even halfway credible. But Norton somehow does, implicating us in his protagonist's Jekyll-and-Hyde dilemma while gently tipping the wink to its essential ludicrousness. (If you're unconvinced, check out the scene where he apologetically desists from coitus with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross lest it escalate his heart rate and bring on a transformation.) All of which creates an unusual problem: The Incredible Hulk is at its most entertaining when the Hulk himself is off-screen. Bring him on and the picture becomes spectacularly average: a bland CGI extravaganza which pits Banner's green alter-ego (leaner and more sinewy than the original's bulbous Gumby) against hi-tech military hardware, exploding fireballs and a fellow pixellated mutant to increasingly numbing effect. The last of these, the much-vaunted Abomination, is the movie's deadliest WMD, facilitating as it does an extended smackdown on the streets of Harlem that gives the film its set-piece climax. As with the Hulk, though, he's much more compelling in human form, Tim Roth evincing a snarling ferocity and feral machismo as the carnage-craving commando who lives for the fight. It's telling that the single most exciting sequence  a breathless foot pursuit through Rio's cramped, vertiginous favelas  has not one fantastical bogeyman in sight.After all, who needs computers when you have two of the greatest actors of their generation going hell for leather in one of the most geographically improbable locations on the planet?Better than Hulk? That's a given, especially with Norton and Roth leading the cast. When they give way to their CG replacements, though, Leterrier's film loses the very elements that lift it out of the ordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good Entertainment Value,"The obvious element to this film are the impressive special effects, which are a distinct improvement if comparing to Ang Lee's Hulk. This was the major driver of the film along with a more consistent storyline that compliments the comic book version.However, with such a strong cast it had raised my expectations in terms of performance which were short lived. I believe Norton's performance was not suited to the role and personally felt it was not successfully delivered as Bruce Banner. No other actors really shined through either but I guess films such as these are not aiming to get best acting performance, but rather something related to the special effects.I would recommend this film for entertainment value as an action movie and not be too critical of the other elements (such as acting and script) as they are only just average.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as Good as Advertised,"I had hoped that since the last Hulk movie came out only five years ago that this one would be something really incredible, something so good that it couldn't have waited. And it wasn't.The movie tries to be too dramatic. Several scenes go into slow motion and drag themselves out, trying for drama but just taking more time. It seemed as though they were ignoring the pattern of a story (beginning, rising action, etc...) and just went for climax after climax, which I didn't buy into because there was no rising action.The visual effects were impressive, but personally I can't enjoy a film that is powered mainly on how it looks. That can only be cool for so long.In the end, I didn't really care much about any of the characters. Emil Blonsky was the most forced of them all, who just seems to be the generic bad guy without being an awesome bad guy.slight spoilers!!! Towards the end of the movie, the Hulk does a ""Hulk Smash"" by pounding on the ground, and he unfortunately says, ""Hulk Smash!"" right before he does it. It felt like hearing ""it's morphing time"" or something equally cheesy.My personal recommendation is to play Hulk: Ultimate Destruction instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Marvel Makes a Beautiful Remake,"When Ang Lee made the Hulk people were not disappointed but not satisfied. So it came as no surprise that the film makers decided not to make the two other Hulk movies planned. So when The Incredible Hulk was in development I had major doubts.But all these doubts became deafened by the good trailer and me seeing the actual movie.The movie made the right choice for casting Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and all the other actors particularly Tim Routh as Emil Blonsky worked pretty good to me.The movie is far more action oriented, great with a more understandable origin and a more vulnerable Hulk. Hence why they would make the Abomination a superior match to the Hulk. The acting and the hyper-realistic tone are all done very well and it is a great movie. I like how they were able to put in the Leader as a nice little hidden bonus for fans and Tony Stark revealing the plans about the Avengers.My two regrets are that this new General Ross is not as menacing as Sam Elliot and that it did not have some of the science explained enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The MCUs Black Sheep,"Incredible hulk definitely makes improvements from the dryness that was Ang Lee's last film. The origin is told short and sweet in the movies intro which really helped the pacing. The cast is good with Edward Norton really well played as Bruce Banner. You really believe him as this intellectual trying to cure himself of this green anger consuming him. He and Liv Tyler as Betty Ross have good chemistry that makes their romance feel very genuine. And despite their only being three action sequences, they're long and will most likely satisfy all the hulk smashing cravings you may have.Where the movie kinda suffers from though is that it lacks spectacle and depth. The performances are good but not great. Everybody does their role well but nobody really stands out or makes it their own compared to somebody like Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. Anybody couldve played these characters. The action sequences are fun but nothing really blows you away or sticks with you after you see it. It's overall just a good movie, but not a great one.It can be easy to forget that its set in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially given the fact Mark Ruffalo took over for Edward Norton. Not to mention are we ever going to find out what happened to Tim Blake Nelson's character? But seeing Tony Stark appear at the end will always be neat. It's crazy looking back now seeing how this simple cameo was what started a whole franchise of legendary characters that have leaped off the pages to the silver screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boring,"I will be the first to admit; I did not watch the television series, I did not read the comic books, I might of caught the last half of the 2003 Hulk on FX one night. However Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. This movie made me yawn numerious times. It was so generic, thin plot, not much character development (besides a few bad guys?), seeing big green monsters box over and over again gets boring after around 2 minuets. Now I usually like Marvel movies, even though I do not read comic books - I liked X-Men, I Loved Iron Man, and Batman Returns was great. Saw the 12:00 showing of Hulk, and I was far from impressed. The action didn't even get my blood pumping, it had much more action then Iron Man yet it did not nearly have the same effect. I apologize for comparing the two but I would rather pay to see Iron Man for the fourth time then see The Incredible Hulk again. I am actually looking forward to seeing The Happening tomorrow.And a few notes:Tim Roth was excellent Brazilian Woman should of had much more screen time Despite how bad the 2003 Hulk was, not many women can beat Jennifer Connelly.Movies that were comparable/better: -Doom (Yes I am serious) -Godzilla (The newer one)",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ang Lee vs Louis Leterrier,"Comparisons are inevitable with Ang Lee's much-panned 2003 attempt at the story of the big green monster. So for the record, I think they come out about even, but for different reasons.Lee's Hulk/Bruce Banner combo, as portrayed by Eric Bana, ended up more cartoonish, but ironically more complex. Leterrier's combo starring Ed Norton, on the other hand, is not only better rendered, but Norton just looks as if he was born to play Bruce Banner in 2008. He effortlessly modernises the character, infusing him with new age attributes like hoodies, back-packs and Brazilian martial arts, while retaining the quintessential intensity that transforms into rage just as Banner transforms into the Hulk.I favoured Jennifer Connelly over Liv Tyler for the Betty Ross character, but William Hurt does make a great Thunderbolt Ross.I can't really remember the villain in Ang Lee's version - something about ""daddy issues"", so Tim Roth's excellent descent into Abomination is a bona fide Marvel villain.Stan Lee must be very happy (if not very wealthy) for two reasons: 1)because the Incredible Hulk, as immortalised in this movie, continues to be one of the most adored stalwarts of the Marvel universe, and 2) because even though ""The Dark Knight"" recently beat down ""Spiderman"" as king of the box office, there is no doubt that it's the Marvel universe and not the D.C. one, that's filling out very nicely at a theatre near you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better story than Ang Lee's hulk, but Lee's film...","had the better actors with Eric Bana, Jennifer Connley, and Sam Elliott. I liked all 3 actors better than the ones in the new Hulk version. But, this new Hulk overall was a little better; the story flowed better.The film begins with Bruce Banner living in Brazil in hiding working at a bottling plant. Some of his blood lands in a bottle and the General is able to track him there. The General has enlisted the help of aging soldier, Emil Blonsky (whom was great played by Tim Roth) to capture Banner. Of course, Banner gets angry and we get the first glimpse of Hulk. Blonsky is in awe of the Hulk's power and wants the same.Banner makes his way to Virginia to see Betty. Meanwhile, General Ross decides to allow Blonsky to be injected with a serum similar to what Banner had, giving him super power. Ross is tipped to Banner's where abouts and this is the first encounter with Hulk and a vamped up Blonsky. Blonskly proves he can take a licking and keep on ticking. This encounter also offers some great special effects.Hulk gets away with Betty, and the two are on a mission to seek out Mr. Blue who maybe able to reverse the effects of the gamma radiation. Ross finds Mr. Blue and so does Blonsky who insists he be given a dose of Banner's blood.The end of the movie is a cool fight between Hulk and Blonsky's version of the Hulk. Good special effects.FINAL VERDICT: While not the best comic movie to come out, this one was pretty good. I wanted to see it in the theater last year, but didn't. After seeing it, I think that was a good choice because it's not worth 10 dollars to see. It's a good action, popcorn flick, but definitely lacks some of the humor in the Spiderman films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does a bigger Hulk make for a better movie?,"Edward Norton not only stars as Bruce Banner but pulls double duty as screenwriter, picking up where Zak Penn left off. Norton boasts being a Marvel kid while growing up and says he always loved the mythic dimension and contemporary themes of the Hulk. He also claims to be well versed on the original TV series, a nod I was hoping hinted towards a movie driven by character development, as opposed to (what Penn's work has previously exhibited) large scale spectacles of action.The film's opening credit sequence establishes ties to the TV series by replicating Banner's gamma ray accident, utilizing identical equipment and a few signature shots. Later on we're even treated to a cameo from Lou Ferrigno (who also voices this version of the Hulk), but once we jump into Banner's current situation as a fugitive hiding out in a Brazilian favela, the divide between the TV series and the movie starts to widen.Before long, General Ross (William Hurt) has caught a whiff of Banner's scent and dispatches a commando team led by über-soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture the outlaw scientist. Banner's concentrated efforts (meditation, jiu-jitsu) to keep the beast within from rearing its big, ugly, green head are wasted when the commando's push become a vicious shove in the darkened bowels of a Brazilian pop bottling plant. From the shadows, the Hulk emerges and shatters nearly everyone and everything around him including any potential for realism this movie may have had.Once the cartoony Hulk emerges, it displaces Banner's tortured struggle for normalcy as the focal point of the movie. That's not to say Norton doesn't get his share of screen time, but by the time the third act rolls around and Roth's English accented Russian soldier morphs into a hulk-like beast of his own, very little happens aside from things being smashed, blown up and punched at for the remainder of the movie. I might have even enjoyed all this mayhem if it didn't all look so incredibly animated, which (of course) it was.When you get to a point where you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a movie, there seems to be a disconnect. At this point, the characters you've been asked to invest into are bankrupted and the movie loses whatever potential it had to connect on any profound or engaging levels.Once the CG trumps the real world, I wondered if, despite its campiness, the Lou Ferrigno Hulk was a better alternative to the big-budget, physics defying cartoon Hulk before me now? There's no question the 70's series suffers from its campiness and budgetary constraints, but at least it managed to create a world where Banner was a compelling character worthy of holding my attention week after week. Is asking a $125 million dollar production to develop complex characters too much to ask? Is it easier making special FX and CG laden spectacles? Is it really a surefire formula for big box office? I'm sure Norton would beg to differ and based on the fact approximately 70 minutes of character driven footage is slated to be released on the inevitable Blu-Ray, maybe we'll be able to judge for ourselves whether character really is more compelling than CG.As it is, this installment of the Hulk leaves as much to be desired as Ang Lee's did back in 2003. Neither movie is terrible and both have their merits, but each one is incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying for their own unique reasons. In my humble opinion, Bill Bixby still holds the crown as the most complex and engaging Hulk on the block. Hard to believe 1970's low budget camp could out hustle a mega-budget, star laden block buster...but it does. I guess small is often better than big, even if we're talking about a hulk.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Some good, some bad ...","As far as entertainment value, here's where I'd put Hulk in relation to other Marvel-comic movies:#1 = Spider-Man movies#2 = Iron Man#3 = The Incredible Hulk (this movie)AND (tied)#3 = X-Men movies#4 = Fantastic 4 moviesThe Incredible Hulk was a bit of a mixed bad - some good parts and some bad ones. On the positive side, the movie picks up where the 2003 movie left off (so it's not a repeat) and there were some cool, energetic fight scenes, especially towards the end. On the minus side, the Hulk looked a noticeably cartoon-like and Edward Norton (who plays the lead character) sounded a bit too effeminate.To its credit, the movie doesn't try to re-tell the story of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk (as was done in the 2003 movie), but rather continues the storyline of the government trying to capture him. He's on the run and yearning to get back with the girl he had to leave ... but worst problems are headed his way.One of amusing aspects of the movie are the cameos by Stan Lee (founder of Marvel comics), Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk on TV), Robert Downey Jr. (playing his businessman character from Iron Man) and even a TV clip with Bill Bixby (who played the TV Bruce Banner). Those were fun to watch. Many of the energetic fight sequences were also pretty great.However, the animation of the Hulk was almost like a cartoon. It was a bit annoying to watch given how well fictional characters can be made to look these days. Furthermore, Edward Norton's dialog was goofy sounding; he just didn't sound like a normal guy. His voice was about an octave too high (well, that's probably an exaggeration).Fans of the comic book seem to really enjoy this movie - so you are lucky if you're part of that group. For everyone else, know that the movie is decently good and ""middle-of-the-road"" in terms of Marvel films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Uninteresting and without flavor.,"If I were Ed Norton, I wouldn't be too pleased either. Because when all is said and done, 'The Incredible Hulk' doesn't feel like anything much more than a second-rate superhero flick set on auto-pilot. It's never unwatchable, though the deafening noise doesn't help, but I felt resoundingly uninterested throughout the whole experience. 'The Incredible Hulk' hits many of the right notes, but without any gusto or flavor.Louis Leterrier's unsure direction seems evident around every corner, as if he's afraid to take any real chances to avoid another failure like the original 'Hulk' saw back in 2003. The result is a film that replaces any hint of developing plot and character with mindless action that pushes the decibel limit. It's entertaining in a forgettable kind of way, but it simply lacks the spark to make this stand out from the rest of the comic book crowd. 'The Incredible Hulk' plays a predictable hand and never branches out. And that's a disappointing shame.A month after 'Iron Man' set the bar for the summer blockbuster season (and it's yet to be surpassed), 'Incredible Hulk' doesn't do much to follow in its footsteps. Edward Norton does fine in his turn as the green monster, though admittedly he doesn't have a great deal to work with. But after Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance practically made 'Iron Man', 'Hulk' lacks the substance and character to make a particularly memorable action flick. Do keep an eye out for a Tony Stark appearance though, continuing Marvel's clever ploy to market its upcoming 'Avengers' movie.By the time we see Bruce Banner in all his green glory, we're reminded that while special effects have come a long way, they've still got a ways to go. The film looks good enough, but at times it feels as though we've watching a giant video game. The film culminates with an adequately exciting climax, but it doesn't do much to leave a lasting impression. 'The Incredible Hulk' is seeking to reinvent itself after an unsuccessful debut, but this second attempt seems to lack the confidence to really make us care.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk Smash!!!,"This version of the Hulk was so much better than the 2003 movie. It's a better adaptation and even has little easter eggs to the tv series. Long before he became an Avenger, Dr. Bruce Banner was a scientist working to bring back the 'Super Soldier' project (Captain America) but got hit with gamma radiation, now whenever he's angry, he turns into a big green Hulk.Five years later, Banner is hiding from the government in Brazil, only to be found by Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, the father of his girlfriend, Betty. Ross gives one of his soldiers the serum and it turns him into an Abomination. They soon must use Hulk to fight the creature.

prefer previous Hulk by Ang Lee,"I am usually open and don't look for too much logic in this kind of movies but after seeing rating on this site I decided to make my own comment...First of all this is not a bad movie and is quite fun with actors i really respect, but i can't help the feeling the story is not interesting enough with lot of pointless scenes just to show more CGI... All the relations between characters are just weak and u don't feel anything just want to see the end of movie, the final fight which is for me not satisfying.I think Ang Lee added a special touch (more psychology) to the previous Hulk and maybe that was the reason why it was so criticised. For me this new version is on the same level as Fantastic 4 and I was truly disappointed...I hope Louis Leterrier will show more of his talent on the forthcoming remake Clash of the Titans, favourite movie of my childhood!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not boring.. not great,"A fun movie; did justice to what it intended to do i.e. comic-book adaptation. But, it does add to the pattern we have seen in all the recent action movies. Most of the action in the city streets looked very similar to Transformers or Spiderman or King Kong; looks like all these people are using the same template of movie making and just putting in their characters. So it does lack originality. When are we going to see real good original action movie which genuinely surprise on and all??? If Hulk is watched by someone who has not watched any of the action movies of last 10 years it will really surprise. Anyways, it is not boring, so go watch it if you have nothing else to do on a weekend.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable,"The Incredible Hulk is definitely different in tone to the 2003 version of Ang Lee. I still cannot decide which is better. Neither are great films, but both are worth watching. The 2003 version is definitely the more ambitious, slower-paced, more character-centric film, but it has its flaws. The Incredible Hulk (2008 version) is more mindless (not a bad thing), more entertaining, and fits the tone of a comic book movie better, BUT it also has its flaws. I say that its easier to just pop in this version and watch, BUT I cannot help but feel that I do have more respect for what the filmmakers tried to do in the 2003 version. Anyways, this is worth watching as well, and it has a better Bruce Banner.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is It Really That Good?,"Depicting the events after the Gamma Bomb. 'The Incredible Hulk' tells the story of Dr Bruce Banner, who seeks a cure to his unique condition, which causes him to turn into a giant green monster under emotional stress. Whilst on the run from military which seeks his capture, Banner comes close to a cure. But all is lost when a new creature emerges; The Abomination.Compared to this year's ""Iron Man,"" also released by Marvel, you can tell why that's the better movie than ""The Incredible Hulk."" I can't compare this film to Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" because I've forgotten all about it but as a movie for its own, I was expecting much more (probably because 'Iron Man' was so good).The movie starts off really fast, much like ""Fantastic Four."" You don't get a chance to know the characters. It just starts off and minutes later, you find people chasing the main character, Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton. Well, they then changed their mind within the first few minutes to finally show us some characterization. Apart from that, this film is really mediocre.The pacing is all over the place. The Hulk looks more or less CGI-ish. There's one scene where you can tell they want you to make it look real and it kind of does, because it gives off a rubber-ish effect. The action scenes was a let down. Even the showdown in the end between the Hulk and the Abomination was so disappointing because it felt like a video game. If you like it that way, it's fine by me.However, the movie was fairly entertaining. Some may be disappointed by the dialog-filled scenes in the first 30 minutes of the film because they just want to see the Hulk. Edward Norton does a decent job as the Hulk. Liv Tyler did a well job as his girlfriend and Tim Roth did a decent job as well.See it in theaters? Well, I think you should wait for it on DVD. Yes, there's a Tony Stark cameo but for that, you don't have to see the movie right this moment. Some of the action scenes wee a little entertaining and overall, it's just mediocre, I'm sorry to say. Watch ""Iron Man,"" instead, a much better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Same formula different actors,What happened here...The first Hulk done in 2003 did not work out like the other superhero movies...so hey lets get all new actors make a bigger uglier bad guy and see what happens.Seriously disappointed that they replaced all the actors. Although I will say Tim Roth is a fantastic bad guy.I did like that the new story showed more occurrences of Banner/Hulk helping people.I am starting to think that Hulk is not a Big Screen superhero. Hulk only gains depth when he is non-Hulk which means to understand Hulk better there will be less action...and less action means no box-office boom.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
OK but doesn't really stand alone,"Edward Norton is great - the special effects are amazing. If I'd watched this film aged 10 I would have given it 10/10, but at aged 28 I'm a bit more cynical. The thing that annoyed me the most is the lack of a clear ending. I mean the latest Batman film ""Dark Knight"" is amazing and although its left open it doesn't feel like the first part of a two parter. This film does.Maybe I'm being harsh only giving it 6, after all I was annoyed when the film just ended in what I thought was the middle, I could happily have sat and watched another 2 hours of this. Its the film equivalent of junk food, not the best but you can eat loads of it.Take your kids - they'll love it, but if you were expecting comic book excellence on a par with ""Dark Knight"" you'll be a little disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much better than expected.,"Edward Norton is right & wrong. This movie could have used more of him in it (when the DVD comes out I hope they include ""his cut"" if it exist), but he is wrong for not promoting this movie.This re-boot is a blast to watch. I actually liked much of Ang Lee's version but only in fits & starts. This Hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags. The FX are spectacular & sometimes inspired --every part of the production is great. The battle scenes are ferocious. I never tired of watching Mean Green do his thing, but I guess thats the point. The movie makers knew when to cut the action.However --like Iron Man-- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism, but, come to think of it, all 3 Spideys & X-Men + Batman Begins (& Returns) also featured really fine & often great acting. AND this Hulk could've used more of it. Norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working. There are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief. William Hurt makes a fine foe. And, so help me movie gods, Liv Tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name ""Bruce"".Overall this movie ROCKS.And I thought all movies released b4 July 18th were just time-killers until the Dark Knight arrives. Thank you Tony Stark, Indy & Bruce Banner for proving me wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Geeky Randy's summary,"Wow. Who knew there would be so much eagerness to reboot the Hulk franchise only five years after Ang Lee's 2003 failure only to release an even bigger disaster. So now, after glossing over a new backstory in the lame opening credits, we have Edward Norton as Bruce Banner now, on the run while attempting to find a cure for himself before he is captured or before someone far less responsible than he obtains similar superpowers. While it should be embarrassing to reboot a story that was only done half a decade earlier, and that visual effects have not come all that far within that timeframe; what's worse than that and the lack of any other essential story elements is the simple fact that the plot does not MOVE.

A huge improvement over the 2003 version,"As opposed to ""Hulk,"" the adaptation made in 2003, ""The Incredible Hulk"" actually looks like some work was put into it. The first film had no emotion and was mostly filled with long scenes of dialogue or useless scenes with the Hulk fighting other creatures. That film also made up stuff about Bruce Banner's dad being involved in turning Bruce into the Hulk, which was never a part of the old TV shows. This film is very emotional and puts a greater focus on Bruce, not what he turns into. Unlike the first film, the cast is actually made up of known people, including Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and William Hurt. There are also little bits of humor that make this a more fun film to watch, such as Bruce's girlfriend giving him a pair of purple shorts to wear. The action scenes are good, but not great. This is a pretty gruesome film that can be a bit disturbing to some audiences like myself, though it is still far less than ""The Dark Knight."" It can be painful to watch when the two Hulks are fighting and when Bruce is injected with the chemicals. This is not an unwatchable film, but be aware that it can be tough to watch at times. Parents take caution; it is fairly violent (not bloody) and somewhat gruesome for young audiences. Know your kids and whether or not they should see this.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just the usual smashing done rather balanced...,"Is it good? Is it bad? Huh? Huh?THE GOOD: They've managed not pump it up with the usual toxic drama and cheap bashing - it has a fine dosage which will save you all the ""Oh come on!"" and the usual exclamations of boredom from the people in the audience. Also Edward Norton seems a better choice than the last guy tough many people hate a to see a sequel with a new cast. So at least you won't regret watching it unless you are an edgy critic. And its better to see it than gamble for another movie of the season.THE BAD: Its not much content to start with, but thats probably because the comic doesn't really offer much movie material to work with. To make comic live on screen you need some seriously profound storytelling abilities, and I'm afraid the The Incredible Hulk (2008) isn't a break from the usual weak comic movies. Liv Tyler seems like a bad choice, it may be just me but i think that she uses the same look on her face in one too many movies and it ain't all that convincing any more. There were no little sugar cubes in the form of elements bringing grace to scenes. The plot aside, there's always infinite possibility for turning a plain old story into a remarkable experience but it seems nobody tries now days.BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see something with sensibly less of the usual cheap drama, profanity and lethally boring dialog you might wanna try the Hulk, with a bit of luck you might be fan of the green bag of muscles and enjoy your self without looking for special experience. But if you put that on the scales against going out with your friends on some other activity the movie should take a rain check.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre,"I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line I don't think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times.

"Great action flick, but ultimately predictable","When the first modern Hulk adaptation came out in 2003, most people were disappointed. This wasn't the Hulk they expected; this was a deep character with an interesting story, a movie with fantastic screenplay and great actors, but few and barely mediocre action scenes. And action scenes was what the fans wanted.So the movie was seen as a failure, and plans were made to relaunch the franchise, giving people the movie they wanted in the first place; a movie that can be summarized in two words: ""Hulk Smash!""The Incredible Hulk is out, and it's a great movie. It's quite the fan service: it has the typical Hulk lines, it has tons of action scenes, it has incredible CGI, and it has the obligatory even stronger villain who ultimately must lose because he does not have the power of good on his side, and it has purple underwear. On the minus side, The Abomination looks nothing like the comic version, and some of the acting is ridiculously bad, with actors standing there staring into nothingness as if they were waiting for instructions from the director. Some actions scenes are cut too quickly, which makes it hard to figure out what exactly is going on, but since that has become the norm for Hollywood movies, it may be a bit unfair to blame The Incredible Hulk for it.Still, it's a great movie, but because it's exactly what people wanted, it's ultimately incredibly predictable. Ang Lee's Hulk was fascinating, challenging and innovative. Leterrier's Hulk is cookie cutter. When people will talk about ""the Hulk movie"" in a decade or so, they will talk about Ang Lee's Hulk, not Leterrier's Hulk.As a mindless summer popcorn action flick, The Incredible Hulk is a winner.

An adequate film that never quite manages to pull the heartstrings like it would like to,"I've read today that Ed Norton has pulled out of the promotion for this film as he is unhappy with the final cut.I can kind of understand where he is coming from if this is the case.The Incredible Hulk is a decent enough comic book action film but i left the theatre with the feeling that they have failed to fully get to grips with the character and his dark inner workings.There is a lot of scope to go deeper into his psyche and explore the animal inside the man but any interesting dramatic themes are substituted for a computer generated frenzy and some pretty generic action film goings on.The film delivers as a spectacle though which is why most people will want to see it,the CGI looks like CGI but its not as bad as everyone seems to be making out.Norton does an okay job as Banner, injecting a little more life in to the character than a wooden Eric Bana managed in the previous film.There are some lighter moments of humour in the film and overall proceedings feel light and comic book, this may be why Nortons not happy.Hulk is not to be taken seriously though.If you let yourself get swept along you may enjoy it, i found it all a little tiresome but each to their own eih!?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Best Yet,"I liked the first Hulk movie because it was the Hulk, a Marvel character that I was so familiar with as a child reading comic books, watching cheesy animations and watching the TV series. THIS Hulk movie is more like tha actually Incredible Hulk I know and closer to the series.The Hulk in this movie was like the actually comic book character where he actually speaks and comprehends. The first Hulk movie showed him as a mindless brute. Also the first movie put too much emphassis on a relationship between Bruce Banner and his father David. And the new (original?) Hulk has more emotion.Choosing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was perfect. Besides Norton's acting, his small frame helped create the contrast between Bruce and the Hulk alter ego.There are a couple of cameos and some winks to the fans. Can't tell you what those are, that would be a spoiler. :) This movie had great live action/CG mix with camera pans that were flawless increasing the effectiveness of the illusion.The true Incredible Hulk or Marvel fan will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Improvement from 2003,"This starts with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding out in Brazil. When General Ross (William Hurt), finds him and sends Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture him. After a wild chase through the slums of Rio, Banner escapes and returns back home to get his data. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) finds out and reunites with Banner.This is a good improvement from 2003. Edward Norton can play a wider range and make Banner more charming. Starting it in the Rio slums really ups the ante. It puts a bit of Jason Bourne in Banner. William Hurt is the weak spot. He doesn't have quite enough of the threatening demeanor. Tim Roth is able to pick up some of the slack as the baddie.The CGI fights are still CGI fights. It still feels like a video game. Nothing will ever replace the real feeling that a stunt guy is out there risking life and limb. The last fight with the two does drag on and on. It's still a pretty good entry into the Marvel universe.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than the first movie (which actually wasn't that bad, you know?)","Let me start off by saying that Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk is NOT a bad movie. In fact, as of writing it has 5.1 rating on IMDb and an critical approval of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes (this one is currently at 65%). Ang Lee did a lot of cool stuff in his film and had a talented cast, Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. Overall however, the Ang Lee film suffered from being too ambitious and overly complicated, and simply not being what the audience expected. The audience went in expecting to see ""Hulk smash"", and got a more cerebral film than they expected, even though there was still plenty of action (Hulk did swing tanks around after all!). It is true however that action scenes in Hulk weren't the coolest, which also contributed to the negative reputation it enjoys.The Incredible Hulk writer Zak Penn (also responsible for X-Men 2 & 3, Elektra and Behind Enemy Lines), director Louis Letterier (of the Luc Besson productions Transporter 1 & 2 and Danny The Dog/Unleashed) and actor Edward Norton (who contributed greatly to the screenplay, though he is uncredited) took the complaints over Ang Lee's film into account and aren't overly concerned with continuity in this sequel. It is mentioned that 5 years have passed and the film starts in Brasil while Lee's film ends there, but the origin of Hulk is changed in the opening credits to resemble more the famous 70s TV series (references to said series abound).The film is more fast-paced than Lee's effort, and while there actually isn't that much more action here (both films have 3 main action scenes), it is certainly better-made and definitely cooler. The story is certainly less cerebral but it's not a throwaway either. There are characters here, and they do go through something. As for people criticizing the CGI, well that just baffles me...just hows realistic do you expect a green muscled giant stomping around to be? The effects of the 2003 movie were already very good and they're even better here. They could have done a few things slightly better interaction-wise, true, but they're still very good.In addition, I love how Marvel movies are starting to reference each other (we have here references to Nick Fury/S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark/Stark Industries, the Avengers and Captain America). This is way cool and I wish they could it for characters whose rights are owned by other companies, such as Fox, Columbia or New Line. Stan Lee's cameo is probably his best one yet and the Lou Ferrigno appearance is way cool. The guy who voiced the Hulk in one of the animated series also appears, as does Bill Bixby, indirectly.Almost as good as Iron Man, this 2008 Hulk enters the hall of the best Marvel movies along with Blade 1, the first two X-Men, Iron Man, Spider-Man 1 and The Punisher ""2004 version"" (yes, I love The Punisher), and succeeds in bettering Ang Lee's underrated movie. With great action and the cool factor in spades, The Incredible Hulk should satisfy all your action blockbuster needs and leave you wanting to see Hulk smash some more. The only minor gripes I have with it are the unnecessary retconning of Lee's movie and the fact that I sincerely doubt that they asked any cast member of the first film if they wanted to return (I definitely would have preferred Jennifer Connelly reprising her role to Liv Tyler stepping in...what is it with movie sequels replacing pretty girls with unpretty ones? Maggie Gyllenhall in The Dark Knight and Liv Tyler in Hulk, sheesh!).Well that's it. Good movie. Good action movie, that is, not good ""potentially an Oscar-nominee"" movie, but you should already suspect that if you know anything about this film. So yes, this is a good action blockbuster, a great one actually, one of they very best of the quite strong 2008 summer movie season.Now vote that my review was helpful or you'll make me angry...and you wouldn't like me when I'm angry...",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quality actors in an empty story,"I was surprised that they tried to do the HULK again after the previous disaster, but when I saw that they were able to get Norton to sign on I was hopeful that It might turn out okay....it didn't. I hear that Norton attempted to help them with the script; they probably should have listened to him a little more. The dialog, as with most of the recent movies was terrible. You'd think they might write something interesting when two people who haven't seen each other for a while reunite, but no. And you'd think that they might spend sometime letting us know the motivation behind a few of the characters like Blounsky, but that would be too much like, good storytelling to please Hollywood.

Inject this other Hulk movie with originality steroids!,"THE INCREDIBLE HULKNo Way! (Meeza's nostrils turn green!). You did not like my pun-infested movie reviews as the next one I will be throwing at you! (Meeza's shirt opens up while it pulsates as his entire body turns into a dark green complexion!). You thought the reviews were silly and a bit over-the-pun-top!!! (AAAHH!! Meeza is a pun green monster filled with rage & revenge!) OK, so these type of comments do make me angry! And you would not like me when I am angry, or maybe you would because I do not pun as much when I am angry. What also made me angry at times was viewing another mostly unsuccessful cinematic takeoff of the Marvel hero ""The Incredible Hulk"" story. Director Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk did break many backs but also showed Hulk as a silly crouching monster, hidden dragon; Sorry Ang! In this latest adaptation, Director Louis Leterrier does improve the Hulk story with a bit more power by giving it an alternative narrative but not enough to have a Hulkian cinematic effect. The steady Eddie, Edward Norton, stars as Dr. Bruce Banner (alter-ego Hulk). Leterrier quickly presents a five minute montage on why & how scientist Banner transformed himself into Hulk when he gets angry during the film's opening sequence. So kudos to Louis for getting those anger issues quickly out of the way. The rest of the film fixates on the cloistered Banner's quest to get the Hulk out of his system. Banner is being chased by arrogant General Thunderbolt Ross and his men to get the Hulkian formula out of poor Bruce to use it for weaponry defense purposes. The Thunderbolt eventually finds where the lightning Banner is hiding and therefore Banner returns back to the States. The good thing for Banner is that he has a banner time reuniting with his love Betty Ross; she even knits a Hulk flag for him and this Ross undresses for less for Bruce. OK, enough! General Ross is so livid that he cannot hunt down Banner that he eventually causes for one of his men Emil Blonsky to convert himself to another gargantuan creature named ""Who Cares? It's Big, Scary, and Ugly"" to battle & defeat Hulk. By the way, that is not the real name of Hulk's nemesis; but at that point I was not engaged in the whole formulaic monster battle between good vs. evil that most superhero films climax with. I do think that Norton was the right man for the Hulk acting job with his excellent performance. But the rest of the cast made me angry with their acting, and you would not like me when I am (ok, been there, said that). Liv Tyler as Ross, William Hurt as the General, and Tim Roth as Blonsky seemed were just doing their acting gigs to just collect the green. I was at a loss for words on how awful Zak Penn's harebrained loss-of-words screenplay was. Not good Pennmanship my dear Zak. ""The Incredible Hulk"" did have some action sequences that were a bit entertaining, but not enough originality was injected in the film to make me feel green with envy that I did not catch it during its original theatrical run. Therefore, I continue to have anger management issues with Hulk movies. *** Average",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Average.,"Compare to Ang lee's Hulk, this one is not aggressive nor ambitious at all. But it's an OK movie.Prior to viewing, I didn't read any of the comments therefore I have completely no stereotype about the movie at all. But I do have my expectations like others. Here they are: 1, Edward Norton, Liv Tailer, Tim Roth, William Hurt and even Robert Donney's performance. We got all these celebrities or should I say, award-winners. I wanted them to be explosive, which means more than average.2, Since Tony Stark also give a cameo appearance in the movie, I also expect it to be solidly written like Iron Man. So I was really thirsty for some Sci-fi twists.3, Ang Lee's Hulk is commented to be ""awful"", so at least the audiences are give rights to compare them.So let's see the result. Quite interesting for me, I don't think this movie beats Ang Lee's ""awful"" one. For some obvious reasons that, 1, Edward Norton is not a mile far better than Eric Banner. Instead, he turned out to be also average, nothing like the movies he was in before. There are very few memorable moments about him alone. What about the romance? Well, Liv Tyler is sexy in her own type, but neither a female scientist type nor a hot babe type. The real problem is that she has absolutely no electricity with Norton. The scenes they are together are always distanced, both characters avoiding each other like strangers. Plus the only funny scene the director arrange for them is not funny due to Tyler's performance, which is the New York taxi scene... Other actors are also average, not in their most comfortable type of characters. I was keep guessing which part will Tony Stark(Robert Donney Jr) play, but to my disappointment he just stayed on stage for 15 seconds.2, The movie is very stably paced, with each fight bigger than the former one. And all the characters made their senses in their actions during the storytelling. Tim Roth became obsessed with power alone and, General Hurt was proved to be wrong very clearly to the end. And Hulk just hide himself for a clearer reason than Ang Lee's version. But the problem comes. The movie leaves very few to be shot in a comical style, not even all the fight scenes. Ang Lee's version tried to produce an abusive visual style with an abusive Hulk, who's ultra-violent and the fans or non-fans can completely dip themselves in this style, enjoying. But Incredible Hulk tried to be average, producing nothing to blow the audiences away. In a less abusive manner, much of the story is straight-forward and easy to understand but also loses its dynamite.3, So now you have my conclusion: Incredible Hulk has a clearer storyline but not as violent as Hulk.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It's not bad, but it's clear that the folks at Marvel were still finding their footing.","Many people seem to forget that 'The Incredible Hulk' is actually part of the MCU, most likely due to how different it feels and the fact that it was nowhere near as good as 'Iron Man (2008)' before it. It's definitely one of the weakest MCU efforts, but it's not bad. Edward Norton is decent as Bruce Banner, and Tim Roth is good in his role. The action is well-done to a certain extent and the whole thing is entertaining enough, but the characters aren't really that well developed and the film is actually rather forgettable. Still, it's never boring and entertains while it lasts. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mean and Green When Antagonized; Get out of the (bleeping) Way!,"When the huge, jade-skinned, sometimes anti-heroic behemoth, conceived by visionaries at Marvel Comics, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, got the movie treatment in 2003, fans a many were stoked to see the Incredible Hulk in full, CGI action. However, the film by celebrated filmsmith Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") was a wooden penny. Hulk dogs? The Hulk's dad becomes The Absorbing Man? The madder the Hulk gets, the bigger he gets? I'm just glad I save my money.I didn't, however, when viewing the recent comic book hero cine-relaunch (Batman being the first) which is a fun, rock'em, sock'em balance of human drama and high-edge action-adventure, the comic book and the classic TV series starring Bill Bixby as the tormented, gamma radiation-infested nuclear scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the not-so-Jolly Green Giant alter-ego. Compromising coolness is here for a superhero that can't take off the costume and call it a day, and that's what makes ""The Incredible Hulk"" interesting.Oscar nominee Edward Norton (""Fight Club"", ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"") fills the late Mr. Bixby's shoes, perfectly and hauntingly, being on the lam from the protocol-minded General Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a no-nonsense William Hurt). All Banner wants is a cure, but Ross and field soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Youth Without Youth"") makes things difficult, especially when Blonsky takes a ""super solder"" formula (a major hint to fanboys) to match monster brawn with the Green-skinned Goliath, and their fracas elevates to a monster mash in NYC's Harlem district. Good thing old Doc has the general's daughter, Betty (a mousy but lively Liv Tyler of the Lord of the Rings saga), as moral support and her heart as well.It's rare that movie producers can admit a ""mea culpa"" (money and rep, I guess), and ""The Incredible Hulk"", a combo of the Jason Bourne films and ""King Kong"", works. Director and fan Louis Lettierer (""Transporter 2"", ""Unleashed"" and an aide on the indie crime drama ""Gravesend"") does the script (a lost, first draft of the TV show's pilot episode, due to budget constraints and unavailable technology? ) by fellow fans Norton (uncredited) and Zak Penn (the second and third X-Men films) justice. Exceptional are the cast, especially Ty Burrell (the short-lived sitcom, ""Back To You"") and Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou"") whose roles hint at a sequel (Like, duh). More eye winks towards fanboys are the cameos of Stan Lee, Ferrigno, Bixby (from an episode of ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"") and Robert Downey Jr. as his Tony Stark role from the super-hit ""Iron Man"", clueing into the Marvel Comics Universe.

"No longer green behind the ears, but still some way to go.","The green mean machine rises from the vaults of the Marvel collective once more. His true conception in 1962 has seen him more than often idolised in several aspects of the multimedia world, be it comics, cartoons, TV shows and just lately, as we see here, once more, a well-established movie star.Playing the beast with the flight or fight syndrome that is Dr. Bruce Banner's alter ego we have Edward Norton, who, also having a major role in the films script (as Edward Harrison), and with this input, we have what feels very much, and quite deliberately, like a pastiche of the 1970's TV show of the same name. With a nod to the late Bill Bixby (1934 - 1993) and the shows instantly recognisable theme tune here too. This classic TV show ran from 1978 until 1982, had 81 airings and we also see, in this movie, an identical transformation that is taken from the TV show, both inspiration and respect for this cult show are well apparent.We have the good Dr. on the run and trying his best to avoid capture, we see his love between Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) rekindled and the dastardly General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) trying his best to apprehend and detain the green giant. All done to perfection and predictability that will have young children loving the adventure and excitement that this formalistic narrative, bland but workable here, holds. While there is nothing wrong in formalistic story lines, it is well expected in this genre, and in its delivery is how it shall be judged.We are shown and drawn into the world in which this green fugitive lives: lonely, desperate, dangerous, cold and deadly. With this in mind, the Hulk has an equal: the Abomination (Tim Roth); hell on earth is soon to erupt. While the human world pulls through with its action sequences, seek and destroy battles, love lost and found, chastising and baiting, we are then introduced to the CGI world of the Hulk and his nasty foe. This green over-sized gamma infested beast has anger management written all over him; big, muscular, rippling and lifelike, not a bad interpretation of the jolly green giant, personally, I would have preferred the human touch, Lou Ferrigno, you are well missed. The blending of both worlds has its moments, but these are fleeting, but overall, it's more a case of ups than down, giving this movie an atmosphere of excitement that won't frighten the kids in the isles and will hold its own in a fight with the grown-ups too.The cast fairs well, but Ms. Tyler's soft and gentle character seems more fun when see is angry (the New York taxi scene for example), Tim Roth just seems slightly disjointed here, while William Hurt can be too easily forgotten when out of shot, but this is most definitely Mr. Norton's movie, without a doubt. Like most of Edward Norton roles they're not too over powering and not too undercooked, while this easy role has its moments, we can certainly understand that the real (hard) work has been done behind the camera.The Incredible Hulk will continue to prosper for Marvel if it heads in the direction that we see here. The kids will love the action and adventure while the grown ups will reflect on the nostalgia of it all and too enjoy the benefit of CGI, all that we can hope for is that too much of a formalistic direction won't turn this green colossus into pea green soup: we wait with baited breath.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thats more like it!!!,"I hated the first Hulk effort with a passion. The franchise had bags of potential and it was never realised, even though the style was visually impressive the film had no substance. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were well cast but their characters were a bit two dimensional. All the other characters were poor.Thank heavens for take two. The focus was taken from the origins of the Hulk and more on the aftermath, which then takes the focus from the Hulk and onto Bruce Banner, which was the smartest move the director made, and there is no better actor for portraying the humanity of a character than Edward Norton. When I first saw that he was in the role I was excited at the prospect of the new dimension he would bring to Banner, and he is successful in so many ways. His portrayal, William Hurt's portrayal of The General and Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of Samuel Sterns had so much depth that it was a joy to watch them all on screen. Liv Tyler did an admirable and surprising job of surpassing Jennifer Connelly, who was one of the better performers in the first attempt. Tim Roth was somewhat below par as the main baddie, but he did the job expected of him with gusto.In terms of visual effects, its pretty much whats expected of a superhero film. The major difference from the first attempt at Hulk is the departure from the comic-book visual style. The effects are much darker, and the Hulk looks much more menacing than he did before. The tributes to the old incarnations of Hulk are well done, with the ""You won't like me when I'm angry"" speech nicely referenced, and there is a neat cameo from Lou Ferignio, who provides this Hulk's voice.I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It realised all the potential that the franchise has and does almost everything right. This and Iron Man have set the bar for superhero movies and bringing them together in the Avengers film will surely be a winner.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Incredible Hulk Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,"VISIT deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com FOR MORE REVIEWS Let's clear this up right from the offset, 'The Incredible Hulk' is not a remake of Ang Lee's 'Hulk' (2003), neither is it a sequel, the film is billed as a reboot of the franchise - which quite frankly means that it is a little bit of both. The film picks up five years after its disappointing predecessor, complete with a brand new cast, director and slightly altered back story. Confused? Don't worry, it's easier from here on in.To it's credit the film isn't concerned with what has come before, Hulk's past being explained fleetingly yet effectively in flashes during the opening credits. We are introduced to Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), alter-ego of the titular character, hiding in Brazil from General Ross (William Hurt) who wishes to use him as a military weapon. The early scenes set the plot up well and introduce the Hulk early which will delight fans frustrated with the last film.Norton deals with his role capably but one can't help but feel short-changed by an actor who has played the dual-personality role so well in 'Fight Club' amongst others, yet the script gives him little chance to convey this inner-conflict. Things really take a turn downhill when love-interest Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) is introduced. Tyler and Norton enjoy little to no chemistry, their dialogue seems forced and the occasional attempts at humour fall dreadfully flat. Tyler is distinctly insipid and struggles to match the efforts of her fellow cast-members.Banner transforms on four occasions during the course of the film and provides us with three prolonged sequences of Hulk-smashing action. Hulk's nemesis is The Abomination (Tim Roth), alter ego of the stereotypical English/Russian villain Emil Blonsky. It is their final showdown which provides the best action, including the piece de resistance as Hulk uses a car as boxing gloves. But here in lies the films greatest flaw, neither The Incredible Hulk of The Abomination look even slightly like the actors playing them, consequently all we are treated to is two large CG-blobs having a big of a ruck on the streets of New York.Bringing Hulk to the big screen, as proved before, is a difficult job and director Louis Letterrier has made an admirable attempt but yet again Hulk fails to shine, albeit for different reasons. Die-hard fans of the comic book and television shows may feel more satisfied with this version but for most viewers this will likely disappoint. Perhaps it is time Marvel accepted that although Hulk is a fantastic character with copious potential, that potential does not translate to the big screen.Verdict: Hat's off to all involved for trying something different and having the guts to change things completely. Commiserations for not pulling it off. TWO STARS OUT OF FIVE!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Norton good, action boring","I must admit I never liked the HULK concept. An angry green guy that smashes things... I do like the concept of Bruce Banner.

Far away from his earlier life we find him working in a third world factory. There's no question he want his old life back, he carries a picture of Liv Tyler with him and on his laptop he has a contact (Mr Blue) that is trying to find a solution to his HULK problem.So far, the story and acting is good. The problem with many superhero-movies is that they need super-villains. We've seen the problem with one villain too much in spiderman 3 and that is what the incredible hulk suffers from as well.

"""Hulk"" doesn't risk at all","""The incredibile Hulk"" is the black sheep of the MCU because of its very different tone and humor compared to the other MCU movies and also because there is Edward Norton as Bruce Banner (and not Mark Ruffalo). For this status a lot of people doesn't know its existence or consider it bad before watching. Instead it is a decent film, likeable, with action and a bit of fun. The real and only criticism against this movie is his regularity. Every aspect of it is simply regular, exactly what you are expecting by this type of films. There's no surprising aspects nor disappointing ones and everything is predictable. Also the last battle follows this rules: it is entertaining and visually good, but it isn't something different from a classical blockbuster movie.

Good picture - with interesting philosophical worm-cans,"Compared to Ang Lee's version of the 'Hulk'  this version is far, far better. The story is superlatively better  and of course, no matter how good Eric Bana is as an actor, Edward Norton  is better to the extreme.The plot is better too, though I will not say much about it.About Tim Roth's unnamed monster  it must be said that it had a certain potential to be improved. Something uncertain was missing  to say the least.One thing that makes everything worth seeing the film  is the interesting philosophical discussion opened when General Thaddeus Ross first  at an early stage of the movie  says: «As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the U.S. army» and somewhat later, after Bruce Banner has been treated by Dr. Samuel Sterns: «If you've taken it from me, I'm going to put you in a home for the rest of your life.» The can of worms opened here, is the general understanding that man is not his own master (not delving into any religious conceptions here), but the notion that the ""state"" as such can own a human being.That is of course not in any case true. A man is and remains his own master, with his own free will, and can not be sold  in the same way that a man cannot sell his soul to the devil  because it is not a saleable commodity.This even remains a vital part of the American Declaration of Independence, quoted in the following: «We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED,  That WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS, PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM, IT IS THEIR RIGHT, IT IS THEIR DUTY, TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT, and to provide new Guards for their future security».Since the views presented by General Ross absolutely belongs under the characterization of ""despotism"", I'd just as well wish, this would have been stated clearly  in the movie, as an explicit answer to the theories of General Thaddeus Ross",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hulk Smash!!!,"After a five year absence from the big screen, Hulk is back with more punches and kicks to throw around than a thinking brain which would hurt more movie goers than cramming for a high school exam.I'll admit that I love Ang Lee's version of the ticked off monster in which it took its time getting to know the characters before getting to the action sequences along with seeing how experiments could have consequences. Plus the cut scenes which resembled a comic book had it's high marks though it can only please those who truly love the atmosphere of comic books. This time around French director Louis Leterrier brings more anger while managing to bring depth to the lost soul of Bruce Banner (Edward Norton).""The Incredible Hulk"" is a reboot of the first movie (note: a third Hulk is in the works) in which it pays homage to the classic 1970's series with Edward Norton (taking over Eric Bana) playing the title character after a failed experiment left him to turn into the Hulk while hurting the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler taking over the Jennifer Connelly role) and becoming a fugitive as he hides in Brazil working in a soda factory. It's not long when Betty's father, the indestructible General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt taking over for Sam Elliot), finds a report that an elderly man has drinking a piece of gamma radiation and immediately finds the location of Bruce where the general gets a British/Russian import soldier by the name of Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help track down Bruce.The action doesn't take much long before Bruce is bullied by a few thugs which leads him to turn into the Hulk smashing and throwing his enemies before going after the secret military. Bruce is now on the run as he wants to head back into the states to find the love of his life along with seeking a cure for his disease while Blonsky convinces his boss to give him the same radiation that made Bruce into the monster he is and having a one on one action.With the film under two hours, The Incredible Hulk is great entertainment and a way of apologizing to those who hated the first Hulk movie in which those who seek mile-a-minute thrill rides will be pleased. The film's got everything from a wild battles, wit humor and while the performances are not Oscar-memorable, I really cared for Norton as the title character where he wanted to rid his curse while remembering from 2003's Hulk that Eric Bana's version actually liked being angry. Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt are good as well along with Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Sterns.A note to all comic book historians or lovers, make sure to check out for Avenger references along with the last scene in the film when a certain character makes a cameo appearance.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, Not Great, Good","This movie came off of Iron Man which did almost everything right. That's why this movie disappointed me a lot. It was supposed to be the next big movie in the franchise, but instead, it was a letdown. There still were good parts like Ed Norton, and William Hurt. The story was at least a little interesting. The Hulk scenes are cool to see. Sometimes, I have fun watching this, but other times I can't. The music intensifies the action scenes, so that's good. Overall, it's not a terrible movie. It's not great though. It's just good.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so incredible,"Not so incredible. I was anxious to see The Incredible Hulk because of the ratings on IMDb and the trailers looked intriguing. Perhaps due to high expectations, the movie left me expecting much more.If you want to see a good super hero flick, see The Dark Knight  a superior show in every respect. Although Iron Man was not as good as the Dark Knight, it was also substantially better than this movie.While the movie did not get off to an overly poor start, it quickly lost its footing. It became slow during the sappy portions of the film. While I generally like Liv Tyler, I found her miscast in this movie. She just does not strike me as the academic type.The movie wasn't all bad. Edward Norton was good as always. I also thought Tim Blake Nelson had a semi-interesting role.Is this really worth a 3? Maybe a bit higher, but I wanted to add some balance with regards to most of the other ratings this movie has received.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time to end the franchise.,"I don't know why, but the Hulk has enjoyed very limited success on the silver screen. I remember watching the cartoons as a kid, I wasn't a huge fan but it was enjoyable. I didn't quite enjoy the first one by Ang Lee, and I barely managed to finish Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk, despite it starring Edward Norton who is one of my favorite actors.Edward is so wasted here. His role does not require any special skills or talents at all, Bruce Banner could've been played by Matt Damon and it would just be the same. The reason I used Damon as an example is because he is also good at playing characters on the run, ala the Bourne series. I honestly did not really notice any of Norton's special acting abilities, such as his intense speeches or extremely in-depth moments. Bruce Banner is just a guy on the run, and a bit of a romantic. Liv Tyler is even worse, she is her usual bland self. She's quite good looking, but I remember her from Lord of the Rings and Armageddon, and she played the SAME bland characters with her bland emotionless acting. This isn't a criticism of her acting ability as a whole, since I haven't seen all her films, but her role contributes even more boring to an already very boring film. To make matters worse, The Incredible Hulk is filmed so dark, even darker than The Dark Knight. I could barely make out the last action scene. Oh and I know we should suspend belief for action hero flicks like these, but in the last scene where the helicoper ripped vulcan cannon fire at the Hulk right onto civilian buildings... uhh okay.....It's odd really, what is it with superhero films and bland acting? Toby Maguire's Spider-Man, Christian Bale's Batman (incredible actor, but again his abilities severely limited as Bruce Wayne), Neo in The Matrix, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars II. I guess Robert Downey Jr's Ironman is one of the more successful projects in recent times, which is why the movie ended up so popular and even worthy of comparison to the powerhouse that is The Dark Knight. Ironically, the last scene reflects this as if to add insult to injury.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Green and not Mean...before it got to be a money Machine,"Maybe if this movie went out now, it would get a much lower grade and Attitude. Ed Norton was pretty upset with the writing and a lot of stuff didn't work in this half sequel half remake and the second try from Marvel studios to present the green angry man, once again and almost five years after the first failure.The plot is pretty generic, in terms of Marvel's standards and nothing is refreshing as Tony Stark's appearance, several years earlier, but... and there is a but to this thing; this universe has invented itself during some significant stages and the hulk getting into it was one of them.He is the one that needs to avoid getting angry and he is still misses his loved one and scared of getting back to the place that banished him once. We all know what is going to happen and if we are looking retrospectively, we all know and aware that none of the antagonists will take place in the MCU.Maybe it was because they weren't interesting enough or unknown to the general audience and maybe that was not the reason, but no matter how you are looking on the facts - the hulk continued his way to be a part of the Avengers and the MCU. The rest of his path covered both unpopular single movies - the rest is well known to all of fans and the rest of world also.On these days, when we are tired of superhero movies, it is nice to find a movie that didn't had any aspirations to be something you won't forget; it wanted to be a milestone in the MCU and let the rest to flow and move on. It was familiar, good enough and had a proper team, that made a good job and that's that.It is like an innocence before the money-grabbing machine got into the business and started throwing a bunch of unknow heroes or such that no one cares about them. Let us feed from Liv Tyler and Ed Norton's love story, let us see a giant hulk crash and smash and even Tim Roth get greedy with power. Wrap it up within less than two hours and...We don't actually need anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Edward Norton >>>> Mark Ruffalo,"The Incredible Hulk is much more serious than all the other MCU movies. That's probably the reason why I really love this movie. It feels fresh and new. The story feels original but a bit rushed. I would've liked more than one Hulk solo movie. Edward Norton was a better Hulk than Mark Ruffalo in my opinion. He felt like a more believable Bruce Banner and his acting was far superior than what Mark Ruffalo did. This movie is sooo underrated, I definitely recommend watching it if you haven't already.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sulk on the run,"Bruce Banner is a man on the run in this one starting with the nice location of Brazil. This film isn't bad, but doesn't have the strongest of plots compared with other comic book films. Edward Norton does a worthy Job of Bruce Banner and his love interest Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) shows nice chemistry. You feel the emotional depth of seperation and loneliness for Bruce. You can empathise with his loneliness and issues of contamination due to the gamma radiation as he is hunted down by general thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is harmless, intelligent, reserved and condemned from society to an extent worried about anger and rage and how to prevent this. His only friend at first is online in the name of Mr Blue. Somebody he has never even met. The imprint of what modern society has become in some cases of today's world. Often the world we live in now is consumed by online, such as social media and texting as it is becoming more and more clear this is just the tip of the iceberg. Bruce goes about a general warehouse job in isolation trying to keep what's inside at bay. (Tim Roth) plays one of the army soldiers trying to take out the Hulk and ultimately becomes the Abomination. We can see the transformation in Tim Roth as he manages what's inside and the inevitability of it taking over. Although even before, he had a taste for destruction.Emulating parts of the King Kong story and how the general refuses to see anything but a monster inside the Hulk. General thunderbolt Ross has an obsession with weaponising the gamma radiation incident by injecting it out of Banner. Only his daughter can see more to the Hulk and who he truly is inside, Bruce Banner. Unfortunately her father believes she is blinded by love and not thinking clear. This kinda story also has similarities to films like the original Terminator as Kyle Reese is also a man on the run. Banner is exiled from any kind of normal life going from city to city unable to avoid conflict.Again it feels a bit like a broken record to say the cgi and special effects were outstanding again like most Marvel films and especially considering this is one of the older ones. The tone is much darker and this has the least comedic dialogue so far. The reason this one receives a slightly lower score for me is mainly due to the story, it's a very linear one dimensional plot with limited depth to its characters. The character development for the film gave it less impacted, sure there was shades of emotional scenes and I felt empathy for Banner yet it was missing something. In simple terms it was no King Kong.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
WEAK in Sooo Many Area's..... True Let Down,"Where do I start...? The writing was probably the weakest aspect of this film with the directing close behind.The pace of the film...? Seemed they wanted to build a fairly strong drama base yet it kept going on and on without good dialogue to support it.I thought the CGI was 'far' below that of the 2003 version. Previous Hulk actually had depth! Emotion facially as well as in body language. This version seemed to have none. And the CGI being so bad that it was literally distracting.Liv Tyler... she normally doesn't stand out for me however in my opinion, she did the most with her part, even more then Norton. And I'm a Norton fan yet he seemed to be less engaged characteristically then most of his other work.Tim Roth... good effort however I just didn't buy him and I believe only due the director.William Hurt as the General... Good choice, he did a decent job. Yet one major deficit to his character was he would flip flop so drastically on the connection with his daughter. One moment he couldn't care much less about her let alone help you believe he was her father. And the next, he's demanding she be protected, Huh?I believe the ultimate downfall is owed to the Director for not joining all the pieces together to make an entertaining and well told story. His direction was weak, kept a weak script, infused no chemistry between the characters and the sad thing about it.... is other then a 'better writer' being needed, he had everything else from budget to talent to tent pole to make this film bring the character of the Hulk into the league it should and could be.Why the suits let such an inexperienced director like Louis Leterrier helm such an important character and film is beyond me.

Hulk Smash Puny Box Office,"Come to think of it, ballet has a lot in common with super hero comics...the story being merely an excuse, a framework to show off the artists skill with the form. That and the melodrama...the acrobatics...and the tights...""-Bryan TalbotEven though this movie makes some small attempts at back story, it's very easy to view this movie as a sequel to Ange Lee's Hulk, for instance Ang Lee's film ends with Banner in South America, and this film begins with Banner in South America.Like many sequels, we begin with action already taking place, and characters who already have experiences with each other. Unlike Lee's Oedipul Comic Book come to screen, ""The Incredible Hulk"", exchanges pathos for chance to see Hulk slug it out on a crowded downtown street with ""The Abomination""(another big mutated guy).If super hero stories are action ballet's where the central character is just a big symbolic suite(or costume), to add some differentiation between this particular dance, and the next one, than the Incredible Hulk, is well worth the watching if only for it's exercises in special effect slug fests between giant monsters(which is at the heart of every Hulk comic).The first movie set up the pins of the story(but lacked a substantial comic book villain, the Oedipal stuff with the father made sense it just didn't make the most thrilling action spectacle to watch), this film while having no emotional core to the volatile Hulk/Banner dichotomy, does have plenty of ""Hulk Smash!"", not as charming, and appealing as Iron Man. Good for those who like the ballet, bad for those who can't kick without content.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A remake of a remake and shows it.,"FIrst, Edward Norton is no Bill Bixby and second, how many ""Hulks"" does this movie need? This movie has several glaring weaknesses: first, the acting is laughable. Tim Roth must be considered as a candidate for the worst actor award for 2008. Second, the story is simplistic. Man is sick, man gets angry, man becomes a monster. Duh. Third, the special effects are almost cartoonish. Is this movie actually a cartoon interspersed with live acting? This confusion of style is now typical of most Hollywood action/sci-fi movies. Fourth, little character development. The characters are two-dimensional facsimiles directly out of the Hollywood potboiler mold. Liv Tyler's performance is utterly flat. It's not her fault; it's the material she has to work with. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford probably would have fared little better, but at least they would have given the role a little more flare. This movie is a remake of a remake and shows it, a really empty vessel. No originality. Intellectually empty.

The Incredible Crap,"The 2003 film version of The Incredible Hulk is absolutely cheesy, lame and crap and this film version of the 80's T.

They also got the name wrong in this film version of the original 80's T. V Programme. In the original 80's The Incredible Hulk, actor Bill Bixby played David Banner, but they got Edward Norton to act in this crap film and call his character Bruce Banner. This film doesn't even deserve or should have got a rating of 6.8 out of 10, it is a film which definitely is very cheesy. The Hulk in this film looks like a cheesy cartoon character, compared to the original Hulk which looked much more scarier. Definitely this film is very cheesy and is just absolutely rubbish.

But on the other hand, you have a very simple story with moments that are repeated, like the chase scenes, really bad cgi at some moments, some characters that come out of nowhere, and a kinda forgettable story if youre not really into superheroes.

Bring Back Lou Ferrigno,"Having read some reviews before I saw it, I thought this film was going to be absolutely terrible, but it was not nearly so bad as people were making out. I think a lot of people were expecting far too much in terms of depth of character, and for every detail and relationship between characters to exactly reflect the thinking of the original comic writers. Well that might have pleased the comic fanatics, but it isn't going to fill the cinemas with the easily-entertained masses.I have never read a Hulk comic, but I am a massive fan of the 70's/early 80's TV series with Bill Bixby. Hence I disliked the first Hulk film of 2003 very much.I was expecting more of the same with this film, but was surprised to see that it did resemble the sort of dumb-ass Hulk entertainment that I know and love much more than the first film.Ed Norton made a quite good David Banner - same sort of down-trodden far too nice born victim, and not too far off Bill Bixby's character. He looked quite hard in American History X, but now looks like Mr Puniverse.Tim Roth - I can never take him seriously no matter what he does, since seeing him in 'Made In Britain' screaming ""Oi, I want my lunch!"" at Borstal canteen staff. His character, and indeed the stupid-looking second monster - which resembled Skeletor after taking a huge overdose of steroids - were rather unnecessary and added little to the film.The plot was OK without looking too deeply at some of the ridiculous exploits of the hulk - such as running virtually all the way from Brazil to Mexico in one night, and the usual unlikely way in which Banner's trousers can be expanded to the size of a house, yet still remain in one piece.I do wish that they would use a human actor to play the Hulk instead of this computer-generated rubbish. The hulk in this film just looked totally unbelievable and little like anything that a human could have possibly changed into. The Lou Ferrigno hulk was (relatively) believable and far more convincing and frightening than some 15 foot tall looney-toon.The other thing that was missing and I wish it would be reinstated is the ""DING!"" sound when Banner's metamorphosis commences. It just isn't the same without that.I have given it 6/10. I'd probably watch it again if it was on TV.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Incredible Hulk,"So the ""Gamma Bomb"" has done it's stuff and ""Banner"" (Edward Norton) has got to find some way to control his newly found, bodice-ripping powers - there must have been quite a bit of lycra in his trousers! Anyway, desperate for a cure and on the run from army general ""Ross"" (William Hurt) he alights on that man's daughter - and his ex-girlfriend - ""Betty"" (Liv Tyler) to help him sort himself out. ""Ross"" isn't the giving up easily type, though, and he engages the help of British killing machine ""Blonsky"" (Tim Roth). Tired of coming off second best in their battles, this man decides that he too must find a way to mutate - setting up the prospect of a battle royal between the two powerhouses of brute strength and terrible skin conditions. It's watchable, this, but I always found the ""Hulk"" stories amongst the most boring from amongst the comic characters. Norton enters into the spirit of things well enough, as does the always reliable Roth, but neither William Hurt nor the terribly sterile Tyler really add any richness to this otherwise procedural fantasy. The visual effects are efficient, the pyrotechnics likewise but the sum of these parts just doesn't really add up to much of an whole as it concludes in the only way it can.

Perhaps they had an idea, why these films would resonate where it counts. Time will tell if the company will retain that knack. This film is offensive , one way.

Great Performance by Norton,"The Incredible Hulk (2008)*** (out of 4)Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), not being able to control his powers, goes to Brazil to hide from his past but he ends up back in the states once the government comes after him. With the help of a former flame (Liv Tyler) he tries to learn to control himself but soon he's got an enemy (Tim Roth) gunning for him. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a pretty good comic adaptation that even those people who aren't fans of comics should enjoy. I think there's a lot of good stuff going on in the picture but I'd say the majority of the credit has to go to Norton for his great performance. When I heard Norton was going to be appearing in a comic movie it took me by surprise because he really doesn't seem to be the type. If rumors are true and he was unhappy with the film it really doesn't show. I thought Norton did a terrific job at showing the characters wide emotions as he fights himself to try and not turn into that towering green guy. I thought the human element Norton was able to bring to the part not only made you feel for the character but it also built up the other relationships in the film. Tyler's character isn't nearly as well-written but I thought she was fine in her part as was William Hurt playing the bad General. Roth is always fun in villain roles and that remains true here. The CGI in the film is rather obvious at times but I thought the filmmakers did a nice job with the Hulk character. The visual look of him was quite good and I thought he blended into the scenes well. The action scenes are all at a high level and especially the final battle.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The biggest difference from your typical action movie is this film is all about the typical us mentality. If they cant own it or control it, then try to destroy it. Actually I am wrong about that last statement. its not very different from the typical us action movie.
The part that I do not (or ever) get is the fact that the us thinks it can go into any country, blow up a bunch of sht and think that its just fine. If some other country did the same on us soil they would say its an act of terrorism. But apparently the us military can do what they want, when they want, how they want all without consequence.

It wasn't really bad either but clearly inferior to the other two. The entire story just was just building up the main fight, the movie felt forced a lot. Special effects weren't always top notch, many of Hulk's animations looked unnatural. I also expected more action scenes - he turns into Hulk just three times! Ironman also had only three big action/fighting scenes but Ironman also had all those scenes where he was improving and testing the suits. When the final battle started I had this ""Okay, just get it over with"" feeling and wasn't excited at all. But I have to say that Tim Roth gave a wonderful performance as Hulks adversary.

one of the worst mcu movies,"""The Incredible Hulk"" is not a good movie. This is a monotonous, boring film with good CGI, and you can't argue, but the rest is forgetful. Edward Norton performs well, as do Tim Roth and William Hurt, but the rest of the actors have made me a little bit turn my nose. The plot is about Bruce Banner, a scientist who after an experiment takes gamma radiation that allows him to transform into the Hulk. But in this film he is looking for a cure, since this power is also problematic for his life. The problem is that I think we had better get into Bruce's life before the experiment, then build his first transformation and only then the way to cure himself. Also I understood little the intentions of the villain, Abomination, in my opinion thrown there just to insert the character. Moreover, I think the action scenes are really mediocre, there are times when I felt like watching or playing a video game, sometimes horrible visuals with senseless fights. The direction of Leterrier is therefore for me super failed. One thing I didn't like (but it doesn't refer to the movie) is that even after replacing Edward Norton he left this canonical film in the MCU. I understand the post-credit scene, but the film had to be in a universe of its own, simply a Hulk movie. I had seen this film before and thought it was ugly, now the rating has improved, but it is still not enough for me..

A very good movie among its genre,"To comment on this movie I will do a comparison between the Eric Bana (EB) version and this the Edward Norton (EN) version. The first thing to say is that what the EN version has demonstrated is that with some screenplays/directors you can tell a story in 2 minutes what some screenplays/directors take half an hour to do. The EN version told us the audience in two minutes how Bruce Banner came to be the Hulk while the EB version took half an hour of valuable film time. Secondly the EN version stuck more or less to the TV series of the Hulk that featured the late Bill Bixby while the EB version went off on some weird tangent bringing in Bruce Banner's father into the equation. I was also particularly touched by the tribute to Bill Bixby that was in the EN version while also giving the great Lou Feringo (He is the TV version of The Incredible Hulk if you didn't know) a speaking part with him exchanging dialogue with his alter ego (David Banner) so to speak. To be fair the Hulk action scenes in the two versions were comparable but the idea of the super soldier in the EN version was easier for me to accept than the Father Son conflict as given to us in the EB version. I also liked the way the EN version once again paid tribute to the Bill Bixby TV series. This was done when Bruce Banner met Betty again. For those of you too young to have see the television series of the Incredible Hulk, the regular feature in that series was Bruce Banner thumbing a lift. So I have given this version of The Incredible Hulk 9 out of Ten and hope to see more!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fun for Rental with a  group of friends...but thats all you'll get,"When I first saw that this movie was coming out to theaters...I was a little disappointed. My first reaction was ""oh great. another unneeded remake. most likely just to make a quick buck"". I will also add that I was surprised and relieved after i viewed this film because it was not at all what I had expected at first. and come on Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt all together...that's the sign of great potential to be a good film. Overall, it was a ""decent"" (don't take that word for any more than I'm trying to use it as) film that at least kept me awake and maybe a little interested. it definitely had its downfalls (for example: who goes to watch a movie called ""The Incredible Hulk"" to watch a bunch of people discuss what they should do?....no! they come to watch Hulk Smash!!!! So, my suggestion is that they should have shown more Hulk than just the characters running from each other). Anyways, I will compare this film to the original because I didn't mind the original...even though it seems everyone else did. I thought it wasn't as bad as everyone said, but that's not the important issue. I believe this movie and the original are about the same, so if you hated the original I wouldn't give this a try, but if you loved the original then don't expect any differences but do expect coming out with a good feeling. So, even though I didn't come out that disappointed there were still some pretty major flaws that brought it down on its knees. It's just the same old superhero concept; The main character has superhuman abilities, has to learn to control them and use them for good, the conflict arises as another equally powerful villain, and thus ending in a great battle between good vs. evil and, of course, good comes out victorious. 6/10 for enjoyment reasons only....oh and P.S. ***spoilers (not bad ones though) spoilers*** Robert Downey Jr. makes a surprise appearance at the end as Mr. Tony Stark (Iron Man) in which he discusses with one of the main characters that he and his group are thinking about making a team...most likely hinting that there will be a movie with all the superheroes and villains to make one colossal movie (something along the lines of The Avengers)...that got me excited.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

How are you feeling? Like a monster.,"When this movie came out, practically no one knew this existed in the same universe as Iron Man. There are clear signs in the opening credits with quick mentions of Stark Industries and Nick Fury. People in theaters didn't know that you were supposed to stay after the credits for the post-credits scene. Thanks to this movie, the Avengers wasn't just a dream, it was a possibility. Besides this, the movie itself was actually decent. Not great, not bad, just watchable.Let's first focus on the big man himself, Bruce Banner/Hulk. I really liked Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Banner in the comics, is drawn as a really small, unassuming man. Norton did a great job because he did look frail, yet very smart. His version of the Hulk is clearly better than 2003 and actually looks threatening and powerful. His strength is very clear, with his muscles and veins popping out and the clear sense of rage that is fueling him, rather than Ang Lee's version.The villain in the film is Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky/Abomination. Despite his final form just being a evil, reptilian version of the Hulk, his development was very good. An aging soldier, wanting to continue to fight, taking a experimental serum and getting more and more insane and rebellious. Roth is an incredible actor, who I loved in Tarantino films, and he expertly portrays the crazed fighter who wants to get the job done.The action was a lot better with the Hulk fighting off the army as well as his final duel with the Abomination. Seeing the Hulk destroy a car to use as boxing gloves was awesome. The tone in this movie was well done as well as we could feel the desperation, fear and insecurity that Banner felt throughout the movie.There were obviously aspects in this movie that I didn't like. First off, Samuel Sterns. A great character in the comics and a tremendous villain that can be used in the MCU. However, thanks to the restrictive terms by Universal Pictures, it looks like he won't be coming around which is a shame because Tim Blake Nelson was good as a wacko doctor. I also wasn't a big fan of Liv Tyler's Betty Ross. While she was undoubtedly better than 2003's Jennifer Connelly, who forgot to portray any emotion, I didn't really feel any chemistry between her and Bruce. Tyler is a good actress, like in LotR, but I still felt that she could've been better in this film.+ Norton's Banner/Hulk + Roth's Blonsky/Abomination + Overall Tone and Action + Connection to Iron Man and confirms shared universe - Universal Pictures total control over character rights - Love interest lacking7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Honestly, not great","I'm not a big fan of the Hulk but I do enjoy myself some Marvel comics. I saw the 2003 version or whatever year it came out and didn't enjoy it much. I enjoyed this one more, but it still wasn't great. I dislike CG, so I hated the fact that the Hulk, the Abomination and more were CG. It looked really unnatural (not that they look natural to begin with) but still. The effects and action were quite unrealistic and silly. The acting was bad and I'm sad to say that Edward Norton just didn't do it for me in this movie. He's one of my favorite actors. Liv Tyler was confusing and the worst of the cast. She would whisper too much, yell too much, cry too much, and it was ridiculous. I don't think that Hulk fans will love this movie either. He only says 'Hulk Smash' once and he doesn't make many appearances anyway. However, it did have a greatly satisfying ending, and there were some cool action sequences in it. It's a very mediocre movie so stay away unless you're a big Hulk fan and HAVE to see it, or you're bored sometime.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
B-movie with poor acting - only good for Hulk fans,"I watched the movie tonight but with little pleasure. it had some nice moments, but in general, it felt like a B-movie from the 90s due to its bad camerawork (including split screen stuff), poor acting by especially William Hunt and Nick Nolte and the very amateuristic special effects. I felt no empathy for the actors with the exception of the good performance of Liv Tyler, and even the more action-oriented scenes were executed poorly.in short - havent seen a movie this bad in a very long time, and would not recommend to anyone other than big Hulk fans.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Incredible, but certainly serviceable","This is sort of the Jan Brady of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It doesn't reach the dizzying heights of 'Iron Man', 'The Avengers' or 'Captain America: Winter Soldier', but it's also not as languid and shrugtacular as 'Iron Man 3' or 'Thor: The Dark World'.Edward Norton makes for a solid Bruce Banner in this man-on-the-run format, but I think Ruffalo is a better fit for 'The Avengers'. The Hulk himself still doesn't always appear photo-real here, and the re-design--where you can almost smell the Bead Head pomade in his artfully unkempt hair--left him looking like a giant green Hot Topic employee. The biggest problem, however, is that it all feels inconsequential.It plays its role in the set-up for 'The Avengers', and it's moderately entertaining to boot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Smashes Expectations,"The Edward Norton version of The Incredible Hulk is a lost nugget in the MCU. As a stand-alone film, it does more to connect the universe than any Avengers film when you consider all the references to the Avengers, yet it's one of the more forgettable films in the MCU. And it's not because it's a bad film-because it's not. It's because this isn't the Hulk that Mark Ruffalo embodied and turned into the fun-loving brute with anger management problems that we've all come to love. This is The Incredible Hulk as envisioned by a producer at DC, not Marvel-dark, brooding, yet competently executed. It's entertaining, just not memorable.The film starts in South America, with Banner in hiding, mastering breathing techniques from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighters and working at a bottle factory. He works with a band of scummy warehouse workers who sexually harass their co-workers and taunt him. Of course, they're just props for the Hulk to justifiably smash in between social messaging a scientist who is supposed to help him find a cure. Of course, Banner can't take a leak without the government tracking his scent, and the mad dog sent to track him is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), an angry Black-Ops guy with age insecurities. Luckily, the government just happens to have some of that handy Captain America super-soldier serum to give him, and unlike Rogers, the serum amplifies Blonsky's worst attributes. When Blonsky attempts to go one-on-one with the green one, and it ends with nearly catastrophic results for Blonsky. So note to Cap, don't fight don't Hulk. Leave that to Thor. Liv Tyler stars as Banner's estranged lover, Betty Ross, the daughter of the stone-faced general Admiral Ross, that's hunting the Hulk. She's completely wasted as a whispery and dotting ex who seems to serve the male gaze and not explore Liv's talents as an actress.The film boasts some thrilling action sequences, so it has that going for it. The first battle between the military and the Hulk is fast, hard-hitting and badass. It's a huge improvement over the Ang Lee version that lulled audiences to sleep with psychedelic colors, mutant dogs, and real-life comic book frames that played out simultaneously to confuse everyone. No, this film doesn't make that mistake; it makes new mistakes.Instead of building off of Blonsky as a human super soldier threat, they decide the only way he can battle the Hulk, is as a Hulk, or as comic book fans know him-Abomination. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the creation of Abomination happened earlier and presented an increasingly difficult challenge for the Hulk. At no point do you ever feel like the Hulk might lose? Abomination is literally a throw-away character that even Marvel chooses to forget about when it comes to the MCU. Toss in the dark and muddy tone of the film, and you have yourself just a run of the mill smash 'em up film in New York.

"Not the best film of the summer, but pretty darn close!","I must say that this film is exactly what a Hulk film should be. It should be a mix of 'The Fugitive' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. The last film wasn't like that at all. Matter of fact, the plot plodded in places, ruining the momentum. None of that here.Having said that, it's still not the best film of the summer. Why? Well, there's not enough emotional investment into the relationship between Bruce and Betty. What's there on film is great, but a bit more back-history would be nice as well. I wonder if that's what Edward Norton was aiming for before Marvel decided to truncate the film. Regardless, I can't wait to see the additional footage in the Blu-ray and DVD version. If that relationship is fleshed out more, it would almost be the perfect Hulk film. As such for the theater release, it's very strong, but more could have been done.There are some very jaw-dropping scenes in this film, but at the same time, this Hulk seems more human somehow, compared to the last film. This Hulk can actually be hurt, and there's real pain that shows on his face, especially when he fights Abomination. This adds a depth of character to this normally one-dimensional portrayal in the other film. I don't recall any particular moment where the Hulk in the other movie was in pain, or even if he bled. Good move by Marvel to make him a more human monster.If anybody was concerned about whether or not this movie is better than the last Hulk film, rest assured that Marvel learned their lesson. The only complaint I have is what I said before; I believe Marvel wanted a film to so totally not be like the other one that they removed a good portion of the pathos from it in order to move things along. However, any complaint about that will have to wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release. I can't wait! Meanwhile, go watch the film and enjoy what's there.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Incredible, not incredible?","It boils down to this: what makes The Incredible Hulk incredible? Is it the newly appointed Edward Norton? Or love-interest Liv Tyler? Actually, it loses out on incredible credibility, as Norton's Bruce Banner chooses to flee rather than fight. He's a passive man on the run from the U.S. Army, looking for a cure. His ability to change in to a raging muscle-man is what they want.TIH covers the origin story in the opening credits (sensible move, we've seen it before with Ang Lee's The Hulk). Banner's brute only surfaces when the army won't leave him be. Leave him alone they do not, as they crunch the middle act in to overdrive. Super- human military nut-job Tim Roth makes a cool central villain (the showdown is glorious). Tyler trades whimsical damsel for astute catalyst. It's our second helping on the lead-up to an Avengers movie. Leterrier's effort is a noble one, as Marvel know what direction they're heading.

The screenplay is so appalling that it makes George Lucas seems like Charles Dickens.,"Many fans of Marvel comics will be outraged by my score for The Incredible Hulk. After Iron Man which was only average by my standards, I thought Marvel could do no worse. They fail to realize that bringing in a quality director is immensely crucial to a film's critical success. Fair enough, Iron Man was Jon Favreau's fourth feature film after Zathura's unlikely hit.That cannot be said of The Incredible Hulk, whose director Louis Leterrier has a poor track record, making bad pictures such as Transporter 2 and Unleashed. Financially, The Incredible Hulk will score big because of its wide fanbase, as well as being strategically released after Iron Man. However, critically it is a whole level below Ang Lee's Hulk.If there's one aspect that The Incredible Hulk does well over Ang Lee's version, it's the visual effects. The grayish-green title character is digitally rendered so well that it makes Ang Lee's light-green monster seem cartoonish in comparison. The action sequences have more in quantity but lack in quality, though the climatic battle between the Incredible Hulk and an even more hulky nemesis is a notch more thrilling than the lackluster one in Iron Man.Edward Norton is not well-cast, but he's a more solid actor than the spiritless Eric Bana in the earlier Hulk. Another miscast is Liv Tyler who plays Bruce Banner's love interest. The awkward drama scenes between them are so incompetent that their character developments are half-baked.To make matters worse, at least Iron Man was enjoyable. Alas, The Incredible Hulk abandons the most fundamental quality of cinema - to entertain. The screenplay is so appalling that it makes George Lucas seems like Charles Dickens. No creative input and narrative breakthrough, the story of Bruce Banner is told in the most uninspired manner even for a comic book character.I'm not against Marvel, but they are definitely alienating the critical half of cinema lovers by their choice of filmmakers. Yes, The Incredible Hulk will appeal to hardcore fans, though the scary part is not the huge green ogre itself but how these people actually part their money so nonchalantly.SCORE: 4.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As bad as people say?,"Is this movie really bad? No. It is flawed though. To many, this may even be the worst film in the MCU. The story isn't what you'd probably expect since it's the first time Hulk is in the MCU and not being an origin story. The story is still good and engaging as Bruce Banner is being hunted by the government. The theme isn't really clear and I have to guess what it is. I'm thinking acceptance? The acting seems off but it feels like it's more on the director. The cast is great but some ways lines that were delivered could've been fixed and redone. Like Iron Man, the cinematography may make the movie feel out of place from the MCU. In fact, it is the most out of place feeling movie in the MCU, mainly because of Norton's recast to Mark Ruffalo. The pacing is fine and the effects still hold up from 2008, some things are even noticeably practical which is a good thing. The sound is good but I'm not a fan of the music and score.

"Well, The Incredible Hulk Is Finally... Incredible","Finally, this is similar to what I call ""The Batman Solution."" Some people dislike this movie's lack of a superhero movie feeling, or for better analogy the feeling of a ""Classic Hulk Movie,"" but that's really not what the Hulk's first outing should be about. It should have the same thematic journey as the comics, which of course this movie had as the comic makers made it this time. It's the same problem with Batman, they've never gotten his character right with the same flawless thematic formation as the comic version, instead creating their own version that's almost in name, action, and task only but essentially not Batman. The Hulk movies and shows ALL had this same problem, their version being Bruce is smart and Hulk is dumb and end of story, when it really is not that black and white and fundamentally not the Hulk. This movie finally got it right, and I think it will be better remembered in retrospect just because people aren't used to a Hulk movie that has as deep an insight into both the characters of the Hulk and Banner as this movie and were busy looking for an action movie, which the Hulk's first outing should not be and thankfully wasn't.It starts out with Banner and the Hulk as rival forces, co-existing, Banner actually contradicting the superhero movie aesthetic and going on a journey to rid himself of his powers, not stop a villain. This chronicle perfectly mirrors the first Hulk arc ever in the comics, and it is essential to defining the chemistry between the Hulk and Banner. Banner hates the Hulk because he does not recognize he is the offspring of him and is his reflection so he only sees potential for destruction and hate and thus wants to kill this new life-form. The Hulk, although simple minded he's not stupid, hates Banner because he can only be angry and never happy or else Banner locks him up in his cage of Banner's inner mind again, never to be happy or safe when he's free, and also hating the fact Banner wants to kill him. Subtly, without realizing it, the audience roots for the Hulk because of this, feeling bad for him. But when we see in the final scenes that Bruce recognizes the Hulk can be used for good and thus form an uneasy respect for each other, their chemistry is taken to a new level of respect. Bruce can now control the Hulk for good, and thus in any future Hulk movies the Hulk can now go battle evil because Banner has a reason to do so, trusting the creature. This chemistry is incredible, and shouldn't be lost in a proper Hulk film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great beginning,"This movie was solid, and that's really all I can say about it. It's very decent, easy to watch and as far as popcorn movies go, I've seen much, much worse. That said, it's still one of the weakest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in my opinion. Does that make it a bad film? Not at all, but for me this film had the least amount of awe in it. It just didn't immediately connect with me like the other films did.So what does the movie get right? Well, the cast is very solid. Edward Norton is a very good choice to play the main character, as he has that kind of geeky yet understatedly dangerous quality to him. You can see that he's a peaceful man, but you really shouldn't mess with him. Ergo, the perfect Hulk. The rest of the actors didn't disappoint either, although Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns was a bit too all over the place for my tastes. But that's just me, as I've heard that most people like him just fine. I personally enjoyed Liv Tyler very much as Banner's (ex-)girlfriend Elizabeth Ross. That woman has the ability to capture your attention by just walking into the scene. In addition, the action was very well choreographed, being fast-paced, creative and easy to follow. The special effects look a bit out-dated by today's standards, mostly those dealing with the Hulk himself, but they weren't that bad.So what didn't work? Well, I think the biggest problem is that the film takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously. It lacked that slight tongue in cheek humour that all the other Marvel films would have after this one. They also dealt with serious issues, but they were meant to entertain first and foremost. This film had some good jokes and I laughed from time to time, but it was still kind of dark for a superhero film. Not a bad thing, necessarily, if your main character is someone like, say, Daredevil, but when he's a humongous green giant... some humour wouldn't have gone amiss. And that's not to say that there isn't great tragedy to be found in the character of Hulk, and that is explored admirably in this film, but that tragedy needs humour to balance it.Furthermore, the story wasn't that captivating as a whole. It hit most of the right notes and was well-written for the most part, but I did find it the slightest bit boring. It just seemed to go by so fast. Hulk had a problem, Hulk was presented with a solution, Hulk tried to reach the said solution, Hulk encountered some resistance, rinse and repeat. Plus, the villain of the film wasn't that interesting either. He was played by an entertaining actor (Tim Roth), but he never really rose above the usual blood knight/wardog clichés.Still, it's not a bad film. If you're a fan of superhero movies, I'd definitely give this one a watch, and even if you're not, I'd say that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not 'Marvel' enough for most fans, this is an entertaining and character-focused flick that's better than it gets (or doesn't get) credit for being.","'The Incredible Hulk (2008)' feels the least 'Marvel' of all the 'MCU', though the fact that a pseudo-series of non-directly linked films can have a 'feel' is slightly worrying and indicative of the greater 'Marvel problem' that I won't get into here'. It's actually quite refreshing, though, as it tells a rather insular and small tale that's true to the character, thanks in part to the rewrites done by the lead - who was such a fan of the eponymous hero he decided that he should be allowed to take a crack at the script. The piece also never really seems like it properly lets the hero loose, however. Indeed this version of the 'Hulk' is more of a character-study than anything else, a dark examination of the inner psyche that fuels his rage-induced transformation, and in this way it almost fails as the origin story it was intended to be. How this is supposed to directly transpose to Ruffalo's later, and arguably better, incarnation is anyone's guess. The picture as a whole is certainly not as bad as most people tend to give (or not give) it credit for and is actually quite interesting and entertaining throughout. It hits home the 'anger management' aspect that has essentially been lost, especially since 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' and its third-act reveal. This flick's issues mostly pertain to the cumbersome fact that it isn't quite 'Marvel' enough for most fans, especially when looked at retroactively. Really, it should be looked at as a stand-alone, though that's increasingly hard to do, and - even though it pales in comparison to what the studio would go on to do - it is a pretty strong piece in its own right. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Elf and her Orc,"So Arwen is back and this time she's even with an Orc. Optically, Liv Tyler looks even more like an elf now, than ever before, with her really extremely long face. People might criticize her acting, but its hard to look good next to a Edward Norton, and personally I didn't mentioned any flaw at all in it; for me, she was totally believable.Criticizing Edward Norton would probably be a sacrilege by now. The legitimate successor of Robert de Niro, the man who can play a tree (de Niro about de Niro), is of course again far beyond any criticism in his acting skills. I thorough enjoyed his interpretation of Hulk.Tim Roth also does a good work as usual, even if his character was rather one dimensional. The story is not record breaking, but was definitely okay. All in all the movie was about as good or bad as Iron Man, but couldn't reach the level of the Spiderman Trilogy or the new Batman movies, due to lack of depth in the story. It definitely has a much, much, much better romance than the last of these movies, though.What really enraged me was the fact that they cut so much of the showdown.

A Film with Issues--But Fun Nonetheless,"If you know anything about Marvel Comics' ongoing drama over its licenses with its characters that it leased out to various production companies at the turn of the century before creating its own movie studio, then you will understand a bit about the strange way in which ""The Incredible Hulk"" movie was scripted.In 2003, a Universal Pictures film directed by Ang Lee and called simply, ""Hulk"", was released to mixed reviews. I personally enjoyed that movie, though some say it suffered from some creative cinematography that tried a bit too hard to be like a comic book.Whatever the case, five years later, Marvel Comics had founded its own movie production studio and was looking to start its own film sequence in which various characters could cross over into each others' films, i.e. the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". For reasons both creative and proprietary, this required a fresh start, which led to a ""reboot"" of the Hulk franchise.And yet, in the case of the Hulk, the basic origin story had been told just five years before hand, and it didn't make much sense to remake that same movie. And so, a ""loose sequel"" was devised in which the audience could assume that the basic gist of the information that they remembered from the 2003 ""Hulk"" carried over into this movie, despite its having a totally different (and in my view inferior) cast. Eric Bana was replaced by Edward Norton; Jennifer Connelly became Liv Tyler; and the most regrettable replacement of all, Sam Elliott's spot on depiction of General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross became.......some random actor who I have no idea what his name is and don't even want to take the time to look it up right now because he wasn't very good in the role.At any rate, the 2008 ""Incredible Hulk"" movie is perhaps the weakest film in the MCU lineup. It is an attempt at making the Hulk story fit into the larger narrative of the MCU, which it does by retconning the origin story so that the gamma ray experiments that led to Banner's transformation were the result of army experiments that were attempts at rejuvenating a ""Super Soldier"" program from World War II. In other words, the Hulk was a failed attempt at making an army of Captain Americas.Whatever one makes of that, the story itself isn't terribly bad. What makes the film somewhat hard to watch, though, is the acting, and one can only assume that that also means that the film was poorly directed as well. Edward Norton is a great actor--but go watch his portrayal of Bruce Banner, and you'll find that Norton is no Bill Bixby. His dialogue is stiff and forced. He carries little emotion, even when becoming angry enough to transform into an 800 pound green monster. The whole role just felt very mismatched.Tim Roth's performance doesn't shine very well, either. One can only imagine why a man with a British accent is in the U.S. Army. But even after you get past that, Roth's portrayal of a villain is a hyperbole, even for the comics genre.The same can be said for Liv Tyler, who is gorgeous but rigid in this film. Aside from one brief moment where she yells at an NYC cab driver, there's not a lot of dynamism in her portrayal of Betty Ross. And as for her father, well, see my comment above.None of these people are poor actors, which again draws into question the directorial skills in this film.And yet despite all of the flawed, unemotional acting, this movie is still enjoyable to watch. The CGI Hulk is amazing, and the battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is fun. As such, in spite of the peculiarity of its being a ""loose sequel"" and in spite of lackluster performances, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is still worthy of 7/10 stars. It has its issues, but it's nonetheless a good movie overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good Effort,"This film is the second one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after ""Iron Man"". It's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually quite a lot of fun, that is if you ignore its many flaws.The producers of this film decided not to completely film The Hulk's origin story here, except through the opening credits, a decision they would repeat 10 years later on Spiderman: Homecoming. At the time it was probably seen as a wise decision, since a previous standalone version, Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" came out 5 years before and was already on the minds of comic book fans. However in hindsight, I feel this lessens the impact of the character in the minds of fans.Ed Norton is in it, and he's excellent. However he was a poor choice of casting by Marvel, because he's a difficult to work with. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was going to be his only Marvel movie at the time. His reputation was already known.In many ways I prefer this Norton's version to Ruffalo's. This is a real movie, and Hulk is a true character, rather than the comic relief he serves as in later MCU films. He has a love interest in Betty Ross, who is played excellently by Liv Tyler. William Hurt is also perfectly cast as General Ross, and outdoes Sam Elliot, who appeared in Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which is no mean feat.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An underrated comic book movie,"I personally enjoyed this version about the big, green guy and have never understood a lot of the bad critical reviews or the negative reactions to it. True that Mark Ruffalo has proved to be a more believable Bruce Banner than Edward Norton, however the story itself was solid and fun to watch. Really, I'm starting to think that some viewers expect waaay too much from every comic book movie. Not every one is going to be TDK, Avengers or Iron Man. Some of these movies stand above their counterparts but that doesn't make the second place entries bad, just not on the same par.

First it has Ed Norton as a waay better Bruce Banner. He manage to portrayed a troubled scientist fighting his own inner demon. Second, you gotta respect the movie for starting the MCU. Yeah people maybe forgot but it wasn't Iron Man who started it all. It was this film. Now the best part of the movie itself. Hulk vs Abomination Battle at Harlem. It was one of the best duel in all of Marvel films. I mean what else do you want than The Hulk use his trademark power and catchphrase ""Hulk Smash!""

It's like ordering a meal that you know you hate.,"I never went to see any of the Hulk movies in the cinema since I'm no fan of the character, but unfortunately I rented them and watched them both at home for some reason. ""Maybe this one wouldn't be so bad?"", I thought.Well, IT WAS!! Don't get me wrong here, It IS better than the 2003 movie, but only because it's shorter and you won't have to endure the pain of watching it longer than necessary.Why was this movie made? The story is EXTREMELY boring. I didn't really get what it was about, other than the Hulk being in there and getting angry once or twice, smashes stuff, you know the usual Hulk-thing. Nothing else really happens. Nothing new, groundbreaking, spectacular or even ""Incredible"". The acting was lame. How on earth did a B-movie like this manage to get that many great actors? But worst of all: the CGI. Think about when this film was made and compare it to Iron Man which came out the same year. At least the Hulk didn't look like Shrek this time, but seriously?In conclusion, I don't believe you have to watch this even if you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or even a Hulk fan. You won't miss a thing. At least it was every bit as bad as I expected, so I wouldn't say I'm disappointed in any way, other than in my decision to watch it.

"I read a critics review, my response","Incredible Hulk 2008 review: a response Critics of Hulk 2008Does have spoilersTIH is a very entertaining it just leaves itself open to nitpicking and vitriol assaults. Basically I put this down not to the creative team behind the project, but to the people who financed it and cut out no less than 70 minutes of the back story, just so as to rush to the action scenes. The problem with this is, many who went to watch this movie don't have a prior investment in the character, so where I could see between the poorly edited hodge podge of scenes the potential for a really sensitive, engrossing and moving portrayal of the tragedy of Banner's lonely tormented, existence, the film itself rushes to quickly through these points for some to really grasp Bruce Banners charm. Unfortunately in the shadow of the witty, quipping Tony Stark, Bruce's on screen persona isn't given quite enough time to develop.Having said that Ed Norton is just brilliant as the tortured alter ego to the Hulk, he really taps into the pathos and simple dignity of this tragic hero. Certainly injecting far more humanity into Banner than Eric Bana's rather phlegmatic approach to the character. He really does give the Banner role the kind of elevated dignity that Bill Bixby added to the role. I wish we could have seen more of this performance. (There is one criticism of the portrayal of Banner which is more to do with the writing; it's like the writers just forgot he's one of the most brilliant scientists in the marvel universe. There could have been more reference and use of this in the script. It really is central to Banner's character.) Another notable, but again underdeveloped character is Tim Roths Emil Blonsky. I've got to be honest I loved the Hulk comic growing up, but the one thing I always thought Hulk was missing was a decent villain. A brilliant villain for me is premised on two things 1, there has to be a level to which you understand or relate to the villain's temptation by evil or malevolence and 2, none the less you have to understand why they must be stopped. Now characters like Lex Luther or The Joker are perfect examples of such villains; one immediately recognises Lex Luther's quest for ultimate knowledge as inherently human, or, one can relate to the mirthful twisted mind of the joker, who is just an extreme reaction to the equally insane and theatrical vigilantism of batman. But what about Abomination? How do you relate to a guy who wants to become a big mutant freak like Emil Blonsky? The truth is you can't, but Tim Roth puts in such a good performance that by the end you see him as both cool and by some weird perverted logic actually relate to his quest for Hulks power. I really think he is the outstanding performance in the whole ensemble.Liv Tyler is under used but again in this role its not so much her acting that is outstanding, than the fact that Liv actually just inhabits important aspects of Betty Ross, a certain maternal care, a child like kindness which resonates with her response to the Hulk and the chemistry with Ed Norton is quite refreshing. It's not quite as ultra quippy and Hollywood as Ironman's main romance, which gave it a level of heart felt realism. Nonetheless her performance is jarring in places, and the scene where Betty and Banner are staring at the ceiling is funny, because it is made so obvious that even Ed Norton's eyes are better actors than Liv Tyler.William Hurt's performance as Thunderbolt Ross has its awkward moments, but nonetheless, again he manages to pull off a rather dastardly General, and even gets a laugh or shudder at his maniacal persona every once in a while. Tim Blake Nelson does his best but his role really is awfully generic and I believe the let down of the whole piece. However luckily he's not in it that much.Another surprise is Louis Letterier's directing. Its great because it feels like Ed Norton had a lot of control over the drama; but Letterier really knows his action scenes and they are surprisingly refreshing and while there are obvious homages to genres like horror etc he really makes the action scenes and some of the CG heavy scenes both aesthetically note worthy and some of the best action spectacles in the comic genre. Apart from Roth, the Hulk himself, directed by Louis is the stand out performance in this movie. The first Hulk fight is really testimony to this.The only other criticism I have of the film is the Tony Stark cameo. It just seems like an add on, rather than a really well though out and integral part of the plot.All in all this is still one of the best comic-adaptations out there; much better performances than in the spider man or X-men series, far better than Ghost rider and fantastic four, perhaps not quite as consistent as Iron Man however it even outshines in places that much lauded and perhaps overrated movie, definitely not in the league of the Matrix, Blade, Batman Begins or V for Vendetta. However it does have better action scenes than the latter two, and, if we had seen the full movie rather than the studio execs ""safe version"", well who knows? The critics say this movie is generic, the CG bad, there's no character development etc. Some of you sceptics who hated the first movie will listen to this and wait to rent or perhaps catch it on TV and when you do you will realise you've missed a movie that was truly meant to be seen on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good film but not really in line with the MCU,"I think the MCU is brilliantly thought out, and The Incredible Hulk is a good film on its own. They were just starting the MCU when this film was released - it was only the second film of the epic series (after Iron Man)Note I am reviewing this in 2018, 10 years on and Avengers Infinity Wars has just been released.As good as Edward Norton is, I was very dissapointed to see that in Avengers Assemble Mark Ruffalo's Banner is nothing like Edward Norton's - I realise different actors want to put 'thier mark' on a character, but when you're more-or-less the stepping off point for an epic collaboration of film franchises you should really have better continuation. How would it look if a new guy took the place of Chris Evans (Captain America) and appeared in the next film wearing a Union Jack?When a new film is released in the MCU I like to rewatch films relating to that franchise.
E.G. before I saw Thor Ragnarok at the cinema I rewatched Thor, Avengers Assemble, Thor The Dark World and Avengers Age of Ultron. Bruce Banner is a big player in Thor Ragnarok too, and I saw the two Avengers films as catching up on him at the same time.

The black sheep of the MCU...and rightfully so,"#MCUrewatch. It's the second film in the MCU and already the franchise reaches it's all time low. It makes sense the producers tend to 'forget' this film. First of all because its story is not an integral part of the MCU story: you can understand the bigger picture without ever seeing this film. Secondly, Norton said goodbye to the role of Hulk after this film. Which we should be thankful for: talking about miscasting. Norton, as does the film as a whole, takes things much too serious. The key strength of the MCU films is its lightheartedness. That is sorely lacking here. Another poor choice of casting is Roth as Marine/Commando. He is a great actor and believable as a psychopath but NOT as a highly trained and lethal Marine. The main problem with Hulk is that from a dramatic point of view the character becomes uninteresting once he becomes Hulk. He is a great supporting character, just not as interesting to carry a film. Well the good news: we are only two films in the franchise and we have already reached rock bottom.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Undeniably Better than the Hulk from 2003 BUT...,"...it wasn't great either. Sure it is well-made, competently directed, even well-cast. Edward Norton, in my opinion, makes a very credible Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler is gorgeous and CAN act. William Hurt and Tim Roth are slices of ham so thick that I thought the film's waist would explode from indigestion! Yet, both retain one's interest. The movie is much more faster paced than the Ang lee film. The CGI effects are much better as well. Look, this was a pretty decent film overall. Despite the new cast and director, the movie was a lot like the Ang Lee film. Some of the scenes were almost the same which when you look at this film director's work - we are now talking about Louis LeTerrier - he seems to do cinematic do-overs more often than not(he also directed the new Clash of the Titans!). That being said - the new film offers what the audiences wanted - an updated version to replace what many saw as a travesty. Now, we have it.

Underrated Buster!,"This movie really is Incredible it does have its flaws and I think that's because while it embraces it's darker feel (which is great) it delivers a sort of miserable feeling which kinda the point of the movie and really comes down to personal taste. When I was younger this and the 2003 Hulk was what I would imagine as the Hulk But even as a young kid I could see how this movie could have been way better. I give it 7/10 because I do believe some of the production design and story could be better but really that's hardly an issue when it's such a good story already. So really a 10/10, people say which Hulk is better and to do this day after seeing Mark as Hulk in the MCU from Avengers to Endgame it's hard to decide. I go with this Hulk but the MCU hulk has a different feel altogether and had such epic moments in The Avengers and Age Of Ultron etc. This hulk from the movie is fantastic in a way that conveys the monster within, and that's why I think its so enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Why do you keep hitting people?""",The Incredible Hulk was the second movie to be released by Marvel as part of their then new MCU idea and after Iron Man was such a massive success fans couldn't wait to see what Marvel had in store for the new Hulk reboot and it's safe to say they didn't disappoint fans.The Incredible Hulk has been given many different interpretations since as early as 1977 with The Incredible Hulk TV show starring (Bill Bixby) as David Banner and (Lou Ferrigno) as the green menance The Hulk after that were some animated Hulk movies and a Cartoon series that were fun to watch as a kid in the 90s then in 2003 we got a live action movie simply named Hulk starring (Eric Banner) as Bruce Banner and a CGI Hulk the movie wasn't the greatest and most audiences and fans agreed that is was pretty boring and forgetable but the action and CGI looked great especially for the early 2000s no plans for a sequal were made and The Hulk just vanished from screens once again.The Incredible Hulk (2008) is the best standalone Hulk movie ever made Marvel took what worked in the previous movie and improved upon it the CGI is better the Hulk is much more defined and detailed and instead of telling another Hulk origin story this movie basically gets straight into the story of (Edward Nortons) character Bruce Banner in hiding from the US military trying to find a way of controlling his anger while working to figure out a cure for his Hulk problem but the government tracks him down and plans to take control of the Hulk creation leading to Banner going on the run yet again tracking down a cure.I personally liked that the movie doesn't hold your hand by having to fill you in on the back story of the Hulk and gets right into what people wanna see The Hulk and not Bruce Banner in a laboratory creating The Hulk for an hour like the last movie did you get filled in on the back story a little during the opening credits but that's it and that's not a bad thing we all know who The Hulk is even if you don't know the full back story it's easy to jump into this movie and enjoy it without all the boring exposition dialogue.The special effects and CGI in this movie are top quality and while later movies in the MCU like the Avengers and Thor Ragnarok have a much better looking CGI Hulk and have Mark Ruffalo playing the role of Bruce Banner and The Hulk this standalone movie set the stage for The Hulk joining the Avengers and led to The Hulk becoming a fan favourite character in the MCU.I highly recommend watching this movie especially if your a comic book fan and a Hulk fan even if your not into the MCU as a whole this is a good standalone movie that helped start everything along with Iron Man.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the best, but a fine start for Hulk in the MCU","Originally concieved as a sequel to the 2003 Hulk, this movie instead decides to do a reboot.It's an interesting idea, but doesn't truly pay off - the character could use a little more backstory in terms of his Marvel Cinematic Universe interpretation and it feels rather rushed at the beginning.The effects and action scenes are, as always with these movies, amazing and very well shot. The ending fight with Abomonation in particular is breath-taking.The script, however, not so much. The characters feel very undeveloped, and Edward Norton never truly finds his footing as Bruce Banner - a role much better filled by Eric Bana or Mark Ruffalo.The villains, whilst interesting in a broader picture, comes off as very generic and underdeveloped as well, with very little screen-time.This was the second installment in the MCU franchise, which is a big feat on its own, and it continued to build upon the world established in Iron Man by tying into both that and the upcoming Captain America movie. But in terms of being a movie, I would much rather prefer Ang Lee's Hulk, which I felt offered an interesting and unique take on the superhero formula.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Marvel shared universe's 'misfire?',"Thor. Iron Man. The Avengers. It's pretty impressive how the Marvel Studios can make one memorable hit film after the next. And then you had the Incredible Hulk. Somewhere. Seeing as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America seem to have pushed themselves to the forefront of the Marvel Universe, sometimes it's easy to forget that there was also a film dedicated to the big green grumpy fella! Or maybe that's because there were actually TWO movies, but we won't really touch on that.The Incredible Hulk movie was actually a remake of a similar Marvel movie only a few years before. However, it totally bombed at the Box Office and was therefore quickly forgotten as soon as possible, especially when the Hulk was to be drafted into the same on screen universe as Iron Man and co. It's not a bad film, it just has problems. One of which is the lack of originality. It's basically Iron Man (1), only with different characters. The story is pretty much identical, only with a green star instead of a guy in a metal suit.Secondly, and this is more of a downside that's applicable after the film was made, the Hulk's human alter-ego played by Edward Norton, decided to leave the franchise. Therefore, all Hulk-related scenes in everything from the Avengers onwards was taken over by Mark Ruffalo. I think the studio was hoping that the Hulk would become more of a franchise in its own right, as there are plenty of little plot points in the film which aren't resolved, clearly so that they can be addressed in later instalments. I guess only time will tell if these will ever see the light of day, or whether the Avengers will take over and the Hulk will just be a background character in the overall story.However, that was to come. Judging the film on its own and it's not that bad. It has some pretty impressive action scenes which are fun to watch, but it's main plus point is Tim Roth. Yes, he's the man tasked with bringing down the Hulk at any costs, but I was on his side. He pretty much saved the film for me. The Hulk (when big, green and generally smashing things) was fun, however Edward Norton (despite being a great actor) just didn't really have much to work with. Therefore it was up to Roth to steal every scene.I know the Hulk is based on a comic book and the monster itself did (still) look pretty computer-generated, which was a bit disappointing as it looked only slightly better than its forgotten predecessor 'Hulk.' The Incredible Hulk doesn't really feel that bigger part of the overall 'Marvel shared universe,' but it is a fun enough little jaunt that is worth a watch just for Tim Roth's performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Solid, if unexceptional. Still, should be remembered more.","After Director Ang Lee's (Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) artsy-fartsy take on The Hulk tanked at the box office a few years ago, things looked dire for the big green dude. So what was in order? Recast the franchise, get a new director, and basically pretend the first one never happened. This is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, and it's a credit to the filmmakers that I very much enjoyed this film, given that I have no history of giving a crap about the Hulk or his tendency to smash things. I've always looked on the character with mild disdain, writing him off as a Jekyll & Hyde-type on steroids. But this Hulk kept me entertained from start to finish.Credit must be given to Edward Norton, whose Bruce Banner is a lonely, tortured soul who struggles to keep the rageful beast within him at bay. Norton makes a sympathetic lead, and he does some fine character work here. Nothing amazing, ala Christian Bale or Robert Downey Jr., but solid nonetheless. Liv Tyler does just fine (though there's sure to be some inexplicable hatred for her by the public there always is for the love interest in superhero movies! I don't get it. I liked Katie Holmes, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Bosworth just fine). William Hurt, Tim Roththe entire cast turns in good performances. The cinematography is excellent (some stuff in Brazil is particularly eye-catching). The pacing is great, and while there is some down-time between Hulk moments, the film doesn't lag. This is a much more somber movie than the crowd-pleasing Iron Man, but the handful of attempts at humor hit the mark just fine.Most importantly, the film gives you a good dose of Hulk smashing things real good. The CGI on the Hulk is far better than the trailers made me think it'd be (with a few exceptions). The action in this movie is fantastic, visceral, hard-hitting stuff. You truly feel the physical power of the character, and a couple moments startle you with their raw power. The final battle in particular is a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the exploration of the villain's motives (villains who think they're doing the right thing are always more interesting), as well as Bruce's desire to control his demons. Good people have a dark side, and bad people often have some virtue left in them, and this movie explores that idea to good effect.Flaws? Well, being a comic-book movie, you have to suspend disbelief (even within the rules of its own universe) about what's possible or even plausible. Some plot-holes arise (although some are later explained, in the moment I was thinking ""wait, what?""). One side character's actions seem like a bit of a stretch. But mostly, any qualms I have stem from the fact that I've been spoiled by excellent superhero movies, like Iron Man and Batman Begins. This is not an excellent superhero movie. It is, however, a very good superhero movie that has some truly rockin' action, solid character work, and good acting. It's more than worth catching in the theatres. (Rated PG-13 for action violence, mild language, and a brief foreplay scene that goes nowhere). ***1/2 (out of five).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The MCU rewatch is at an all time high!!!,"Edward Norton gives such a compelling performance as Bruce Banner, and I am just going to put it out there; I prefer him over Mark Ruffelo. I found this movie to be really enjoyable, and it was a really great original story for the character of Hulk. I would also go as far as saying that Edward Norton and Tim Roth are the best hero-villain combo.The Incredible Hulk feels like a driven, heartfelt, chaotic, and action-packed film. The incredible Hulk follows Bruce Banner, now living in the shadows, cut from the woman he loves. While he tries to escape his nemesis, Captain Thunderbolt Ross. The cinematography feels very Transformers-like, and I liked that at times, but it did also feel annoying at times.This movie is filled with an amazing cast (all MCU movies are). First, Edward Norton gives a great performance as Bruce Banner, and he really shines with his acting chops. Tim Roth is a legendary actor, and I didn't think this was his best movie, but he was still great as usual. As mentioned, this film is very action-packed, but the pacing is very odd. When the action is happening, the movie feels great and fun, but also over the top; however, when the action isn't happening, a lot of the movie's flaws show. For example, the dialogue can feel sloppy, and the movie can drag.In conclusion, The Incredible Hulk may not even be a great movie; it's not even a good movie. However, the movie shines when the action scenes are happening, and it stinks that we will never get to see Edward back as Bruce.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hulk fans will be happier now.,"In my opinion, the first Hulk movie in 2003 wasn't all that bad. However, I went to see it with very high hopes and expectations, and left feeling unfulfilled. I didn't like the new origin story and I hated how The Hulk kept getting bigger - he was like 25 feet tall! There were good action scenes when Hulk fought the army, but Bruce Banner's dad as the villain at the end was just strange and boring.This time around, I think the formula is better...a little less drama and a lot more action. The Incredible Hulk also had a better villain in The Abomination. The action and fight scenes were terrific and a great cast complemented a well-written story. It seemed more like the Hulk in the comics which made for a much better movie. I also enjoyed the nods to the old Incredible Hulk TV series. The pace of this film is pretty fast and the feeling is more tense and exciting than the first movie, which was kind of slow and dramatic.The Incredible Hulk is definitely worth the price of admission. Hulk fans and general action movie fans will really enjoy it. I took my very uninterested girlfriend with me and she even said she liked it. As far as comic book movies go, I think only the Spider-Man movies (other than the 3rd), Iron Man and Batman Begins edge out The Incredible Hulk. Hopefully it does well so Marvel will make some sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty Blah,"This was probably the worst of the original Marvel movies in their MCU, as it had the least heart, the worst casting, and was just pretty uninspired. Watching Hulk fight scenes is fun and all, but that can only do so much for a film.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Way better than Ang Lee's version, a great adaption of the Incredible Hulk","OK, so I want to start out saying that everyone needs to remove Ang Lee's The Hulk back in 2003 from their memories forever, because Louis Leterrier is the man by pretty much telling Humpback Mountain director to shove it elsewhere with his adaption to the Incredible Hulk.As soon as the movie started, I loved it more already. Edward Norton was by far the best choice for Bruce Banner over Eric Bana (whom I don't have a problem with, he just doesn't fit the Bruce Banner profile). And Liv Tyler was a great Betty Ross. I've been a fan of both William Hurt and Tim Roth for a very long time, so I was pretty stoked to see them in this as well.Also, Hulk looked way more realistic than Lee's. It's still CGI, of course, but it didn't look like a cartoon in a live action film. I was quite impressed with Louis Leterrier since I wasn't a fan of the Transporter movies, but I decided to give him a chance because he has more experience in the action genre compared to Ang Lee.I also like how they actually stuck to the storyline of the comic. The last one was way screwed up, making Banner's father Absorbing Man, which is completely false. The Abomination looked intense!!! Tim Roth did an amazing job, and I love seeing him as a villain.It wasn't a better comic book film than Iron Man, but it's right below it as far as being one of the best Marvel Comic's ever made.I enjoyed it. Everyone involved did an outstanding job. So with that, I give it 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Only Enjoyable for Comic Lovers,"The Incredible Hulk (2008) stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, who isn't the greatest Hulk by any means. The backstory of Banner was good and interesting, different from any of the other Marvel characters, but the movie drags out so long. The Hulk is really only on-screen for a combined 15 minutes, including the last fight seen with Abomination. The villain in this movie is confusing to detect as well. Movie is just boring and drawn out, only enjoyable for die hard Hulk fans, but if you miss it, there is no problem.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible,"This is a direct downgrade from iron man 1 it's awful the plot is rushed and makes little to no sense lots of side plots are introduced into the movie and hardly any of them pay off or get developed, the characters are bland and forgettable. The antagonist is shoehorned into the movie at the last half of the film. The cgi is absolutely horrific, and it's weird to think that iron man 1 was made in the same year as this. Edward Norton does not fit the role of Bruce Banner at all. This is a forgettable movie definitely not worth watching",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Average; the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero genre,"If the most commonly remembered generalization of the film output of the 1980's is teen comedies with synthesized soundtracks, the 2000's will be most remembered and generalized as the decade of the comic book movies. I have no specific qualms with the genre, quite the contrary: I think there are a handful of superhero films that are conversely at the top of their game and major recent plus points for the action-adventure genre, and this Summer also brought us the genre's greatest output, The Dark Knight. Great films like Batman Begins, X2 and Spider-Man 2 were countered by pretty lousy adaptations like Elektra and Fantastic Four, but it is The Incredible Hulk, I think, that signifies the beginning of the end for the genre.The movie itself isn't really bad by any means at all, certainly not like Fantastic Four. Much effort has been put into both production value and telling a quality story while avoiding camp and cheesiness. Special effects are top-notch and there are plenty of grand, crowd-pleasing set pieces and action sequences that really keep the ball rolling. On the other hand, an effort has been made to attempt to keep the movie in a semi-realistic setting: sure, there are fantastical elements such as gene-altering radiation, superhuman creatures like Hulk and Abomination, far-fetched and fantastical military technology and other such things, but like Spider-Man 2 these factors are regulated to a realistic setting, avoiding the camp and altogether silliness that abound films such as Joel Schumacher's Batman films or Elektra. Marvel's taking over of their film properties and self-producing the blockbusters seems to indicate an increase in the quality of the productions, as the Marvel producers take pride in their creations, treat them with respect and take them very seriously.As with this summer's Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk has also managed to attract to itself a major star who is not usually associated with this type of work and who takes it seriously. Edward Norton brings a little something else to the table, and it is evident that he tries his best to do the most with the Bruce Banner character and make him as believable and accessible as possible, without much success as the script basically requires him to sleepwalk through the Banner scenes as preludes to the centerpiece Hulk sequences. The rest of the supporting cast are strong as well, with such heavyweights as William Hurt and Tim Roth rounding it all out and bringing in their own signature styles and commanding presences.Hollywood has already attempted to bring Marvel's Hulk character to the big screen once before, resulting in one of the most polarizing comic book movies ever made. Some people can't stand a minute of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk movie, while others praise it and see its merit through the flaws. I belong in the second group, and furthermore feel like the two Hulk movies really complete one another. While Ang Lee's film was indefinitely flawed, both in its special effects work and in its ridiculously over-the-top set pieces that really took away from the experience, from a Hulk poodle attack to the terrible final showdown with Nick Nolte's villain. But on the other hand, the characterization and character development in the film was among the strongest of any superhero movie yet. Banner was made out as someone out of a Shakespearian tragedy  wrongfully accused, misunderstood, thrust into a situation against his will. He is not exhilarated from his powers but rather afraid, mortified of them. We are also treated to the revelation that Bruce and Betty Ross' relationship revolves around their both having fathers they couldn't count on, although both of their fathers are featured in the film and are shown as caring and compassionate as well as monstrous and abusive.On the other hand, Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk serves as an anti-thesis to Lee's film. While Lee's film was weak on the action scenes, Leterrier's film excels in them, portraying them as realistic, gritty and thrilling, and avoiding camp altogether. Unfortunately, this seems to come at the expense of character development, even though Edward Norton really tries his best to up the ante.Now, I would like to bring this back to my initial point, and explain why The Incredible Hulk marks the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero comic book adaptation genre. While Iron Man benefited from a sense of fun and Robert Downey, Jr.'s irresistible charm, and The Dark Knight was something in a completely different league, The Incredible Hulk, which was released in theatres right between the two other comic book juggernauts, comes across as frightfully run-of-the-mill: good, well-made, but bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. With Marvel studios lining up feature films for Thor, Captain America, Ant-Man and Nick Fury, as well as one massive The Avengers film bringing together all their independently produced film characters, it can very easily be seen that unless each film takes a completely unique standpoint and brings something really special and new to the table, they will all start feeling redundant really fast and really soon. Also, what after The Avengers? There aren't nearly enough comic book superheroes to bankroll endless comic book adaptation films, and there can only be so many sequels  both the X-Men and Spider-Man franchises crashed-and-burned whatever quality they had by film 3, Superman is already washed up, Christopher Nolan probably won't make any more than one more Batman film, and who knows how successful Marvel's upcoming, lesser-known superhero movies will fare. The Incredible Hulk, featuring a fairly universally known hero, didn't fare too well at the box office, which leaves the future of the genre, at least in my opinion, pretty clear.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"How ironic that the strongest Avenger, has the weakest solo outing","Worst film of Phase 1, and I'd say the whole MCU, no contest. The story is slow, the CGI is crap (Iron Man, which released a month earlier has effects that still hold up), and overall it's kind of dull.

The Black Sheep of the MCU Family,"Some people don't count this film as part of the MCU, and there are several reasons why. Firstly, it's the only one ever to be produced by Universal (the others being distributed by Paramount until Disney took over) and so naturally it has a very different feel. And secondly, outside of William Hurt's General Ross, none of the other cast members return to reprise their roles. Betty is never seen again, so naturally Liv Tyler isn't either. Tim Roth's Abomination is another 1 time Marvel villain, Tim Nelson's Leader tease never pays off and when we next see Dr. Banner 4 years later in the Avengers, it's Mark Ruffalo as the Great Green Giant, not Edward Norton. Outside of a Robert Downey Jr. Cameo at the end of the film and a few subtle references in later movies, very little ties this film to the MCU. But I decided to count it, hoping it would surprise me. Unfortunately, it did not. The Incredible Hulk is as underwhelming as I remember it being.But it's not all bad. We have a sound performance by Edward Norton as a man who desperately does not want to become the Hulk, and goes to Brazil to study under a master of breath control in order to curb his anger. It's clear we're never seeing him again, but in another universe he would still be playing the role 13 years later, and I wouldn't be too opposed to that. It's not as good a casting as RDJ for Tony Stark, but what is?In terms of other performances, they're all ok. Liv Tyler is in full trembling sympathy mode, but I've never thought Hulk needed a love interest, and she ultimately is not too consequential here. Hurt delivers enough gruffness to have him brought back 8 years later, and Nelson is on screen so little no-one really gets to care about him. Roth is so-so as a bad guy, until he gets that Hulk juice in him, ultimately leading to the big CGI smorgasbord. And this battle, as I have suggested, pounds away relentlessly, taking as its first victim our patience. ""Iron Man,"" the much better spiritual partner of this film, also ends with a showdown between an original and a copycat, but it involves two opponents who know who they are and why they are fighting.Ultimately, I can see why this film is forgotten. Everything ranges from decent to fine, nothing stands out and in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't end up mattering anyhow. When you get down to it, as a fictional creature, the Incredible Hulk is as limited as a bad drunk. He may be fun to be around when he's sober, but when he drinks too much, you just feel sorry for the guy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Marvel's now 2 for 2!,"This one's pretty easy...if you've been wanting a Hulk movie, this is it! It's a fast-paced, character-driven, action-filled roller coaster that really delivers. This film is faster & less angst-ridden than the Ang Lee production a while back, but doesn't throw unthinking or purposeless mayhem at you either. Like Lee's, Leterrier's offering arrives owing more to the TV series than the actual comic origins (so no Rick Jones or gamma bombs), but does hew a bit closer to the Marvel Universe. Insiders will see lots of set-up for future outings in details like SHIELD, Drs. Samson & Sterns, and the long-abandoned Super Soldier Project.Like Downey last month, Norton pretty much carries the movie with a very engaging and nuanced performance. He plays the guilt-ridden conflicted hero well, and is supported ably by fine turns by Tyler, Hurt, and Roth. My main complaint: a sudden, inexplicably truncated ending that left too much up in the air, with only the slightest of epilogues. Actually, TWO epilogues. They give nice teases for what lies ahead, but did little in service to the story just seen. As said by many, it's not Iron Man level, but Incredible Hulk makes a dang fine 2nd Marvel-only movie and makes one quite optimistic about their future slate.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Potentially Underrated MCU film,"""The Incredible Hulk,"" not to be mistaken with its 2003 counterpart, is an underrated film, that is usually forgotten to be a part of the MCU.Edward Norton plays a much different Hulk than Eric Bana or Mark Ruffalo and I think it works really well. We also have Liv Tyler as Bruce Banner's girlfriend, Betty, who is probably one of my favorite female characters in a comic book movie.While the CGI is far from perfect and the Abomination, is an abomination CGI-wise, there are a couple of scenes where I genuinely liked the CGI. There were also some really neat landscape scenes in Brazil that I thought added something to the film.2008 Hulk is a bit of slow-burn at points and it's definitely not perfect, but I still found myself enjoying it and if you're like me, and haven't seen it in a while, go give it a second shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hulk merely pawn in game of life,"The Incredible Hulk marks the second transition to the big screen in the span of a month for two of Marvel Comics' stable of superheroes. Hot on the heels of the critically lauded and box office bonanza that was Iron Man, The Hulk tries to catch lightning in a bottle twice in a row, without success.Sure it's racking up impressive numbers at Rotten Tomatoes, but that's largely due to the gargantuan action sequences that dot this otherwise brain dead movie.In a clear example of a talented actor in it for nothing more than the paycheck (and let's not forgot those enticing royalty residuals) Edward Norton pretty much walks through his role as Bruce Banner, the scientist/victim of an experiment with gamma radiation gone awry who finds himself morphing into the giant green monster every time his blood pressure escalates or he feels pain.The plain fact of the matter is that the movie suffers from an overabundance of lousy CGI. I want to cut French director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, Danny the Dog) some slack here, after all without resorting to CGI the only way to bring the Hulk to the screen would be to spray tan Lou Ferrigno green once again and slap him in a silly wig (Ferrigno makes a cameo as a pizza-loving security guard in one of the movie's better moments). However, whereas Iron Man's effects were impressive, The Hulk's look chintzy, almost cartoonish. You can never overlook the fact that what you're watching is computer generated.And while I'm playing the comparison game, whereas Iron Man, through both a smart script and the deft utilization of Robert Downey Jr.'s acting talents, created characters and a story with depth, the Hulk never manages to create a similarly engrossing universe. Even Tim Roth, who does his best to chew up the scenery (both literally and figuratively) as Emil Blonsky, the SAS agent-turned-Abomination, ends up serving as little more than a placeholder for yet more crappy CGI.Am I being too hard on the green giant? Maybe, but when it comes to muscle-bound cinematic simpletons, I can't help think of Mongo from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles when he uttered that hysterically philosophical line ""Mongo merely pawn in game of life."" Yes Mongo, you are, and so is The Hulk, whose creators only aim is to milk theater goers of their ticket cash and deliver second-rate CGI filled crap in return.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Yea... I'll take Mark ""Sour Cream"" Ruffles","SYNOPSIS:
Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is keeping a safe distance from the US trying to cure himself of The Hulk. Unfortunately, things don't work out as planned and something much worse comes up.REVIEW:
Now, I think Norton is a fantastic actor and I enjoy many of his film, but with having seen Ruffalo in the same role, Norton just seems out of place. I will say that it's definitely possible I feel this way reduce to Norton only having been in one film and Ruffalo being in more. I do remember enjoying this film more than I did this last viewing. The writing was a bit choppy and the pacing felt like a rollercoaster, especially for a film about the military wanting to find a fugitive that holds the power of becoming a giant green destroying machine. I feel it could've kept a really solid fast pace. If my opinion mattered, I'd say to either cut a lot of the love story out or just remove it completely. Another aspect that I have a qualm with in every film that does this and it's unbelievably stupid brave soldiers. By this, I don't mean intellectually the soldiers can add 2+2, but they seem to not be able to put 2 and 2 together in certain situations due to how ""brave"" they are. When you are unloading full clips of ammo into a ridiculously big green monster that is bending solid steel and it's doing absolutely nothing to it, maybe just run away or hide. It makes no sense and completely takes me out. At the very least, if this is happening, the Hulk should take out every single character shooting at him. INCLUDING Tim Roth's character. I understand Tim Roth's character plays a large role, so how about you have him do what any real person would do if that was a real situation. Then we have General Ross (William Hurt) who I can't stand. That's nothing against the film, I just can't stand him. I want to say I don't believe anyone is truly like that in the military, but I can imagine there is. Aside from all of that, I do really like Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky and Norton is good enough. I think I could see Norton as Banner/Hulk in all of the films, but it's hard to say. What really saves this film for me, is the villain and end battle scene. Abomination is one of the greatest on screen supervillains we've had to date. As far as brute force (obviously when it comes to psychological parts we know far better characters). I was also left extremely confused after the battle, however. If I said what I was confused about, that would be giving spoilers, so I'll let you watch and maybe you'll know why I was confused. At the end of the day, this is on the lower end of MCU films and just like every other not great MCU, it has potential. Unfortunately, this one falls flat for me. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a decline,"I did not really like Ang Lee's Hulk. It was so much less than the Marvel Hulk. Too much psychology and too little anger.Well. After ""The Incredible Hulk"" I have to change my mind.

This Hulk is behaving like a big gorilla. Rather status than anger.This incredible Hulk is just heading straight forward into the realm of the horrible TV series.

Finally a Hulk movie to be proud of,"I know I have been probably a year late in posting my review for this movie but I honestly didn't feel I couldn't post a review for it till I watch it again. Despite being a financial success TIH had the misfortune of being released amongst other Superhero movies, The Iron Man and more famously The Dark Knight. I saw Ang Lee's Hulk in the cinema and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I refused to see the Ed Norton version. I later caught TIH on DVD and regretted the fact that I didn't catch it on the big screen because in my opinion it is far far better.In my opinion Ang Lee's version was a ponderous mess that should have been less talky and had more action. Another criticism I have of Ang Lee's version is that in my opinion they overcomplicated the story, instead of being just about Bruce and his battle to cure himself they tried to link it back to his father whilst TIH is far more simple.After the critical backlash Hulk received it does look the producers learnt their less. Hulk in my opinion waffled on quite a bit whilst TIH is more to the point. For instance we see the gamma radiation accident in the opening credits so we skip right to the action whilst Ang Lee's version took up at least half an hour before that even occurred. TIH boasts of some good action sequences and a fine story to back it up. Plus Ed Norton is a far better actor than Eric Bana. I love how it toffs it cap to the TV show, Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee both have special appearances and Bill Bixby is seen on TV and there was an instance where they used the music from the original show.My only criticism of TIH is that they didn't show enough of The Abomination and felt they only included him so that Hulk could fight him at the end and give the audience a thrilling ending. In my opinion TIH is head and shoulders above most recent superheroes movies(Fantastic Four,Spiderman 3, X Men 3 etc).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overall not bad, but after Iron Man looks weak","I decided to refresh memories about all films MCU reviews on them. And today is the turn of the loudest, the meanest and greenest hero - Hulk.
The film was released in the same year as the first Iron Man, but was not received as warmly. Box office failure and defeat from critics followed. Part of the movie deserved it. Weak plot and dynamics - general characteristics of the movies of the Hulk. There was also very little action, always a hallmark of the green giant. Yes and no villain points clearly not added. But the Incredible Hulk has its advantages, and the main, in my opinion, of them - Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.
Yes, Bruce banner and Betty Ross in their performance came out slightly cardboard, but that's the fault of the weak script, not the actors themselves. Norton and Tyler got the best they could out of him. When you look at them, you believe they love each other, but there will always be the Hulk between them. I also liked General Ross, played by William hurt. I really hope to see the Red Hulk someday. And Stan Lee, as always, is beautiful. And after the credits, Tony stark appears.
The film as a whole is worthy of viewing. Hopefully, we'll see more solo films about the Hulk.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
MCU's Least Incredible,"Even Oscar caliber actors like Edward Norton, William Hurt and Tim Roth aren't enough to overcome the inherit difficulty of putting the Incredible Hulk on film. Most obvious is the fact that the Hulk is one of the few superheroes who must be presented with CGI whenever he's on screen. Even if the CGI is done well, it makes it hard to humanize the character. As far as the CGI goes, I would say its midling here: not bad, though I find it overly dark, which apparently was intentional.The second hurdle to making a Hulk movie is that a hero that is essentially mindless and just smashes his way to victory while being impervious to all attacks is just boring to watch. The reason the series from the 70's worked so well was because it revolved around Dr. Banner and only brought out the Hulk typically once an episode.The series was an adult drama about a middle-aged doctor who lost everything when he gained his superpower. He was on the run from the government and himself with only an unknown cure offering any hope. The drama and humanity of it all carried the series, not the action. And I do believe a successful movie could be made if it followed the same template.This movie starts out that way and briefly seems to capture that nostalgia with Banner walking on a backroad during a rainstorm. Unfortunately, the nostalgia would end there, and the movie would quickly become the superhero action flick that most probably expected but doesn't necessarily work that well with this particular hero.Maybe if the movie had remained a drama, Norton could have pulled it off, but even so, I find him simply too young to play Dr. David Banner. To compound that problem, the script made no attempt to show Banner's genius. I would say that is the most obvious improvement of Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Banner. Watch The Avengers and you can tell Banner is a genius within 10 seconds of him being on screen. Balancing that intelligence against the Hulk's mindless destructive power is what makes the character. Norton rewrote most of his dialogue and turned up the desperation and angst and muted the brainpower. It might be enough to make Banner empathetic, but it isn't enough to make him interesting.You combine that fault with a bad guy who seems obsessed for no reason, leading to an unfulfilling ending that really leaves a lot of open questions while merely putting Banner back into the situation he started in.Along the way, I also have some issues with some of the choices that the director made. The shaky cam did not make the movie feel more realistic, but instead, made it feel cheap. And a final battle between two indestructible CGI monsters came off as stakes free as one would expect.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not So Incredible,"The Incredible Hulk is a film with a lot of ""non-stop"" action sequences and decent special effects, but is there really much more to it than that? My answer would be a simple ""no."" It is nothing more than a typical summer action movie. Iron man was amazing with an awesome storyline, brilliant acting, awesome special effects and bad ass action sequences. Seeing this film after Iron Man was destined to leave me disappointed. I had heard so many good things about it that I was let down.I'm just gonna come out and say that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2003 version of The Hulk as I thought it had a really good storyline and a very good vision. I liked the whole artsy feel. Take out the art, add the film adaptations of The Fantastic 4, only with The Hulk and you have this movie. It's fun but there's nothing else to it. The only things that really keep me from rating it lower are the acting which was phenomenal and the ending which I thought was pretty good. Other than that, it's just mindless fun.Don't go into this film expecting another Iron Man and you should be okay. It's a fun summer, popcorn movie, nothing else!",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My favourite Hulk,"I'm not a Marvel fanatic, but I enjoy the genre generally as good entertainment. However, this one has Ed Norton (an awesome actor) and Liv Tyler - beautiful and talented. I love their chemistry together and Ed Norton is by far the most believable Hulk. I like the CGI and SFX in this and whilst they are cartoon-ishly overblown in places it's all appropriate as it's Marvel. Tim Roth as the adversary is good; because he's not a normal and obvious choice for an action anti-hero, but then nor is Norton. Liv Tyler's gentle way is a perfect choice and believable as the subject of his undying love.I like that Hulk, is a love story as well as hot action. It is tender and moving, and also funny. There's lots of physical humour, and the Hulk - although suffering with serious anger management issues - is likable and really rather cute.You'd expect this sort of film to be just for the boys but there is plenty for (non-fan-girl) girls too.

One little touch that I loved was hearing the Bixby/Ferrigno TV theme when Banner's walking down a highway. Nice tribute.I feel the only real drawback in this film is Abomination. Not Tim Roth, he's great. I'm referring to the design. The artichoke head ridges and cauliflower ears are missing here. Other than that, this film is entertaining.

I am happy how they handle the origin, gamma exposure screens, quick and done cuz we have see it numerous times.Except Ross no one returns in future and I doubt many people who saw Civil war knew who he was from, let Red Hulk comeout (Hope She-hulk delivers)After many months the only scenes I vivdly remember are Hulk claps to blow away fire, even thou I am huge MCU nerd.I think the Norton-cut would have been better from film-making standpoint but idea of shared universe could have been tainted if studio interference wasn't involved.
