"A rare horror sequel that delivers the same quality scares as its predecessor, courtesy of returning puppeteer James Wan.","The Conjuring was a shocking horror film. It combined every creepy trope you can think of (ghosts, dolls, music boxes, mirrors, you name it), and it actually worked thanks to a genre-savvy director behind the curtains. James Wan has proved himself a capable producer on projects such as Saw and Insidious, and with The Conjuring, he cemented himself as a master of the genre. It had the perfect amalgam of horror tropes crafted in such a way that felt as fresh and spine-tingling as classic haunted house movies did in the '80s. The Conjuring 2 is another ""based on true events"" tale that has us follow expert paranormal investigators, the Warrens, this time solving the mystery of the Enfield Haunting.Similar to the Amityville Haunting, the Enfield Haunting sees an English family plagued with a poltergeist that doesn't seem to enjoy the presence of anyone in the house. What The Conjuring 2 succeeds at is giving us both character development and another great story, which is exactly what a good sequel should do. The acting is uniformly great, but the true star of the film is James Wan. His shots are designed in a way to imbue dread and stir it around our heads for a while before hitting us with the scare. That's what true horror lacks these days, patience. The longer the anticipation is built and the more atmosphere is created, the more unsettling the situation becomes until it's like a ticking time bomb that you anxiously wait to go off. It uses familiar tropes, such as self-starting children's toys, slamming doors, and smashing furniture, but they're used as tools to mask the truly frightening fact that this family is up against something utterly beyond their control - they're hopeless, and we can feel it.Mind you, The Conjuring 2 isn't without its faults. The runtime is a blatant offender. Pushing the 2-hour mark is never a good idea for a horror film, and some fat definitely could have been trimmed. There are a handful of cheap scares, audio scares to be precise - when the music gets extremely loud all of a sudden and you find yourself more annoyed than scared, quickly reaching for the remote to turn the volume down at the risk of enduring another ear drum shattering noise. It also doesn't feel as unique as its predecessor, understandably due to the very nature of sequels, but there are moments that drag on long enough to remind you that the first Conjuring didn't have these plodding plot points. For example, it takes about an hour for the Warrens to even get to England. Also, while in the haunted house, they're able to sleep through some horrifying sounds that would snap a bear right out of hibernation. But these dull spots and plot inconsistencies are few and far between.The Conjuring 2 is how a horror sequel should be done. It's slick, stylish, fun, and at times, quite terrifying. When a horror movie makes me want to turn on the lights as I go roaming around the house at night, I consider that a job well done. The Conjuring 2, well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An uncommonly strong sequel,"The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.Some awesome, unsettling and creepy music in places too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
great horrorverse,"It's 1976. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) investigate the Amityville house. After the incident, they are attacked for participating in a hoax.

A Rare Sequel That Improves on the Original,"The Conjuring 2 (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are coming off the Amityville case when they decide to take a break. This break doesn't last too long as Ed has a vision of a possessed nun, which is the same person Lorraine previously saw. Meanwhile over in London a mother and her four children are being haunted by an evil spirit, which appears to be attached to an elderly man.THE CONJURING came out of nowhere and become a huge hit among critics and horror fans. The box office numbers meant a sequel was bound to follow since the number one rule with horror films is that if one makes money you rush another into production. Thankfully this film wasn't rushed into production and it's great that they actually took their time to deliver a good screenplay. I must admit that I'm quite shocked but I thought the film was much better and much creepier than the first film.Director James Wan is really becoming an expert at these types of films and this here is certainly among the best that has been made. I thought the first film was quite good due to its performances and a nice story but I didn't find a single thing creepy. That certainly wasn't the case here as the movie had my blood turning cold several times including the before mentioned nun, which was downright creepy at times. I also thought the first hour was perfectly done as the director slowly builds up the suspense and once it hits he just keeps it going with one sequence after another. I will say that the ""crooked man"" didn't work and the finale wasn't as great as I was hoping but these are just small issues.Once again the film really benefits from the two great leads performances. Both Wilson and Farmiga are perfectly believable in their roles and they certainly sell the viewer that everything you're watching is actually happening. Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor are also very good in their supporting roles as is Simon McBurney. The film also benefits from some terrific cinematography and a very eerie music score. On a technical level the film is very impressive and this here helps build up the atmosphere.THE CONJURING 2 is a very rare sequel that actually manages to be much better than the first film. It also shows why sequels shouldn't be rushed into production and that if you take your time with them something as good as this can be made.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Clever enough to scare us,"""The Conjuring 2"" is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief and faith. The family drama is still right at the center and is quite effective, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their roles. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares. The truth is that ""The Conjuring 2"" has enough suspense and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film clever enough to scare us. nikisreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The supernatural conjured,"Decided to re-watch both 'The Conjuring' films, with memories of really liking both, after watching, and not liking all that much, 'The Nun' (which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest) very recently. Just to see whether they held up, as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes.On re-watch, 'The Conjuring 2', like its very good predecessor, does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring 2', like its predecessor, is not a perfect film, but it is very atmospheric, well made and genuinely scary, or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise, done to death actually, but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness. As a sequel, it fares very well and one of not many to actually be on the same level as its predecessor.'The Conjuring 2' is overlong, which is its biggest issue. This would have been rectified by 20 minutes being trimmed and the pace of the first act, with a beginning that doesn't attention-grab or unsettle as it should have done, tightened up.Other than those, 'The Conjuring 2' is very good. It looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull once it gets going, while the ending is leagues better, much more momentum and the resolution didn't feel rushed. As said too, 'The Conjuring 2' yet again is genuinely scary, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening, was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well, especially Vera Farmiga who is superb, Patrick Wilson is even better here, while also impressed with how Frances O'Connor coped with a role that on paper seemed limited.Summarising, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A sequel deserving of being made,"For the most part, I came out with a positive vibe with the film. Production-wise, I thought it was exceptionally well done, and coming off the original one I can definitely say this held its own very well. Sequels have this innate ability to overdo what the previous installment did, and one might say this did it in some sense, but for the most part it played with a dialed-back approach. I mean look, what am I supposed to say about a film that is supposedly based on a true story? Sure, they will take their liberties here and there regarding what to make happen and how, but if they say it happened what am I to do in telling them they're doing what happened wrong or overly much? It was the right amount of ""more done.""In my opinion alone (which will not be consistent with everybody here), the first hour was terrifying (depends on what one considers scary). The crowd interacted with the film appropriately, and the actors on screen did their due diligence to make you fearful for their well-being. Pacing-wise, the second hour took a strange turn. I was fine with what they did by creating more of a slow-burn effect to build up to a large climax, but considering there wasn't much to be considered scary in the second hour, it kind of felt like we got slow-burn for nothing (the end punch was fine, just not nearly as frightening as anything in the first hour is all). I can't really explain it. That's okay I guess, but I'm sure this film ran over two hours long, and I think the most appropriate cut would have been about right at two hours. I was only slightly fatigued by the end of it all.James Wan has a terrific eye for the horror genre, and likes to display an array of emotions in his films, especially comedy where needed. Nothing slapstick at all, just the perfect blend of realism like ""This is how a person acts in real life,"" something that Christopher Nolan has never been able to do himself. The characters aren't just pieces to tell a larger story, they are the story. Patrick Wilson is silently one of my favorite actors, often taking the non-blockbuster role but still holding his own in a natural way. I have only seen Vera Farmiga in a few films now (The Departed, Orphan, Up in the Air, Source Code, Safe House, and The Conjuring), and with every scene she is in, she just encapsulates me. I would love to sit down and have a dinner conversation with her, if you know what I mean.Compared to the first film I'd say this resorted with a few more jump scares, but I'm going to credit Wan for not cheapening them and doing them where they fit (no kids scaring each other, etc). This film did not play with the ""less is more"" mantra as much as the first film though, but like I said I'll go with that in a sequel. The first one also had much more even pacing and left with the right amount of questions unanswered; not to be unfair with this, but I also ""believe"" the story of the first film more than this one (only regarding what was seen on the screen). However, in The Conjuring 2 I cared more about this family, and I think the tension was equally as good in this film, save the night scenes being just a little too well-lit for my taste. I'd say I might like the first one just a little bit more, at least in that I own the first one on Blu-ray and I don't know if I need this one immediately.Oh, and just be aware that the official trailer reveals way too much. I'm not even talking about jump scare material (which it does overdo), but I mean story material. Avoid please! Watch the teaser trailer instead, that one is perfect and reveals nothing substantial. Also make sure you stay for the first billing credits sequence at the end of the movie just because of how well it is crafted, as was the film itself! If only they cut out 10 minutes and maybe even $10 million in the budget, I think it would have served its purpose a little more appropriately. Unlike Sinister 2 though, this film didn't disappoint in the slightest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring 2 is best when it sticks to the basics,"First, the all-important question: Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like, jump out of your seat, watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichéd haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does use—well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest moments—like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight—are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography.Speaking of tropes, that's where the ""based on a true story"" bit comes in. The main plot of the film revolves around a real-life incident known as the Enfield Poltergeist, an extremely well-documented case of a supposed ghost who terrorized the Hodgson family of North London from 1977 to 1979 and was apparently a fan of the classics: knocking on walls, shaking beds, throwing furniture, and even the occasional haunted kid's toy. And as malevolent spirits often do, it picked on one of the children in particular, 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). Call it a collective delusion, or a desperate cry for attention from a disturbed child. Or call it what the movie very explicitly calls it: The Devil.With this installment, the Conjuring movies may have overtaken The Exorcist as the most Christian of horror franchises, taking place in a universe where the Catholic Church is the spiritual S.H.I.E.L.D. and demon hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) its holy roller super-agents. The film opens with the Warrens investigating the famous Amityville case, during the course of which Lorraine first encounters the hellish presence that will haunt her for the next few years. Fearing for his life, she begs her husband to suspend any future paranormal investigations, to which he reluctantly agrees. Until, that is, a priest arrives to give them their next mission: Travel to London and confirm the veracity of reports of a demonically tinged haunting.Both Farmiga and Wilson are given their chance to shine in spooky set pieces—Farmiga early on in the film, Wilson later. But while they're both convincing in spiritual warrior mode, Wan's decision to play up the romance between the two doesn't quite work. We knew that the Warrens were a happily married couple in the first movie, but having them each individually tell the story of their paranormal love and Ed make suggestive comments about the sleeping arrangements seems odd, maybe because they're flirting in front of a possessed pre-teen whose soul is currently in the process of being swallowed by the Pit. (On the other hand, this is just another day at the office for the Warrens.) The non-horror elements of the film are uneven in general: The score, so effective in the fright scenes, suddenly evokes eye rolls when things start to get sentimental, and there's one scene of unintentional comedy where the film's retro '70s setting—another element downplayed in the first film but foregrounded here—collides with its demonic imagery in an honestly pretty silly way. (The Conjuring 2 shares its predecessor's eye for period details, some of which seem out-and-out ridiculous until they're juxtaposed with photos of their real-life counterparts in the end credits. The on-the-nose pop music gets no such redemption.) That being said, there are also some truly funny moments, like a shot of the Hodgson family running from their haunted house after a particularly intense bout of psychokinetic activity that riffs on smartasses' favorite retort, ""Why don't they just move?"" (And, for the record, they don't move because it's public housing, and the local council, which is naturally quite skeptical of the whole ""ghost"" thing, has to approve the relocation.) It's also worth noting that The Conjuring 2 is more than two hours long, allowing for lots of escalation. And while each individual haunting scene can be white-knuckle intense, by the dozenth or so such shock, the film starts to lose momentum. So the final confrontation, when it does come, is a relief in more ways than one. The long running time also allows Wan to overthink his demonology: The main villain, an infernal nun, is appropriately nightmarish, if reminiscent of the veiled ""Bride In Black"" from Wan's own Insidious. What's less compelling is the insertion of the ""Crooked Man,"" a storybook scarecrow monster that starts spreading Babadook-esque chaos about halfway through and is explained as the demon assuming a form that's familiar to the Hodgsons. Which would be fine, if it weren't for the two familiar forms that the spirit has taken already.When The Conjuring 2 focuses its efforts on scaring the audience, it succeeds, wildly. And why wouldn't it? Wan's got his horror technique locked down at this point. It's the parts where it wanders away from the basics of creating and releasing tension that prevent it from outdoing its predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Nun and Crooked Man were unnecessary,"The Conjuring felt so grounded, making it all the more terrifying. I was expecting the same from this sequel, but the over-the-top scenes with the Nun and Crooked Man really made me hesitant to finish watching (forced additions by the studio to push The Conjuring ""universe""?).I'm glad that I continued watching, though, because Ed Warren's first interaction with the demon speaking through Janet was masterfully done... aaaaand of course they had to bring the Nun and Crooked Man back... and the hanging on to the curtains for dear life... I... I just can't.I wanted The Conjuring 2 to be so much more considering the director AND writers returned, but it just ended up feeling like another cash-grab sequel to push a ""cinematic universe."" James Wan is one of my favorite horror directors and I remember Insidious: Chapter 2 being pretty good, so this was unfortunately a huge disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wow!!,"Wow wow wow!! I've never been much of a fan of sequels but The Conjuring 2 was incredible. I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary' I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before & let's be honest, nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore. However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror movies! To be scared & the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave amazing performances & the story had you never in a state of boredom. Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3 would bring!

Very overplayed and not scary!,"Amazing how little of what actually happened is shown in the film, according to any documentary or article on the film, instead they try and make it more 'action packed' and thus totally unrealistic.Interesting that you'd think with all the noise and shouting going on there that at least one of the neighbours would have gone outside to at least find out what was going on. That would have probably killed what little suspense there was though.Now I did enjoy the first one and I don't blame the producers of these films for employing some 'artistic licence' as the stories in themselves aren't particularly exciting as they are fascinating. In fact the original stories are far more engrossing than these films.Sadly with this film they've decided to continue with the non scary looking ghost routine and somewhat OTT with the effects when playing on peoples senses is far more effective a medium to scare people without the need for pointless special effects and overplaying on 'action' scenes that bear no familiarity to the actual story, adds nothing to the film and makes the finished output look a bit silly",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definitely scarier than the first!,"I was really counting on this movie to raise my scare level to the top, and if you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea what I am talking about! Oh my gosh, this film was freaking terrifying! For three years I was plagued with nightmares of the first movie, and i didn't think any movie could be more scary. Conjuring 2 definitely proved me wrong! Not only were there jump scares but REAL horror, not just being startled by a loud noise but James Wan shows us what real horror is. There were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen. That is what scary is! Demons are what true scariness are. What lurks in the darkness is something to be terrified about. And this movie shows us this perfectly. Like I said it does have jump scares, and I appreciated that, why? BECAUSE NONE IF THEM ARE FALSE, they were not a cat jumping out or a character popping out, every single one was real and lived up to the rising suspense that was built up. Not only is it scary but it is an awesome story. As a matter of fact a TRUR STORY. It was very well told and unlike most horror movies today it actually had a PLOT. The twist in the end is brilliant, unpredictable and pieced together the plot elements well. Also greatly shot, greatly acted and great character development. Unlike most horror movies this has Likable CHARACTERS. Unlike most horror movies it's not a gore fest or has countless swear words, it's rated R JUST because of how SCARY it is. I love James Wan he is terrific at what he does. Every horror director now days NEEDS to see the insidious trilogy and of course the 2 conjuring movies. This has restored my faith in horror movies! I definitely recommend it. See it with your spouse, friends, girlfriend or boyfriend (definitely do not bring your kids) and you will have the thrill of a lifetime!

More like Insidious 4,"I absolutely love the first Conjuring movie. When I watch that movie, it gets under my skin. I actually feel troubled and somewhat terrible after watching it. I rank the first movie rather high. It bothers me almost as much as the Exorcist does. I don't even like to watch it at night. The feeling of dread in that movie is heavy. In the sequel, my patience was challenged a bit. It plays out like a sampler of far better films such as Poltergeist and The Evil Dead. It's fun for what it is: a popcorn movie.

The Conjuring 2 Review,"The Conjuring 2 is directed by James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. The Conjuring 2 is an excellent horror movie and just a flat out great movie in general. From the camera-work to the performances this movie delivers on all fronts. The plot follows a family in poverty in Einfield,England that start experiencing strange happenings in their home. After things become much worse over a period of time The Warrens are contacted to come and help. This is a very scary movie thanks to James Wan's direction from lingering and tracking shots he is truly a master behind the camera. The scares come quite often as scenes will linger and bring a huge sense of tension and get you when your not expecting it bringing some very frightening scenes. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage. The children actors have the be given credit too as they are great in this film. These kids are terrified of the haunting and you will feel their dread. I am so satisfied with this film generally people worry about horror sequels usually because they can turn out unsuccessful, but I am happy to report as a big fan of the first movie this is just as great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Left a lot to be desired...,"After immediately watching this after the first Conjuring film, I found myself ridiculously let down. It pales in comparison and even stand alone it's quite unbearably boring for the first half of the movie.

"Gerne-bending, ground-breaking and an absolute classic","The thing about The Conjuring series is that it screams classic right at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there.

Is it scary? Definitely yes. Don't bother comparing it to the first one. Just enjoy the movie and you will find yourself holding your breath until the very last moment.Vera Farmiga was superb. Her presence was so strong, and powerful that she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions. Patrick Wilson was also wonderful indeed.

Jump Scares and very little else,"Being a huge fan of the horror genre, one must be disappointed with the quality of movies being churned out by ""Hollywood"" in the last 4-5 years. Conjuring was one of the exceptions, albeit partially. It managed an effective combination of jump scares and build-up. I, for one, love the horror genre, not for the former but the latter. Extensive experience in this genre has trained us well on the wheres, hows and whats and hence, build-up is what should matter most.It is extremely disappointing to see the extent to which jump scares were employed by the makers having established themselves in the 'true story' mould with the first movie. They even aped camera angles adopted in the documentaries on the Enfield haunting, for crying out loud!I was distraught when I read somewhere that the nun sequences were added as an afterthought. Wonder if the movie would have been better without these scenes?!The Elvis part, bad. The climax, worse.

"""The Conjuring 2"" Is Equivalent To Its Predecessor, Diabolically Creepy","James Wan is the genuine Sir Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st centuryThree years ago, the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the Malay director, James Wan - my king, master and role model -. ""The Conjuring"" triumphs in critics and box office bringing a breakthrough and resurgence to horror movies in the last decade, it was compared with classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" and is considered as the master jewel of Malayan and the cinematographic of horror. Wan has continuously been providing us great achievements in commercial films, since his major debut as a director with ""Saw"" in 2004 to his first action film ""7 Furious"" last year; his shiny and original style to portray suspense and horror through each frame, has made to the director reaches to the top of podium of the films, not only in the horror genre, also the action genre, and we hope more he'll try to experiment.""The Conjuring 2"" opens the same iconic way that its predecessor, now is the famous case of Amityville (112 Ocean Avenue) which reveals to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the renowned paranormal investigators duo. Amityville was the event that gave them renown and recognition to investigators, but not by their horrible experiences, but by unbelief and ignorance of the people, which didn't believe it possible that those things happen. Later, within the film, we continue to validating in a 90s TV Show lack of confidence and credibility of the people towards the Warrens. Ironically, that skepticism would be powered once more with the Enfield Poltergeist, the case more documented to paranormal level. The famous massacre (DeFeo family) has been adapted millions and millions of times a big screen, however, Wan manages to save that gloomy essence of the night of the murder and projects it of a delirious and disturbing way in Lorraine's head, from the first minutes, ""HORROR"" genre shines.The Enfield Case is adapted with purity and splendor of a script credited to Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes & James Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Wan dodges references of the two small programs have focused on the event (BBC's ""Ghostwatch"" and Timothy Spall's miniseries) to develop to Ed and Lorraine in the story (in real life, Warrens had not the least significance in the case, they only evidenced it one night). The film takes its time - somebody says that enough, I for one, the more see James's delights more I go crazy - to introduces the destabilized life of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor). The events happened in a interval between 1977 and 1979, to capture each sublime moment of the epoch, it was vital the intervention of the Department of costume led by Kristin Burke, the Department of light and art led by Fiona Gavin, A. Todd Holland and Andrew Rothschild, which not exaggerated in capturing the atmosphere of the 70s and 80s. Wan is amazing to recreate complex and refined milieus and sets, every shadow, square, furniture, door, toy and even each color play a fundamental role in the creation of the style of the director, a director who is delicately precise with his details, even though was a humble house, without many luxuries or support tools, the visual tension is concurrent.On a night as any, Hodgson family is sleeping peacefully after a tiring day. Two of the four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe) and Margaret (Lauren Esposito) are awakened abruptly from their nap by an unknown entity, immediately, they go to tell what happened them to her mother, who refuses to believe and finds an Ouija board manually made by her daughters. Next day, harassment persist more sharply up to the point that the mother experiences with her own eyes paranormal events - James's interesting proposal to not to fall into the cliché that nobody believes them. Meanwhile, a suggestive sub-plot takes place in Warren family. Lorraine tends to keep fragments of each case and in their latest investigations, she sees to the Demon Nun (Bonnie Aarons), a superb and shocking demonic nun who torments them with a sinister intent, that purpose will intertwine of a sumptuous way with Hodgson's ending (which never happened).Wan knows how to distort every trick in his favor, rung by rung construction makes that final climax has really earned. Wan is distinguished by the ability to frighten or intimidate the audience with shots both day as at night, he knows play and combine the tools that possesses, knows to keep constant tone of his film, he doesn't allow his audience to sleep, and even though this time he uses to more jump-scares than its predecessor, are equally enjoyable and are not shamelessly used. All of the above is essential in the foundations, however, the actors take all the credit Ed, Lorraine, Peggy and her four children (especially Janet) are fabulous, measured and charismatic.""The Conjuring 2"" is credited with the title ""Horror film of the year"" and is used for viewing the constant advancement of its director within the genre, it's hard to watch and hear, the film is not suitable for hearts or minds weak, ""The Conjuring 2"" an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not the greatest sequel.,After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Based On The Enfield Haunting.,"For a modern ghost film...this is pretty damn good!It is loosely based off of the true story of the Enfield haunting- which is one of the most documented cases of poltergeist activity in the world.The filmmakers do a pretty good job at staying true to the story- with the whole nun-demon angle tied in for dramatic purposes.Unfortunately, for this case, it became a media frenzy.They brought in kooks, psychics, and ultra-skeptics, alike...and made the whole thing a total crapshow.The whole story begins around Christmas 1977, when a girl named Janet- and her family- start to be tormented by an unseen entity.Janet starts sleepwalking; beds shake inexplicably; and, eventually, Janet starts to speak with the voice of an old man.She claims he is Bill Wilkins, who died in the chair in the corner, from a hemorrhage, at 72 years of age.Information that is later corroborated by the former owners son.Not only do her siblings and mother witness these strange occurrences...but a local police constable, daily mirror reporter, and Maurice Grosse, from the Society Of Psychical Research, do as well.And, eventually, the Church is called in.They send a couple of their own investigators in to judge the veracity of these claims. As the Church does not want to embarrass itself by involving itself in a fraudulent case.The film ties this into one of their previous investigations- with the woman (who's a psychic) having had a premonition that seems to be coming to fruition here.And they try to help the spirit of Bill Wilkins cross over.But it becomes evident to them, that the force behind this activity is not actually the spirit of Bill...rather, something much more demonic in origin.Cue the spiritual battle between the Church investigators and this demonic nun-entity.For the most part, this is a pretty great film.Well written and constructed...it really manages to keep you engaged.Coming off as The Entity meets The Exorcist.Though, the ending gets a little too Paranormal Activity for me.While more tastefully done than Paranormal Activity...it has some similarities...though, I kind of liked how they wrapped things up (seeing as I have a demon haunted painting, myself)...6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A major downgrade from the original,"The Conjuring 2 is a sequel to the acclaimed original, which is once again directed by James Wan. The basic premise of another haunting in a single mother's household in England sounds interesting at first sight, yet slows down over time. The 2 hr 14 min runtime makes the pacing feel slow and the simple plot dragged to the point of boredom. There's a few decent scares that almost capture the terror of the original, but it mostly comes down to cheap jumpscares and ""spooky "" images. Overall, this sequel left me extremely disappointed and worried for the future of the franchise if even a main entry can't deliver.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile,"James Wan returns with the conjuring 2 after the events of the first movie Ed & Lorraine Warren have become more recognized after the most recent case of the Amityville haunting. We're then introduced to the Hodgson a woman name Peggy and her four kids down on their luck are beginning to experience strange occurrences in their house so the warrens are sent to London to gather proof. Succeeding in every way that the first film did. The conjuring 2 still holds its roots of suspense and terror with it's reliance on silent atmosphere and subtle Paceing, While still delivering sort of a seclusive atmosphere even though this is being set in a more populated area. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga again give a great performance as the warrens you start to get more in depth into their characters and their relationship to this film. Lorraine is having visions involving Ed and she's beginning to feel that they should probably give up this life in order to save their. You really understand the pain that she's feeling, as they try to bring the family closer together speaking highly on one another. It's because of these two performances you get more of a strong bond between these characters. As for the first the family themselves what screen time The other kids have they get decent performances as does Frances O'Connor as Peggy. However the best performance the one who really goes to Madison wolf as Janet one of the main children believed to be possessed. You're given plenty indication that this is a child that's pretty much depressed and just feel like a target. The way she gives a performance with her face along with ther body language when she possessed, she just does a good job. Another aspect of the movie is that it tries to give is more of a real world perspective as sort of a theme with others claiming the family trying to bank in on the whole claim as Hoax and that really Janet is the problem. Unlike the first one where they eventually explained Bathsheba this movie doesn't explain as much and leave everybody in a shadow of a doubt. You know there's something going on here but you don't exactly know what it gives sort of a mystery. What really build help build the world of these movies is that they don't try to play it off as just a movie they played real serious which Really helps immerse the audience into the Film. The conjuring two as a decent follow up a special film that keeps you curious in what is the come next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Even better then the first one,"Normally I am always a bit doubtful when it concerns sequels because most of the time they are no match to the first one. But in this case the sequel is even better then the first one. And I did like the first one as well. With The Conjuring part 2 they bring us horror at it's best. I thought there were more then enough scary moment in this movie. The entire movie feels like evil. You expect at any moment to jump out of your seat (what my wife did a couple of times eventually). It's a really dark and well made movie for this genre. The cast is perfectly chosen. I can't really fail anyone. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are perfect in their roles. The whole family Hogson did a brilliant job playing the attacked family. Bonnie Aarons as the demon nun is really scary, as well as the old guy and the crooked man. A must see if you are into possession horror movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haunted houses and possessed children: the best of,"As a self-declared horror aficionado, it's of course a lot cooler to proclaim you only seek out obscure titles and undiscovered gems, and that you actively avoid watching the mainstream blockbusters. But the honest truth is also that certain of those mainstream blockbusters are worth checking out, and much more entertaining than digging up unknown movies (that are often unknown for a good reason, by the way). Budget can help a great deal, but the biggest differentiator remains the director. Simply put, James Wan knows what scares people. He proved so in all his previous genre work (""Saw"", ""Insidious"", the underrated ""Dead Silence"") and with ""The Conjuring"" he additionally demonstrates that he's an excellent scary storyteller.The first ""The Conjuring"", released in 2013, was a tense and atmospheric story about a relatively unknown haunted house case. The second one is, in good old sequel tradition, bigger and more spectacular. It revolves not around one but two of the most legendary and infamous real-life (?) haunted house cases that everybody at least heard about already. It stars in the US, with supernatural investigators/demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren sticking their noses in the Amityville House haunting, but then we go overseas, to England, to dive into the almost equally notorious Enfield Poltergeist case. If haunted houses were a rock band, this film would be their ""best of"" compilation CD.""Conjuring 2"" doesn't feature anything you haven't seen numerous times before. There's flying furniture, toys and musical boxes switching on by themselves, crucifixes turning upside down, shadowy figures lurking in dark corners, fragile teenage girls talking with the rusty old voices of hellish demons, and whatnot. Where James Wan and his crew make the difference, however, is that the uncomfortable atmosphere is omnipresent and steadily building up. Unlike most movies in the ghostly appearances and haunted house section, this one doesn't solely depend on a one or two effective jump-moments and a whole lot of false scares. The use of eerie scenery is slick as well, with the optical ""crooked man"" music box as most notable attribute. Wilson and Farmiga are good in their roles, but the best performances come from the ""victims"", like struggling single mother Frances O'Conner and desperate demon-host Madison Wolfe. I do feel sorry for Franka Potenta, though. It looked as if she had such a promising career in front of her after ""Lola Rennt"", but apparently it didn't last long. Here she plays an insignificant and unlikable supportive character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I honestly & truthfully cannot understand the reviews this has garnered.

something wicked this way comes,"The first conjuring was scary tense and original. It scared you when you least expected it and it scared you even when you expected it. the sequel However is the first time a horror movie ever gave me Goose bumps. Never has a movie ever given me goosebumps.Does that tell you something ? the direction is top rate and the acting is solid. The pacing is superb as the director lets the story unfold at it's own pace. Like the first movie. The conjuring 2 borrows from the real life case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren two real life Ghost hunters that had a knack for getting the truth out. The Film opens up in the famous Amityville Horror house and goes from that investigation which Lorraine said the evil in that house is as close to Hell as she ever wanted to get. Then the story moves to England and the house of a normal family named Hodgson and the stark horror that awaited them, The Enfield Haunting as it came to be known has the distinction of being one of the most documented cases in the area of the paranormal. Things occurred there that no one can explain. From Cops to Paranormal scientists no one could explain how it was done from scratching inside the walls to the Young girl named Janet being tortured and speaking in voices. Of course there is the people that tried hard to disprove it and only muddled the waters further. When the attacks intensify and the Catholic Church is brought into it the Church sends in Ed and Lorraine to investigate Not to get involved just observe. Lorraine is plagued by fear that if they do get involved it'll mean Ed's death. but from the moment they get there things escalate to the point that the warrens realize they can't just sit back and observe. there is danger here and Janet is targeted for death by the vengeful spirit.And so begins a struggle to find out just what it is they're dealing with a ghost Demon or hoax. That struggle is going to lead the warrens to the edge of despair and it might cost them dearly in the end.the Story is based on true events. But like the conjuring the conjuring 2 is based on the fact that the warrens investigated the haunting. they never solved it. They never had epic battles like the films suggested. but that's reality and we are looking for entertainment and as entertainment this is entertainment of the finest kind. Best money you'll ever spend at the movies this year. and best money you'll send renting or buying the DVD. In other Words Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"a bit more theatrical than the first, but all the more entertaining, and well acted","This movie is based on the Enfield Poltergeist which has been largely dismissed as a hoax, although that's still up for debate. This said, they don't shy away from the skepticism throughout the movie, not just doubts about the Enfield residence but the Warrens themselves. And I really appreciate that. As far as the horror goes, it doesn't quite have the same palpable tension as the first, but the ""theatrics"" it offers, and the cunning design of two of the coolest ""antagonists"" in the movie - the Crooked Man and the Valak Nun - are just plain awesome. What seems like a straightforward evil old guy haunting a family turns out to be something much more by the end, consequently and cleverly extending the Conjuring Universe. Given, it does follow some horror clichés as the first did, such as predictable jump scares and the whole haunted child trope. It's unavoidable at this point in time, so it never bothered me. And once more, the acting is superb all around, but it did feel like there was more room for development and drama for Farmiga and Wilson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

How can the same director get it so wrong?,"Firstly can I say that The Conjuring - the first movie, was one of the best haunted house movies I've seen, if not the best. While it brought little new to the genre, there is after all only limited scope for this, what it delivered was impeccable, and it avoided using manipulative ""effects"", visual and sound, in order to deliver its thrills.The follow-up, ""The Conjuring 2"", by contrast manages to get everything wrong!For starters in the original, while based on a ""true story"", i.e. the events in the movie were as reported and investigated by Ed & Lorraine, this is irrelevant - it adds little (unless you believe it's all real) and it certainly takes nothing away - the second movie makes it more of a mission statement. For background, the haunting was thoroughly investigated and plenty of evidence came to light that the girls were faking it - paranormal investigators were heavily criticised for accepting that some of the events WERE faked but still believing the haunting was real! The movie faithfully covered all of this and in doing so, destroyed the suspension of belief, viewers are asked to engage when watching this kind of movie. How can you believe the haunting is real, when the movie is showing you evidence it isn't? You end up viewing many of the events as totally laughable - it's rather like Scooby Doo in places!Secondly, the original spent just the right amount of time setting the scene: letting you into the family's life so you like them, and then building up the suspense oh so slowly to the point you are desperate for Ed And Lorraine to get involved and help. The Conjuring 2 however runs two thread plots from the start, one set in England, and one set at the Warren's home - it's not clear at all if they interact, never mind how until the end of the movie. It tries to build up BOTH threads, but as a result it takes twice as long and you end up bored - not just that, but the constant chopping and changing ruins the effect. It's not until the last 30 mins of the 134 min long movie that the action begins and it's over in a trice with a frankly absurd plot suddenly sprung upon the viewer.The setting is problematic, while a remote farmhouse with a foreboding tree next to a still lake gives a perfect background to a ghost story, a 70's council estate really doesn't. OK, so that's where the Enfield haunting occurred, but it makes it all less believable.Finally, the shocks - yes I jumped a couple of times, but that was simply due to cheap effects. The movie isn't remotely scary, well maybe to young children it could be, but to an adult, it's more like pantomime. Nearly everything that is going to happen is predictable, the camera work if nothing else, telegraphs it.
The fact that we hardly got to know the family involved either since most of their lines were simply various types of screaming (yes, there's plenty of that - maybe to make up for the lack of it from the audience?), so it was difficult to care about whether anything happened to them anyway.In short, while I awarded the first movie 8 and it may even rise to a 9 after a second viewing, this offering is total junk.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Can't live up to the powerful original,"Usually when you go to see a horror sequel it's the villain/monster that you're being treated to another viewing of. 'The Conjuring 2' is a rare exception where it is the protagonists who are the constant. Sadly, this equals less guarantee of quality, because it's unlikely that they are what made the first one great. 'The Conjuring' was a brilliant horror film. The intensity, story and thrills were all of the highest quality and the result was one of the finest horror films ever made. So the sequel had a lot to live up to. Could it do it? Not quite.The first thing you'll notice is an extended run time. 133 minutes is long for a horror movie. A lot of time is spent setting the mood, with a very patient build up taking place. For me this could have been cut back a bit, as it was a little slow at times and one or two scenes felt unnecessary. James Wan is a fantastic director who usually paces a film exquisitely, so I suspect this had more do with the script than anything else.The main thing it lacks that the original achieved so well though, is a genuine concern for the characters in the film. The spooky, middle of nowhere, atmosphere created in the original is nowhere to found here, and that takes away a lot of intensity from the film. The characters of 'Ed' and 'Lorraine' also feel too in charge this time around, and are portrayed more as heroes than regular people. This also goes a long way to destroying the level of discomfort the audience should be experiencing.There are some good frights here and there and some genuinely creepy visuals, but it all feels short of the high expectations the original created. And that sums it up in a lot of ways, it's not a bad film, it just can't live up to what we had all hoped for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan has proved himself again as The Conjuring 2 outshone the first one,"THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEWWow. Trust me guys, this movie is extremely good. The casting is perfect. The storyline is very very good, and as a 'Horror' movie, it's very very scary. This movie has everything really. But more importantly, James Wan has proved us again that he's the best horror movie director today. The Conjuring 2 and Insidious 1 are the two scariest horror movies that actually have a great plot in both that I have ever experienced in the 21st Century.I looked at every single details in this movie and it is f**king flawless. The casting of Janet (Madison Wolfe) is brilliant. This is her biggest performance ever in a movie and she is fantastic. She is a star, and throughout this movie, she really shines. The music is fantastic. It's very very old schooled. One scene involving a music will warmth your heart. It teared me up a little bit, and if you have watched it, you know which one I'm talking about. But my God, the music, the setting, and all of these little details supported how the movie feels like we're watching a 1977 movie. Most of all, James Wan directed it perfectly.For once in a horror movie, it actually have stories. I mean the other horror movies are just there to grab people's money. Paranormal Activity is an example. This movie involved a family, the power of love, religion, and supporting one another until the end. This movie contained messages and there are themes. There's a difference between a 'horror' movie involving killings and deaths and blood, and a true horror film involving a story based on a true story and a very good plot and characters.Finally, Patrick Wilson. I love this man. He is truly perfect for Horror movies as he has starred in Insidious and Conjuring (Both the most successful horror films directed by James Wan), and he made that character alive in this one.There is one 'Con' about this one and it really doesn't affect how the viewers see it but I just need to point it out. The ending made the 'true story' into a fantasy really as it involved the power of love and a happy end. But really, the ending was good in my opinion, but it just doesn't seem real at all, but do not let this ending be an excused to not watch the movie because you will miss out.If you love movies, this is a fantastic horror film.

One person involved in the case, and barely portrayed in the film, if at all, is SPR member Guy Lyon Playfair, who has himself stated that The Warrens only spent around half a day with the family, and that Ed started talking about how much money could be made from this case.

This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.,"First of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.A family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.The one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Great Sequel,This was a great sequel which is very rare for horror movies. I had high expectations from this movie since I loved the first one and it was able to meet those expectations.

Simply terrifying and you'll get plenty of goosebumps,"This sequel to the The Conjuring is simply terrifying thanks largely to James Wan's direction who maintains a firm grip on the audience and manipulates the senses.You get a real feel for the time and place as this is loosely based on the real Enfield hauntings that occurred in 1977 where two sisters reportedly witnessed all kinds of haunted house shenanigans in their North London council house.Wan makes the most of this premise and plunges you into a terrifyingly haunted house scenario when the Warrens travel to the UK to investigate. It is abound with jump scares and upside down crucifixes and it is an intense watch, especially as Wan likes to tease the audience with things moving in the corners of the frame just to add to the unsettling atmosphere where anything could jump out at you.Well acted by the leads with characters you care about for me this is on par with the original and, although you'll get plenty of goosebumps and be afraid to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night after watching this, it doesn't stay with you as much as a film like The Exorcist does. I'd like to see the filmmaker rely less on jump scares and dig deeper into the viewer's psyche to create a longer lasting unsettling experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Made an IMDb account to review this for you,"This movie is very worth your time if you are looking for a good scare. With no swearing literally at all, not much violence or gore, and no drug or alcohol use, this movie gets its r rating solely for how scary it is. James Wan is a genius director. I hope for more installments to this series. I mean, thats all i really have to say. Im now just typing to fill 10 lines so i can send this review. This is no ""jump scare slasher"" film, this is real terror. There are jump scares, but more like you jump and then stay in the air. the scare keeps going. I audibly screamed a few curse words at the screen. A single tear shed from my eye at one point. This movie is very very scary. Its scary but so good! I loved every second of it! Sorry for mistakes or confusion. This is my first review. This is hopefully the very last sentence that i will have to write.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Daft horror,"The street lamposts are 1990s, not 1970s. Curious that the movie makers did not notice this, given they parked 70's motors all over the place. Maybe they intended to fix that with CGI post-prod, but ran out of time/budget.This movie is flawed but watchable enough, if you don't mind the silliness of it all. As others pointed out, this has nothing on the brilliant The Exorcist movie. Or classic English horror movies such as Omen, come to that. Those movies have a heart that these Hollywood movies always seem to lack.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary and Entertaining,"I am a big fan of 'The Conjuring' and I think it's the best horror movie of this decade so far. The expectations were high for the sequel with James Wan returning, but I also knew that the track record for horror sequels in general is not very good. As a horror movie, I think 'The Conjuring 2' succeeded at being entertaining and scary.The camera-work from James Wan is as good as it was in the first entry. The build up to the scary scenes is well-made and I love his establishing shots of the house. Something as banal as a chair can become scary in this movie. To me the best part of this movie was clearly James Wan's direction.In fact, there's a lot of good in this movie, but I was not a fan of the script. I know it's not necessarily fair to compare it to the first one, but we didn't get the big 'Annabelle' or the basement scares that we had in the first one. I also felt like the demon was not very threatening.To me the first 30-45 minutes were really scary and entertaining, at some point I was telling myself ""Well, this is almost on par with the first one', but things got a little bit out of hands in the last act. Without giving up spoilers, at some point in the film there's a new ghost entity that reveal itself. When you'll see the movie you will understand what I'm talking about. It took me a little bit out of the story, especially since they kept telling us it's based on a true story. But it was a cool ghost nevertheless.All things together, there are some great performances (I liked the little girl playing Janet) and spooky filmmaking by James Wan. It's not very fair to compare this with the first Conjuring, but if we compare it with other horror movies coming out these days, ""The Conjuring 2"" prove itself to be a worthy sequel.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary but lazy script,"**This review is a detailed review without any spoilers, so you can know if it contains some stuff you like or don't.**I'll tell you right now, the movie is scary. I made some jumps and had chills on the first half of it and then some parts in the second half. The atmosphere is great, the spirits are scary as hell, but it is sometimes wasted on cheap jump scares that you can see miles away.What throws me off was the doggy thing where it reminds you of a poor version of then babadook character which in this case is absolutely useless to put into the script.The way the characters interact is something we've seen millions of time in bad horror movies that throw you out of the ""reality"" of the movies. What i mean by that is when we look at the first movie, the characters were not venturing alone in the dark like in every other stupid horror movies, they were going as a group, except for one time. But in this movie, every character doesn't seems to realize that the ghost can actually hurt them even after multiples encounters.One more stupid thing is the ending. The script on how they find out how to beat the spirit is so dumb, i never thought a super spirit would allow them to beat him in a single stupid attempt. It's almost as the spirit committed suicide for no reason at all. There needs to be an investigation for a movie to have a suspenseful ending, but sadly this movie decided to go for the cheap way.Overall, go for it if you like the Insidious series, it's pretty much the same, but if you expect a great movie script with a good intrigue, this is not the case.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing sequel,"I was hoping that the sequel would improve on the 2013 original. Sadly, this is not the case. The Conjuring 2 follows a very similar structure to that of the original, but where the original avoided most problems that plague other horrors films, the sequel stumbles onto most of them.The sequel makes two significant errors. Poor child actors and revealing far too much about the spooky entity. The first error, poor child actors, was avoided entirely by the original. The second, inexplicably, has the least capable child actor's character (Billy) stutter throughout the film. Completely unnatural and an unnecessary burden on the actor (and audience). B-B-Biscuits? (were the biscuits haunted?).The second error, turns the film into somewhat of a comedy at times. We learn far too much about the deceased old man. ""My house"" always cracks me up, surely that's not meant to be scary?Hoping the third movie is better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Valak's Awakening,"The thing I like about both Conjuring films is that as much as the films present us with terrifying demons and creatures, it's always been about the Warrens. Ed and Lorraine are the center of the stories even when the focus seems to be elsewhere. Conjuring 2 feels about 35 minutes too long, with a first act that significantly drags, but when it gets going, it sure gets going. This time around the Warrens head to Enfield, London to investigate claims of a poltergeist terrorizing a young girl, Janet, in her family's home. The first hour deals with the family going through it with their own team of London paranormal investigators before it finally reaches the Warrens. Meanwhile, the Warrens, and specifically Lorraine, had the Nun to deal with before heading over. The good thing about these films is that there isn't the cliched ""no one can see the demon but the person being possessed"". The Conjuring 2 comes right out and declares that this particular demon, Valak, isn't hiding his presence. Much like the first film, it comes down to the religious angle of it all, which I could give or take. But I do appreciate the attention to detail, the lack of cliches, and the gorgeous cinematography. While not being nearly as tightly directed as the first, James Wan still has something here and hopefully continues to for years to come.'7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A great horror sequel, not as good as the first","The Conjuring 2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the Amityville haunting. The first film was set before Amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases. This film is set after Amityville, and mainly concerns the Enfield Poltergeist.The films obviously take a lot of liberties to what *actually* happened. Let's just say that this film is set in an alternate reality where every investigation the Warren family looks into is entirely true. If anyone looks into the actual footage and evidence in the case, it seems to be a pretty elaborate hoax, but in this film, it isn't.That being said, this is an incredibly effective horror film, and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious, and I frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible. The family is incredibly charming and likable, and the acting, especially the main girl character, I found to be quite impressive. There is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the Warren family, as they question the reason why they do what they do.There were some cheesy moments throughout the film that distracted me a little. Some weird and out of place editing choices and other minor stuff. There is an over reliance of CGI in a few scenes that I found distracting. CGI, especially when it's CGI characters, are incredibly hard to make scary, and this film is no exception. However, for the most part this issue is avoided in favour of more traditional methods of scaring the audience.Overall a quality film that is definitely worth watching if you liked the first film. It's not a better film than the first, but there isn't a massive drop in quality that occasionally occurs in sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Solid sequel to the terrifying original,"The original 'The Conjuring' was one of the best horror movies I had seen in a long time, a genuinely frightening and refreshingly unpredictable horror film that made for a welcome addition to the genre. I was just hoping that 'The Conjuring 2' didn't make the same mistakes as 'Sinister 2', which was a total disaster.Thankfully, the hugely talented horror director James Wan ensured that didn't happen and produced a very commendable Conjuring sequel. Whilst 'The Conjuring 2' doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it's still a very solid horror with plenty of scares. As in the first movie, the tension builds nicely until the final quarter, when the pace is relentless.I was impressed after originally fearing the worst for this sequel. 'The Conjuring 2' is a respectable horror movie, but the original is the more frightening and unpredictable of the two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fantastic Sequel,"The Conjuring 2 exceeded my expectations. After a lot of horror movies going downhill and failing ridiculously, James Wan comes back for his 'Conjuring' franchise and rips it. Most of horror sequel don't live up to the expectations of it's predecessor but The Conjuring 2 was, IMO, better than the first one. James Wan has done a magnificent job here.You know a horror movie is scary when the title comes on and it scares the hell out of you. The cinematography, the tension the movie builds is on point. Even paintings and pictures scare the **** out of you. The movie includes no blood or gore (except the first scene) and still manages to scare the life out of you. James Wan doesn't follow the horror movie blueprint. In a regular horror movie, traditionally, when you're trying to prove a ghostly creature in your house to someone but the unusual doesn't show up until the people are gone. James Wan isn't following the tradition, instead the unusual happenings happen in front of anybody, there's no hiding. You see a lot of movies where actors are trying to investigate and all those stupid thing that you'd never do in real life, The Conjuring 2 is as same as what we'd do if we were in those situation. First time ever i've seen smart people inside a horror movie who do the sensible thing to get out of the house.There are lot of things James Wan has done by not following the horror movie blueprint and it has absolutely paid off. The movie is 10/10 scary. Actors are smart and acting is very good. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are back again as the paranormal investigator and demonologist. Acting is top notch. Even those 5 British kids and Frances O'Connor playing British mom was outstanding. A huge performance mainly by Madison Wolfe A.K.A Janet and her acting was marvellous.For those who liked The Conjuring would really love The Conjuring 2. It's 10/10 scary, 10/10 acting, 10/10 creepy soundtrack. 10/10 jump scares, 10/10 scary creatures and 10/10 movie. Well done to James Wan for single handedly carrying horror franchise. Would go first day for The Conjuring 3 if it is to ever happen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Suprisingly Good (but not without its faults),"The mere mention of a movie getting a sequel is enough to make people reconsider their life choices. This was how I felt when I heard about ""The Conjuring 2"". It wasn't that I wasn't hopeful. It was just because of the things I had heard about ""Annabelle"" (which I still haven't seen, and have no intention of seeing).However, this was actually a pretty good horror movie.PROS:To be completely honest, I think this film was a bit scarier than the first. ""The Conjuring"" was a creepy and scary movie, but most of its best moments were shown in the marketing. This movie didn't have that issue, and instead showed us some of the more cliched scares in the trailer, saving the best for the actual movie. There was one jump scare that actually got to me; no joke. I normally hate jump scares, but this one scene in the film is an exception (won't say which scene).Like in the first movie, the overall acting in the film is great. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are both great (again) as Lorraine and Ed Warren. Their relationship was a big part of the movie, and they nailed their performances. Even the children (for the most part) were good in this movie.The character development was still strong in this movie. That was one of the best parts of the first movie, and it's nice to see it present in this film.CONS:The original film managed to use minimal CGI, which may have been to its lower budget. ""The Conjuring 2"", however, used quite a bit of unrealistic CGI. There were some moments where the visuals were so bad that they almost completely took me out of the movie.One scene gets on my nerves. There is a scene where the main family is being interviewed, and the youngest daughter starts talking like an old man. The older sister is right next to her, but she has a complete lack of expression on her face; she's acting as if her sister isn't being possessed by an old man. It seemed really dumb, and I don't know why the director kept this in the film.Overall, ""The Conjuring 2"" is an uncommonly strong sequel, and the third movie of an ever growing franchise. I can't wait to see more of both director James Wan and the other movies in ""The Conjuring Universe"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The clue's in the title,"Snagged into watching this. By the rating on here, I feel it is only reasonable to try and rebalance this entirely deceptive average of above 7 with a lowly single star. However, I should have known that anything that included 'Enfield' in the title, possibly London's most boring suburb, other than Penge, was not going to set the world alight.The prologue is the scariest thing in the whole film. It's then followed by 50 solid minutes of people screaming at doors banging. Then the Americans arrive and people float in the air a bit and a tree falls down scarily. Someone spends ten minutes trying to axe open a cellar door when there are at least a dozen windows they could try breaking. The police come round once, appear on TV, then are never seen again. A girl holds water in her mouth in the dark for five minutes.Then there are the anachronisms. No working class home had a TV remote in 1977, and if they did, it had a cable running to the set. Tape to tape machines did not work on batteries. No Londoner ever said ""Guys"" to a group of people before 2011. And not all London interiors looked like they had been plastered with cement.The actors on the other hand are doing a pretty stand up job with the year 7-level script and there's a very good rendition of Love Me Tender on acoustic guitar. They deserve a star. The rest? No.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good movie bu lacking attention to details,"I liked the movie, the story, the acting, ..... etc. But the only thing annoyed me was that the direction was not that good. Two things made me say that. There is a scene where it rains on the road concrete where there was a small pond of water from earlier rain. When it started raining, it was pretty obvious that the rain was covering most of the pond not all of it which gives away the fact that this is just 'artificial rain'. Yeah we know artificial rain is the most used rain in movie industry but it cannot look like artificial rain. The thing is I wasn't paying attention and still I noticed it which is bad.The other thing is I know movies based on true stories always have additional details for the sake of drama. But the director and the authors should pay attention to details. I mean the demon was so scared from the small cross in Ed's hand but he is totally OK and jumping around in a small room full of (at least) tens of crosses with different sizes. It was even moving them around the wall. This was just ridiculous to me. Being a true story this leaves me with the certainty that only one of those two contradicting facts have actually happened in the real story.The movie had some other minor directing faults that shouldn't have gone under the radar of a professional director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Slow n neat.short review.from a commoner like me.,"Janet- at the very first few glances, pops up a question- where did she school her brilliant acting talent? That makes the other brilliance around her shallow. The movie is slow and boring in the beginning.. But definitely keeps your seat belts still buckled up cos you know, at the back of your mind- it's based on a real story and the inhuman demon's horror lingers within seconds of its appearance. The movie slowly takes over you and the boring haunted house horror makes you a part of those characters in the movie. Once you are in it, the yellow eyes, the unkempt hair, the redness of scare on the white faces ... All begin to horrify you... Mrs/ms.Valak will definitely crumple your face to frighten..but, Mr. Ed and Lorrainze , with the help of Lord Jesus and the holy bible and the holy crucifix and of course their exorcist talent to communicate with the spirits, win the game against the super strong spirits... Just like any horror Hollywood movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie is the real horror. The initial boring parts of the movie is the leap into the characters to make you feel the horror. No cheap horrifying makeup. Subtle makeup, sensible movie. THE CONJURING 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Words alone cannot describe how clever and scary this sequel is. While the Autistic Reviewers thought the first one was decent enough to give us some scares and nightmares, this one goes beyond all those expectations. The way the timing is done in this film is brilliant. The villain(s) in this one are extremely intimidating and enough to give you goosebumps. The two main characters from the first one return and their performances are even better than the first.A demon/spirit is haunting a family in the city of London and as each day goes by we get to see just how worse it gets! Each night is incredibly scary and has you on the edge of your seat. And once it gets to the final showdown it's one of the years best face offs! All in all, the acting was great, the humor worked, he demons/supernatural creatures are incredibly intimidating and are the best on screen Horror Villains we have had for a very long time.The Autistic Reviewers give The Conjuring 2 5/5 stars, 10/10.

In part 2 we didn't had the father and smaller sons comes to picture just when he goes to the kitchen during a seen towards the end.Also the use of heat sensitive cameras and other techniques used in part 1 were really making the scenes true and believable. Which was missing from some scenes in part 2.But the horror, had played its part.

A Great Sequel,"'The Conjuring 2' is a perfect example of what more sequels should be. It is a perfectly executed horror sequel and Director James Wan effectively explores themes of vision,belief and faith.

The film doesn't provide anything new in horror genre, but its set pieces are often impressive even though it rely on jump scares.

Actual great horror,"The Conjuring 2 is a direct sequel to the first Conjuring and is once again directed by James Wan. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back on the leading roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators. Also stars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Simon McBurney, Franka Potente and Lauren Esposito among others. The film is based on the true story, that follows Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help a family with their problems with paranormal forces in Brimsdown, Enfield council house in 1977, what is their most documented paranormal case ever. This is one of the best horror movies ever made in my opinion, and it is much better than the first film which I also really liked. What this movie does is benefit from a great horror director who clearly knows how to inject good scares with amazing use of camera- work and tension building that result to thrilling scenes and make for a great movie overall. All of the actors do a fantastic job, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga on the lead who have great chemistry with each other and make us really feel for their characters when stuff with the demons is going down. Also, Madison Wolfe gives one of the best kid performances on screen ever. She is just brilliant and carries entire scenes on her own, with her amazing gifted ability to act and it might just be me but she is totally Oscar worthy here. Much better than all the kids in Stranger Things combined, even though I know that's a TV Shows by comparison, but just on the acting scale of things she deserves much more recognition for this role . Since the movie is over two hours, by the end it does feel like it is going on for a bit too long, and the ending in itself is a bit too much in the sense that the way they defeat the demon and resolve the case felt like cheating to me. But either way those are the only small issues that I have with this wonderful film which I loved and I can't wait to see what's in store for this universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
North London haunting,"This is my review of The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case (spoiler free)***** (5/5)Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor.Plot: Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Wilson) travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.I just want to start by saying this the best sequel to a horror that I have ever seen, the first Conjuring (2013) was the only horror to scare me and this, this is exactly the same. Director James Wan is known in most parts as the master of horror I think he is living up to that name. After the previous movie he directed Fast & Furious 7 (2015) which made a billion dollars worldwide, he said however before making that he was never going to make anymore horrors which is fine because loads of directors change their genre. Just like the original this has a very good plot which is known all around the UK as fake it was made up, because a poltergeist is a spirit that is made normally by teenagers, this is basically the story of how real those were. The original one the reason why I like these films so much is because they have a dark atmosphere, a good plot, good acting and basically just feels real like you're really there it's terrifying. Also I like to add that in the first each time before the scare there was suspense and the suspense is exactly the same in this one if not better. In my opinion a horror is supposed to scary and this just like the original are way better than the PG-13 jump scares, like the Paranormal Activity series.In the first one we saw that the spirit was haunting a child and this is the same except somewhat different, the spirit is haunting 11 year old Janet Hodgson (Wolfe) but not just her it seems the spirit wants the whole family out. They seek the help of spirit hunters Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to see if they can help their haunting problem it's basically the same as the first but who said you can't follow originality. It feels real as you're watching it, it genuinely feels like there is something behind you. The first Conjuring as I previously was the first actual to scare the living daylights out of me, and this as I said before is the same.Here are some reasons as to why I think this is a horror not to be missed:Story: Like the first one this has a terrific story which is conveniently based on a true story which everybody around the UK knows it was made up. This time it is set 6 years after the events of the first one. There is the connection in this story however it doesn't even show you a glimpse of what happened last time but this is still the sequel. It's basically the same story as first except no creepy doll this time and that is when you should keep the originality. The story is truly scary and will probably scare you too.Connection between movies: There isn't really a connection it just continues of sorts but it is the sequel because as it says on the poster The Conjuring 2. There is little connection however not shown anywhere in the film. I am just glad there is a sequel.The real moral of this story is that it's not about ghosts or ghouls, or anything creepy, it just shows you how bad the weather is in England. The real reason I gave it 10/10 is because it is the perfect sequel to a perfect horror that is of course an opinion. At this point I would be stating the faults of this movie but there really isn't any. The special effects are amazing and it is truly a terrifying spectacle that is just as good or better than the first. Just a true delight.Verdict: Terrifying, and will hopefully scare the living daylights out of you. A worthy sequel James Wan you are the king.10/10 worth every single penny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't get the hype. Was it a horror game or a movie?,"Hated the movie, for one simple reason. CGI effects. It's not scary when the subject of fear in the movie looks like something that came from a video game, or like a sticker/emoji. It would be a 1000 times more scary if they'd be reasonable enough not to mask everything in effects and jump scares. Jump scares is equal to a comedian tickling his audience. The beauty in horror movies is the tension, suspense, the build up, and the point (in my opinion) is to sympathize with the protagonist, but I can't do that if the antagonist looks like animated version of Marilyn Manson, literally. Make up should cover the scary part, plot-wise it was okay, but nothing I haven't seen before, nothing unique. The Conjuring 1 was way scarier and more interesting than this sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nice Sequel,"It is a rarity to watch a HORROR sequel that is almost as good as the first. And let's put an emphasis on ALMOST. The acting was superb from all angles especially the lead couple, the girl and her mother. There were some extraordinary struggling scenes that were executed perfectly thanks to the latter actors. And because of that, the film adds these extra layers of brilliance making this a great experience for the viewers as we struggle along with the lead actors. Other than that, storywise, it's just a straight forward possession film that takes place in London. But all praise must fall on James Wan for his choice of scene shots and his way of creating suspense and terror. For example the house in London looks incredibly real and one can almost feel this dread and doom inside of it. It actually (and sadly)looks like some old houses in London even in this day and age. This film is strongly recommended for horror fans and even those who aren't keen about that genre. Looking forward to the 3rd part in this trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Based on the true story as told by charlatans,"I'm giving this one more star than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background ""monster"" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.Ultimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.Again, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wan's direction shines,"The biggest standout in the Conjuring franchise is the masterful creation of tension by James Wan. He has a knack for mostly avoiding jump scares and finding more creative means of eliciting fear. The acting and relationships are as strong as the first, albeit with a slightly lesser story. I would say that this film did not need to push past 2 hours either, but it at least uses that extra time wisely. The Conjuring 2 is on par or slightly below its predecessor, meaning it is a more than worthy entry into the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Movie Serves Its Purpose,"I don't scare easy but the Conjuring series manages to do that :D.This movie is way better than the first one (Conjuring 1 was good too).I was watching this movie at home all alone, I always turn down lights when watching movies. The nun demon scared me to such an extent that I had to get up and turn on the lights of my room and the adjacent room as well lol.Actors are good, well I love Vera Farmiga in all sort of characters.I feel very uneasy around nuns and clowns normally and when they showed the Demon Nun I was like OMG!!! Believe me that's super scary.The set, direction and the storyline is good. However I felt that the closing of the movie i.e the way Warren's fight and contains the demon could have been longer and more elaborate. Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren reveals the name of the nun demon and condemns her to hell and that's it.So my verdict is go watch the movie, I bet it will not disappoint you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

James Wan knows his craft,"Watching a horror movie alone in a theater.Check.Watching a horror movie alone in a theater, with nobody else there.Well, almost check.I had about 5 more people sitting at the back. So it still felt like I was the only one in that big room watching on the big screen.Conjuring 2, as most people would know by now follows Ed and Lorraine Warren to the famous or rather infamous Enfield case in London. The Enfield case itself was quite widely covered by tabloids and some daily's but is also considered mostly a hoax. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that it was not real. This site – History Vs. Hollywood covers it quite well.James Wan has taken quite a few creative liberties with this case as the Warrens were just two of the many paranormal investigators who visited the Hodgsons and they were there only for a day to investigate. But having said that, I really liked the movie. James Wan has the craft to show the audience a horror without it being a slug or gore or bad makeup fest – he has the ability to build on the characters so well that you actually care for them. That is a hard thing to do in films. If you do not care for the main characters, then the film is almost as good as dead.The story itself might be called clichéd by many, but I think its the emotions like fear, sadness, grief and depression that actually make every clichéd horror story different. The Hodgsons were poor, they hardly had enough money to buy even biscuits and Peggy Hodgson, the matriarch, was barely meeting ends for her 4 children. So you immediately feel for the characters and as they say, when you are down is when you get kicked in the guts. The main character – Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, the one who is possessed from time to time, does a brilliant job. Her fear, agony and sadness is palpable. The others in the family too were quite good as supporting characters.I have to dedicate a paragraph for Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. I have seen their movies as separate lead actors but their chemistry as a couple is really powerful. You actually see the love, affection, blind trust and deep bonds that even the real life Warrens might not have had. They did a stellar job in this part of Conjuring as the first one and the movie was as much about their love than it was about the poltergeist.Coming to the actual horror in the movie, the poltergeist Valak is an actual documented demon. But its not Marilyn Manson dressed as a nun or even Sharon Needles. See the resemblance?Valak is actually depicted as taking the form of a disfigured child with wings which might have been scarier I think.That was one miss from James Wan. He does admit that the design of the main demon was actually done at the 11th hour. But there are a couple of sequences involving the Valak that are done quite well and a large part of the credit goes to Vera Farmiga.The other small part I didn't like was the screen time of 2 hours 14 minutes – I think the movie could have been edited down to lesser. It felt a little long and sluggish at times.But other than that, the movie was great. It was crafted well, jump scares were actual jump scares rather than just loud noises and the story was really well knit together. I would continue to pay money to watch good horror movies on a big screen – its where it looks and sounds the best. First reviewed on broth of blogs",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wan back to doing what he does best!,"One of the better horror movies to emerge from the last decade finally gets a follow up with The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case. Director James Wan is back to doing what he does best after indulging himself hopelessly in the Furious franchise - something I've not entirely forgiven him for. Now that he has that out of his system, he fleets back to the one franchise still very much appreciated, that is if we quietly disregard Annabelle (2014) - something I have most definitely not forgiven him for. The Enfield Case has everything you want in a sequel; the setting, London, England 1977 and we see the return of the ever palpable Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as our favourite ghost-hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although, those of you who managed to catch the, quite brilliant, three part series on Sky 1, The Enfield Haunting, will have been subjected to some unfortunate spoilers. But worry not, there's more to this story than a great way to tell it and, after a small time-out, Wan doesn't hold back on the big-budget- scares.Enfield, North London is the birthplace of one of the most documented hauntings in British history where the Hodgeson family were subjected to a series of ghastly shenanigans. In particular, the youngest daughter of the family, Janet, played here by a precocious Madison Wolfe, who is tormented and sometimes embodied by the spirit of a previous resident, Bill Wilkins. When the incidents become more frequent the family turn to the church for sanctuary who, in turn, contacts Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. Meanwhile, Lorraine is facing her own demons and is haunted by the spirit of the Amityville case who gives her a terrifying premonition of Ed's death.One thing that makes this movie a cut above most horror that has been recently released is that it is very well made. Wan captures the bleak and impoverished conditions of the late 1970's working class. For those who lived and were raised through the late 70's, early 80's, there is a strong sense of familiarity. The patterned curtains, mismatched bedspreads and garish wallpaper, Wan taps into a familiar fear of helplessness that comes with those childhood memories; or even that uneasy feeling you get when you enter a musty, old house of the recently deceased.Though most of the suspense stems from Wan's ability to make your skin crawl, he isn't afraid to parade the obvious scare. His excessive use of quick camera shifts make it easy predict when a big jump is coming, with the old, 'it's behind you!' trick, but it makes you feel rather ashamed when he still manages to get you; especially when you're too old to hide your eyes behind your fingers so you revert to muttering expletives under your breath. The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case is a popcorn horror for the nonchalant. It's a testament to Wan's style of film-making. The haunted house / possession genre has exhausted all of its resources but, regardless of his critics, Wan does not pretend that he has reinvented the wheel. Instead, he throws everything into the boiling pot for it to ultimately reach its over-produced, climactic ending; gratuitous entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Good,"I have no idea why this is rated so highly. After the first Conjuring movie, I was looking forward to this, but it's honestly laughingly bad. The script is poorly written, the scares are predictable, the CGI was hilariously awful. Not something you'd expect for such a high budget movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as good as the first but way better than a lot of horror films out there,"One can literally count on the fingers on one hand the great horror films that are intelligent and yet not derivative. James Wan has honed his arsenal of horror aesthetics through the years and he reached his most potent level with The Conjuring in 2013. One of the reasons Wan succeeds so well in this genre is that he knows the audience - when to tighten the piano wire noose and when to let you take in a breath. The scares are simple yet elegant, and damn well effective. It is a tough act to follow. A little personal story first...I am an avid reader, a habit that began when my mom gave me a few Enid Blyton books when I was in P3. But the moment I hit Sec 1 I told myself I need to start reading adult fiction. I remember going to Times at Lucky Plaza, a short walk from my school, and picking out a book to start on my next reading journey. I picked up Jay Anson's The Amityville Horror; I figured by reading this genre it meant I am all grownup. It scared the living daylights out of me. To think that all the stuff actually happened really put the fear of God in me. The Conjuring ended with Ed and Lorraine being called to the Amityville haunting and that is where The Conjuring 2 begins.There is no need for any synopsis because the sequel adheres to its predecessor in form and structure. It is yet another haunted house, this time from across the pond in London. A nice family is being tormented; nightly shenanigans ensue; all levels of hell break loose. An air of familiarity breeds - a little girl possessed, speaking in a husky menacing voice, uncanny levitation - all too familiar. If you have seen the demon possession film The Exorcist, you have seen them all. That isn't a slight against it; merely an observation. As much as Wan can scare us, it is the quiet passages that he also excels in. We understand the pains of the tortured family and the relationship between demonologist and clairvoyant, Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively. Vera Farmiga's Lorraine's tender exterior holds a steadfast sense of justice at bay. Her warm performance counter-balances a Patrick Wilson's Ed who is headstrong in his fight with the demonic monstrosity. Their screen chemistry feels natural and lived-in. It is precisely because Wan makes us fall in love with the characters first that the horror of what happens to them become emotionally unbearable.IMHO where it fumbles for me is the familiarity of the narrative. I see the usual scares coming and none of them resembles the original in terms of elegance and simplicity. I am also of the opinion that great horror movies do not rely a lot on CGI (take a good look at the good ones in the past few years - It Follows, The Babadook and The Witch). The moment I see CGI-ed ghosts my mind starts to tune off (here's looking at you, Crimson Peak). I am also of the opinion that great horror movies don't have a runtime of over 2 hours. My wife would say ""chop chop curry pok"" and get it done fast and furious. The Conjuring 2 could have used a faster pace to get to the meat.Still, this is a solid piece of horror filmmaking culminating in a full-blown final act of symphonic terror in which so much is at stake. I would definitely welcome a third part but James Wan needs to choose the next case from the Warrens' files wisely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I Hate That I Like This Series,"I don't enjoy the ghost/demon ""Possession"" subgenre of horror. That's why I never watched The Conjuring films until 2021.The Exorcist was cool, for a laugh. It didn't age well, but it has charm and the unmistakable anarchy of a trailblazer. The mystique of that movie's production and its ballsy presentation to a terrified generation has haunted the horror genre ever since its release, and it arguably pigeonholed the aforementioned ""Possession"" subgenre into weak, formulaic clones with diminishing returns.That is, until James Wan gave the world The Conjuring.The Conjuring, all three of them thus far, is this generation's Exorcist. Furthermore, it surpasses the Exorcist on every technical level.First, I don't buy that Ed and Lorraine (RIP) were out here in real life beating back ghosts and demons. But, that's because my belief system doesn't support conscious life after death or a physical realm of judgment. I leave room to acknowledge possibilities though.These movies are just well crafted. The Conjuring series follows a Vatican-recognized Demonologist and his UCLA-tested Clairvoyant spouse (all true) through different demon-busting exploits.And it mostly works.Shots are tight. The actors are believable. The special effects are low on CGI and instead rely mostly on tension-building and creepiness.The Conjuring 2, in particular, has a kinetic style to it that keeps the viewer engaged for its whole bloated runtime. Great acting and stand-out cinematography.That said, there are some problems with the series.There are some by-the-numbers jump scares, none of which work, and some eye-rolling plot contrivances.I wrote too much. That was too much. This is a good movie. Conjuring is pretty creepy.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent Followup and Frightening All Its Own,"The inherent value of a good horror film is its ability to evoke primordial emotions out of its audience. In today's ever commercially consumed society, there seems to be less variety when it comes to comedy, drama, action etc. It's as if big Hollywood studios have found the perfect algorithms to keep viewers laughing, sobbing or on the edge of their seats. That said, there's still a diversity of ways movies can disturb, unsettle and frighten. One need only look at the two most acclaimed horror movies thus far this year; The Witch (2015) and The Conjuring 2 (2016) to see there's still variety. Yet while The Witch was quietly subversive, The Conjuring 2 is a happy celebration of classic horror movie tropes.The Conjuring 2 revisits husband and wife team the Warrens (Wilson & Farmiga) as they investigate the paranormal occurrences of the Endfield House in 1970's London. The Hodgson family seems to have disturbed a former resident of the house whose spirit has taken a liking to youngest daughter Janet (Wolfe). With nowhere to turn to and the case becoming a bit of a media circus, the Warrens are resistant to help partially due to Lorraine Warren's premonition of Ed Warren's death.The Conjuring 2 stands as a textbook example of effective horror house chills and thrills using every technique at its disposal. Everything from high-minded and meticulously created atmosphere and looming dread to low-brow jump scares are administered smartly; stabilizing some of its clichés with brilliant cinematography. Director James Wan recycles a few of the visual motifs of Insidious (2010) and the first Conjuring (2013) but let's not assume every horror movie should be groundbreaking.Of course at twice the budget as the original, It'd almost feel a waste if The Conjuring 2 decided not to up the ante. Thus instead of two ghostly spirits, the film conjures three, one of which represents the manifestation of youngest son Billy's (Haigh) nightmares. It is the inclusion of this third sprite that the movie starts to lose much of the scrappy competency that made the first so memorable. That and the lack of a showstopping possession. Don't get me wrong the young Madison Wolfe does a tremendous job but Lili Taylor's performance in The Conjuring single-handedly saved the original from third act folly.Unfortunately, The Conjuring 2 fidgets uncomfortably under such folly, submitting a third act that is at once climactic yet technically disappointing. There are other disappointments as well; many of which stem from constantly hearkening to other, better films. There are references and visual cues to The Omen (1976), The Haunting (1963) and of course The Amityville Horror (1979) which serves less as an integral part of the story and more of a blatant case of horror movie fandom.Yet for all it's faults, The Conjuring 2 still remains a decent followup to the original and a refreshingly frightening film all it's own. While it doesn't break the mold by any means, the continuation of the Warrens investigations into the paranormal feeds into a certain cultural zeitgeist that popular culture is all to willing to consume. Perhaps horror films serve another function other than to disturb, unsettle and frighten. Perhaps that also exist as an exercise in formalist filmmaking that's unfettered by irony and cynicism. In other words, perhaps some people just need something to believe in.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blospot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Terrifying Perfect Sequel,"How many times have you gone into the sequel fearing it won't be as good as the first? Well you have nothing to fear here... that's not totally true; you do have something to fear here you have a lot to fear with The Conjuring 2 which I believe is far better than the first one.James Wan really pulls out the scares in the follow up to his 2013 The Conjuring. The story focuses on the Enfield haunting. Set in 1977 London, England; Peggy Hodgson is a single mum of five children who asks for help after she believes her youngest daughter Janet maybe possessed. Ed and Lorraine Warren are sent to investigate.Not only am I impressed with the scares in the film which come in the form of jump scares and slow burn tension building I am really impressed with the way James Wan recreates England in the 70's. For someone that isn't even from the country I have to give credit for the amount of research that must have gone into this project to get the feeling right.The movie has a great cast with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles as Lorraine and Ed Warren; they are joined with great performances by Frances O'Connor who plays Peggy Hodgson, Lauren Esposito who plays Margaret Hodgson and the stand out performance from Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson.When it comes to real life hauntings like the story this film is based on I am somewhat of a skeptic, I don't believe in ghost so in order for me to enjoy a film that is advertised as the true story from the case files of the Warrens I have to try really hard to turn the skeptic side of my brain off and enjoy it for what it is... Which is one of the most scariest films I've seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Who you gonna call?,"Supernatural sequel The Conjuring 2 is a fictionalised account of the Enfield Poltergeist, which allegedly terrorised the occupants of a council house in Enfield, England in 1977. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who, having decided to take a break from investigating ghosts and demons after the trauma of Amityville, agree to travel to England in a purely observational capacity. Of course, they become far more involved than they originally intended once they see the plight of the family involved, single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), and her four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley), all of whom have had enough of their unwanted ghostly house-guest.At 134 minutes, The Conjuring 2 is about half an hour too long, and often feels like it is dragging its heels: there's only so many times that we need to see furniture being tossed around or the kids waking up to experience supernatural shenanigans. That said, the film is a serviceable sequel that should please fans of the original and those interested in the paranormal, partly because it is loosely based on fact (with the emphasis on 'loosely'), and partly because James Wan has had loads of practise when it comes to creepiness, the director conjuring up (pun intended) plenty of atmosphere and some well crafted scares. A solid cast also contribute to the film's effectiveness, with youngsters Wolfe and Esposito faring particularly well as the Hodgson sisters, who suffer the most from the haunted happenings.At the end of the day, the film doesn't do anything to rewrite the rules of the genre, but it's a slight improvement over the original. I was entertained enough to want to see what further sequels and spin-offs might hold (the latest being the forthcoming The Nun, which is based on the demon that is causing all the trouble in this film).",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Superior horror sequel,"The Conjuring 2 is not only a good horror sequel but it also manages the incredibly rare feat of being a horror sequel superior to an already strong original. It's scarier, the threat is more memorable and distinct plus it really doubles down on the emotionality of Ed & Lorraine's relationship which is the best part.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are phenomenal together, their earnest affection for each other is by far this franchise's strongest aspect. The third act of this one is really tense and that's all down to how much you care about the Warrens. Also, Patrick Wilson does a pretty good Elvis impression.Frances O'Connor is great, a single mum trying her best and suddenly having to deal with a possession at the worst possible time, she is another essential part of this film's strengths and why it remains equally engaging in between all the scares.James Wan remains a master of the craft technically with one takes that look so challenging yet are executed seamlessly. He's also really good at jump scares, making sure the tension is built and maintained beautifully and when the jump scares arrive they're inventive and rarely feel cheap.The music by Joseph Bishara is equal parts eerily unsettling and deeply human. When it comes to the soundtrack, it completely makes up for using something as obvious as London Calling with one of the most heart wrenching implementations of I Can't Help Falling in Love With You.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Still creepy and scary, and remarkably, a decent follow-up to the first one","Watching the first ""Conjuring"" movie on DVD was driven by the motivation to scare a friend, who is known to be entertainingly frightened. I am not a fun of horror movies because of their usual shallow story-lines and cheap tricks. Plus, the hype that surrounds them annoys me since a lot of them are just plain cash-making machines, e.g. ""The Blair Witch Project"". So I was surprised that ""The Conjuring"" movie has this interesting story-line and lingering creepiness, which was achieved without relying much on visual effects. Indeed, ""old-school"" darkness and shadows are scarier than trying-hard CGI monsters. And after the movie, we ended up scaring each other with that brilliant ""clap scene"". So I think this time, it's not bad after all to watch the sequel, ""The Conjuring 2"", in a movie theater (given that we have the same director, and of course, the same people who portrayed the Warrens).The second movie started with the controversial Amityville Horror case, in which the Warrens were also involved (their most widely known case). In these kind of supernatural cases, people are divided between those who considered the case a hoax and those who believed it to be true, aside from being don't care or neutral. In this case, the film takes the side of the Warrens who considered that something demonic was behind the killings. In our case, as an audience, we are more on the neutral side, just plain listeners to one side of the investigation while seeking entertainment value; somewhat akin to watching a cultural film and being immersed with the cultural point of view in question.For the Warrens, it seems that the Amityville Horror case has greatly affected them, especially Lorraine, who saw premonitions of her husband's death. Then, after that, the film moved to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, where something paranormal is happening in a public housing unit in London. This is where the film developed the Hodgson family (and it did well enough to make us care about their struggles). This is set in the late 1970's, and remarkably the production values are high because the setting really looked like we are really in the 1970's (and they showed photographs when the end credits rolled) and the camera work is successful most of the time to create tension and suspense. However, what's missing in this film when compared to the first one is an iconic scare scene, e.g. the ""clap scene"". We practically saw nothing new except a more stylish camera work, more masterful suspense, and a different story-line. The good thing was that most of the scares are effective enough to elicit reaction from the audience (in many occasions, I laughed at the reaction in many false alarms and unexpected scare moments, and that was fun), and the high point of the film was particularly intense (but quite short for our taste). Moreover, we get to see a good attempt at combining horror and comedy, e.g. when the Hodgsons ran away from their house after a disturbing poltergeist activity. James Wan, indeed, improved in his skills as a director, although not much in mixing sentimentality (but I think that Elvis Presley tribute as a way of cheering up the Hodgsons is OK).Another good stuff is the performance of the whole cast, with the special mention of Madison Wolfe, as Janet - the main target of the poltergeist(s) for possession - and Frances O'Connor, as Peggy Hodgson - the struggling mother of four, who was at her wits end to provide for her children. Then, as usual, we got good performances from Vera Farmiga, as Lorraine Warren, and Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren. Even though we more or less saw related scare scenes before from other movies, e.g. The Exorcist, many of the scares are still effective. However, it is during the time when it attempts to use more CGI that the film loses its effectivity, e.g. the Crooked Man scene. In contrast, we experienced more chills when a shadow was employed, e.g. the nun scene where the demonic, in a form of a nun's shadow, slowly reaches for an eerie nun portrait, and places itself behind it. It is in the ""old-school"" style where Wan's technique is most effective, and in this manner, I find the first ""Conjuring"" film to be more creepy than this one. And also, the big difference is that in the first one we don't have much idea about the villain until the climax, but in this one, we more or less have a good idea about the villain's identity and how it looked like given Lorraine's premonitions and an image from one of Ed's dreams. And finally, we find a haunted farmhouse, with centuries-old tale and more ominous villain, to be more creepy than a suburban tale with a less compelling villain background story. However, given the suburban setting, the feat is remarkable, and we had fun watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This film did an excellent job of building the characters of Lorraine and Ed Warren.

The first film did a great job of being a horror movie; this film did a great job of showing how chasing ghost can way heavy on the lives of two people who have bonded on a similar trajectory and career path.The young girls also did a great job of portraying a family being struck by such a magnificent, scary demon. This was done well by the girls in the previous film so isn't the standout imo. Imo, what stood out is how the story stood on itself throughout, with literature devices used early that come back around in the end. We live a plot that is intricate enough to build upon itself and have a clear beginning and end that make sense.Jump scares and all, this film was done well. But what made it different from previous films is how the jump scares were used. Places intricately and fairly throughout the film like proper seasoning, never too much never too little, the film properly used jump scares with proper buildup. (Unlike the other entry in the universe Annabelle which relies entirely too much on weak jumpscares)The film was also exceptionally shot. The dark areas of the film were used properly to cause more fear in the viewer.Overall, loved it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You know who knows how to make a horror movie?,"JAMES FREAKING WAN that's who.
I am always kept on the edge of my seat during any of the Conjuring or Insidious movies.

The Conjuring was just that scary.The Conjuring 2 is even better. I have known about the Enfield Haunting for some time and I thought it was a great depiction of the events that happened.

Overrated,Very tired of the cheap scares and cheesy writing. Can't believe both the script and the cheesy cuts with bad vfx made it through to the final film. Overall not happy with the film.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cheap and full of stupid clichés,"Seriously, I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating on IMDb (7.9 at this moment).First. The whole thing is boring and predictable. And come on, it doesn't take much skill to scare a viewer with a sudden and loud shriek, accompanied by some puppet jumping into the screen. And they do that in the movie all the time, they do it a lot. And this is very low class for a horror movie, if you ask me.Second. The music and sound effects. They serve just one purpose here - to teach the stupid spectator how to react at certain moments. Like ""look, if you didn't notice, it's a really tender family moment, say 'awww, how sweet'"", ""and here it's ominous"". Come on, we're not that stupid! We don't need THAT many hints!Third. There's a lot of clichés. I mean it. Wind-up toy truck moving on it's own - how original! Then some vintage-looking toy with spooky pictures that come alive, then happy children's lough in the distance, then some background cathedral singing, then scary faces that only show in the mirror, then low-frequency growling - I can go on and on. It's boring. I know I've said earlier, but it really is.But what got me the most, is that the creators of the movie exploit that ""based on true events"" line, and they are quite shameless on that. It's NOT based on true events in the full sense of this word. It's based on the STORY which is told by a couple of very successful hoaxers.And the main female character - her acting was all about delivering just one image, it was all about that look on her face: ""ah, I'm so enlightened, I posses hidden wisdom, I pity you, stupid hectic humankind""Not a good movie. Just a bunch of old and cheap tricks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get out of my house part 2!!!!,"The year is 1977 and paranormal investigators Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson)travel across the Atlantic to Enfield, London to help a single mother of four children Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor)who believes that there is a presence in her home. Things take a turn for the worst when one of Peggy's daughters Janet (Madison Wolfe) becomes the focus of the entity's attention....In many ways this sequel was quite brave as I could see that James Wan could have potentially set himself up for a fall - this film is essentially an English version of The Amityville horror and I could imagine that some people may complain about it being a rip-off of The Amityville Horror(although in fairness to Wan he does make no pretences that the film is anything else given the fact that The Amityville Horror is referenced in the early stages of the film and like The Amityville Horror the events that happened in London are purportedly based on true events as well).Despite the familiar central premise, The Conjuring 2 still has a lot of strong and nice touches about it. Like the first film, Wan builds up the suspense admirably and again moves the camera around well; the score is good and is also used well and at the appropriate times. Wan has also done an excellent job in recreating 1970's Britain which gives the film an appropriate sense of time and period.Like the first film, this sequel has its fair share of creepy and shocking moments and many of these sequences are carried off with a degree of skill and professionalism. Unfortunately, there are odd 'scary' moments in the film that didn't work for me whereby they looked more silly than scary, but there were more moments where the scares worked so this isn't a major criticism.The acting is pretty good too with both Farmiga and Wilson being on good form. Frances O'Connor is also endearing as the struggling single parent. However, the real star of the show was young Madison Wolfe who stole the show from her adult co-stars.Even though this is basically a reinterpretation of The Amityville Horror it still has enough of James Wan's style about it to make it an enjoyable experience. It does have much of the feel of the first film about it which does make some of what you see here a tad more predictable, but the chances are that if you liked the first film then you should still enjoy this one too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So when conjuring 2 was announced I was eagerly waiting for its release. The movie started off well but left me disappointment.

Your name gives me dominion over you!!,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!!**queue intro music**Since its all hallows eve, lets continue with the supernatural elements.Tonight's movie review is the supernatural horror flick The Conjuring 2 (2016) helmed by the original directed, James Wan who gives us a story based on the real-life paranormal investigations of Ed and Lorraine Warren.The story is set in 1977 and follows the Warrens as they travel to England to help a single mother, Peggy Hodgson, and her four children, who are experiencing disturbing and supernatural events in their home. The family is haunted by a malicious spirit, and the Warrens must uncover the truth behind the haunting while facing their own fears and challenges.Even though the movie is horrifying, and you definitely are on the edge, the themes of family and sticking with each other and backing each family member against a bully is heart-warming and emotional. This can be seen with Ed telling the kids to be there for each other whilst playing an Elvis hit song ""Fool Rush In.""The sequel is a great entry and does what a sequel needs to do - up the ante of jump scares and answer unanswered questions that were introduced in the first with a great link to this sequel.The filmmakers provide suspense to the Enfield Haunting by giving us a new terror - the black-eyed spectre known as Valak, who dresses as a warped Nun figure - this thing is creepy and terrifying. The demonic entity haunts Lorraine from the get-go which gives us clues to why Lorraine doesn't want to help anyone in need. A scene to mention is when Lorraine is searching for evidence in the basement and comes across a painting of the Nun, this is when the painting's eyes move and the Nun's face appears right next to Lorraine's, creating a jump scare that legit made me jolt. Another standout moment featuring the character of the Nun is when Lorraine sees the shadow of the Nun walking across the wall, creating a creepy and unsettling atmosphere.Madison Wolfe who plays the youngest daughter shines as the possessed English girl and really gives you a nuance performance of whether this character is telling the truth or is actually experiencing the paranormal.Overall this movie is a must watch for you horrorfreaks out there 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Wonderful sequel in the Conjuring universe,"This story is scary more than the movie is scary. Rather than jumps or scares it is the enfolding tale that holds the fright. In the 70s Lorraine and Ed Warren first attend to the famous Amityville haunting hoax. Then they travel to London to try to deal with England's analog, the Enfield murders. The acting, directing and editing are spot on. A family of a single mother and her two girls and two boys live in a dilapidated council house that is creepy and falling down around them. In that shambles of a home the younger girl is levitating, speaking in a gruff old-man voice, and terrorizing her whole family as well as her own self. Enter the Warrens. This being a movie rather than a documentary they fix things up lickety-split, after they are asked to leave (a nod to the real events) and then return when Lorraine finally gets a vision telling her the place is indeed haunted. One of the things I take exception to, lowering my rating to four stars, is that there is no reason for the zoetrope to go into the basement of fear at the Warren's joint. No demon lives in the antique toy. Even its inclusion in the story feels like a sore thumb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat,"To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat - a genre for everyone it ain't - so kudos to ""The Conjuring"" and its sequel for pulling an ""Exorcist"" and turning even the most hesitant members of the general public into temporary aficionados of the macabre. Three years have passed since the original and nothing's much changed; still intact are lean, mean, and very devilish thrills not to be messed with - James Wan could turn the adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren into a franchise and I wouldn't much be bothered by his audacity. This year's follow-up to the 2013 juggernaut expectedly pales in comparison to its predecessor - how could it not - but it's unusual in that it could very well stand on its own and still be regarded as a solid piece of terrifying exhibition. Success is rare for any sequel to a critical and commercial triumph, especially for the horror genre, and ""The Conjuring 2,"" against the odds, delivers the goods without attempting to outdo or undermine the beast that made it. As the film opens, we find the movie's previous protagonists, the aforementioned Warrens, recovering from the psychological wounds left by their 1976 investigation of the Amityville murders. Ed, per usual, has quickly compartmentalized the case into the deepest pits of his mind, figuring it better to abstain from unhealthy dwelling, but Lorraine, a possessor of psychic powers, has become immensely disturbed by the events experienced in the wretched home. She's considering quitting her self-made profession; she's not so sure she can continue carry the weight of someone else's literal demons. But before she can give her skepticisms too much serious thought, the Warrens are drawn to an intriguing case across the pond. Due to overzealous tabloid coverage, the recent hauntings of the lower-class Hodgson family has become all the rage in town gossip and in news stories. According to several reports varying in their authenticity, Janet (Madison Wofle), the second oldest of four children, has been suffering from strange bouts of sleepwalking and, most dramatically, instances of possession. The flat in which the family's living seems to be tormented by a poltergeist unwilling to leave - and as time drags on, malice increases. Naturally, Ed and (a hesitant) Lorraine take the long flight over in hopes to dig deeper. All that surrounds them, of course, is much more complex than anyone could ever realize. And so retained is the fun of the first ""Conjuring"" in its sequel; it's a skillfully designed and executed horror show with more than a few whodunit undertones lurking underneath its jump scare tactics. We grow to care about its characters just as much the solving of the central mystery, and the Warrens, already such likably offbeat heroes, are provided with increased depth that reminds us that in front of us are not pulpy ghostbusters but genuinely vulnerable people who just so happen to have extremely difficult jobs. So while I'm easily able to admit that ""The Conjuring 2"" is not as spine-chilling as the film preceding it - there's a higher reliance on slammed doors, too-quickly-revealed foes, and generalized possession tropes (and there's certainly no equivalent to the first film's memorable clap supplemented basement scare sequence) - there's no denying that on display is an intelligent horror blockbuster more than likely to satisfy the thirsts of fans of the 2013 film and horror pundits alike.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring 2,"James Wan reached the peak of his horror career with the first Conjuring opus. Without difficulty, he perpetuates the lineage with the second opus and definitively establishes himself as the current master of fear in cinema.This sequel certainly loses its surprise, a supernatural case with a predictable twist tangled in a not-so-subtle relationship with faith and destiny. But the scenario nevertheless has the merit of tackling head-on the elements which raised the question during the real Enfield affair, rewarding this new investigation by the Warrens with a hint of doubt which nourishes the duo, an endearing couple becoming a little more the mythological driving force of a large horrific universe.What the film loses in originality, it conjures up in genre codes, the director making his camera into the virtuoso incantation of the evil one, thwarting expectations at the slightest camera movement, at the slightest layer of sound, an exercise today of more difficult when you are looking for the real thrill in theaters.We do not escape the quota of jump-scares, but Wan continues to provide an oppressive atmosphere, an almost burlesque gallery of monsters (the Crooked Man will be remembered), and above all a crazy inventiveness in the framing of the supernatural element, from the sequence shot to introduce the phantom presence to the movement games to reward the fear.Sermon from hell, score of terrors, The Conjuring 2 is a new rollercoaster of terror from James Wan, a solid act of faith where Evil poisons Good like a filmmaker plays with his spectator. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Once again a nice horror produced by Wan. But it didn't exceed the previous movie.,"""My name is Bill Wilkins. And I am 72 years old. Where you come from? I come from the grave.""My wife was asking me already for weeks if we'd go watch ""Lights out"" in the cinema. Now, I really have no problem going to a cinema and watch a movie. Sitting in a cozy chair with a mega large popcorn and a maxi coke. Yet I wasn't so thrilled to go and see this one. Simply because my wife isn't such a fan of horror. It's a waste of money since my wife would watch it with her hands over her eyes all the time. So we compromised. What if we first tried ""The Conjuring 2"". From what I had read, ""Lights Out"" is much more intense and frightening than this sequel directed by James Wan. Let's call it an assessment test. Based on this test I'll decide whether or not we'll go and watch ""Lights out"".Well, my wife failed the test (Can you believe that?). But I have to admit something. I was scared to death a few times. This was actually my wife's fault, whose screeching effortlessly exceeded that from an ordinary pig farm. There are indeed some strategic and perfectly timed frights in this movie, but overall I thought this film wasn't much better than its predecessor. Again Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are asked for their assistance, because there's somewhere a frenzied poltergeist who's driving a family nuts. So again it's a story based on true events (sigh). This time the story takes place in the United Kingdom. You can conclude the following. Not only in the U.S. people are being haunted by restless souls. And you can also state that there are civilians in the U.K. who make up such stuff due to lack of attention or intelligence.Ed and Lorraine Warren are notorious for their paranormal investigations but won't get off scot-free. The stories of manipulations to get a bit of the media attention, ensure that the label ""true events"" will be treated with some skepticism. And also in this case, better known as ""The Entfield Haunting"", were some rumors that the whole story was financially advantageous for this poor family. There's one advantage though. We also get a nice, creepy horror once again. And Wan is also a master in finding the right balance for such a horror. Both seasoned horror fans as an occasional film viewer can find something to their liking in this film. The dangerous frontier of excess is never exceeded, so to speak. Again horror fans can prepare a comprehensive list of movies in which certain sequences of ""The Conjuring 2"" were used already before. In other words, nothing new under the sun.The emphasis in this film lies on the threatening and gloomy atmosphere, without introducing bloody and gore scenes. This means that you'll be treated to some eerie fragments with spooky shadows, moving objects, scary sounds, banging on doors and even the manifestation of demonic possession. You can certainly expect some successful horror moments. They are as good as predictable, so I could warn my wife in advance (a waste of time anyway). But the absence of such a shock moment, is sometimes even more frightening. Despite its long running time, the film holds you in its grip the full two hours. Not only by the eerie moments, but also by the story about the interference of the church and the debacle about the veracity of Ed and Lorraine.To be honest I thought this film met my expectations but didn't exceed the previous one. The demonic nun was more funny than frightening. Bill Wilkins, however, will scare the sh*t out of you. The cast was sublime. And not because of their performances, but because of their resemblance to the original persons who experienced this event. And if you don't believe me, you can check the original BBC documentary about The Entfield Haunting. Furthermore, the environment where everything happened looked gorgeous (a true vintage look with elements from the 70s) and everything was portrayed impeccably. For horror fans this is definitely a must. I'm sure we'll see a bunch of similar films, because Ed and Lorraine have compiled a whole series of similar disturbing incidents. Be my guest, I'd say.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Even better than the very good first one,"James Wan mantains the formula (superb horror timing and visuals, great sound editing, great characters and realistic dialogue, good acting), but erasing any possibility of boredom with a break neck pace while still telling a detailed story.The acting is probably even better this time around, the surprising humor hits, the jumpscares work (for the most part) and ""The Nun"" creation is so good that it got a spin off movie (that wasn't good, but still).In the end, if you like the first one, it's hard to believe you won't enjoy this one even more. But if you didn't or don't like James Wan ""style"", then there is nothing here to change your mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A bit long but better than the first,I enjoyed the first conjuring movie well enough but I wasn't dying to see the follow-up. It's a surprisingly good sequel that impressed me more than the first one.There is a simple enough setup of Loraine and Warren once again going to investigate a haunted house. I think what I like the most about how James Wan starts horror movies is that he really sets the mood. By showing the characters reacting to spirits or scary things going on then we start to get a sense of the state of mind that they get put in.I love how this movie is shot. With the prevalence of shaky cam and found footage horror movies it's almost refreshing to see long crane cam shots and just an overall clarity how everything is presented. Many horror and suspense movies lean on having cameras wobbling around to create confusion and try and feel scary. His horror movies feel more like he's trying to pull you and make you feel what the characters are feeling.My one big complaint is the running time. When a movie is asking for more than 2 hours of my attention it better have no pacing issues. The pacing does dip a bit in the 3rd act but the final 30 minutes mostly make up for it.I hope James Wan makes at least one more of these after Aquaman because these movies are a lot of fun in a way most directors can't come close.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Mere Coincidence ?,"I am slightly spooked by something concerning my watching experience of this movie.

I have to admit that in this movie there were many ""new evil creatures"", for example the crooked man and Valak. The cinematography of the second movie was kinda different than the first movie.

not bad but some silly writing and directing choices spoil the ride,"Some spoilers. I won't go into the synopsis as you can read that elsewhere. I loved the first one and although this one isn't bad some choices in story and directing spoil what could have been a solid sequel. First off choosing this case to base a film must have seemed good on paper and the attention to detail for the time period is top notch, however a small terrace house in England just feels a little insignificant and low budget compared to the First, this is enhanced by linking it to Amityville. Not that they should have done Amityville as we have seen that done so many times before but to relate it too possibly the most infamous haunting ever then flash to a two up two down council house feels odd. What more having same daemon responsible for both makes no sense. The film has a good atmosphere with a sense of dread throughout but again where the old man and the nun daemon.are genuinely creepy they go and spoil it with the crooked man character, a creature so silly and out of place in the film more suited to Pan's labyrinth or the Muppets than this movie not to mention the dubious CGI. A little subtlety would have been better, even using a deformed version of the old man ghost would have been effective and made sense within the context of the film. The acting, script and directing are otherwise solid apart from a few unnecessary odd camera sweeps which makes it a shame that these few errors in judgement detract from which could be a worthy successor to the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The Conjuring 2 scares taking no shortcuts and manages to tell its story through contrasting periods of calm and fear, also including the beauty of an era perfectly recreated","The director James Wan returns with his protagonists, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, in a sequel that only briefly mentions the events of the first film. We start with the couple's most intimate dramas, always haunted by the price paid for messing with the paranormal, and quickly the setting shifts from the US to England. There, the Thatcher government's unemployment crisis serves as the backdrop to the story of a mother who struggles to raise her children on her own - and whose frailty makes room for the occult.This option for a very specific setting already shows that Wan values particularities. The 1970s allow for a more exaggerated color and lighting scenography, and the English plot brings with it a type of humor that is also specific (as in the scene with the police officers). So, even though The Conjuring 2 has an evidently episodic character, it doesn't feel like Wan repeats. To make the story look new, James Wan builds the characters by showing their ordinary lives before any paranormal event: The Hodgson's daily life, the difficulties caused by an absent father, siblings supporting or teasing each other.It's also interesting how the director and his writing team bring the Warren couple back into the narrative. Both are the guiding principle of the franchise and the investigative passages in the families' homes are the culmination of these first two films. This time, faced with a family that needs help to face a supernatural phenomenon, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are once again called upon by the church to investigate the phenomenon and find out if it's worth doing any kind of intervention or even an exorcism. However, Lorraine is unwilling to face another case because she feels that Ed's life is threatened in some way (the explanation for one of the only loose ends in the first film - in short, the explanation of what had made Lorraine go 8 days away without not even eating years ago after an affair they were involved). Even wanting to support a family supposedly tormented by an evil entity, she can't accept the idea of risking the life of the love of her life. This duality between the altruistic desire to help the Hodgsons and the fear of losing Ed is evidenced in several moments of The Conjuring 2 just through Lorraine's eyes. Whether on relatively mundane occasions, like a family breakfast or singing around a guitar, or even tense scenes while paranormal manifestations actually take place.As mentioned before, this sequel lacks the freshness of novelty of the first and the overall structure of the script mimics that of the first film. But that doesn't detract from the shine of this sequel, which achieves the same quality as its predecessor and goes beyond. The director manages to create suspense sequences, establishing a genuine climate of horror. The few jump scares (those jumping scares in a chair) are very well employed. The suspense sequences are long, tense and surprising, whether for the moment of fright, or for the conception itself. In this The Conjuring ... 2, Wan creates a setting in which dream and reality get mixed up so that, at the end of each sequence, he achieves the ultimate horror realism, but obviously it has its problems. To create this environment, the script is also very close to his direction and photography. James Wan manages to present innovations in his direction, coming to show scenes through other perspectives of his characters, using different angles and taking advantage of the darkness as few filmmakers of the genre have managed to do until today.The film has an extremely well-constructed first act, well-directed, tense in the right measure and frightening, which indicated that it was another great example of the fruitful crop of contemporary horrors, however this only reveals how much The Conjuring 2 is an extremely film. Irregular, alternating great moments, with sequences that leave something to be desired. We start the film with a prologue that shows an affair that almost resulted in the Warrens' retirement, after the tense moment the viewer is introduced to the drama of the Hodgsons, an English family who sees their daughter and their entire house being haunted by a spirit, the fact that shocks England is the only thing that can get the demonologists back in business. Thus, at first there are two cores in the film, the life of the Warrens facing their conflicts and the beginning of the haunting in England. It is this beginning that resides the most interesting moments of this The Conjuring sequence.The first act which mainly focuses on the English part of the plot is extremely well directed, James Wan's long shots make the viewer feel that all that dread is happening live. With no apparent cuts, horror is much more palatable, at this moment the still young (but already very experienced) director carries the feature with very skillful hands using an incredible classic horror repertoire, referring from Illuminated to Poltergeist in an organic way and offering the film a rich visual imagery. At this moment, Wan offers a horror much more based on suggestion, tension and atmosphere than on horrifying apparitions and big scares.And the chasm is significant between that first act, part of the second with the rest of the movie. Much of this is due to the fact that there is a long delay for the Warrens to get involved in the case, this entire first moment the couple doesn't even know about the existence of that family and their hauntings, it gives the feeling that the viewer is watching two different films that blend in half of their stories. At this point, there is practically a narrative impasse, when Ed and Lorraine Warren get involved in the Hodgson case, the two take the lead in the story for themselves (as expected), however until that moment everything that went on in that house was seen by the narrative point of view of the youngest daughter of the family, and when Wan's camera suddenly leaves the girl's side to follow the investigation of the famous couple, it is as if the film has retreated from giving more dramatic involvement to the drama of the family. Haunted girl. So there seems to be an indecision on the part of the filmmakers themselves about what is really important in that work.It is also in this second moment that director James Wan indulges in all the cinematic exaggerations, if in that first part the filmmaker's movements were precise in that moment that should have been more tense, they seem to be a great juggling act, Wan seems to want to carry out all kinds of impossible plans, with cameras that start at the ceiling, do somersaults and end up through a window, all this without enriching the language itself or with any narrative effect. The Conjuring 2 seems to forget how frightening its viewer's imagination can be, excluding the power of suggestion and betting on countless computer-generated monsters that in the first and brief appearances can cause fright, but when shown to exhaustion, as it is in this case, ends up generating an incredible disinterest.Another characteristic feature of the director's career is his creatures. His films feature creatures that mark the viewer for their inventiveness and ability to evoke horror. And, best of all, he makes a point of showing his iconic-featured ghosts. In this point, Invocation... 2 takes risks in conceiving the Crooked Man: actor Javier Botet wears a costume that resembles a Tim Burton character and his movements emulate stop-motion animation. For some, this may be a breach of expectations, because, yes, it is out of tune with the movie. However, in addition to reinforcing the surreal atmosphere in which the family lives, the Crooked Man came out of a children's toy with moving images: there is a metalinguistic joke here, as if the director were rereading the old horror and fiction films and their animated monsters. In addition to this character, we have the nun Valak, the real devil in the movie. Every time she appears, it causes chills in the audience, especially in the scene in the frame at the Warren's house).Another point worth mentioning in the horror production is who is also acting. The title has a great differential as it counts on a cast that is really qualified for what it does, and the returns of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are essential for that. The development of your characters in this new chapter goes deeper, also showing their most intimate situations and creating greater empathy for them. Still, the additions of the entire Hodgson family, their neighborhood, and so many other characters are also worth mentioning, with a massive prominence for Madison Wolfe in her moments of despair and drastic changes involving possession.The Conjuring 2 has only one problem that breaks the mood a bit: the need to overcome the first feature. In the second one, now with an eight times bigger budget, some scenes try forcefully to be bigger, with bigger and more frightening dangers. It is understandable that this happens, due to the pressure for success generated by the good result of the first film (which earned US$318 million) and also to avoid following very similar paths. However, this exaggeration to try to surprise ends up not working as expected and scenes from the final minutes (when the attempt to impress is more obvious).A horror movie can be told simply through blood, death, and easy scares in succession, and still achieve its goal. However, The Conjuring 2 takes no shortcuts and manages to tell its story through contrasting periods of calm and fear, also including the beauty of an era perfectly recreated through costumes, sets and props. And if The Conjuring 2 makes its blunders it causes a feeling that the film could be a great contemporary horror, but turns out to be an extremely competent film, and that by the current standards of most blockbusters seen is already a huge compliment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

First time writing a movie review,"(Translated from Chinese, please forgive me for poor grammar and word usage)
Overall, although there are some minor shortcomings, the advantages can completely cover up these shortcomings. In many aspects, it is a breathtaking horror movie. Let's talk about the small shortcomings first. The development of the ending is a bit too deliberate. Although it is not easy to control the ending to be oppressive and uncertain based on the filming method and the previous layout, but in the end, I feel there is still a feeling that the development is probably expected, which is a bit of a waste of the previous excitement. It's not a shortcoming, but I personally feel it's a pity that the rhythm difference between the beginning and the end of this film is a bit big. From the perspective of beginning, connection, turning, and closing, the proportions are about 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% respectively. Although it is like music that accelerates the closer it gets to a tight place, but after watching the movie, I felt that the front was boring and the back was not enjoyable enough. Finally, for the good points, because there are so many things to say, I will briefly mention some of the points that are of concern. First of all, a horror film has the feel of a suspense film, especially with a lot of foreshadowing that you would not pay special attention to at first. How well laid out is it? It is comparable to good suspense films, but of course it should still be inferior to the top ones; as for the lens position used, I personally feel that this film makes full use of different lenses, in addition to God's perspective and oblique lenses, there is also a mixture of the two. The scenes and first-person shots are also used very well, especially one section that uses limited vision to create a scary atmosphere, which is impressive. Looking at these techniques like this, I think they are all clever and not artificial. It is really interesting. I admire it; I think the last plot part is also very good. From a macro perspective, understanding the plot of this movie will be of great help to the entire The Conjuring universe. It can connect the plots of several movies and fill in some doubts buried in other movies, and then just simply If you watch this movie, its plot also properly reflects the interaction between many characters, and even takes care of the audience's attention to the characters when advancing the entire plot, and the focus is still very clear.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Still entertaining,"Kimi no na wa...Ed and Lorraine back at with another paranormal case. This one was also very entertaining. Again, the scares were effective, and this time some were creative, especially the one involving the drawing of a nun. However, the scares weren't as intense and breathtaking as the first one, although there were more scares.However, this movie developed the relationship between Ed and Lorraine, and made me care for them more.The story became more complicated, which wasn't bad, but sometimes the movie felt a bit slow. The twist was pretty clever, and I noticed that the movie already gave the answer to the ending at the beginning.Overall, an entertaining sequel, albeit just a little bit not as fun as the first one. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrifying. Vera Farmiga at her usual best.,"The recent passing of Lorraine Warren prompted me to finally watch this sequel to the The Conjuring. The first one gave me nightmares and I have a feeling this one will too. I'm more easily scared these days, but this still felt like one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.The Conjuring 2 was horror film-making at its creepiest best. I felt like I couldn't really come up for air during its over 2 hour duration. The scares and creepy scenes just felt relentless (almost too much so). At one stage, my dog looked at me (with my hands over my eyes) as if to say, ""what the hell is wrong with you?""I'm a huge Vera Farmiga fan, and she is perfectly suited to the role of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson puts in a good performance too, and they share excellent onscreen chemistry. Whether or not you believe in ghosts or this particular case, it was still unbelievably terrifying - particular for me, who grew up in a haunted house.I'm not religious, but the religious element here was done well (without being preachy) and gave a bit of an Exorcist vibe to things. The film felt like a combination of Poltergeist, The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror.It was unexpectedly feel-good too! The ending made me smile and I certainly didn't think The Conjuring 2 would be the most uplifting film I'd seen in recent weeks. In saying that, it wasn't exactly a relaxing Friday night watch.RIP Ed and Lorraine - together again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great pickup sequel for The Conjuring universe.,"The Conjuring 2 is a great movie which have a great timing in presenting the horror clips with a great transitions.After watching the first part in the conjuring universe ""The Conjuring(2013)"" the expectations of the audience on the universe has taken a bit higher than the expectations on all the other horror movies. And I as an horror addict after watching the second part in conjuring universe ""Annabella"" I feel some disappointed for the story and the scenes in the first half of the movie. And lost hopes on the Conjuring universe.But after watching ""The conjuring 2"" the hopes on the universe has taken twice the hopes after watching the first part.

The action by Madison Wolfe 'Janet Hodgson' was so realistic and great.

A worthy sequel with some flaws.,"If you liked the first movie you will not be disappointed. The Conjuring 2 keeps most of the strengths of the first movie to create a tense atmosphere while telling a story with enough depth to keep you interested until the end. The camera work is worth mentioning since it is remarkably effective at creating fear and tension through forced perspective and blurry images.However, in this sequel the characters are not as well-defined as in the previous one. Most of the characters in the family have little personality and are defined by a single trait: the little brother stutters, the mom has money problems, the other brother does nothing. This might seem like minor detail in a horror movie but it hinders the creation of a connection with the characters and, therefore, worrying about what happens to them.The movie could have had more engaging characters but this won't prevent anyone from enjoying the film. It is a very good horror movie and a worthy sequel. I highly recommend it. Go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Let's Scare Ourselves to Death,"The Conjuring and its 2016 sequel are among those horror movies that totally blow your mind. The demonic forces and hovering spirits are present among us and may choose to interfere with our lives for one reason or another that has made them uncomfortable or mad and these movies are produced based on real stories of real people that were hunted by demons and crazy spirits. The script is neat, the acting's satisfactory, and the other elements are all fitting together just fine. Above all, the scary scenes are never exaggerated by blood splashes or extreme violence which, surprisingly, makes it even more horrifying 'cuz that's what you get to experience in your daily life no matter how much of a dull lifestyle you're getting to have. It's one movie you genuinely would be scared to even begin watching that you might prefer to play it in the daylight rather than night-time and this comes from a person who laughs at all the other horror movies.

"Unoriginal, yet scary","First of all, this was a surprisingly strong sequel. As a fan of the first movie, I've been looking forward to this for quite some time. I watch a lot of horror movies and it always really bugs me how the setting is similar in all of them: family moves into house, house is haunted, paranormal researchers arrive and save the day. This film was no different and didn't stick out as very creative either but it was still pretty enjoyable. You can usually expect a solid horror movie when you watch something by James Wan. The film has a few good, however predictable scares. It's not subtle horror either, but the jumping-in-your-face kind. I don't really get why this has been rated 10/10 so many times as it is definitely not flawless. Another thing about this movie was its duration. Horror films are usually around 1h 30m, except this one was over 2 hours which I found a bit too long. For example, was that scene of Ed singing ""Can't help falling in love"" really necessary? In my opinion, you kind of start to lose interest after an hour because there is just that about 20 minutes long part where nothing really happens. To summarize this, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the sequel held up to the first one, however I think that it is still just an average horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Worthy Sequel To The Celebrated Horror Flick,"'The Conjuring' released back in 2013 managed to achieve a cult status among the followers of the horror genre and the sequel with director James Wan himself wielding the megaphone was long-awaited by the movie buffs across the world.I was a bit late to try this movie due to varied reasons,but must say that the sequel was worth the wait and succeeded in keeping me thrilled till the end with its bounty of jump scares and old-school horror stuff.Its a herculean task to produce a sequel that matches the quality of the original in which most of the film-makers fail,but not a crafted auteur like James Wan who has struck it big in pushing the series forward with an equally thrilling sequel that has its share of excitement even-though the film is made in a platform that's blatantly similar to the first except being shifted from US to the British setting.The movie set in 1977 London is based on the series of events following the poltergeist activity reported by the Hogson family that's popularly known as 'Enfield Haunting' and the screenplay by Chad Hayes,Carey Hayes,David Leslie Johnson and Wan himself has developed the characters well and managed to narrate the events convincingly on screen.The characters of old Bill,Crooked Man and the inhuman spirit Valak were scary and shook up with their sudden appearances .Joseph Bishara is a maverick when it comes to sound design and here too amazes with an enthralling background score as in movies like Insidous and ones in the Conjuring franchise,namely 'The Conjuring' and 'Anabelle'.The soundtrack holds a major key in creating an air of dread that evolves into sudden scares.The technical soundness is notable with catchy frames,neat cuts and excellent art direction.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprises their role from Conjuring and did their part well.The surprise package was 13 year old Madison Wolfe reprising the role of haunted Janet Hogson who caught attention with her brilliant act and control in handling emotional sequences.The climax which ended all of a sudden was a weak link in an otherwise intriguing narrative and it felt as if Wan didn't take much interest in going into the detail of inhuman spirit Valak which is expected to be dealt in detail in the future.A Spin-off film named 'The Nun' showcasing the inhuman demon 'Valak' is on the cards and is anticipated to carry the Conjuring franchise forward,detailing the character that's introduced in this movie.Overall,'The Conjuring 2' is a neatly crafted sequel to 'The Conjuring' that's worth every penny paid for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Un-Scary Schlock,"I'm easily frightened by movies. I've never been able to get through Disney's ""Pinocchio."" ""The Conjuring 2"" is one of the least scary movies I've ever seen. I laughed out loud several times. I thought it was so ridiculous, heavy-handed, absurd, over-the-top.I was actually scared during one scene. Patrick Wilson, as paranormal investigator and allegedly Catholic anti-demon commando Ed Warren, wades into standing water underneath a suburban home. Everyone knows anyone who wades into standing water in a domestic setting risks being electrocuted. Alas, the only menace Warren faces is the cardboard outline of a standard-issue specter who rolls up behind him. Boo!The other scary factor: how old Franka Potente, who plays paranormal investigator Anita Gregory, has gotten. Back in 1998's ""Run Lola Run"" Potente was the embodiment of youth. Now  she's in her forties. Scary.I honestly don't know what filmmaker James Wan was trying to achieve. Was he really trying to make a scary movie, or was he trying to make a meta-commentary on how schlocky scary movies can be? I hope the latter, because that is what he has achieved. The saving grace of the film is the presence of Vera Farmiga, an actress who deserves so much better than this, but who shines like sterling amidst the dross.""The Conjuring 2,"" just like the original ""The Conjuring,"" is based on an allegedly true story. In 1977, in Enfield, England, two sisters, 11 and 13, claimed to be experiencing demonic possession. They were the child of a single mother and lived in a council house, that is a government welfare house. There was video footage proving that one of the girls was faking.Never fear. Ed and Lorraine Warren, an American couple who sold themselves as real live paranormal investigators and exorcists, showed up.""The Conjuring 2"" wallows in 1970s nostalgia. That there even is such a thing as ""70s nostalgia"" is evidence of the demonic. The men all wear wide lapels and wolfman sideburns. There is a lot of emphasis on retro tech, like bulky reel to reel tape recorders – the kind that actually could capture Satan's voice, whereas today's hand-held digital devices just don't pack the same punch.There is a loooong pointless scene where Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren, treats the possessed children to an imitation of Elvis Presley singing ""I Can't Help Falling In Love with You."" Watching this endless scene, I really wondered what was going on with James Wan, the director. Is he tired of cheap, teen horror and does he want a career as an artiste and auteur?""The Conjuring 2"" is really hard to look at. The allegedly haunted Enfield council house is visually repugnant. There are threadbare, royal blue chairs on a threadbare, royal blue rug. If you have any taste at all, you know what horror I dare invoke with these words. Everything in the house is begrimed. It looks as if a toddler had been rolled in molasses and car exhaust and then set loose on every fixture. And of course the family is so poor that they can't afford a single one-hundred watt bulb. The house is kept at forty-watt level throughout the film.The allegedly scary stuff: kids levitate and speak in deep voices. A scary nun appears. If you've ever gone to Catholic school you are laughing as hard as I was at this point. The nun looks so much like Marilyn Manson that I'm sure his lawyers are asking for their cut of the film's box office.There are some cinematic classics in the horror genre. James Whale's Frankenstein is indelible. ""The Haunting"" from 1963 is one of the most profound and disturbing films ever made. These films are about so much more than James Wan's bag of tricks, which consists of sending an impaired person into a dark space – say, Patrick Wilson after he's been partially blinded by escaping steam from a broken radiator, having that person stumble about, holding the camera on one spot for a long time, and then having a scary nun pop suddenly into the frame. Horror classics have something truly menacing and challenging behind the costume.There is something truly scary behind ""The Conjuring 2"" and behind the Amityville Horror, another Warren cause celebre. In both cases, we are talking about broken families. We are talking about kids who have troubled relationships with their parents, or absent parents. Shenanigans like the Warren's obscure the real facts that really need to be addressed. At least two of the children who grew up in the Amityville home say that they were abused by their stepfather. We were so busy looking for demons in that house we couldn't see the kids being hurt.Another disturbing aspect of this film. I'm really sick of James Wan's exploitation of Catholicism, a religion he evidences zero respect for but loves to exploit in order to plump up his box office. Wan is constantly tossing crucifixes, rosaries, and clerical garb onto his piles of junk. Ed Warren, in ""Conjuring 2,"" references the Catholic Church so many times it is monotonous. Wan is from Malaysia, a Muslim majority country. He is himself Chinese. I do not see him denigrating Islam or Confucianism in his films. He wants to avoid any risk of true horror.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

5/10,"Directed by horror veteran James Wan, ""The Conjuring 2"" picks up 6 years later of its predecessor and finds Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorrain Warren (Vera Farmiga) struggling with their marriage in the face of Lorrain being haunted by a demon whilst they accept to travel to London to help a single mother (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids whose house is being haunted by a malicious spirit trying to corrupt the younger sister (Madison Wolfe).When the first ""Conjuring"" came out the out-pour of love for it left me absolutely incredulous, I will admit it had a couple of good scares and overall empathetic characters, but the handling of the true story aspect of the film was disastrous, the direction wasn't particularly inspired and it was basically not scary to me and relied too heavily on what are only jump scares that are a little less noticeable because of how James Wan masks them.Still, I went into ""The Conjuring 2"" very open minded and wanting to be proved wrong, but most of all, I wanted a good horror ride filled of tension and scares. Just as with its predecessor, I find myself disagreeing with the love for this film. What I got was an overlong, bloated and occasionally offensive film. Normally if I find a movie to be offending my intelligence I go really low on it, yet ""The Conuring 2"" has enough moments to distract me from the very brief ones in which I found the filmmakers to be talking down on the audience and not treating them as equals.Just as with ""The Conjuring"", the haunted characters we are presented to are well fleshed out. They aren't by any stretch of the imagination as deep as a ""Chris MacNeil"" in ""The Exorcist"", but they do have a dynamic that's interesting and you can't help but stick behind them as they battle with their struggles because of how ordinarily they are presented to you and for my money there is a pretty clear inspiration on Wan's part from a much superior recent horror film: ""The Babadook"". There are some striking similarities in how the weight of being a mother is represented to you and whilst the inspiration is a little too evident, it really does work in getting you behind a mother continuously on the verge of breaking.Moreover, there is a strange bipolarism in the way this film is shot and edited. It looks like it was done by two different people. I'll talk later about the dullness of a half of the film, but there is some really inspired stuff in certain points and what makes it frustrating is that repeatedly when the film is having these great moments, it decides to cut away from them and go for some cheap horror tricks that result completely ineffective in the face of what was being built up. Indicative of this is a moment, at the start of the second act more or less, where the little boy goes down the house in the middle of the night to drink and we see him drink from the outside, on a steady shot showing just two windows in the house, it is a very simple shot, but in that moment a whole lot of possibilities open up and sprinkle amazing tension. And then what do the filmmakers decide to do? Cut to the garden outside where a swing is creaking.That is the kind of stuff that happens throughout the movie that left me baffled. Not to mention, the ridiculous use of jump scares by Wan. I honestly and unfortunately don't get why he is hailed as the greats horror director of our time. Really this sh*t is supposed to be scary? My suggestion to everybody is to watch ""Rosemery's Baby"" and get a real taste of what scary is, there are one, two at best, jump scares. What Wan does here is simply make everything culminate in a jump scare of some sorts, visually, with sound or dialogue, it's always there and by the third scare in I had given up on it. He is trying to build tension in some ways which always result cheap, because they are only there to serve the final moment and not the story. At no point I felt stakes for what was happening, it was all just so predictable and uninteresting from a horror point of view, I found it to be very unsophisticated, culminating in a finale that I had very little investment on, once again it was having good moments, but they were all overcome by the dullness of their surroundings.Which brings me to the next point: this script is a mess. With the exception o the above mentioned empathetic relation with the characters who are haunted, the rest of it terribly mishandled. Vera Farmiga gives a cringe worthy performance because of the ridiculous arch she is asked to handle. The mythology is all over the place, it is co chaotic and unclear it becomes offensive: there is no logic to what happens, which demon is which and why they collide together, I have literally no idea what was going on, who was haunting who, it was a disaster and just as messy was the handling of the true story element which isn't ever addressed in the film and asks the viewers for a suspension of disbelief that is just preposterous.Whilst there is respect for the filmmakers in what they are trying to do and for some of their inspired ides, I am very sorry that this is the type of horror that is being hailed at the moment and wouldn't recommend this ride to people.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy and classic horror,"Very briefly summarized: old-fashioned and good horror movie. I might also add that this sequel is just as good as its predecessor. But there is a but. The film begins very well. Mother and children in a house where it happens scary stuff. Many well-used but effective effects makes you cringe properly several times. Just like we will have a good horror movie. I also think it is a good choice to move the story from the US to London. It breaks well with the first film. Unfortunately, I think the last part of the film is not as good, unfortunately. The story is too complicated, and horror effects become too exaggerated, in my opinion. I also think the end, the settlement with evil was something strange. But this film is not bad in any way. I only wish it would hold the suspense up all along. Nevertheless this is one of the better ones in its genre, and it will probably continue to entertain fans of such movies. So we'll see what happens on the third film? I guess there will be several films to follow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great horror flick to watch on a Friday night,"The Conjuring 2 shows us the case of a family who is being haunted by the spirit of a man who used to live in their house when he was alive. He speaks and acts through Janet, one of the kids that live in the house and everything starts to go down for the family.First of all, this movie isn't related to the first one so you can watch it even when you haven't seen the first Conjuring movie.This is one of those stories we've heard and seen a million times before but the director James Wan presents it in such a fresh way that doesn't look full of clichés even when it has a few, like every other horror movie out there. The acting by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is great as it is expected, but the performance that really stands out, at least in my opinion, is the one from Madison Wolfe, who plays Janet, the 11 years old girl. She gives such a believable performance that I think is great and I would like to see what she does in the future.As the story goes on, the movie becomes even creepier with every scene. There aren't as many jump-scares as you would expect from an ordinary horror movie and the ones that are there are completely justified and they have a reason to be there, and this is something that James Wan always makes a good job like in his other movies like The Conjuring and the first two Insidious movies. I think the cinematography is great, I like the atmosphere they created inside the house even when it's daytime.So, should you watch it? Of course!

A great film that suffers from running time and going too big,The Conjuring 2 manages to up everything that was in the first one. Doing what most horror sequels tend to do by upping there production budget and effects even more. Sadly this is also what hurts the Conjuring 2 as it feels very bloated and very lengthy. A good horror movie should be 90 to 105 minutes in length no longer. This film instead is 134 minutes long making for a long over done film with waaay to much going on.The film just doesn't feel very concise has a good story . And the movie suffers from not enough being cut out and making it keep going on and on.The characters are still great as I love the relationship between the warrens and the love story that is also being told within this film as well.The cinematography is also amazing along with the sound design. Everything in this film has a purpose and adds to the film's beauty and all the fear that is being built up with it.This is a film I recommend to any horror fan as I think there is a lot to like here if your in that field,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A satisfyingly frightful film,"I have to admit, I wasn't The Conjuring's (2013) biggest fan. The film felt like yet another possession story that has been told in a very similar way since The Exorcist (1973). The jump scares were there and provided everyone in the theater a good spook, but the cliché nature of the film prevented from rating it anything other than O.K. James Wan's The Conjuring 2 is very much a story told in the same way as the previous film. Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again sent on task to aid a family being haunted by a truly terrifying demon. There are far more twists and turns to this iteration in The Conjuring series than its previous entry., but the most amusing part of this film is Wan's wonderful recreation of 1970's England. The Hodgson family is in great distress by the time the Warren's arrive, and sure enough, this films demonic presence doesn't like it. What transpires is a jumpy and at times horrific demon tale that is far from original.The movie progresses very much like the first entry and the acting throughout the film is serviceable if not mediocre at times. Thankfully, Wan pulls us into the horror immediately, leaving us on pins and needles for the films surprisingly lengthy run time (2+ hours). You are definitely getting a lot of scare for your buck, which is arguably the films greatest accomplishment. Many modern horror films run under 90 minutes, so a lengthy ghost tail is a treat. While the demon possession story has been told many times, the consistently ominous tone of the film is no joke. Wan's camera-work is wonderfully traditional for a horror film, full of close ups and some well planned continuous shots. The film ends abruptly and without much resolution, its hard not to wish there was a bit more put into the concluding moments. I don't how many more of these films in The Conjuring series can be made before they are cast aside a repetitive, but as long as Wan is behind the camera, its worth giving it a try7/10 - Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The Conjuring 2 builds up and up and gets you in its grip, which is what the best horror can hope to do.","James Wan is a big fan of horror. It's not always a surefire thing when a creator is someone who is so connected with a form of entertainment (see also from this opening weekend Jones's Warcraft), but if a filmmaker is in tune with the material he's in love with and it works on all cylinders, there's few pleasures to match it in mainstream cinema. This is a major release (done on a ""medium"" budget of 40 million) and it's done by someone who's clearly a geek for 70's horror, but in a way that is... classy. And scary as all hell; it's not often to use the almost DVD-cover level critic line but, really, The Conjuring 2, if you're open to it, will scare the s*** out of you.Wan's become so saavy with how to deal out suspense, and it comes down to how he paces things. This isn't a short movie, and it's longer than a lot of other movies of its genre at 134 minutes. This is to the film's benefit, as it gives a lot of time to build up the characterizations; Wan gives us the two narratives of this family in England, on poverty row basically, and how the 11 year old girl is traumatized repeatedly by this undead entity named Bill and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga's) own visions of a demon in a nun's outfit going after her and killing Ed (!) (this in part attached to that little known case in Amityville, NY). We get so much time with the both sides that by the time the Warren's come to England the movie's halfway in, and it's time to get to the meat of the story.A lot of what impresses me with The Conjuring 2 isn't so much the elements that we're familiar with by now when it comes to demonic-Christian-drenched horror: we know that the people will come in to the house with the crosses out to get the ghosts or demons or whatever-you-remember-from-The-Exorcist out, and that there will be characters flailing about in the air and objects flying across rooms and terrified characters. What matters is execution, and Wan and his cinematographer and production designer (this IS the 70's!) makes everything palpable and pop. When a little girl is hiding under the covers and Wan switches to a POV of the demonic entity coming in to the bedroom and towards her bed, it feels terrifying because of how all of the shots are paced and cut together and how much we believe this young actress (Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, outstanding especially in the quieter moments like on the swing with Lorraine when they meet).It's a terrifying trip into the darker recesses of the human soul, and it also comes down to how Wan makes sure to depict the people and places with a degree of honesty in the drama that is outside of the junk/baby food modern horror audiences are used to. It might be a lot sometimes to ask for quality acting, or a budget higher than 5 million, but it does make a difference, and here Wan takes his time with them and it's clear they had preparation before they stepped into a story that involves family and love at the core. I liked that part of it too, that it emphasizes the bond of a family, or a married couple, in the face of evil and demons and the afterlife. So while it deals in tropes of the genre - the audio recordings that reveal more than we first heard, the ""trick"" video footage, the otherworldly inner ""voice"" taking over a character (in a real, deeply troubling psychological sense than just the surface one too) - it doesn't cheapen what's happening to them.I felt invested in this family, which also features a compelling performance by Frances O'Connor as the mother of the family, and it pays off in set piece after set piece, paced out with wonderful bits for character development (including an acoustic Elvis performance by Patrick Wilson!), so that by the time the gigantic, thunderstorm climax comes we can still rock with the over-the-top punches that, of course, didn't happen in the ""based on a true story"". And yes, the climax is a little too long and features a CGI character that goes too far. But I can forgive these flaws because of the other 2 hours that came before it, which comes close to the likes of The Babadook and It Follows and even The Witch as far as digging deep into what makes people tic and drawing out the atmosphere of things like a room or a hallway or a flooded basement, and getting terror by simply holding on a shot sometimes for long enough for it to take on another meaning (i.e. Ed talking to ""Bill"", back turned, in close-up with the ghost out of focus but still in sight).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hmmm...,"Although a good movie, the story is an account of ( or ripped from ) a British drama called ""The Einfield Haunting"". This movie was good but did not do justice to the original events. I recommend people watch the original drama. The drama is a mini-series which covers the events quite extensively.The plot is also OK but nothing extra ordinary. In comparison I think the first movie was great. For people who do not care much about the source of the story, this should still be quite watchable. In this day and age where horror seems to be a synonym for gore and filth, you'd find this to be a fresh telling of actual events.Definitely creepy and well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"First Saw, then Insidious, and now this. Another Horror Masterpiece by the Wan and Only!","In this day and age, where Horror very seldom receives the attention and praises of which it is so worthy, creators of Horror films have to constantly challenge themselves with aspirations of newer heights. If you didn't successfully reinvent the wheel and improved on it - you project probably won't be as successful as others from different genres. ""If you want a good Horror film"", say the critics and reviewers, ""make a great one. If you want a great one - make a masterpiece"". ""Is that so?"" says genius director-screenwriter James Wan, ""challenge accepted!""At first, I must say I was slightly disappointed having realized that The Conjuring 2 isn't a straight sequel, and doesn't pick up after the events of the first film (as I was looking forward to getting some long overdue answers and closure). The sequel, in short, as another crazy Ed & Lorraine Warren adventure, beginning with a fine and well deserving tribute to the famous Amityville incident. Her premonitions still haunting her, Lorraine hopes to convince Ed to stop their work as Possession/Haunting 911, but the two find themselves unable to send away a family in need, who is haunted and terrorized by yet another malevolent entity of the underworld. Nothing new so far - but only because I'm refraining from spoilers. Towards the final third of the film, Wan presents one of the best, most off-guard catching twists since Insidious.As in the first film and the less impressive spin-off ""Annabelle"", the story is divided into the main plot (Ed & Lorraine to the rescue vs. haunting spirit), and a side-plot portraying an entity haunting the couple itself. Both come to a closure in a suspenseful, creative and innovative manner as only Wan has been able to produce in the past decade. The story is compelling, interesting and well presented, and the conclusion is absolutely marvelous!As in the previous film, Patrick Wilson is extraordinary and Vera Farmiga is only slightly less impressive. Patrick McAuley deserves as many complements for such fine acting skill at such a young age. However, the show is breathtakingly stolen by Madison Wolfe as little Janet, the spirit's main point of interest. In the first film I thought I'd seen the pinnacle of ""possessed""-acting, but just as Wan was able to higher the stakes of writing and direction - Wolfe presented a whole new level of exquisite acting.In addition, The Conjuring presented one of the scariest Horror icons ever seen on screen (being Annabelle, the nightmare-inducing doll). I really hadn't expected Wan to be able to top that. Surprise surprise, he did. The painting and appearance of the ""nun-demon"" in this film is one of the most terrifying images I've ever seen, very much resembling the haunting spirit in Insidious, yet not enough to qualify as recycling.As for the other info some might find interesting - the music and soundtrack are as ""Wan"" as can be, combining haunting thrilling tunes with nursery rhymes, with the addition of a religious song. Hey, if it worked so greatly in Insidious, why change it? The cinematography is nothing special, but this goes unnoticed during the films. In addition, just like in the first film, cliché jump- scares are almost non-existent, and the very few that do appear are in very good taste.In summary, the creator of Saw and Insidious has done it again, placing The Conjuring franchise right at the top with the best of them. I never have high expectations of sequels, but I tell you, Wan is going to make a believer out of me yet. I had to think a lot about the rating I was going to give this film, but the final plot twist (which is of a whole new level and never seen before) made it an easier decision. If you are in any way a fan of Horror - go watch the first film, and then this one. You'll be happy (and terrified) that you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Exceptional Fictionalized Film About a ""Real Life"" Haunting/Possession","This is NOT a Documentary. It Amazes how many Professional/Armchair Critics Bias Their Reviews of a Movie like this because of Their Enormous and Unwavering Skepticism of the Paranormal, The Real Life Investigators, The Warrens, and approach this Thing as though it is Making a Definitive Case on the Real Life Incident.This MOVIE is a Fictionalization of a Reported Haunting/Possession in the Mid-Seventies, in England. If You Seek Information about the Event, there are Documentaries and News Accounts Available for Perusal.Director James Wan, follows His Hit ""The Conjuring"" (2013) and brings back Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as ""The Warrens"", a Real-Life, Controversial, Husband and Wife Paranormal Investigative Team.

The Conjuring 2 (2016),"Three years after he blew the doors off cinemas across the country with one of the biggest modern horror movies, The Conjuring, James Wan comes back with a true sequel to The Conjuring, aptly titled The Conjuring 2. Often, horror sequels try to get too big or too flashy and end up being far inferior to their predecessors. The Conjuring 2 is certainly bigger and flashier, but James Wan has some gift for taking a generic storyline and making it scary as hell. The Conjuring 2 takes place six years after the original film in Enfield, London. It's based on the Enfield Haunting, one of the most well-documented paranormal cases of all time and was labeled ""England's Amityville."" In this haunting the Hodgson family, a single mother and her four children, are being tormented by a spirit and call on several paranormal investigators to help them, including Ed and Lorraine Warren. The case quickly turns into a media circus with allegations that the haunting may be a hoax, and the Warrens have to decide if the kids are playing an elaborate prank or if the Hodgsons are living in a very real nightmare. Being a horror sequel, or really just a movie sequel in general, it's expected that this movie is going to up the stakes and flashy imagery compared to the original film. The Conjuring 2 is no different. There really isn't a scene that's as brilliant as the hide-and-clap game with Lili Taylor from the first Conjuring. However, at a staggering 134 minutes, James Wan packs in a ton of surprisingly durable scares. After a great opening sequence, Wan gives us about 5 minutes to get acquainted with the Hodgsons before already scaring us silly with the first night at the Enfield house. There's tons of agonizingly long tracking shots that ratchet up the tension for an incredibly long time. What's great is that not all of these shots end with a jump scare. Be warned though because if there is a jump scare, it's perfect. There's not a single cheap jump in this movie. The ""scare scenes"" themselves are very long; once one of those great tracking shots is done, you'll go to another person for an equally scary scene. Because there's so much suspense and so many scares in the movie, the 134 minute running time never feels too long. It feels just right, although the scares might be exhausting by the end of the movie. Wan also has a knack for making an old scare new again. He can somehow make a tired jump scare scary again, but at the same time, it's not quite as fresh as it was the first time. That's what holds back The Conjuring 2 from surpassing the original film. The Conjuring 2 does have some heart though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the married ghostbusters, and the Hodgson family is a likable group of people to hang out with for two and half hours. Madison Wolfe steals the show as Janet, who gets put through the wringer throughout the whole movie. Even if it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, The Conjuring 2 is an incredibly scary thrill ride that'll be hard to top this summer. I do have to admit that I did scream very loudly once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good stuff,"Three years ago, the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the Malay director, James Wan - my king, master and role model -.

A better and scarier film than the first,"The 1977 British haunting known as the Enfield Poltergeist has sparked controversy and has been accused of being complete hogwash. The famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) have now got their work cut out for them with this one. But director/co-writer James Wan is not concerned about busting myths. The guy wants us to be scared silly and have a ball. He has succeeded. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.That's the modus operandi of Wan's latest scare-a-thon, the sequel to the 2013 summer blockbuster. This is better than the first – bigger, scarier and much more intense. The first film was fun, but it relied too heavily on nostalgic and retro traits, having aped/paid homage to 1979's ""The Amityville Horror"". This new one is no different – it acts as a ""greatest hits"" album of classic horror movie moments – specifically, those of ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Exorcist"".Wan's passion for the genre shines through in every scene. His unnerving atmosphere soaks the film in a shroud of doom and gloom, relentlessly unleashing his old- school house of horrors until the curtain call. It creaks, it moans, it shrieks when need be, never short-changing the character development and audience in the process.This is not the horror film of the year so far (that honour belongs to the haunting indie film ""The Witch""), but as far as popcorn horror films go, this one's really good - and a good stepping stone to introduce newcomers to ""Exorcist""-style classics, a trait which I suspect was Wan's true intention all along, having already establishing himself as today's go-to filmmaker for spooky films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Strong follow up,"The Conjuring 2 is a solid follow-up to the original, delivering a gripping and atmospheric horror experience. James Wan returns to direct with his signature style, bringing back the beloved paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, played once again by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. This time, the film focuses on the infamous Enfield haunting in London, and the change in setting adds a fresh feel to the sequel.The movie excels in its suspenseful build-up, eerie visuals, and strong performances. Wilson and Farmiga's chemistry continues to ground the supernatural story with emotional weight, making their relationship just as engaging as the horror elements. The film has several memorable scares, including the chilling introduction of the demon nun Valak, which has become iconic in its own right.While The Conjuring 2 is a worthy sequel, it doesn't quite reach the same tightness as the first film. Some moments feel a bit drawn out, and the final act, while exciting, leans more into spectacle than the subtle, nerve-wracking tension that made the original stand out. Still, it's a fantastic horror film with great atmosphere, strong performances, and plenty of frights.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Holy shi't, James Wan!","Are you trying to give me a heart attack?You want to talk scary? THIS is scary. 2013, Wan came out with another horror movie, called The Conjuring. It didn't take long before it got hailed as one of the best new horror movies. And I couldn't help but agree. I hadn't found a movie so scary in a long time.Then I today went to the theaters to see the sequel. I was hopeful, despite the common once-is-enough rule when it comes to horror movies. But I gotta say, this movie was fantastic. I loved it even more than the first one! First off, if there's anything Wan knows how to do, it's an opening scene. If you're not invested from the start, it's a little harder to get into a movie meant to be frightening. But he succeeds with exactly that, and I feel exhausted before the title scroll even has shown up. The story when you think about it, is pretty similar to the first, but with the big difference that not only the family with the haunted house in the danger. Ed and Lorraine themselves are too! And I have to give credit for how their characters were developed in this movie. The movie delves very deep into the personalities of them, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga doing an extraordinary job making them likable. They are well-written not only as two people really passionate about their unusual profession, but as a loving and caring couple as well. The scenes where they show their affection for each other are superb.But of course, I'm mainly here to talk about whether or not it was effective as a horror movie. And it sure as hell was. Jumpscares or not, when you think about it... Doesn't Crooked Man just scare the s'hit out of you? And doesn't it feel disturbingly surreal when a girl suddenly gets the palest face and starts smiling evilly, all while speaking with a rusty old man's voice? And doesn't it make you uneasy when something simply supposed to be a painting comes to life?The Conjuring 2 is more than just the half-creepy/half-amusing horror movie you watch and then forget about. It's an experience. One that makes you speechless with wonder.9.5, the rating is only knocked down by a few cheesy moments and (very intermittent) parts of off pacing. I recommend it to anyone desperate for a revival in the genre. Because real horror... is finally back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Conjuring 2The biggest difference between American and British ghosts is the latter stops haunting you at teatime.However, this horror movie doesn't divulge if its phantoms take 1 lump or 2.Amityville experts Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are dispatched by the Vatican to investigate a demonic possession across the pond.However, Lorraine is hesitant in helping a mum (Frances O'Connor) rid her daughter (Madison Wolfe) of a demon due to a prophetic dream she had involving Ed's death.While she eventually agrees to participant, the case it self may not be as supernatural as they first thought.Based on one of Britain's most notorious hauntings, this somewhat factual sequel is enhanced by the ambiguity of the Enfield occurrences themselves.

typical James Wan,"Starting off with a compilation of what happened at the Amityville house it all looked fine. If you want to know what happened go watch the original one (1979).

Based on the real events late seventies at Enfield.And again i was tricked or possessed by the trailers shown were people are really scared and are screaming. Been in the genre almost 35 years I thought, could it be as scary as The Exorcist (1973). Sadly it wasn't.What it does is again having a lot of jump scene's and creepy voices but even as I did like part 1 this one couldn't satisfy my hunger.Some parts I did enjoy and of course children being possessed do offer something weird but it's so typical James Wan so you know what to expect and you do know what is going to happen like a ghost passes by in a slow and creepy way.

The Conjuring 2,"The Conjuring 2, I thought the first one wat promising and decent enough and decided why not watch the next one. Imo, I came out of this feeling similar to the first. Well put together visually, but often empty inside, never really tied up with a finale that makes it worth the typical slow burn these movies have.Directing, even more creative stuff from Wan here, my comment still stands though, it's cool, but it doesn't exactly serve a function and neither increases immersion. Besides that, I think this has the better jump scares than the first, just the way they are put together. 2-3 got me here, whilst only 1 got me in TC1.That being said, jump scares are cheap and not really a part of movies that are scary, just tense and somewhat annoying if they are so formulaic. Wan loves that slow zoom with the slow incoming silence.As for the story, it's noticeably longer, and has a somewhat better conclusion, this movie felt a bit more whole as a idea. That said, I don't think the extra time was warranted and it could've done with some trimming.Acting, again, all good. Music, subtle, not very memorable.Horror/scary factor. Compared to the first conjuring this has better jumps, but the monsters are a bit meh, just as TC1, the close ups are stronger though.For now, I see these movies as a very accessible horror. It's simple but works.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan + Conjuring 2 = The best conjuring until now,"Conjuring 2 is an amazing movie.Script is darker than the previous one, storyline is more creepy, i really loved the interpretation of all actors, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga gave us amazing moments with their roles.I rewatched this film for about 8 times, James Wan made an amazing job in 2016 he is a very talented director.Unlike the first movie Conjuring 2 includes more characters ( Crooked Man Valak and their vessel Bill Wilkins ) the whole idea to make Valak use Bill Wilkins as it's vessel for me it still gives me the creeps.Nothing more to say about this movie for me is the best Conjuring movie i ever saw.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Much Better Than The First But Still Not In Love,"Everyone was going on about this one being better than the first so tonight I went. The first one wasn't even the least bit scary to me. This one does have quite a few more scares, but they are all jump scares. My biggest dislike was the movie ended quite abruptly when it shouldn't have because it drug on for two hours and then when the actual climax occurs it lasts a good 10 seconds and boom the end. Since that was the entire point of the movie it made no sense whatsoever for the scene to only last 10 seconds. So I'll totally give it credit for jump scares and for the cast including awesome Franka Potente (she's in awesome German films), but it is one of those films that could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Genuinely Scary Sequel,"The Conjuring 2 is one of those extremely rare horror sequels that doesn't fall victim to copying it's predecessor. While The Conjuring 2 isn't free of clichés and isn't better than it's predecessor, it's a really solid horror film separate from the original. The Conjuring 2 is chilling without relying on jump scares, features really good character development, despite being a tad familiar. This film may prove that James Wan is the modern king of horror, because every horror film he does is solid.One thing to learn from this film is that while jump scares are a cheap way to get scares, they can be very effective when used sparingly. Many modern horror films rely solely on jump scares to scare the audience, but this film has a truly chilling tone, and many scenes are terrifying without jumping the audience. That being said there are jump scares littered throughout this film, but Wan is clever when he uses them, and is often effective when he uses them. I'm proud that most horror films don't jump me, that being said multiple times watching this film I found myself jumped.One major reason this film succeeds is because of the character development, which really helps the audience care about the characters. Every single character in the film is well fleshed out, and given a moment of relatability. Even the ghosts in the film are generally scary and have a really good design. However, the film's characters represent one of the film's major problems, the fact that it's based on true events. After seeing this film it would seem to say that the phrase ""based on true events"" was only included for dramatic effect.The story of the film is based on the actual events of the Enfield Poltergeist in England in the late 70's but the problem is that half the film uses moments from that investigation and the other half feels like an exorcist rip off. It's unfortunate because there's a terrifying story, despite the evidence that it was a hoax, in the Enfield Poltergeist that gets lost in the shuffle. Simply put if the filmmakers hadn't felt the need to match The Exorcist, the film's ending may not have felt so different from the rest of the film.In the end for horror buffs, this may be the best horror film of the year, if nothing better comes along. For those who want to see a great horror film regardless of its faithfulness to the actual events this is a great film, but for those who want a faithful adaptation of the Enfield Poltergeist this film definitely takes some liberties. That being said this film is genuinely scary which is rare today, and above that is just a good film in general, so it's most definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Enough Horryfying and Scary to give you Jitters, a well deserving worthy Sequel.","THE CONJURING 2 REVIEW - Yeah Finally watched it in theater and got a feel of watching a scary horror film in theater after a long time. Couldn't watch The Conjuring in theater but loved it when i watched it in Mobile so i was eagerly waiting to watch The Conjuring 2 in theater at any cost. Expectations were little bit higher and movie pretty much matched that level. Follow my Details -Acting - Good but not upto the mark. Reason- Director didn't give much attention to this field as this is a horror flick not Cult Classic cinema. Still i feel Acting could have been better by all actors.Writing - Very Good ! Story has been written very well, twists and realisticness deserves appreciation.Screenplay - Fantastic ! Screenplay is very tight from the beginning till the end except starting 10 mins which takes time to set a plot, then movie takes pace and keep you hooked till the end.Dialogues - Average ! Nothing impressive, ordinary dialogues and really can't expect much from a True Story.Cinematography - CLASS ! Wow, great work by cameraman. Most scenes have been shot in Dark, Each and every angle looked scary and eye pleasing.Direction - Good but not Great. It is a sequel so obviously everyone will compare it to its prequel and that's why i think Direction wasn't as great as previous one. But still a praise worthy work by a Director, its not easy to complete people's high expectations (Because its Prequel). Film looks tight from its beginning but loose Climax i mean The Conjuring had longer and more interesting climax than this. Here Director failed badly, he could have easily make Climax little bit more scary and interesting but i don't know why he didn't do it.Final Words - Not better than The Conjuring and Despite having bit of loose climax this one is a Must Watch for all. Film will definitely leave you with an scary impact and jitters. Go for it, and enjoy another Breathtaking, Scary and Dangerous experience from Hollywood. 7/10 * Stars by Me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nothing in The Conjuring 2 can match the terrific hide-and-clap sequence from the earlier film,"Nothing in The Conjuring 2 can match the terrific hide-and-clap sequence from the earlier film – let's face it, that was always going to be hard to top – but that's not to say this sequel doesn't pack its share of solid scares. With 2013's The Conjuring, director James Wan, creator of both the Saw and Insidious franchises, managed to pump fresh blood into a genre as creaky as the haunted house thriller. This time he gives us a slow-building pressure-cooker of a film that's a respectable follow-up.Set in 1977, not long after their success in the now famous Amityville case, the film sees hotshot paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) dispatched to London to look into the complaints of a family who claim they're being terrorized by a spirit.Cash-strapped single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids are dealing with a lot in their home – toys go on by themselves in the night, furniture starts flying across the room, and there are frequent rumblings and rattlings from behind the walls that can't be explained. But things really come to a boil when youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) begins to growl in an old man's voice, and their lives become seriously endangered.The film's period setting and England's gloomy weather contribute a lot by way of atmospherics, and the Hodgson home in a working-class London suburb is all kinds of creepy with unsettling dark corners and rotting damp walls. Wan sets up the mood for some effective scares, giving us the kind of jump-in-your-seat moments we've come to expect from him now. Creepiest of all is a scene involving a framed painting on a wall, and the appearance of long white fingers from behind it.But like the earlier film, what really separates this one from your standard issue horror movie is the level of performance that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the table. They're such good actors they sell the audience on even the cheesier aspects of the story, and of course on the romantic bond between the couple.Although it feels way too long at roughly 133 minutes, and takes many liberties with the truth while still insisting it's based on true events, The Conjuring 2 ultimately succeeds in delivering slow-mounting dread punctuated by powerful moments of absolute terror. I don't know if I can see a nun dressed in a habit without a chill going down my spine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Spoiler-free review the conjuring 2,"Honestly, i think this is the best movie in the conjuring universe. This movie is scary, long and romantic (Ed and Lorraine). I think that this one is just better than the first one because it has better jumpscares, there are more scary scenes and it's longer. Acting 8,1/10. Cinematography 8,3/10. Plot: 7,9/10. Special effects 9,2/10. I think Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga did a really good job, playing Ed and Lorraine Warren. I was terrified at some moments, they did a really good job. There were some decent jumpscares to some very good ones.I highly recommend this movie to watch because i had a great time with this movie.

Best demon movie I recommend you to watch (but not alone)!,"Well I will give a honest opinion. Also I don't like to compare this movie with 1st one.The scare tactic used in this film is different to the first. Oh! I am already comparing LOL!! You see a lot jump scare scenes in this movie. So if you have a weak heart, better watch it with ears closed. It not just the visual but the sound effects can make you jump. The portrait scene is probably the best scene in developing a tension in the audience. The mirror scene in trailer is also good. People were laughing out loud after every jump scare. It does not mean its not scary as some people here think so. They are laughing because it scared them and they don't want people around to know about it. Laughing probably makes them feel cool. So it's quite entertaining to see people going through all this. I loved it as I was there watching in the cinema hall on a late night show and the expressions of people around was priceless. I think this is the only film where I have witnessed too many jump scares which are actually horrific. There are many great horror movies and we know they get the tension build up slowly and in the process waste a lot of time. In this movie, it was not the case and that's what makes me watch it with more curiosity. But I recommend not to watch it alone especially if you are scared of demons. The Nun demon is damn scary for children. So keep your kids away. The jump scares can kill a old person with weak heart. So you better know what you are going to watch is actually entertaining but can be disturbing if you are alone. I am not so scared of demons but even I jumped when there was a jump scare situation. The TV scene did make me jump. I was not scared but it was too sudden and shocking which made me jump. I enjoyed this movie more than any demon movie because of this very reason. Go ahead if you want this experience! It has a mix of slow tension as well as jump scare scenes. Worth watching and yes it is the best demon movie I have ever seen!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Don't believe the hype,"I read a lot of reviews on here about how this movie was extremely scary and it was better than the first movie. After watching it I totally disagree. I was hoping to be scared, although it just seemed like all the scares were all just quick jumpy scares, and that gets boring if that is what all the scares are. Over time the scares began to become less frequent which made the movie very tiresome near the end. I was really trying my hardest to stay awake near the end of the movie because it got really slow and boring. The ending was very weak as well, nothings worse than a quick ending almost like a snap of your fingers and its over. That is what this movie felt like at the end. I didn't really even like the first movie, however It had my attention more in this movie. My review may have been higher if i had some green helpers with me to watch the movie although i did not and I was disappointed because of it.

Wear a diaper in-case you are easily scared.,"A sincere thank you to James Wan for reviving the franchise after the debacle called ""Annabelle"". James Wan is probably the only director currently in Hollywood who is capable of making a believable horror film. The genre which is just full of either horror-comedy or horror gore was really becoming boring before Conjuring. It was becoming boring but then comes Conjuring 2. James Wan is a messiah of the horror genre.Not going to talk about the plot but I am going to say this that a good horror movie doesn't need loud noises to build up a scene and James Wan knows that. Every build up scene in this movie just has the breathing of the characters or the noises on the wooden floors or a creepy chime music. That's all and BOOM!. The acting is very believable. Especially the little girl. Patrick and Vera are exceptional. The main crux of a horror movie is that you are not scared of the ghost or demon but you are scared for the characters and the imminent threat looming on them. If you don't care for the characters then a horror movie is a lost cause. You care about the Warrens and that keeps you hooked to every dark room, every whisper around them. I had a little problem with some jokes in the movie which I think could have been avoided but it's fine.It is refreshing to watch a good horror movie and I would urge you to go alone if you want the full thrill of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A true story, but then Hollywood became involved","A true story and as I was living in the UK (and Southgate in Enfield), I knew of the story. Also there have been many newspaper articles, documentaries, books and films about it.In real life a renowned paranormal investigator was involved and he wrote books and I think assisted with films made about the events.In Hollywood, that's not good enough. Although he is featured, the church need to call the Cavalry - here come the Americans. I really have no memory of this couple and their team being involved, but hey ho. It's a film 'based on.....'.Anyway, the film: The initial scary scenes were scary, but I was a little distracted by the awful fake accents of the actresses playing mum and daughter - who, I guessed weren't English (were there no British actresses available, or ANY actresses that could pull off a London accent). Also the policewoman would never refer to the mother as 'ma'm', it would be 'Mrs.......'.Anyway, in comes the paranormal investigator, but that's not good enough, the church want the American team and in they come. They also bring a demon nun - yes a demon nun. The initial furniture moving and door knobs rattling were scary, but we then get the full Hollywood treatment and the film becomes a run of the mill ghost story with cheap shocks, silly sound effects and annoying music.We seemed to be seeing more of the Americans and their problems at home with the nun, than the Enfield setting. It had become boring and 'nothing new to see here'.It did transpire in real life that the whole happening was a hoax, I'm sure the young girl was on some programme or another stating this. It was mentioned that the family may have devised the hoax in order to get a new council house - now why would they want to move from that palace? Only joking - yikes what was that house? The walls were riddled with damp, it was dark and dingy, it's not like that on the true footage. I'll have to look up the basement too as not many UK houses have a basement now - and the washing machine in the basement is a US thing.If you want a great ghost story - watch The Changeling with George C Scott. That has some scary moments and more importantly, has a great story explaining the haunting.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not As Good Or As Scary As The First,I was surprised to see this movie was rated slightly higher than the original and even more surprised at some of the reviews saying it was a masterpiece and one of the best horror sequels ever.Then I started reading more reviews and saw more people saying what I felt: it just wasn't very good or scary.The set up of the movie took way too long (the Warrens don't become involved until over the first hour mark) and the movie overall could've been trimmed down.The old man IMO simply wasn't scary enough and the nun demon lost her luster as well.The first Conjuring movie was scary as hell and had a good story.

Intense and pretty scary in places. 7/10,"Review: This movie did take some time to get going but once the plot unfolds, it's nearly as good as the first movie. I'm glad that the director got the same actors to play Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), because the movie wouldn't have worked without them. The chemistry between the 2 actors is brilliant, and there demonising skills are truly remarkable. They never seem to panic under pressure, so when they get the call about a family in Enfield, England, who have a demon taking over the daughters body, they are straight on the case. With the media watching the house, the pressure is really on the couple from America, who struggle to believe that there is paranormal activity happening in the house. The single mother, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), tries everything to save her young daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), whilst struggling to pay for the roof over her head, and to feed her children. After seeing a tape of Janet faking an episode, Ed & Lorraine decide to leave London but Lorraine can feel that something is wrong. They then decide to go back to the house, and what they witness is truly out of this world. Basically, you have to watch the movie, especially as it's based on true events, to see the true impact of what the poor family had to go through. The bonus material is also pretty creepy, because you get to see the surviving family members, who say that the movie is very close to the events that happened in 1977. Anyway, although I preferred the original, I still enjoyed this film, and you can't help rooting for the family, who definitely wouldn't have made it without the help of Lorraine & Ed Warren. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I'm so glad that the director of the first movie, James Wan, 39, returned for this sequel, because he really did a great job, in terms of bringing the Warren's cases to the bring screen, and the intensity in both films where brilliant. At such a young age, Wan's first project Saw, which was released in 2004, made headlines in the movie world, and then he went on to direct Death Sentence, Dead Silence, Insidious 1&2, the original Conjuring and Fast & Furious 7. His next project is the highly anticipated Aquaman, with Jason Momoa playing the lead, so he certainly doesn't shy away from big budget projects. With the success of the Conjuring franchise, and Fast & Furious 7 being the 6th biggest movie of all time, he certainly has achieved a lot, so early in his career and I'm sure that Conjuring 3, if there is one, will be just as successful as the previous movies.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $370.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers, starring Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Simon McBurney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Franka Potente and Simon Delaney. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"It overcomes its poor plot with new, effective scares.","As I walked out of my showing of 'The Conjuring 2' I overheard a family talking amongst themselves. The youngest boy said that the film itself wasn't what scarred him but the noises did. This made me think a lot about what many people deem as horror. It's strange that, to many people, fear is not measured by how it makes them feel but by how far their butts left their seat. For me this is not effective horror. When I see a horror film I want to be affected by it. I want to feel that sense of dread that churns deep in your stomach and makes you sweat through your clothes. Unlike many people that saw this film with me, I thought this film did just that.It's sad that people are writing off this films effectiveness based on the fact that there weren't many jump scares. I mean, there were obviously some in there but the majority of the film is atmosphere. The atmosphere that this film builds really gives off a sinister vibe. As I watched, an eerie feeling washed over me. The sense that this is not something we are suppose to be watching.And this feeling continued for the films two hour run time. The more sinister the plot gets the more you just feel a sense of helplessness. This sense of dread helped the film be more than just any other horror movie. With this feeling surrounding the film the scares hit hard. It knows that jump scares are far better than false scares and it uses it's atmosphere to really make you lose it.If anything jumps you in the film it is the ghost or something the ghost does. It's never like a bird flying around or a person grabbing someones shoulder. Instead the film actually uses the ghost to scare you. What I loved about this movie is how many new, different scares where in it. It's clear that James Wan was having a blast making this movie and he experimented with a lot of new things.Some fall flat but most are extremely cool and effective. Not only was he experimenting with new scares but new camera movements as well. Which all turned out super impressive. There's a great birds eye view shot of people running down a alley that made my jaw drop. That's what separates this film from so many others.The cast and crew seemed like they were having way to much fun with it. It gave the film energy that many don't have. This helped 'The Conjuring 2' elevate itself over a relatively bland story. A story that we have all seen a million times over. Where someone gets haunted, the family gets involved, than things get really bad so they call experts in to cleanse the house.The fact that this isn't anything new or different really does hurt the film. It makes a lot of the scares predictable and the plot points less sharp. Not only that but when your movie runs for more than two hours with a story like this it can get a bit dry near the end. Especially when the previous hour and a half was a none stop scare fest.It's at that point where I began to realize that not a single character had any personality what so ever. All anyone was, was a plot device for the script. A means of forwarding the story to the next scene. They would do something that a normal human probably wouldn't do, get freaked out and than it was on to the next scene.While 'The Conjuring 2' may not be as good as the first film it is still a solid horror flick. It knows what it is and doesn't bother with the extraneous ""character building"" that many others do during the opening half hour. While it certainly would've made the film better to have characters we cared about, not pretending like they were doing this helped get to what we paid for. Getting the pants scared off of us. And this film does that in a fresh, new, and very effective way. If you're a horror fan this one should not be missed. Just make sure to manage your expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"I liked it, but I was expecting something even better, and I have some doubts about the script.","I loved the first movie and honestly had good expectations for this sequel. I don't know if that was what clouded my judgment or not, but the fact is that I was a little disappointed: I was expecting something more that I'm not sure what could be, but that never come. However, I admit that the problem may be more in myself than in the film.The film begins by taking a very brief approach to the Amityville case, which is already quite retold in cinema, as we know. Starting from these initial scenes, we accompany the Warrens, a famous couple of psychic investigators, to the United Kingdom, to investigate the famous Enfield haunting, which has also been previously dramatized. And here begin my questions and doubts: wouldn't it have been better to leave Amityville aside and think of another way to start the film? It doesn't seem that difficult, and it would remove from the film the strange feeling that it wanted to address two supernatural cases at once. And one more thing: after some reading, I realized that the Warrens' has had a very minor participation in the investigation of the Enfield case (which almost everyone today considers to be a forgery). Wouldn't it have been more interesting to address a case that the Warrens had really studied, and that was perhaps not as famous and as clearly false as Enfield's?Overall, I liked the movie. To say otherwise would be to lie. It is an elegant film, which fulfills what it promises and knows how to present itself as a solid production and stand out from the immensity of low-budget indie films that abound in the horror genre. It also seemed like a worthy successor to the first ""The Conjuring"" film. But I really lacked something, as I said before. I liked the way it builds tension and the atmosphere of suspense is genuine and solid. However, most scares are predictable and there is not much original. Another problem I felt was the uneven pace and the length of the film. The beginning is too slow, it takes a long time to introduce the story and an infinite amount of time passes before things start to ""warm up"". Afterwards, everything happens so quickly that we hardly have an opportunity to taste the fear.Skillfully directed by James Wan, the film retains the participation of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson from its predecessor. Already familiar with their characters, they do even better than in the first film: Wilson is the one who has evolved and improved the most, but it is still Farmiga who steals the attention and dominates the film, with a great presence and a very competent performance. Frances O'Connor was also very good and professional in her role. Madison Wolfe and Lauren Esposito are also okay. Simon McBurney could have been better, but it seems to me that the script didn't give his character as much attention as the one he really deserved.At a technical level, it is a film that justifies every cent of its budget: the CGI and the visual and sound effects are the best that was available to Hollywood and works fine, blending perfectly with a cinematography that captures the foggy London environment and loads it with more shadows and darkness whenever it is opportune. The light and the absence of it is, in fact, one of the elements that most helps to build fear in this film, as well as the sound, the sound effects and a subtle and more skillfully designed soundtrack than the one that was used in the first movie. The design of the monsters and demons worked perfectly, especially the nun, and the design of the sets is excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A brilliantly crafted piece of cinema,"I don't often give a ten, but this time here goes my vote.I didn't rush to see this one because I didn't care much about the first Conjuring. It is lost somewhere in my memory between Insidious and some other movie I forgot about. The design of the Anabelle doll bothered me to begin with.Anyway, I finally watched The Conjuring 2, driven by favorable critics and word of mouth, and I am really glad I did.Of course it's a James Wan ghost movie, so they throw everything in but the kitchen sink, although I think the kitchen sink got thrown out at some point, but I loved every part of the ride.The Warren couple works in this one. There is real chemistry. The kids are all great. A kid in a horror movie is usually a low point, useful to generate compassion but also to make the rest of the cast look good, but there you have three of them, who seem to effortlessly deliver, well, anything. They performed so well I almost didn't notice.The efficient reenactment of the 70's period is a real pleasure, but the movie doesn't just rely on the tricks (and bells, and whistles) of that proficient era. I really think they tried to sponge out ideas and mood from recent horror greats. I felt some Babadook in there. And a hint of It Follows maybe.Clearly the creative department (because there is plenty of creativity nonetheless) tried hard on this, which is great, because they didn't have to. They would have made their money anyway.Thank you Mr Wan. Very hard.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""Me, won't me"" ..... ""Help, it let go"" .... what's the ghost telling us?","Conjuring 2 is the sequel to the above average horror movie conjuring 1 which I liked for it's lack of unneccessary forced horror and instead the characters wouldn't act incredibly dumb and it doesn't even seem so unrealistic with the religious theme.I gave conjuring1 6/10 for it's great take at the horror genre which is very hard to do right because the few people that actually watch it have very different interests.But a movie that has an R rating without much violence, blood, sex/nudity, or death must be somewhat thrilling.
But to me conjuring 1 wasn't really scary and it felt a bit long for the little that happened.Conjuring 2 takes the concept of conjuring 1 (first family being haunted then ghost hunters coming and fighting it) and makes a story about a more powerful entity that is actually dangerous to our exorcist / ghost hunter coupleBut we receive new concepts as well, being the big view on proving the supernatural and giving our entity more of a personality.Conjuring 2 is a lot scarier than conjuring 1 (I always watch these movies alone in bed at night so if they don't scare they aren't scary).
and the new demon Valak's design is the most terrifying I've seen in horror movies so far except the thing.Also the acting in general but especially of the child is phenomenal.Conjuring 2 also doesn't force our characters to make some bs decisions so the plot can continue like in the nun and even the movie the nun was spared with too much idiocy.Forwarding to the style, the scenes filmed in ego perspective were absolutely thrilling as well as the few but very effective jump scares.In conclusion I recommand this movie to anyone interested in horror to get scared or fans of the genre that all have aready seen it.I'm definitely gonna see conjuring 3 if they next one improves upon this movie it could be the first horror movie ever to get 8/10 by me.

"Does nothing new but it does what it does very, very well","Honestly, I was not planning on seeing this film. You know, another haunted house film? What can they do that hasn't been done a 1000 times before right? Well, enter James Wan: he makes a flick for some 10's of millions (40 here) and it makes hundreds at the box office (320 to be exact). Why is that? Coz they work, that's why! So I saw it because it got good reviews but even then I was full of suspicion. But yeah, like I said before: it works. Not because it really does something new -it doesn't- but because it does what it does very well. The movie feels fresh and entertaining and never bores despite its 2 hour running time. But if you're sick of haunted house films and never want to see one again I won't blame ya, but if you do want to see one again then see this one alright :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring 2 Review,"This is by far the best film in the Conjuring Universe so far. It's suspenseful and creepy. Let me get some negatives out of the way. There were some shaky cam moments in the beginning of the film that made no sense story wise. 2 of the 4 child actors weren't that good but what do you expect from child actors. The night scenes in the house in the first half of the film were too dark just like the original Conjuring movie but James Wan fixes this halfway through the movie. Now let's get onto the positives. The main cast and most of the supporting cast did an outstanding job in their respective roles within the film. Ed and Lorraine Warren were given better story arcs than the first film. The cinematography was great throughout the film and had some really nice tracking shots that weren't too long and weren't too short. The tone remained consistent throughout the film and the plot was pretty good. I understood what was going on throughout the entire film. The demons in this movie are flat out creepy. The Nun got me every time it was on screen and the Crooked Man's design was great. I swear they used stop motion animation for the Crooked Man. If they did, then they blended his character really well with the live action scenes. The scenes with both those demons added suspense and terror to an already terrifying film. Overall, The Conjuring 2 improves from most of the mistakes from the original film while adding better cinematography, a better supporting cast, and scarier demons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The story is true. The movie is not,"Of course, the title I mentioned in the review doesn't mean the movie is bad. The entertainment of a horror movie is still there, JW's skills are still fully demonstrated. I just feel like it's a bit of a waste of source material, especially compared to part 1, where everything was worth noting as a perfect adaptation of a true horror story. The Amityville Horror at the beginning is of a higher quality than the main story, and it has little to do with the UK story. Valak's ""move"" from US to UK is not yet convincing. JW's horror tricks are still there, but equally important is that the authenticity of the story, also known as the beginning of paranormal stories, is not good. Everything is quite rushed and we immediately see scare scenes, sometimes these scenes are overused and unnecessary. There were even a few weird scenes that made me feel a bit funny instead of focusing on the fear. However, we should give praise to Madison Wolfe, at that age, there were actually a few scenes that depended entirely on her acting instead of CGI or special effects, and those were not easy scenes. Besides, the ending scene is effective in bringing drama, intensity and human messages, especially the main villain is quite interesting, even though it doesn't appear much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An actually good horror sequel.,"Not better than the first, but just as good as the first. I really enjoyed it.Pros:
Creepy as all bloody hell.Scary as well.Good acting.Special Effects are very well done.Good story.Effective jump scares.Good ending.Etc...:Cons:
Some might find it excessive. Though I don't find it too excessive.Conclusion:
This was potentially one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. No, not scarier than the woman in black, but it's up there. Especially since it is based on real life. It is entertaining, tense, and terrifying. Enjoy!!!!!Extra characters: 28

James Wan surprisingly avoids sophomore slump on 'Conjuring 2',"There are few horror films that have exceeded expectations in the past 20 years. In fact, you can probably count them on two hands. Most people would put 2013's simple-yet-striking spookfest 'The Conjuring' in this list, so it's hard to imagine any follow-up effort coming close to it in terms of quality.Director James Wan clearly realized how important it was to live up to expectations, so he brought his A-game on 2016's 'The Conjuring 2,' which follows world-famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine as they investigate a media circus of a case of a haunted house in Enfield, England. While there's much criticism about the veracity of the story, and the level to which the Warrens were involved in the case, this doesn't change the quality of the film.In 'Conjuring,' we once again get to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (both of whom are modern-day scream kings/queens by this point) reprise their roles, and while there are a few other key actors who are key here, particularly Madison Wolfe as the young Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as her mother, Peggy), it's really the ""Patrick and Vera show"" once again. They both deliver strong performances and are the best part about the film. That said, as you would expect, the thrills and chills sent up audiences' spines are also key, and somehow the ones dished out in this film are on the same level as those in its predecessor. Sure, there are a lot of commonly used techniques like shaky cam, quick transitions, etc., but they are done so well here and do not feel cheap at all.Additionally, the soundtrack and sound effects really bring 'Conjuring' to life, as any haunted house movie would rely on. But the main reason this film lives up to expectations is because it has a strong script. From some lighter moments to many tense ones where there are life-and-death situations, it really is all in the script and the screenplay.'The Conjuring 2' proves that breakout horror films are not always a fluke - it's possible to build a successful franchise that resonates with audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So good!,"One of the best sequels to a horror movie. I think that The Conjuring 2 rises to the level of the first, I would even say that it is better. Ed and Lorraine Warren are superbly portrayed again and the actors do a wonderful job. The story is once again just as good and captivating, but this time we also have some small surprises at the end that I appreciated. They also introduce new characters to The Conjuring universe that we will most likely see in other spin-offs. Each scene builds the tension, they are well thought out and not all are based on jumpscares and even if they are, they are done properly. Many memorable moments that are increasingly rare these days, a film that is a must see for fans of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Conjuring review #3 (read my others),"Wow. After watching conjuring my hopes were extremely satisfied, then Annabelle happened and I was very disappointed... but then I saw in my list of conjuringverse movies that there was a conjuring 2, so decided to give it a watch. And I must say. It's very thrilling and insane, in ways I would argue it's even better than the first. James Wan returns to give us what this conjuringverse needs, especially after the disappointment film that came before it. I can't believe what James Wan did here. It's truly yet another remarkable film to be looked at. I've been watching all these conjuring movies in one viewing. And all at the same day lol, I can't believe how good this was.

A Hauntingly Brilliant Sequel That Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine,"""The Conjuring 2"" is a chilling and masterfully crafted horror film that not only lives up to the reputation of its predecessor but also delivers a spine-tingling experience that will leave audiences sleepless for nights. Directed by James Wan, this sequel continues the supernatural adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, played brilliantly by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga.What sets ""The Conjuring 2"" apart is its ability to build tension and suspense. Wan's masterful direction keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, skillfully utilizing eerie sound design, clever camera angles, and perfectly timed jump scares. The slow-burn approach allows the fear to steadily escalate, creating an unnerving atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Jumpy Horror,"Like the first one, Conjuring 2 is a good jumpy horror movie, it ticks all the boxes that anyone who likes this type of movie is looking for, sometimes this almost seems too formulaic as it goes through every cliché and you'll find yourself knowing whats about to happen next because you've seen similar movies, but then at times it uses this to misdirect you and the 'jump' comes from unexpected places.One thing I do find a little strange is how this and the first movie, Wan portray the Warrens as some sort of heros, in what was a blatant real life hoax and the warrens were either too stupid to see or were in on it.But in todays horror movie world where most movies are terrible and / or rely on gore to attract viewers, this is good back to basics stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wholesome Christian fun,"A ghostbusting couple decides to give it a rest after a demon comes too close, but are drawn irresistibly across the Atlantic by the cries for help from an English family haunted by the spirit of an old man, where things get even closer.Hectic story that rolls out all the tricks to reasonable effect. While Wan does put bums on seats, he's considered a bit safe and does the expected here. But there is some edge to this standard story of puberty possession, with violent entities piercing through the shadows with demonic intent. Early on the scares come through sound jumps, but the visual weirdness takes over and delivers some good stuff.The acting is good, particularly the wife. There is one afterthought scene before the third act, which starts with a false line about taking the music away and develops into a decent tribute to Elvis while failing to deliver any horror effect. That's probably the biggest blip in the pacing of a story that doesn't have enough psychological strength or coherent demon myth to outrun 100 mins.The Christian angle would be nauseating, except there's no sincerity and it fizzles out with maudlin reassurance for the teen audience.The English accents are from drama school, although there is a fair attempt at setting the contemporary scene from 1977 - not sure Maggie called herself the Iron Lady until two years later.Sound design early on was interesting, but after that it's mostly Scorsese-style dropping in of popular old tunes that sets the tone.Overall, more robust from Wan but still safe as houses.

The Conjuring of More Childish Horror,"The Conjuring 2 is the best example of what's wrong with modern horror. It's formulaic, predictable, uninventive, and only scary if you're a child that is afraid of loud noises and ghost stories. The fact that the Warrens have been proven to be frauds who were attention seekers doesn't help.Rarely have I seen a movie this bland, dragging and unimaginative. The writing left me blase at best, furious at how childish it is at worst. The cinematography is so boring and basic, even TV cooking shows look like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison. After watching the first Conjuring I thought they might do it better this time, but it just keeps getting worse. James Wan is definitely a hack.If you want a really scary movie about evil entities, watch the Spanish masterpiece Aterrados.

Conjured 2,"Decent story, well acted but what really impresses me about this movie is the way it works against expectations. It knows when the jump scares normally come and doesn't give them then.

Problem is... It still feels unfocused to me. Why can these movies not just focus on one thing?

James Wan has not taken the recognition of his last work for granted. With this Conjuring he has gone to experiment with his core film making and he's successful in all ways. Actors are all brilliant. Vera Farmiga is a beautiful artist who lives the character of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson, this time is at his best and he totally nails the character of Ed. Young Madison Wolfe is a talent to look out for. She's vulnerable and worth-getting-scared-of at the same time. Overall the movie is worth the hype.

Solid if overall rather decent haunting effort,"Attempting to move on in their careers, the famous couple is brought to a case in England involving a single mother who believes that her home is possessed only to find that it's targeted their teenage daughter and must try to stop the demonic entity from haunting them.Overall this one wasn't all that bad of a sequel effort. When this one works, it's due to the usual round of high-intensity supernatural action set-pieces that are quite prominent in this style. Those early hauntings, from the first instances of the demonic happenings in the bedroom where it appears out of the shadows of their toys to scare him or the later scene of it throwing the bookshelf against the door in front of everyone, are genuinely creepy moments that work rather well here, and along with the special series of stalking scenes later on that really makes a much more prominent atmosphere that lets the scares come rather nicely. The scenes of the possessed daughter throwing around the furniture in the house, appearing as the demonic spirits to torment the family or the different sessions attempting to exorcise the spirit in front of the different sets of experts that are there to help them all give this one some rather intense and chilling encounters. Other big scenes, from the spirits' attack in the bedroom where it traps her in the locked room and begins wrapping her in the sheets as well as the big showcase freak-out in front of the research team where it appears to be all faked for their perspective that leads into the utterly thrilling finale as they finally attempt to wrest her from its control makes it all quite fun as there's a lot of chilling suspense in the ghostly figures appearing around the house, the action of needing to rescue her up in the bedroom and the attempt to confront the demon once and for all ends this one with a ton of fun and a great overall feel. Given that this one keeps the interest up once it gets to these scenes featuring plenty of continuous action to keep it going, there's plenty to like here even with a few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the rather cliché and unimpressive ghostly attacks which are found in the first half which is mainly a part of the demon nun attacking her in their house as these are typical and expected scares. Playing with shadows, close- ups of roaring demonic faces out of nowhere and intense scenes that prove to be dream sequences all show up throughout here, and they all drop off rather quickly than the films' later demonic scares. They're a part of the film's other problem in the exaggerated length that really didn't need to be, as the first half here is way too long in getting them over to the house so it feels a little lopsided in terms of action here. These do hold it back although it's not enough to really be a detriment.Rated R: Violence, Language, children-in-jeopardy and underage smoking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Crooked Man always did seem like a creepy nursery rhyme...,"James Wan, perhaps the premiere modern horror director (""Saw,"" ""Insidious""), makes graphically regal films that often exceed the genre's visual conventions. His popular ""Conjuring"" films give him the opportunity to show that skill. With gorgeous period-piece settings, the general warmness to the coloring works as a nice counterpoint to the scares. While this newest entry doesn't quite sidestep all of the clichés in modern horror (giggling children, creepy toys, red herring scares), it does askew some. The just-brainy-enough storytelling mixed with the super strong direction make it a distinctly solid studio horror trip. Based on ""true events,"" we find paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren traveling to the UK to study a peculiar and sinister haunting of a young, single-parent family. Along the way, some plot conveniences and illogical creature rules haunt the proceedings. Luckily, these are overshadowed by some fantastically creepy monster designs, including a boldly sadistic nun-figure and a terrifying rendition of the ""Crooked Man"" nursery rhyme, all underscored by effectively cool music and sound design. By now, Wan has proved he knows what he's doing in the scare department. However, some surprisingly adept humor cuts through the horrific drama, allowing the themes of family and dangerous commitment to shine through. But what really makes the whole thing work are the people. In spite of the few plotting flaws, in the center of the story are characters you wanna root for. They are funny, loving, sympathetic and real; they are human-feeling people who make human-feeling decisions. With this beautiful control over tone and character, Wan feels only a step away from making a true masterpiece. Until then, this will more than do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Amazing Horror!!!,"I went into the cinema with low expectations because i saw so many things about how good the conjuring 2 is. I thought that I would be disappointed but I was very wrong. The conjuring 2 is fast paced and well written. The story doesn't just focus on the horror but it also focuses a lot on the characters. There are some character building scenes but none of them waste time. They are all very meaningful. I felt much more connected to this family than the last one. You sympathize a lot with these characters. Everyone is trying to fight their own battles and overcome their obstacles.The horror is very scary. James Wan managed to make a very terrifying atmosphere. He knows how to build up suspense and he knows how to use jump scares. There were quite a few jump scares in this film but none of them were false.Some were very predictable but most of them caught me off guard. What made this really scary is the fact that it was in a normal house . It wasn't in some big American house with eight bedrooms and three floors.It was in an average British council house.The acting was very good and everyone did a great job. I felt glued to the screen and felt engaged with the story. The cinematography and lightning was very good. The camera work was absolutely amazing.The only reason why I'm giving it 9/10 is because I felt that the last 10 minutes was way too much. It was very extreme and messy. I didn't really feel engaged. However, many people felt that the ending was good and well written so I'm not going to say that the ending was a bad thing. It was just a bit too much for me.But overall this was a very good movie and if you're looking for something to creep you out and make you feel scared then watch the Conjuring 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mary poppins accents,"For some reason, the producers decided that it would be OK to use American actors to play British people, instead of just using British people.It also appears that the American cast were coached on how to speak with a North London accent by watching mary poppins. The accents are so bad that I cant watch it without cringing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wan's Sequel Ups the Scare Factor,"James Wan is a mastermind when it comes to building suspense, and creating dreadful atmospheres in his movies, which is exactly what he does here in the Conjuring 2. The story was engrossing while simultaneously being unpredictable. The acting performances were terrific all around, with Madison Wolfe giving a great performance as the main target of the powerful demon. This is easily one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen, without losing anything in terms of having a touching and complex story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great use of sound.What makes horror films so good is the experimental use of the camera and sound.

How James Wan is Rewriting the Book of Horror,"Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit.The brilliantly terrifying The Conjuring is the second highest grossing horror movie of all time. The first being: The Exorcist. This film was genuinely the best horror film I had ever seen in a long time and James Wan is in my point of view, the best director working in horror today; so I was really excited to see this second instalment. This movie makes a perfect follow-up to the original Conjuring's lesser known case. Plus, the movie starts with a certain Amityville House. Yes, THAT Amityville. Here, the Enfield Case is probably one of the best documented, most studied and most contested hauntings in existence and in British history. The real recordings of paranormal investigator Ed Warren interviewing the entity through Janet live at the end of The Conjuring 2 and it's difficult not to let chills run down your spine. Nonetheless, director James Wan offers its potential fans a helping of reinsurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghosts and demons out there, then God must be out there as well. James Wan, who directed Saw and Insidious, is a horror filmmaker of such skills that even when he makes a by-the-book haunted-house story, it's easy to feel a hint of admiration for his talent beneath your tingling spine.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson couple really ground the film in realism as their backstory and relationship are really touching and heartfelt. Being more than a horror movie, it's about marriage and being with somebody that understands you. The realistic family story grounds the film and makes it better than your average horror film.Horror lives in the unknown. It hides in abandoned asylums, in catacombs, in cabins and haunted manors. These are safe places to die. You don't want to die? Maybe don't do an Ouija Board, stay home and watch Netflix instead. Nothing can find you there. Except James Wan. Wan is a modern horror maestro who brings the fear home to you. All these events take place in the very real world, occupied by everyday people trying to get on with their life. We've all been children hiding under the duvet from whatever hid under our bed in the dark. Even now, home alone on a rainy day, we've sat on our couch and wondered what creaked the floorboards in the seemingly empty room next to us. Wan's fear construction is effortless, his best moments lie in the silence between scares.He also has a sense of the audience: of their rhythm and pulse, of how to manipulate a moment so that he's practically controlling your breathing. He became a master of THE face. He must have a card in his office reading:""All you need to make a hit horror film is one truly awful face!"". THAT face. The face that's staring through the window. Staring through the dark. The face that's coming to get you eventually. James Wan again proves with this film that he knows how to use a jump scare. Those are meant to get you. This man knows how to built tension until it feels insurmountable. He's also a wizard of timing, i-e he toys with us by throwing so routinely unsettling images at us, like, let's say a toy firetruck that starts to move ion its own. Then, letting that omen menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause, stopping dead in its tracks. It's right there, in the middle of that storm of quiet, that our anxiety starts to rush in. Finally, it's truly the craft, performances and the writing that make this film a billion years ahead of all films of its kind, out right now. This film is really good. It's scary, suspenseful, the tension is real and a lot of that is due to a brilliant cinematography.Overall, James Wan knows his craft. And all he has to do to bring you true horror is take you home, where you think you're safe from harm. Sweet, sweet dreams.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
boring plot,"A terrible chaotic plot with a lousy narrative. The single scenes do not fit together in a satisfying way. The final showdown was exceptional unsatisfying. The defeat of the demon with some sort of guessing spell worked out - it seem, just to get the movie finished. The final picture with people hanging around on the street - we have seen this already in hundred movies. I wonder, whether horror plots are coming to an end. It seems, that people are afraid of only the same demons all the time. Nothing new on the planet to be afraid of? Or are the writers of the plots themselves too afraid to bother with today's fears of normal people? It is not the demons, it is sickness, age, religion, weapons, missed education ... time to mix that together to horror.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And for sure because the movie based on the real story, it made the movie more 'live' and made me feel more scared. before this, the conjuring 1 was my favorite horror movie but seriously The second sequel is much better! Thank you for everyone who gave their best work on it especially for the actors who played as ed & lorraine warren and also janet *forgot their real name* their actions were just incredible! their actions were also supported by very scary and awesome horror effects that following the movie from the beginning till the end and I love the way the editor made the credit by showing the comparison of the real pictures with the movie pictures.I think 10 stars doesn't enough for this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Ridiculous, and terrible.","This movie is ridiculous, and terrible and that's besides the unbearable accents.It's a ""based on true events"" movie, and the ""true events"" are the most ridiculous claims of paranormal behavior ever... OK, maybe not ""ever""... but close. The photos of levitation are clearly a child jumping on her bed, and the ""male voice""... well you gotta look at the difference between this movie, and the original documentary / interview recording on YouTube.Anyway, the ""event"" aside... this HAS got some (very few) really good scary events of it's own, well done, but it's just a terribly cheesy, poorly acted, ridiculously exaggerated movie. I don't know why Farmiga accepted the role, Dempsey is perfect for it, because he's a B- lister, and pretty good at being a terrible actor... kind of like Wahlberg.I didn't like the first, or the second, but I'd watch a third out of interest.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Better, scarier and more engaging than the original. The best horror movie of the decade","I have been a huge fan of James Wan ever since Dead silence. I didn't like saw franchise though. I am not a huge fan of Insidious series either because Insidious 2 and 3 disappointed me big time.I have liked The Conjuring it was like a breath of a fresh air for Horror genre. So i had decided to watch the Conjuring 2 not just because of its name but for the director James Wan.As we all know that form is temporary but class is permanent and James Wan has proved yet again that he is a class.To create a masterpiece horror movie like The Conjuring 2 that too after making a action movie like fast and furious 7 shows your class.The story revolves around Lorraine and Ed Warren who travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirit of Bill Willkins who died in a chair due to brain haemorrhage. Lorraine has her own fear and premonition of a demonic nun who threatened to kill her husband Ed in real life.Can she stop her from killing Ed? this is what The conjuring 2 is all about. Truly speaking The Conjuring 2 is scary as hell. There is hardly any movie that made me jump over the seats. The Conjuring 2 has succeeded in doing this.Now a days when we see any trailer of a horror movie 90 percent of the scary scenes of the movie are being revealed in it but James wan is a very clever customer he kept 90% of the scary scenes in the shelves which has not been revealed in any of its trailer you can only see it in the movie.Two scenes that made me jump over the seats were when Lorraine decides to check in the painting room and a demonic nun comes out from nowhere from the painting and a scene when Janet watches TV and figure out a person sitting on a chair behind her and the remote control falls by itself.Those two scenes are the scariest scenes Hollywood has ever witnessed.The conjuring 2 is a sequel that is better and scarier than the original.The Conjuring 2 is engaging and scary from start to finish,The movie and demonic nun creature will be remembered for a long long time.I loved everything about this movie. Being a horror buff you can't afford to miss this flick at any cost.Now I am eagerly waiting for The Conjuring 3.Kudos to James wan for making The Conjuring 2 and creating a creature like demonic Nun. A cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The way horror sequels should be made! Just as good as the original!,"If you liked the first one, this one does a good job at hitting the scare meter heights as its predecessor did. Some scenes are pretty full on. James Wann has once again done a great job at creating a lot of tense scenes, specially through the use of some pretty good camera work. Although it's a bit long for a horror film, which is my main criticism...it still manages to keep the audience on edge right till the end. As we left the cinema, judging by the audience's reaction, it will be a movie that will be received by horror fans. Might not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the horror genre, and considering the it is a genre that is slowly dying unfortunately...The Conjuring 2 definitely stands up high (with the original) above the rest. 4/5 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
AWESOME!!!!!,This movie was AWESOME!!! I'm a big horror movie fan and it's so rare to find a great one now a days. This movie scared the poop out of me the first time I watched it and I've watched it about five times in two years.

Don't believe the hype it wasn't very good at all.,"I'll give it a 5 because don't take me wrong, I have DEFINITELY seen much worse lol. But I was super disappointed in this sequel. It felt soooo long I couldn't wait for it to be over. It failed at creating any real feelings of suspense. I wasn't scared or even interested in the plot because every single time something ""scary"" happened, it stopped before anything ACTUALLY happened and cut to the next scene. Like nice family moment, then predictable jump scare, then right back to nice family moment. Ugh!! Predictable and cliché scares. And the Elvis part was awful! I also thought Lorraine was actually annoying and overacting this time too.. Which is a first because I love her as Norma Bates. :) Just wait for it to be in Redbox for a dollar.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Cor, blimey guvner, a sequel worth your sixpence piece!","I remember being pretty disappointed when The Conjuring first came out. The Internet was building it up to be one of the scariest films ever made and I was getting really excited to be properly scared. I don't usually get scared in films, but James Wan's very own Insidious did manage to conjure up (pardon the pun) some genuinely terrifying imagery so I had every right to expect the same from The Conjuring but the film didn't scare me at all. It wasn't until I re-watched it recently that I realised that whilst it isn't a scary film to me, I can appreciate it for being a very well-made horror film.So when The Conjuring 2 reviews came out and were citing similar hype, I tried to put aside the claims of it being even better than the first film and went in with an open mind, almost expecting it to be a disappointment, but it wasn't. The Conjuring 2 is one of those very rare sequels (even rarer in the horror genre) which manages to better the first. It still has its problems and I still don't think it's scary or that it outdoes Insidious, but it is a fine example of haunted house horror which can stand proudly on its own.You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's simply more of the same when the film starts as it's almost identical to the first film. A seemingly unrelated case opens the film and the title flashes up on the screen along with some jargon about the film being true and this case is yet again the scariest The Warrens' have ever encountered blah blah blah. It's basic scare tactics that might work for horror virgins but us aficionados will just be rolling our eyes. To be fair, the opening scene is actually very well directed and gives you some idea of the film's overall quality.We're soon plunged into 1970's England and we're given constant reminders of this which is something that irritated me. Maybe it's because I'm English myself but the stereotypes were often quite overwhelming, although amusing. Every car in the driveway is a Mini Cooper, The Queen often pops up on the telly and everyone has a seriously strong cockney accent. I know that it's set in London but even so it sounds like most of the actors have moulded their accents on Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I also found Frances O Connor a little wooden and unconvincing at times as well as a few of the kids.Overall the acting is terrific though. I was particularly impressed with Madison Wolfe as Margaret, the main girl, who gave off Linda Blair vibes at times. The role asks a lot of such a young actress but she tackles it head on and it's pretty extraordinary to watch. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are also as excellent as ever as our favourite paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. I really liked how the film focused so much on their relationship so that it became the emotional core of the film. Similarly, Wan takes his time to carefully build the characters in England so that we become invested in them and actually care about what's going to happen to them. It's such a rarity these days to find a horror film with characters you feel involved with and this is the main aspect which makes The Conjuring 2 so strong and compelling.The other great thing about the film is its atmosphere. James Wan clearly has a deep love for the horror genre and The Conjuring 2 is a labour of this love. The whole film is deliciously Gothic and over-the-top, it's a horror fan's dream come true. There are a lot of spooky scenes crammed into the film and whilst they didn't particularly scare me, you can't help but appreciate the stylishness and effectiveness of them. James Wan really is a master behind the camera and knows how to create genuine tension. Like the first film, a lot of scenes are filmed skilfully in one fluid take and it often becomes very intense, especially combined with the striking loud score and sound design.Even the typical horror clichés like possession and creaky doors are done in such an effective way that you don't care that you've seen it a hundred times before. With a running time of over two hours, I was still left feeling eager for more. The Conjuring 2 creates a gorgeous world of horror and allows you to sink within it. It will leave horror fans consistently grinning from ear to ear. The demon/ghost designs in this one are also much more creative than the first film. The nun character (played by the same lady who acted as the iconic bum in Mulholland Dr) was memorably creepy and a bizarre character known as the crooked man is weirdly delightful, although some might find him a jarringly out of place.If you're a fan of the horror genre then I can't really see any reason for disliking The Conjuring 2, and if you're not a horror fan then what are you bloody doing watching a horror film? Recent films like The Witch, It Follows and The Babadook may be better but that doesn't make The Conjuring 2 obsolete. It's a beautifully crafted piece of supernatural horror which delivers atmosphere and suspense in spades. Some of it does feel a little contrived towards the end but the finale's so excitingly pulse-pounding and intense that you're unlikely to care. It makes sure that the audience actually care about the people on screen so it's never dull for one moment. A third film will definitely be on the cards and if it carries on being as solid as this one then we might be looking at the best supernatural horror franchise since...

Marginally better than the predecessor but really good and presents some real good quality horror.,"Sequels often carry a burden of expectations/benchmark set by their earlier movies. The Conjuring was executed amazingly well even with the standard scary stuff and The Conjuring 2 stuck to the story flow approach of its predecessor but yet bringing in the novelty in terms of brand new location and a sub-plot. This franchisee is definitely beating Insidious hands down.Story (8/10): Based on a real life incident in late 70s - a family of single- mother and four kids in North London is terrorized to hell by a supposed ghost, often possessing one of the daughters. Warrens are called all the way from US to take a look at that and report back to the church. Their search encounters series of events that eventually discover the genesis of the Hodgson family's nightmare. The climax is particularly well written with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seats.Horror (6/10): I found the horror element comparatively less in this one compared to The Conjuring. Partly also because some of the scenes were too predictive as we not just seen them in the first movie but other horror movies as well. However, it doesn't seem to be a mistake as much as it seems a deliberate attempt to stick to what worked in the first part and focus more on the story telling. It is the same dilemma that super hero movies face - whether they want to focus on out-of-the-world action sequences or focus on a compelling story.Acting (9/10): Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have given stellar performances here. Particularly, Patrick has made himself more noticeable in this one. Frances O'Connor (as the single mother) and Madison Wolfe (her daughter) had the most challenging roles which they executed very well. The expressions of agony, fear, anger, disgust have been nailed to perfection and is particularly remarkable.Direction (8/10): James Wan has stuck pretty much to what worked in the first movie. The direction is good overall. The scenes have been conceptualized well. Especially, the climax has been directed extremely well with some unpredictable sequences. The movie could have been a bit shorter as the first half of the movie is a bit of a drag.Overall (8/10): The Conjuring 2 did just marginally well compared to its predecessor. However, it would be a bit unfair to keep comparing it with the first part. Independently, the movie is really good and presents some real good quality horror.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just as scary as the first one!,"James Wan knows the formula for making a great horror film. He knew what to do with the first one and he knew what to do with this one. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return in the same roles as Lorraine and Ed Warren.

Better than any other horror film so far!,"Its not only a movie that scares us, it also didn't fail to gave us a good story, an excellent plot to demonstrate what really happened to the most documented supernatural case, which was the haunting of the Hodgson family back in 1977. Nothing in this film bored me, and the ambiancé was really scary. The jump-scares were new and a lot of scenes were really unusual to happen in a horror film. The actors did a very great job, they really fit in to their roles. Im glad that the sequel of the conjuring exceeded the quality of its predecessor, and it also exceeded my expectation though my expectation was already high. The trailers released were excellent for not showing the entire story, they just shown enough to promote the film. It is my first time actually to have a ghost-movie to my favorite list, I am really a fan of horror movies, and I usually liked a killer/zombie-movie, but this film really killed it, IT IS THE SCARIEST MOVIE SO FAR! looking forward to the conjuring 3 already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The real sequel,"After the mediocre (if you're being nice) Annabelle, which was a prequel, we do get the real treat. While there still will be an Annabelle 2 (? No seriously -> ?), a movie I probably could do without, this sequel is something that touches upon the themes of the original and with the same cast actually delivers on its promise.Apparently the filmmakers take real life incidents (things that actually happened to some degree) and build a movie around it. And it does work, because you do have a stellar pair who really have a great chemistry. It's not bloody horror, but it is horror that is able to have you at the edge of your seat",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stop reviewing this movie because you're angry that it WAS a true story.,"I find it funny that people are attacking this movie because they don't want to accept that this was based on true events coraborated by many eye witnesses. Why?...are you upset that there could REALLY could be a God or supernatural forces that are good and/or evil?
Anyhow, the real point here is, this is supposed to be a movie review site, not a critique on the motives of the movie maker. Stop trying to lash out because you are angry over the fact that you think the producers of a movie had some sort of agenda about forcing religious beliefs on the audience. Whether this is true or not shouldn't have anything to do with it. Rate the movie based on the things that a movie should be reviewed on...acting, plot, score, special effects, etc.
As far as that goes, the movie delivers. It will scare the crap out of ya, for starters, therefore, it does what a scary movie is supposed to do. The acting is good. It won't win any Oscars, but it's good. The story is good even if it wasn't a true story, so relax. My only warning here is, don't let any young children watch this or they'll be sleeping in bed with you for years...yeah, it's that scary.

"Eerie, and still strong with the utter intensity!","The long awaited sequel ( At least for me ) has finally come as we're presented with a sequel for one of the bigger, more effect modern horrors over the years, The Conjuring 2.This movie is an overall headstrong sequel I'd say, unlike other sequels this one keeps its intensity, and overall chills cranked up through the roof, just like the first one. The atmosphere in this movie is eerie, and overly bone chilling. You get shots of which are so dark, along with the soundtrack being so quiet to where us, the audience are sitting in complete and utter unsettlement as we are set within such a white-knuckle tension zone over most of the movie. The film sets an amazing tone for creepiness, keeping the movie mostly dark-like, and eerie, of which deeply succeeds when it comes to the breakdown of the demon / ghost appearances. The overall soundtrack of the film, as well when it comes down to such actions also adds onto the overall film effect that it has going for it. Overall the film is like the first one when it comes to succeeding complete, and utter creepiness, and overall eye candy tension. Something some horror films try, but miss the mark on, leading to this factor being as the first film, a pleasant surprise. For the acting in this film, again, of which you'll hear be said a lot in this review; Like the first film, the acting was well played out. The kids in this film did a quite believable with portraying their emotions, mostly for this film either serious, scared, or upset. This movie also does a flawless job for making the audience feel for this family. The audience overall watches as this family goes through the struggle of getting people to overall believe they're truly being haunted, and overall provoked. At the same time they're battling a war between them, the truth, and the media. So overall the film does an amazing job for having us, the audience truly feel emotion for this family, and only want the absolute best for them in the end. Ed, and Lorraine from the first film, as well have some new, and unique character unleashes in this sequel as well. They both have a somewhat deeper side to them shown in this film, their true care for what they do, and their overall emphasis, and even love for each other are perfectly shown, and executed without being TOO much in depth to it. We also see some new, pretty exciting - like characters enter the sequel as well, overall great actors, and amazing twist of deep, inner-character ties along with it all as well, coming out as flawless, and another outstanding surprise! Now for the good stuff. The demons / demon in this film is absolutely creepy. This film did an amazing job with it I would say all the way. The film throws the demon in hidden places throughout camera shots, making it insanely creepy for those who spot it. And when blatantly seen, even then this demon comes off as truly frightening, and just flat out creepy. And yet another succeeding, and outstanding tie-in this film brought to the table was the fact that demon actually came within different forms. Something to understand, along with everything else here, you'd have to see the movie to figure out.Overall. This sequel was one hell of a watch. You have great story, well executed actors, creepy, unsettling, and flat out eerie tone, and atmosphere, whether it be the soundtrack, happenings in the film itself, or the demon appearances itself, the film overall comes off in the sense of it all being nightmarish. This was an outstanding sequel, and definitely didn't miss the mark. If you enjoyed the first film, your expectations shall not be disappointed in the Conjuring 2. See it all to believe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the few better horror movies out there.,"Sequels usually breaks down a movie franchise. It's easy to see examples of terrible sequels especially in the years of previous films. And horror movies are no exception, making an impressive horror movie is hard enough. But making a sequel to it is almost committing movie suicide. The Conjuring was good and a lot of people really seemed they enjoyed it. However The Conjuring 2 was spectacular, not only did it had impressive cinematography that captures the absolute tone of a dark and an evil atmosphere. But also it had great camera works and angles that shows both disturbing background and close up images and visuals. The plot in this horror movie is nearly as the same as its predecessor. Haunted house that haunts a family, Warrens comes in to save the day. The movie does have its fair share of clichés here and there however the way that this movie was executed really gave its terror. We get to see a lot of character development in this film, adding in more layers of characterization to both previous and new characters. You get to see the relationship between Ed and Loraine Warren grow as people get doubts about their profession. The family that's being oppressed (The Hodgsons) gets a good backstory and the film does a good job of showing that backstory to the audience. This film also focuses on the public eye and skepticism as well. There were claims that the actual haunting of Enfield was just a hoax in order to have a public attention and director James Wan decided to use this element to drive his movie forward. Showing the realistic reactions how the public would react. The build up and the tension pacing was just right for the film as some scenes had unpredictable jump scares. The movie does another great job of cutting off Loraine's ability of clairvoyance as it was quite helpful in the previous movie. In this movie, she is much more vulnerable to the demonic presence in the house. Exposition and the history of the haunted house really gives you the chills and it adds on to the already high staked tone of the movie. The acting was quite phenomenal, the Hodgson does an amazing job being terrified and scared. The main child actress really steals the show as she delivers an amazing performance of being both possessed and un-possessed. It's truly incredible to see her deal with this possession while being a kid. Since you'd probably get more emotion of a kid being possessed rather than an adult. The soundtrack in this film is the same as the first movie, no soundtrack seems out of place and is given at necessary points in the film, while also using it sparingly throughout the film.Final Verdict: I will give this movie an 8.0/10 This movie was an upgraded version of The Conjuring. With such skill in the horror genre James Wan delivers one of the chilling horror film of all time. I recommend this movie to anyone. A definitely a ""must see film"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile....""","James Wan is the best horror director working today. The man knows the genre so well that he can easily manipulate the atmosphere to terrorize the viewer. Such a masterful sense of control that he can easily control your fear. With this sequel, Wan has created 3 very successful and engaging horror series.Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to England to investigate whether or not the Enfield family are plagued by deadly spirits or if the family is lying and the whole thing is a hoax. We as the viewer know the truth, we are with this family when the strange occurrences start happening. Yet Wan cleverly depicts such things in a shroud of mystery when the Warren's arrive to make them question if what is happening is real or not. Should they leave thinking it's fake, the terror we feel for the family will be even greater.I believe The Conjuring to be one of the best horror films of the last decade and it's a hard act to follow. Wan tries to up the ante here with the sequel, the scares are more frequent, the demons/ghosts more creepy and the tension is tighter. I still believe the original to be slightly better because it was fresh and the atmosphere was simply brilliant, but Wan does marvellous things with the sequel.Look to any other horror film and the artistic merit fails by comparison. Wan doesn't need blood and guts or even cheap jump scares to make the viewer scared. He simply builds tension, plays with our expectations and uses creative camera techniques to make the film memorable. One particular scene that stands out in my mind is when Ed first interviews Janet, the little girl who is the focus of the terror. The demon/ghost will not communicate unless they look away, so Ed turns his back to Janet. Wan focuses the camera on Ed, while Janet is out of focus in the background. It's one static shot where the out of focus character slowly and eerily changes into the demon/ghost. We never get a good luck at the thing, but we can see enough to know something is eerily off. Effectively creepy with the simplest camera technique. What other horror director would do something like that today?Highly recommended for the horror fan and people who really adore the original. Wan has stepped out of the horror genre and has had success (Fast Seven), but he loves the genre too much to abandon it. The man knows how to direct a horror film and he directs this one extremely well. My one complaint is that the film is long. Clocking in well over 2 hours, it feels like it at times. I'd say to maybe take out one of the scares, but I love each one. Add to the fact that most of the effects are practical and it makes me appreciate the film even more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The horror movie of 2016 to watch,"In all honesty, I do not know where to begin with 'The Conjuring 2'. For people within the audience that has been following my reviews. You may be aware of myself not being a major fan of present-day horror movies, although I am desperately seeing most horror flicks that come out because I genuinely love the genre. I have been waiting patiently for a horror movie to truly frighten me and make me uncomfortable. With this title, I have finally found that. 'The Conjuring 2' was terrifying and near perfection at the same time. I even was brought to a point where a horror sequence almost made me want to walk out of the theater because I was so uncomfortable and uneasy with the events occurring on screen, Now do not forget, with that being said, it simply means that this was a horror film done right. There were multiple moments, still shots, and sequences that I feel will go down as iconic parts of horror movie history. James Wan will equally become a household name among horror movie fans as he is only continuing to push out impressive horror flicks time after time. 'The Conjuring 2' blew away the original to me and I am confident in saying that this could be THE horror movie of 2016, competitors being 'Don't Breathe' (Evil Dead remake team) and 'Lights Out' (Also directed by James Wan). If you want true terror and fast-paced horror, this is the movie to see. Again, in my opinion, this is the horror movie of 2016.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Didn't live up to it's expectations for me.,"I honestly preferred the first Conjuring. The sequel didn't live up to my expectations. Having researched the real recordings and such this should have never been made into a film. I really wish they would have chosen a more ""Involved"" case file that the Warrens had actually had a huge part in. I feel like ""The Conjuring 2"" could have been so much better if there were a different case they were focusing on. This movie could have exceeded it's potential, but for me at least it just wasn't the right focus for a sequel. I do have high hopes for a ""Conjuring 3"" in the attempt to make up for ""The Conjuring 2"". In my book this just didn't scare me at all as a horror fanatic and I'm a very disappointed fan. I really had high hopes for this sequel and it let me down dramatically.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chills!,"Once again, James Wan left this die-hard horror movie fan smiling and satisfied. Everything from the interactions between the characters to the sweeping, long takes has been improved since the first film's release in 2013.This is a film that does not rely on predictable jump-scares to get and keep your attention. However, the dark atmosphere of the haunted home, set in the beautiful (and period correct) 1970's England, will keep you on the edge of your seat as your eyes dart around the screen, searching every dark corner of the decrepit waste of a home for some kind of potential evil. This is where the camera work of this film shines. The long takes are beautifully done. They are slow enough to build tension and paranoia but not too fast that you will miss a monster standing in a dark corner as the camera is focused on an actor.I took two stars away from a perfect 10/10 score for two reasons: number one... the first hour of the movie provides quite a bit of foreshadowing for the second half, which, once you finish the film, can be excused. I feel like it dragged on for a bit, and could have been done in a more timely manner. Not a big deal. Number two... the CGI of a particular monster (which shall not be named) was sub-par at best, even if it only got a couple of minutes of screen time. It detracted from the atmosphere that James Wan had built, though not enough to break the feeling of dread.Taking everything into account, this is an excellent film that any fan of the horror genre should see. It will leave you with chills throughout multiple scenes and the overall atmosphere will make you feel uneasy and paranoid. There were several scenes in particular that made me push myself into the chair, trying to subconsciously get away from the screen as much possible.8/10 Cooper L.W.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not quite as memorable as the original movie.,"'THE CONJURING 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2013 blockbuster supernatural 'fright flick', once again directed by James Wan (who also helmed the original 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' 1 & 2 and 'FURIOUS 7'). It was written by Carey and Chad Hayes (who also wrote the original film), as well as Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprise the leading roles, as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're investigating an aggressive poltergeist, that's haunting a London family (in 1977). The script is once again (said to be) based on a true story. The film also costars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Franka Potente and Simon McBurney. It's received good reviews from critics (once again), and it's also another hit at the Box Office (the first movie made over $300 million, on a $20 million budget). I found it to be a more than decent follow-up.The movie begins with Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) investigating the Amityville murders (in 1974), to see if a demonic presence was really responsible for the horrendous slayings. While experiencing a vision of the crimes, Lorraine foresees Ed's murder (by a tragic impaling). The story then flashes forward 3 years, to London; where a single mother (O'Connor), and her four children, are being terrorized by a supernatural presence. Ed and Lorraine are called to investigate the haunting, but Lorraine is extremely concerned about Ed's safety.The movie is once again outstandingly crafted, by Wan. It's got great atmosphere, it's disturbingly creepy, and the 'jump scares' are really well done. The story is (once again) intriguing, scary and filled with good character development. It's a little slow-paced, at first, but the film makes up for it in the second half. There's not really much to complain about, but (still) I didn't find it quite as memorable as the original movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent work by Patrick Wilson once again,"Dear Team, That was the most horror film of the year 2016 till date.The film was more a strong chemistry between Loraine and Ed Warren. I must say that Patrick Wilson once again wins over the show with his splendid performance. Besides, Peggy was also good in body language. I just could not get the point how Ed at the seeing the cross of reels in the bus got the sense that the spirit in that house was inhuman ?? And what was the reason of listening to the two audio reels ? The adventurous thing was the performance of small kid Janet that really shocked in some scenes. The film, however, was not more horror than its prequel but it was a treat to watch due to excellent performances of all cast most especially Ed and Loraine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A cheesy attempt at horror.,"It was just one of those mediocre horror movies.I mean i did not seeanyone jumping out of there seats scared.In fact i heard many laughingthrough out the movie.I couldn't even take it seriously especially withthe horrible kid actors.The only reason why i gave it 2 stars was causeit had Vera in it.I regretted paying 20 bucks for it and don't recommend this to anyone unless you would like to fall asleep or be laughing the entire time.It was just like any other horror movie except worse.Did not enjoy it and my eyes were tempted to close the entire time.Rather then scary it was funny,for the most part the acting sucked,and the story line was also bad.

As great as the first and SCARY AS HELL!,"Whoever says that this sequel is not as good as the first film is LYING. It is so common for the sequels to be far worse than the originals that it has become a habit to the viewers to judge them without even noticing them. NOT this time!Conjuring 2 is not just ""not worse than the first"". It is precisely as good as the first.Great story, great acting, smart dialogues, smart jump scares, dark atmosphere. Everything you need in a horror film.I liked the fact that the movie makes you care for the protagonists. Also, I loved the way it keeps you interested all the way throughout it. Never bored, never relaxed, always on guard. The quality of the movie is A+. James Wan's magic wand has done its miracle once more.The trap of relying on the first movie's success has been avoided and that is because of Wan's love and dedication to his work.It's about time that we become less harsh on good horror films and stop judging them for being what they are. They are horror films and we should judge them as that exactly. If i wanted to watch ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Cane"" I wouldn't be watching a horror film. STOP COMPARING HORROR FILMS WITH DRAMAS.On the other hand, even with this type of judgment, this movie deserves a 9/10 BECAUSE IT'S A DAMN GOOD MOVIE.Congratulations James Wan!

Best one in years!,"I am a fan of thrillers and horror movies. It's been quite some time since I last saw a horror movie like this one. It was a delight to watch this one! I am a sucker for true stories and seeing that this one originated from parts of a real story, was all I needed!The movie had all the necessary elements and classical standards of horror movies. Jump scares, visual effects, sudden noises, atmosphere, the works! The cast was amazing and the acting in all levels was amazing. I really like the children that were all up to the task.The depiction of the era and the costumes and everything were really high quality. I watched this in a cinema and despite all those stupid teenagers that laugh for no reason, it managed to captivate me and have me at the edge of my seat. I can recall more than ten times when I was really scared which was the first time after so many lousy movies that try to scare you with stupid effects.This movie has atmosphere, it is nicely crafted and it's really worth your time!

Something you should look out for and must watch,"The movies on its own justifies itself to be made by one and only James Wan.

The Conjuring 2 Review,"OK. This movie is a great scare movie! You hardly get to witness a second horror movie that is as good as the first movie if not better. I gave it a ten because of the scare factor and that the characters in the movie set the atmosphere that guided us down a road less followed. It's one thing to sit and conjure up strange noises and knocks and pings throughout the night and then account them as being paranormal but as soon as you get serious about what you are doing knowing all too well that what comes through could without a doubt kill you, it's then the word paranormal becomes a welcome mat compared to the actual being that is in the room with you. With that said, don't be too critical because you will come out of this experience in the movie as just a movie and nothing else. Sit back, relax while you can and savor that moment because as soon as you dive into the movie, you will be scared and you will have images burned into your mind. Don't be surprised if you get home and begin to leave the lights on because this movie is that frightful!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I just don't get it,"How this title currently has a rating of 7.5/10 I will never know. The horror genre has been suffering for some time under the weight of bad acting, over played jump-scares and little to no substance and this is just another addition to the long list of horror titles treading that path.The problem? Honestly, it takes more to scare me than a loud bang among the silence or the sudden appearance of a distorted face in the darkness. I didn't feel invested in a single character, nor was there a tense build up of fear and trepidation when introducing the darker forces at play. Instead we are treated to having spirit after spirit shoved in our faces for the sake of a cheap trick, all whom seem to be little to no more harm than a somewhat aggravated cat. No one really seems scared by what is happening, in fact pretty much the entire cast seems to have approached their role having been told to ham up their accents but tone down any actual commitment to emotion in case the weaker members of the cast REALLY stand out.Perhaps you will enjoy it. Truth is, if you liked the first one you probably will. But if you are like me and want to sit down with something that is truly going to test your nerves, you probably want to return to the Tartan film collection and find something you're yet to try.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not as scary as its predecessor. Still, it's much better than most horror sequels.","The Conjuring 2 is based on another true story from the case files of paranormal investigators, Ed Warren(Patrick Wilson) & Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga). This time around, Ed & Lorraine Warren travel to London for their new case. Once there, the Hodgson family tells them, that their house is being terrorized by malevolent spirits. Now, it is up to Ed & Lorraine Warren to stop this haunting, at any cost.The Conjuring 2 is a good film. However, when you compare this movie to The Conjuring(2013), it just doesn't match up to it. The first film, had some brilliantly executed jump scares & genuinely unnerving scenes. This movie, has some great jump scares too but, they are few & far between. One thing that this movie has going for it that The Conjuring(2013) didn't, is an element of suspense. Director James Wan introduces certain subplots, that he ties together very well with the main story, in the climax of the film. A note on the performances. Patrick Wilson is outstanding as Ed Warren. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Lorraine Warren. Madison Wolfe is mind blowing as Janet Hodgson. Wolfe at such a young age, portrays a variety of emotions, effortlessly. Frances O'Conner is brilliant as Peggy Hodgson. Lauren Esposito is great as Margaret Hodgson. Benjamin Haigh is superb as Billy Hodgson. Patrick McAuley is awesome as Johnny Hodgson. Simon McBurney is impressive as Maurice Grosse. Maria Doyle Kennedy, Simon Delaney & Franka Potente are effective as, Peggy Nottingham, Vic Nottingham & Anita Gregory, respectively. Bob Adrian & Bonnie Aarons are fantastic as, Bill Wilkins & Demon Nun, respectively. Sterling Jerins is good as Judy Warren. All in all, The Conjuring 2 is a well made film. I just wish it scared me more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The camera may be so small and light. However this movie is a heavy 'n full on good time,"Great movie, I enjoyed this, and director James Wan (Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence) is becoming one of my favorite directors, not just in mainstream horror movies, but mainstream directors in general. I love how this film isn't just cheap jump scares, like many of today horror films. It actually builds up the tension. I thought the first Conjuring was great, and this is a good example of how to do a horror movie, and how a sequel can actually be better than the 1st in my opinion. I actually saw this movie with my dad, and he fell asleep. But, I thought it was more than entertaining, and worth staying awake. Even though I thought the crooked man ( a.k.a. James Wan auditioning for slender man) didn't need to be in the film, and this film could have been trimmed down 20 minutes. Also, the acting by Vera Farmiga (Orphan) and Patrick Wilson (Watchmen), works well, and the two work well together. Patrick Wilson's acting, wardrobe, character development, and 70's sideburns almost had me thinking it really was 1977 lol.

Scariest horror film since ....The Exorcist ...,"I truly dislike profanity ... but OMFG! WOW!Now that is how you make a horror movie.James Wan is a master of modern horror, tapping into truly nightmarish scares that only exist in the old classics.This movie it a horror masterpiece, with 2 simultaneous stories attempting to link up, with terrifying visuals, great acting and a very good script, C2 easily surpass the original which was in itself a great film.I won't lie, i had my doubts because horror now a days is technically dead, good horror anyways, especially if its a a sequel. But man was i surprised.The last time i felt truly scared watching a film ... and i mean true fear was with the Exorcist. The Conjuring 1 was excellent and had scenes that scared me, but TC2 in its enterity is terrifying.Do not watch it alone, and be prepared to look at nuns in a whole new way ...Horror at its best.

The film also delves more deeply into very interesting lessons about understanding Good and Evil. Characters deliver excellent performances that are balanced between skepticism and belief about the supernatural. Lorraine and Ed play great emotional scenes that run the gamut. The movie feels very authentic for its time period so that you really feel like it is occurring during the 1970s. Well-paced scares that supply consistent twinges of fear along with moments of utter shock. It is a dark world that keeps you thoroughly enthralled, wanting to see what happens to these characters, and how in the world they will be able to resolve the demonic problem at hand.

Who you gonna call?,"In The Conjuring 2 a family of a single mother and four children, living in London, find themselves being haunted by an evil spirit. Because of their increasingly dire situation they decide to contact Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren who answer their aid call. So, James Wan! More like James Win, know what I'm saying? Because he directed this awesome movie? No? OK, sorry. In all seriousness I may have found my favorite horror movie with The Conjuring 2. That's not saying much, as I am not that educated in horror movies but this film showed me that in order to create horror there must be no shortage in creativity and practicality. I've heard people saying that crafting a horror movie must be easier than other genres but this movie proves the opposite. Director James Wan injects his film with horror through some of the most elaborate visual techniques I have witnessed in a movie from this genre. From the simple use of shadows to the use of decoys in the shot that only want to trick our focus, Wan plays with our senses in almost every sequence. You are always left examining every aspect of the environment where the characters are in order to guess where the next horrifying thing will jump from next; and at times it is so obvious that you are left squinting your eyes and cringing waiting for the jump scare to take the color out of your skin. From POV shots to elaborate tracking shots, the variety of filming techniques is also astonishing. Wan's excellent directing also tackles the sound category. Every knock and every squeak serves a purpose and enhances the atmosphere.In the following I am going to do a very spoilery commentary about to sequences which raised all of my body hair and turned me into a chicken-skinned porcupine, but at the same time made me admire James Wan as a horror director. The first sequence I want to mention is the one where Ed Warren contacts the spirit of Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) through Janet (Madison Wolfe). Ed is facing the camera and his back is facing Janet, who is sitting on a couch. The camera very cleverly maintains focus on Ed and through the use of depth of field distorts the image of Janet. As Ed begins to interview the spirit and this entity starts to answer in a very crooked voice, Janet begins to shift very subtly into an old man. This isn't implemented as a jump scare but as a ""Holy crap! Look look look!"" moment. As you maintain your focus in Ed Warren and Patrick Wilsons great performance the oddity slowly and almost unnoticeably starts to manifest. What's incredible is that the scene lasts about 4 minutes. Wan's complete trust in Wilson's performance and in our attention as an audience is baffling. He has no need of hammering in the fear factor; he trusts that our attention and perception will do the job for him. The other sequence I will delve in switches subtlety for the most horrifying character that will haunt my dreams until I drown it with many sessions of watching colorful cartoons and sitcoms that will dry my tears and keep me from reluctantly waiting for that face to pop out of a window at night. Trust me it really is that scary. And if you've watched it you know what I am talking about. Yes, that nun (Bonnie Aarons) is the stuff of nightmares. The makeup and character design is one of the best I have seen in a horror film, probably on par with The Exorcist. It is much simpler but damn that crap brings the crap. But back to the sequence, man was it bone-chilling. Lorraine following the nun into that room and then the way in which the film plays with us through shadows and the shape of the nun's face, damn damn damn. I really wanted to look away as the nun's face just sat there in the dark, and I think I used all of my cringe faces in that single sequence alone. That is true mastery in film design. The film also included some amazing musical choices. All of those Christmas carols that played as the nun's background music were chilly but also pretty epic. But music wasn't always used to enhance the chills but also to bring some heart into the film. ""Can't help falling in love"" was used to gather our characters in moments of tranquility which made the pace much more tolerable.The characters were also quite tolerable for a horror movie. They obviously included the kid who wandered out into the darkness alone in spite of all the spookiness that had happened and made us question why he didn't have at least 7 people accompanying him with all the lights on. But all of the characters in general where entertaining to watch and the family and the Warrens had enough character development for us to care about their survival. The awesome performances, especially from Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Madison Wolfe also helped the movie become very digestible.Although I truly admire this film I do have a few negatives to point out. Firstly, there is a tall and silly monster called the Crooked Man that makes sudden appearances and it just feels very out of place given his very over the top and colorful design.All things considered, The Conjuring 2 is a true masterwork in horror. It is very uncommon for a sequel to be as good as the original, but in my case this movie surpassed the first one because of some extremely clever filming and storytelling techniques. I am thrilled to experience all of James Wan's upcoming projects and I am confident that he has the ability inflict some very intelligent thrills into us audience members. I am rating The Conjuring 2 with a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson played their part as a couple perfectly because they bring out that realism of the film because obviously there's a lot of upside down things going , yet they still keep standing strong together. So there's more to the conjuring 2 than it just being a scary supernatural horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The first one is better,"I like the first one better because: * less CGI effects * the scenes on this movie is predictable * another girl in distraught, it seems to me that this ""epidemic"" was all copied from the exorcist movieWhat i like about this movie: * the romance between Ed and Lorraine was highlightedThe first part of the movie was really exciting but then it gets boring on the latter part. The static TV thingy is not new. In my opinion this is a case of ""creating a sequel just for the heck of it."" I find the first one much appealing that its predecessor. I gave it 5/10 because of its lack of originality and its overrated CGI effects. The scary monsters such as VALAK and slender man's brother was also overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Genuinely scary!,"For me, personally, this is one of the best horror movies. All the right kind of scares, jumps and sounds- not too over the top. I think it's one of the best sequels to be made.

A good sequel! Highly recommended!,"Wow!! Just wow!! James Wan is fast becoming by top horror director of all time. So far the Insidious franchise has put my faith back in actual scary horror movies and not the awful horror violence movies such as Rob Zombies god awful Halloween 2 where there is nothing scary whatsoever seeing someone stabbed 13 times. But with Dead Silence, Insidious and now The Conjuring, James Wan has made and produced some classic horrors. With the first Conjuring, I thought it was excellent up to the kind of rip-off ending where it reminded me far too much of The Exorcist. That was my only gripe with the film though.In The Conjuring 2 however, yes we have another possession but it is the three 'demons' that Wan has added to this movie which just terrifies you. It was bad enough having nightmares about Red Faced Demon and The Bride in Black from Insidious. Now we have Bill Wilkins (The Old Man), The Nun and The Crooked Man. All three of these played on my fears that I had as a kid and they were truly terrifying. Like with Annabelle who was introduced in The Conjuring and got her own spin off film, the same will now happen with The Nun in this film and I for one can't wait. A special mention must go to the production design as well because the house that the family live in in this movie would be terrifying WITHOUT all the haunting's going on!! Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren are even better in this than the first one and are a great on screen couple with quite a nice scene at the end dancing to an Elvis Presley track.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Conjuring 2 - Conjured me.,"Enjoyed the first one, although I'm afraid I didn't have the patience to watch the second one. 30 minutes in I found it tiresome and boring. Hope I got to the point quicker than the second movie. This movie was more carnival than horror.Too formulaic to ever be remembered, indeed, the ending happened exactly as contrived. The horror genre shouldn't be 'just' about making people jump at specific moments of drawn out tension, That's not radical, clever or new. Sometime you have to go with gut instinct to make a sequel worthy of it's predecessor, and I feel that this sequel fell someway short. by a substantial n=margin I'm sorry be of this opinion, because I know hoe talented the guys are, however it could be time constraints/issues and a myriad of other factors.

A Perfect Nightmare Fuel,"A Perfect Nightmare Fuel.. James Wan is really gifted to create such dark art.(Before I've seen the second edition of Conjuring Saga, The Conjuring (2013) and The Omen (1976) were on the top of my list). Back to the answer, let me tell you something about horror movie. There are two types of a horror movie..one who make you thrilled, scare over the skin and others are just make your bone chill, you can sense that SCAR beneath your skin and spine. It has everything the perfect combination of Background score, Timing, Script, Characters, great fleshed out the screenplay, great horror visuals.. I am die hard fan of horror movie, have seen many Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Turkish horror movies apart of English.

Ridiculously Over-Dramatized,"These movies are supposed to be based upon a true story. And the first one was great because of how realistic it was. But it is painfully obvious that this movie is way over dramatized. It was so over done to the point of seeming ridiculous. I don't need to know the original story to know when something is being over-dramatized. And I can't stand it when movies take liberties like that and go way overboard with exaggerating a retelling of a true story. And this one takes it to the point of absurdity. Honestly I didn't even watch the whole thing, I had to turn it off because it was just too ridiculous. I was watching it to watch a realistic horror movie, and this was anything but, it was almost comical how much they overdid it. Bad, just bad. I give it a 4 and thats being generous and only because I liked the original premise, and the two main characters, and it had potential but they really got lost with their creativity here, probably because they were trying to out-do the original. Which they did, but not in a good way.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Suburban Screams,"With the Conjuring now having its own universe of films, I see this more as an instalment in an anthology series than a sequel and an entertaining one at that.Based on a true story always means loosely based and over dramatised, in Hollywood terms, so drop your realism expectations and enjoy the story.Jump scares, creepy music, lots of panning down the hallway shots, it's all formulaic, but done at the top of its game, so much so it pulls off being original whilst delivering the expected.As a British guy who grew up in 1980's social housing I tip my hat at the set and costume designers, there were houses out there that looked just like that, I really did get the British Thatcher years vibe, (although a little easy on the posh accents there girls!)Overall the acting is pretty good, there's a nice rapport and relationship building with all the characters and they use this a lot to drive the plot of the film, which is one of its plus points.That said there's still some genuinely creepy parts, some cheesy but effective jump scares and some over the top demonic action. A perfect little combo to make this film an entertaining good ghost story.Patrick and Vera do Ed and Lorraine justice as usual, proving they're still horror's power couple.It's worth a watch for the nun portrait coming to life scene alone.Think Omen-esque horror vibes, when the late 70's got horror all serious and British, meets retro documentary paranormal busters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

OTT isn't scary.,"I seriously don't get the hype around The Conjuring & Insidious. They go so over the top I can't take them seriously. What ever happened to a slow burn or subtlety in horror? Don't get me wrong, I love high concept horror or a good cheese fest too. Evil Dead, Poltergeist, Hellraiser... they're not exactly documentary level BUT Conjuring sets itself up as some kind of 'realistic' horror. Constantly reminding us 'Based on a true story' well then give me a little credibility. 'The Amityville Horror' or 'The Haunted' have a foot in reality that revvs up near the end to good effect. This film lets go of reality from the beginning and personally no amount of loud jump scares can make up for a complete lack of atmosphere.They even cram in things that didn't even happen in the 'real' story. A freaking ghost nun demon? Or how about a scene were a dog turns into an 8 foot tall crooked man? A scene so far out the box even a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel looks low key by comparison.The actors playing the mother Peggy and the oldest daughter put on the worst 'cockney' accents I've heard since my high school presentation of Oliver Twist.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Vast Improvement Over the Original,"The Conjuring 2 follows the Warren couple as they discover another family is being haunted and sets out to help them, meanwhile spiritual troubles have started with themselves.Personally I didn't care for the first movie that much. I thought it was largely cheap horror without much substance. The sequel, however, takes everything it predecessor did right, then puts it into a much better movie.Similar to the last movie, the performances are all good. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson continue to be great, but another standout was Frances O'Connor. She plays the mother of the haunted family, and she does a dang good job of it. The kids are good too, most notably Madison Wolfe, who plays the girl the ghost primarily goes after.Unlike it's predecessor, this movie is actually pretty unnerving throughout. The movie takes a similar approach to the original where it develops both the Warrens outside the haunting and those who are haunted before ultimately bringing them together. It works very well here, and the movie is much more upfront with it's scares, yet it's not really over-the-top for the first half. As such, we see the family's relationships get tested, and it develops and makes the audience care much more for them. So each scare becomes that much more effective. Even without that, the movie is creepy. It uses the fear of the unknown very well, and builds up a tense atmosphere with immense payoff.Speaking of the payoff, the climax is outstanding. The first movie had a notably good climax, and for me that more or less saved the film. Here, it's even better. It's longer, and thus the tension builds more. And there are aspects that are hinted at (or more, outwardly stated) earlier in the movie, so when those aspects present themselves it only makes it better. I was on the edge of my seat, and while I was sure I knew the ending, I wasn't completely certain. And that's another thing I loved about this movie.The movie is great with it's mystery. Towards the end especially I began to question it, and while I was sure I knew what was going to happen, again, I wasn't completely certain. The movie had proved itself to be pretty brave thus far, who knows? Maybe it would turn everything on it's head.The first act is brilliantly shot. It features several noticeably long takes, and it further shows just how much skill went into this movie. Unfortunately those shots do take a dip in the last portion, or maybe they became less noticeable once the story picked up, but regardless it was a treat to see this level of skill from a director.Overall The Conjuring 2 is somehow not only a good horror sequel, but a great one. It's a beautifully shot, genuinely unnerving, well- performed horror that I had a blast with. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, and in the end I would definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Satisfying and more Emotional Engaging Horror Sequel,"Sequels of horror genre have always been cursed to turn out poor yet director James Wan manages to set his bar as compelling as the first one; though not critically-acclaimed but overall a satisfying scare without blood and gore. Slightly longer than its predecessor, the 134 minutes running time enhances smooth pacing of the plot, allows further debate over the controversy of supernatural phenomenons and scientific psychology, human tricks and role play of the religion organisations; even if parts of its horror elements may feel routine, it is still able to trigger chills and unsettling moods. Characters development and emotional engagement especially the love life of Warren have made this follow up more to like a family crisis drama interrupted by a demonic figure, thanks to the strong performance of the young casts, eerie but not over loud thematic scores as well as the confident cinematography and visual effects. Overall, the efforts of remaining the styles from the first one, the decision to twist the final act and the addition of dramatic aspects are mixing so well which eventually it just feels so real that leaves the desire to follow up with the next documented case.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"a quality horror , something rare today , James Wan Best Director of terror today, and watching Madison Wolfe , she has a great future.","The Conjuring 2 achieved something rare for a horror movie, be the same level or better than its predecessor which is very good, the first spoke about the case of Harrisville, United States. A couple moves to a new house next to his five daughters to. Inexplicably, strange events begin to frighten children, the father and especially the mother. already that the plot is based on the case Enfield Poltergeist, recorded at the end of the 1970s the beginning of the film is very good, and very interesting, we has a notion of the Lorraine Warren can do, the cast is back Vera Farmiga who indulges in the role, she is excellent, Patrick Wilson this very well also, Madison Wolfe steals the show whenever she is present on the screen, it makes an excellent performance, the cast still has, Frances O'Connor, Simon McBurney , Franka Potente, Steve Coulter, etc., the chemical Patrick Wilson with Vera Farmiga is excellent, you what feel each character feels for the other, the picture is very good, and the direction of James Wan to back this sequence, is excellent he usually give some unpredictable scares even some being predictable, but I took a lot scares, the way the Wan films is excellent, it does some very good camera games, some moments are very tense, and the nun Demonic gave me a lot fear, and the soundtrack is eerie, as well as the first, the final scene I found good, but was a little fast, the script is good, more is some very quick things, in my opinion the film should be about 10 minutes more, to better develop some things, the Conjuring 2 is one of the best films of the year, in my opinion is better than the first, it gave me more scares, and the villain was interesting to come the Conjuring 3.

An entertaining horror but unnatural,"Let me start by saying as a stand alone horror film this is very good and has plenty of scares but if you're watching it thinking its accurate to the real case you'll be misdirected. The Warren's only visited for an afternoon in the real case and were not invited by Maurice Gross or Guy Playfair. They turned up one day unannounced and actually weren't received well by the Hodgson family and never returned. They never spent longer than a couple of hours and most definitely did not partake in the invedtigation of the case as the film portrays. The house is fairly accurate but the real house in Enfield, London is a lot smaller and doesn't have a basement. Most of the events portrayed in this film didn't happen, such as the tent in the hallway, the zoetrope and the final scene featuring the tree is pure Hollywood make believe. The names of the people are accurate and I'm glad to say that the exterior street used in the filming is actually in enfield and is fairly close to Green Street where the actual house still stands. I live only a couple of miles from the real house and have visited it several times and one day I might get to go inside. As I said an entertaining couple of hours if you like horror films but the film is very inaccurate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Zoetroped,"I love when my perseverance in a movie franchise, including preparing by seeing two lousy ""Amityville Horror"" flicks (1979 and 2005), actually pays off, as it does here with ""The Conjuring 2,"" a sequel that surpasses its promising but largely hackneyed and lackluster predecessor. Now, I realize I may not appreciate the horror genre in the same ways as do others, as a bodily or visceral thrill. I'm not opposed to that, but rarely do I find a horror movie to be scary, which often leads me left with either trying to engage with them intellectually and, as that's often counterproductive to their intent, just seeing them for laughs--the worse schlock sometimes the better. The first ""Conjuring"" didn't quite succeed on any of those accounts. The horror was too overly rooted in familiar filmmaking and tropes and even combined with relatively poor acting wasn't especially amusing, but it was reflexive. The Warrens aren't only ghostbusters (or demons or whatever); they're filmmakers and exhibitors. They recorded the supposed paranormal activity by camera and sound recording and even employed special lighting techniques. Then, they exhibited these films whether to a priest or a campus of students. In this sequel, they do so for television, as well as their continued collection of documentation for Catholicism. ""The Conjuring 2"" goes further and improves in other ways on the former picture, too.There's a lot to like here for one looking for reflexively-engaging cinema. It begins with a séance where Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) enters a past horror, or rather her entering a character in another movie. This is where one is rewarded for watching the aforementioned 1979 and 2005 dullards. Love the mirror motif, too. This somewhat of a film-within-film, however, is interrupted by foreshadowing for the rest of the movie involving the ghastly-looking nun, which will appear later in Lorraine's other nightmarish premonitions--as well as, we're told, her past one which itself is from a film-within-film flashback in the first film--and in her husband's painting, which becomes something of a living portrait. That's approaching ""Dorian Gray"" levels of cleverness there. Then, there's the TV stuff: the Warrens being interviewed, and the Hodgsons from their haunted home across the pond in London. One of the Hodgson daughters even struggles for control of the TV channel with their ghost squatter.The Warrens and company are back with the recording equipment, too, so as to verify the supernatural. This ground was already covered in the first movie, but I do appreciate the joke regarding the supposedly-lightweight video camera. Moreover, the abstraction of filmmaking within a film is leveraged more effectively here. Note that the camera and audio tapes are employed to both confirm and deny the paranormal activity. Movies and other recording arts, after all, aren't unbiased arbiters of fact. To use semiotics from film theory, it's just an indexical trace of what was recorded. In other words, film is a ghost. The husband's painting is another instance of this, as is the fevered-dream scratching in the bible by the wife.This leads me to my favorite part, the zoetrope. Including this ""philosophical toy"" that played cinema before cinema was supposedly a thing in a movie in the first place is a good way to win me over--the fan of the history of the invention of movies and early cinema that I am--but it's especially wonderful how it's employed here. Zoetrope strips, like their predecessor of phenakistiscope discs, tended to feature drawings instead of photographs (although there were exceptions: the photographic motion pictures of Duboscq, Purkyne, Heyl, Muybridge, Marey, Demenÿ, Anschütz--and bonus points to any reader familiar with all those names). That is, such zoetrope strips as the crooked man here aren't indexical. A cartoon may be based on something in reality, but not even the Warrens would offer it as evidence of demonic possession. What's clever here, then, is that while the video and audio tapes turn out to be unreliable as proof and even if they are good for that they require some editing and interpretation, it's the zoetrope cartoon that manifests as real when the crooked man comes to life--the monster as movie. Anyone taking the based-on-a-true-story nonsense of the movie seriously should consider the lack of earnestness on the part of the filmmakers this implies.This sequel is an improvement all around, too. The slightly-shaking camerawork works better this time methinks and in a less showy manner. There are still the usual games with telegraphing jump scares, but the whole construction seems less formulaic. The climax is genuinely exciting because it springs from its reflexive elements and was heavily foreshadowed. I also appreciate the depiction of an ideal marriage here more. I like that Farmiga seems to get more attention and not just because I feel as though I've seen Patrick Wilson, who plays her husband, in a lot of other stuff yet still couldn't identify him from a lineup of other leading men who've left little impression on me. The Warrens truly come across as a team in this one. Especially effective is the business of her clairvoyance--seeing what others cannot--and the complimentary analogy later of him losing his physical sight. How apt for a picture of a visual art form reflexively about that art and what is seen and verified.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This is how you make a sequel!,"A thoroughly enjoyable night out at the flicks. I saw the first film and loved it and I think I might have enjoyed this sequel even more and whats-more, the screening I went to of this was absolutely still and silent - James Wan had the audience in the palm of his hand which is exactly the way it should be.Wan takes everything you loved about the first film and turns the volume up a couple of more notches. The set design, script, acting and scare scenes are all uniformly masterful. My only criticism would be that it was a tad long and the middle section of the film could have been trimmed down a bit; we reach a point as an audience where we feel that the setup has been established for the final act and we want to move into the final movement of the film but Wan lingers a bit too long and shows us one too many possession scenes I think. This is a minor criticism though.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson deliver solid performances again and Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor (whom I enjoyed immensely in the excellent TV series The Missing) are also excellent. The scare set pieces are fantastic with the early scene of the demon visiting Lorraine at home being one of the best horror scenes in years. Great music and atmosphere and I was pleased to see that Wan even kept the creepy ascending yellow title scroll from the first film.9/10. Loses one point for being slightly too long.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring 2 is another best horror movie of this decade.,"The Conjuring 2 : Words cannot describe our experience of watching scary horror movies.It will be truly the best experience if it is a true horror.The Conjuring which was released in 2013 is often termed as best horror movie of decade.Now I got lucky by getting chance to watch The Conjuring 2 first day in theater.When I went into the hall I got surprised to watch it house full.So is this sequel more scarier than its predecessor???? Plot: This movie was another case from real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.It revolves around Hodgson family in Enfield,London.Janet,younger daughter of the family gets possessed by unknown entity.Even Lorraine gets haunted visions about enemy from past.How are they both related??Did Warrens save the girl?? Plus Points: 1)Scary scenes: Same like its predecessor,The Conjuring 2 has also scariest scenes which will really make everyone scream.We get them back to back,which may cause us feel mentally disturbed.These scenes are real feast to horror fans. 2)Screenplay and Direction: Screenplay of this movie is awesome and spooky.From the first scene itself the movie involves us into it and never falls apart.James Wan once again proved that he is the best horror director in recent times.Hats off to him. 3)Music: Same like other James Wan's movies like Insidious and The Conjuring,this movie also has spooky music always playing every minute of the movie which is the major pro of the movie. 4) Performances: Everyone in this movie gave realistic performances especially Madison who played the role of Janet gave award winning performance. Minus Points: One and only thing is Beware before watching it because it really going to make you look around always just to make sure that you are not alone.

Nothing horror,"James Wan is creatively bankrupt, and grossly over rated.I went to see The Conjuring 2 today with a friend and I was completely fed up by the end.The movie starts off with a blatant marketing pitch for what I'm guessing is going to be 'The Conjuring 3'. Why else introduce the Amityville Horror at the beginning which has absolutely nothing to do with the Enfield Poltergeist? It's just so James Wan can keep milking his franchise like he did with The Conjuring 1 with Annabelle, and the god awful Insidious series etc. Either that or they will make a spin off featuring Marilyn Manson in a nuns outfit.So then the film shifts to London, with a cringe-worthy attempt of signifying that we are now in London by playing London Calling by The Clash. Cue stock footage of very British things and blah blah blah we are in a school playground where we meet Janet and then its over to her house to meet her caricature mother. The mother who has the most fake sounding cockney accent you will ever hear. In England we refer to it as 'mockney'. It's so over done and put on you wonder why Wan didn't just hire an actress from Eastenders. The acting may have been worse but at least you'd have more of a real sounding London accent. That scene where she goes into the basement of the house with a mate to mess about with the washing machine, I felt like I was watching a live London stage show. Where the actors over do the acting and accent.Thankfully, I wasn't the only one in the cinema who laughed out loud at the actor playing Maurice Grosse. Another awful, awful representation of a real person. His moustache and hair looked glued on and again was nothing more than a hilarious caricature. Most of the extras in this movie (people playing the police etc) had no fluidity at all, just a stale rigid performance devoid of anything you could relate to real people.Every 'scary' scene is a loud bass thump accompanied by a jump scare. This is the extent of James Wans creative vision. Mind you, I will give him credit for the chair scene where Janet is blurred out in the background and old Bill comes for a chat with Patrick Wilson. You can see bills face form slowly as he talks. Thats as good as the film got.There was no tension, no atmosphere, nothing. The inside of the house was HUGE for a London council flat. Flats like that are tiny in reality.And the demons great plan for Mr Warrens demise was to make him fall from the top window and impale him on a sharp tree branch below? LOL. Come on Wan, this is something a child would come up with.The film got silly at many points, especially that cgi demon that came out of the dog. Just degraded the movie further and was comical more than anything. The first time BIll speaks through Janet when the press are there in the living room just sounded ridiculous.Again, the use of religion to combat the evil just got on my nerves. Apparently Ed Warrens cross on his necklace warded off evil spirits but Janets room full of crucifixes on the wall did diddly squat. Any one else getting fed up to the back teeth of good vs evil involving religion? The acting was adequate enough but Madison Wolfe makes no impression what so ever. The other child actors were good enough I suppose.There's nothing here you haven't seen before. James Wan uses the same old tedious, trite tricks and just copy and pastes from his other movies, with the exception of a differently arranged type of jump scare etc. He lacks vision and creativity. All he is, is a commercially viable hack making watered down 'horror' for the lowest common denominator. Generation 'apphole' will eat this crap up like its the best thing 'evaaaa' and hail Wan as a movie making god.The emperor has no clothes.70 out of 153 found this helpful.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I actually like this better than the first film,"I think the first film is more effective at the horror elements; there's nothing new in the scares and unnerving sequences here. So this film isn't as visceral as the prior film. But I prefer the script a good deal.First I think the relationships amongst the characters-especially how the Warren interact with the new family-are more individualized, less trope-y. Likewise, I really like how the Warren's love is fleshed out. The scary bits are less intense but you care for the characters so it's something of a wash for intensity.Second, the film does at least brings up the notion that the Warrens are frauds, even through it is just color. The opening TV interview works well in this regard. The big 3rd act twist also works well in this regard. The film still doesn't got far enough on this aspect because it is a horror film but I like the gestures towards that.I still think a more interesting film about the Warren is possible but *this* is the best use of them in the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hell on Parade,"For years, I've been telling people that the scariest horror movie I've ever seen is 'The Exorcist.' Well, all that changed after watching 'The Conjuring 2.' All I can say is, Wow! James Wan, who I've been following since his 2004 feature 'Saw,' has shown amazing growth as a purveyor of the demonic. And his understanding of the intrinsic nature of evil from a Catholic perspective rivals that of William Peter Blatty, who I have greatly admired since reading his novel THE EXORCIST, upon which the movie was based.Now, I enjoyed 'The Conjuring' which, like the sequel, is based on a paranormal case by real-life investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. After seeing that movie, I began researching the Warrens and learned about the case in England, where the story of 'The Conjuring 2' takes place. The fact that these are actual cases and involve demonic possession both intrigues and horrifies me. As a Catholic, I believe in Hell. And I believe that demons like the one featured in 'The Conjuring 2' have walked the earth long before man. Perhaps this is why, for me, the film is so frightening.Flipping around the dial the other day, I happened across the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot from 2010. Though well made, it wasn't scary. I know Freddie Kreuger is a fantasy character and, despite the sharpness of his homemade claws, he's just another homicidal killer. And I feel that way about most horror movies involving monsters. 'The Babadook' is a great example. Yes, he's paper-thin and creepy. But that's about it. I was more moved by the exasperated, sleep-deprived Amelia and her lonely, desperate attempts at creating a normal life for her troubled son, Samuel. Conversely, when the demon in 'The Conjuring 2' takes on the form of The Crooked Man, I ended up halfway out of my seat—which is a tribute to the genius of James Wan.Like most folks, I believe horror movies do well because people like to be scared. It's a rush similar to riding a roller coaster. And when it's over, you're relieved. But every once in a while a film comes along that disturbs the viewer to the core, its aftereffect lingering for days. 'The Conjuring 2' is just such a movie. And an estimated $40M in box office receipts at the time of this writing—this kind of story sells.Now, I'm not saying that a film like this will turn an atheist into a believer. But it might make those who are on the fence about God, angels and demons think twice before picking up the planchette from that Ouija board collecting dust in the corner with those other games. My advice—just say no.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Way too slow,"This takes place in 1978 and is based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) fight a ghost in England that targets a family with a divorced mom and four children. It targets especially their 11 year old girl.The first movie was a good scary movie. It had its faults but it worked. This one doesn't. For starters it's too long. There's no reason for this film to run almost 2 and half hours. Plenty of sequences could have been trimmed or cut out completely. Secondly it has too many damn jump scares. They're annoying and force the audience to jump. Also it's VERY slow-moving. I got bored pretty quickly. Worst of all it just isn't scary. The attack scenes weren't even remotely scary. On the plus side it is well-acted and directed with accurate 1978 clothes and fads portrayed. Also the ending is great--violent and exciting but its too little too late. This has been getting raves from critics and viewers so I'm definitely in the minority here but I really didn't like it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""A rare film of the horror genre""","Horror sequels can be another horrible film following from it's predecessor's success that most filmmakers just want some money without any effort and interesting stuff to show,they are just blatantly lazy.Conjuring 2 didn't follow that but instead brought us new interesting things to this franchise with a captivating story and a hunting and creepy atmosphere,it is a well directed horror sequel.The performances were amazing,the chemistry of the Warrens was just marvelous and so thus the children in the film they were also excellent.As the film progress the tension gets higher and also thus the apprehension.This Horror film is far from the worst and near from the best it's on par with it's predecessor,Conjuring 2 is an example of a good horror sequel",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fantastic horror sequel,"The Conjuring 2 surely has to go into the history books as one of the best horror sequels ever. There is barely any drop in quality compared to the first film which really is remarkable in any genre, let alone horror.The atmosphere is superb. It is so genuinely scary and creepy, and full of brilliant horror moments that will have you glued to the screen. It isn't too reliant on jump scares either which is a huge plus. There is plenty of slow burn and more measures horror moments which are a real treat, adding to the constant sense of terror.The plot is very well executed and draws you in from the get go, in no small part due to the terrific acting from the entire cast. I do think it was a little too fragmented at the start, and perhaps a teensy bit anti climatic at the end but this is a small gripe. On the whole the story is top notch.If you loved the first Conjuring film you love this. And if you haven't seen either, what are you waiting for?!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Well Done Wan, Well done","The horror genre, a movie category that tries to be good, but often ends up a joke during most movies. Occasionally though, we get a film that provides a good thrilling scare and is actually worth the admission price. For me, The Conjuring was one of those movies able to provide the chills I was looking for with a story to match. When I heard a sequel was coming, I feared that its good name would be diluted by the Hollywood haste to make money (remember Annabelle?). Hi Robbie K here, and today I review the Conjuring 2 and share my thoughts on the latest film. Let's get started.THE GOOD  Story  Integrated scares  Acting/Recurring CastSeldom do we get a horror movie with an actual story, instead focusing on how to make people jump. This is not the case with this film my friends. Director James Wan and his team have managed to craft a tale that is both entertaining and interesting to watch. Conjuring 2's story takes place a few years after the first with the Warren's continuing their investigations of the paranormal. Meanwhile, across the ocean, the Hodgson family begins to experience their own paranormal activity that will eventually warrant inspection by our detectives. Sounds simple I know, and in truth it is, but Wan's delivery is fantastic.He manages to build suspense in his tale, using a gradual series of scares to build the tension and slowly reveal the truth in the haunting. And to throw in the few twists they did, only added more depth to the story. But Wan goes one step further and decides to bring some character development into mix, helping to add depth to all involved to help us connect with the film. The Warren's story was great to expand on, discussing the origins of our detectives, while also dropping in a little bit of love to sweeten the deal. And if that weren't enough, he even manages to keep all of the scares pertinent to the story, integrating them into the plot rather than dropping a random scare moment that Hollywood is famous for. By having the scares have a purpose, they removed the corny aspects and added an edge that made the only that much better. Of course, having a great cast to act out this story is the final piece of the puzzle. The repeat performance by Wilson and Farmiga was just as strong, the chemistry between them solid that I believed they were a couple. Newcomers to the series Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor played their roles as a terrified family to the letter, while also having another side to them that made you feel sorry for them. Finally Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross added some finesse to the cast, with a little comedic relief when the going got tough. But while fantastic alone, the chemistry between everyone was on point and only made things that much better.THE BAD:  Still another horror movie  Dropped some plot points/unexplained  Predictable scare tacticsIt was difficult to find weaknesses in this movie for me, but there are a few things that took away from the movie for me. First is that this is still another horror movie that fits in well with other films of the same genre. We've had some unique horror films in the past, but this one is just a good old fashioned haunted house story. Again this is a picky weakness, but the originality could have used a bit more tweaking in my opinion.A bigger weakness is some of the plot points and presentation in the film. Wait a minute, I just said the plot was good didn't I? Yes it is, but it's not perfect and the Conjuring 2 has a few moments that I was still wanting closure on. I have to be sparing to not spoil anything, but one major detail lacking is why one particular thing has a vendetta against the family. A second limiting plot point is how two of the characters sort of drop out of the story without so much as a blink when they had played a key role in the film. But even with these limitations, the story itself was mostly complete and had a good closure, again I'm grasping at straws here. In addition there were some melodramatic moments that were a bit drawn out and somewhat cheesy to me. Oh well can't be perfect right.Finally the scare tactics are still predictable as ever and didn't really get me with the exception of one time. Camera angles giving away something, music eerily going silent and the occasional getting out of bed to walk in a dark hallway give away the horror from a mile away. But while I'm used to it, other members of the audience were still howling in fear, so again this may be a moot point.THE VERDICT:Overall, The Conjuring 2 is a sequel quite worthy of being called just as good as the original. Wan and his group has shown that a horror movie can have a story and still be scary despite the beliefs of Hollywood. The engaging characters, the well timed suspense, and the integrated scares are surely the best selling points. With few weakness to point out, this reviewer can't help but recommend this one for a theater visit for you horror fans out there.My scores for this movie are:Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genuinely spooky sequel,"The Conjuring 2 is certainly a strong installment into the (hopefully) Conjuring series. Following the further cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the film takes us through one of the most famous hauntings in history - the Enfield Poltergeist.The scares in this film are genuine (no cheap jump scares here!) with a particularly compelling story based on the true events that occurred in Enfield, England during the 70's. The tension that builds up during scenes is quite incredible, the imagery used to portray the demon that stalks the characters is pretty disturbing.Of course, being a movie, The Conjuring 2 takes liberties with the ""true story"", which is especially obvious during the film's climax, but the whole film is competent enough to suspend your disbelief. I walked away and wanted to find out more about the true story, which I recommend you look up (Not for the film's sake but just because it's an interesting story in itself)! Overall, a strong, competent horror sequel with some genuine creepy thrills and a compelling story. Worth a watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as good as the first,"I'm a bit disappointed as I really liked the first movie, but this was not as good. I thought the plot was okay and it did keep me intrigued throughout, but I didn't like the family as much as the family in the first movie. I also thought certain parts of the plot could've been developed more as they seemed a bit rushed. There were not as many horror moments as the first movie and they didn't make me scared or have shivers. Overall I feel this is just one of those typical mediocre horror films which is really disappointing because I liked the first movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A disappointingly long and inaccurate sequel.,"After watching The Conjuring a couple of days ago, my husband and I decided to give 2 a chance and we both regret it. The film was extremely slow-paced with no jump-scares and left us feeling more like we were watching a low intensity thriller than a true horror. This is based on a true story of a London haunting, however, it is desperately inaccurate to the actual story.Compared to the first film this was a flop. More than two hours long and the plot only begins to take shape an hour in. I don't recommend this if you actually want to be scared and the CGI was disappointing too.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very good movie,"Wow, such a scary movie!! Vera Farmiga has to be one of my favorite actresses ever! She cares about her roles so well and she puts such heart to them! I love her in Bates Motel as well. I believe I liked this better than the first one. The first one was so great but I just didn't care for the other characters in the story, but this one I do. I feel so bad for the little girl and the family and I want the Warrens to help her and her family. The whole family is great and you really feel for them. This is such a creepy and scary movie and the special effects in this movie are so great! I will always love the Conjuring movies and after seeing this I do consider them some of my favorite scary movies. The one thing I absolutely love about this movie is that Faith plays a big part in the movie. I am a Christian and it is so refreshing to see a scary movie that has faith as one of the main parts in the movie when so many scary movies don't. I love that faith plays a big role in Ed and Lorraine Warren's marriage and family. This stuff is real and I love that this story is based on real events. It shows that God is real and Satan is real as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary Enough,"The Conjuring 2 was a pretty decent horror movie. As far as horror movies about paranormal activity goes, this is probably the best one. Having said this, its debatable that the first Conjuring was just as good. In my eyes, it wasn't any better than the first one, but not any worse either.Some scenes were really good and scary, such as the first scene, and some were quite predictable. There were more good scenes than bad ones though. WARNING: Do not watch this if it is your first horror movie. I also think if you are going to watch this movie you should be either a 16+ or an experienced horror movie watcher, as you should be for most horror movies.Like in the first movie of The Conjuring, it says it is based on a true story. They only say this to scare you. It is true that there were people who heard strange noises in there homes, but so do we all. Plus, they never found out where the noises were coming from and in this movie there is a lot more than just noises.Considering it is a a movie about paranormal activity , and those movies don't normally scare me because they are unrealistic, this one is fairly scary. It was a good quality movie with good graphics and an obvious amount of effort put in to the making. The only disappointing thing, for me, was the bad story line and especially the ending, which I thought was quite poor and rushed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Maybe not as good as the first Conjuring, but a very very very good sequel indeed !","I loved the first Conjuring for what it was..maybe a bit cliche, but absolutely terrifying. And while The Conjuring 2 is not as good as 1, it is still absolutely terrifying.Let's start off by saying that when i see ""based on a true story"" the movie immediately becomes scarier, even though it's exaggerated most of the times. This movie was scary. James Wan can't do it wrong. He is so good at this game. The direction and camera work were astonishing, just like in the original. The music was very very chilling. The nun is probably one of the scariest things in recent horror movies, cudos for the design of this demon.The characters were believable and the actress that plays Janet was the best of the bunch. The first part of the movie I think was more terrifying. The tension building is done perfect and even the most cliche scenes e.g. The fire truck toy scene and the TV scene were done in a very believable way and freaking amazingly shot and builded.Of course you see that i rate it 8, so there are flaws. I love The Conjuring franchise and 8 is low rate for me, and I'm being generous, but i HATE CGI, and c'mon, but the Crooked man was a joke and darn ridiculous. The main demon (the old man) was not that scary too. I remember Batsheba and my hair stands up. The final 20-30 min were kinda boring and the great tension and build up the movie had just fell flat. There were times where the film looked and sounded like kids film, soo not that good.Nonetheless The Conjuring 2 is a good movie and a great sequel. We can't expect to be scared like part 1, but it pretty much hit the spot. Watch it only in the dark and with headphones to really see it for what it is. If you don't get scared, kudos to you, cause I did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"More of the same, only longer, duller and less frightening","With The Conjuring leaving theatres in 2013 as one of the highest- grossing horror movies of all time, it was of no surprise when director James Wan announced that he was going to helm a sequel, despite claiming to be done with the genre. The first movie was a stylish alternative to the blood-spattered torture porn and CGI- laden exorcism drivel that grace our screens every year (although it featured quite a bit of the latter), and a loving wink to the creepier, more slow-burning supernatural tales of the 1970's. The sequel keeps the 70's aesthetic, but sadly everything else too. And this time it's longer, duller and far less frightening.It's London, 1977, and the Hodgson family move into a ramshackle council house in Enfield and quickly start experiencing paranormal occurrences. Janet (Madison Wolfe), one of two daughters, is tormented by the apparition of an old man, and furniture regularly flies across the room. The events quickly attract the attention of the police, reporters and sceptics, and word eventually travels across the pond to paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson). Lorraine is battling against her own visions of a ghostly nun and the death of her husband, but the couple decide to investigate nonetheless. Soon enough, the Warrens uncover sinister forces at work at the Hodgson's home.The first film was such an astounding success that it would seem that Wan and his four writers were simply terrified to change the formula, while bending to the fact that the audience will no doubt be expecting the ante to be upped significantly. So we are again hampered by a distracting side-story involving a previous investigation by the Warrens,as the film begins in Amityville, a story which the 2005 version starring Ryan Renyolds should have ensured wouldn't litter our screens again for at least two decades. A troubling seance seems to unleash a p****d-off, creepy nun onto Lorraine, and this story thread is shoe-horned into the central plot. Much of the first third is spent switching between continents as the Hodgsons and Warrens go about their business oblivious to the other's existence in a clunky style that doesn't really gel.On the spooky side, it's obvious that Wan has a real knack for sculpting a set-piece, He understands the effect that a creaking floorboard, a dark corner of a room, or just plain silence can have on an audience, but Wan doesn't seem to have the discipline he had first time around. Chilling slow walks across a darkened landing soon give way to jump-scares you can spot a mile away, a spirit with a daft Cockney accent, and most inexplicably, a giant CGI 'Crooked Man'. There's a limit to how many you can be asked to watch a character make the same daft mistakes (why doesn't somebody just turn a light on at least?) or watch the so-called experts deny what is right in front of their eyes despite years of experience. And at 134 minutes, it asks you to do this for a long time. I must be missing something, as The Conjuring 2 has been another huge financial success, but I see little here that I haven't seen a hundred times before.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If there ever was a horror movie deserving an Award....,"I love all the modern horror movies that are written like Conjuring, Annabelle, Sinister, and Insidious.When I saw Conjuring 2 getting 7.9 stars on IMDb, I knew it would be a HUGE mistake for me to wait for it to come out on bluray. You usually only get one chance to see movies like this on the big screen.It's almost unheard of for horror films to get rated that high. Now I know why so many people are loving this film. For me, this surpassed the original. And while it wasn't as scary for me as Insidious 1 or Sinister 1, the story itself is probably the strongest out of them. And there are plenty of great scares, special effects, and a totally original villain.I'm not a big fan of slow burner horror. In fact, I generally try to avoid them because they are not exciting enough for me. At times during the first 30-40 minutes of this film, I got the feeling it was a slow burner. But as the story progressed, I reflected some more, and it's really not a slow burner. It's just such a well written story, that it creates a perfect balance between hardcore horror and slow burner character and plot development.As the IMDb rating confirms, this is one horror film that satisfies most horror movie fans.And If you are the type of person who gets teary eyed at emotionally moving scenes, fortunately for you, you might get a little waterworks going during this film.This movie, as far as horror genre goes, is just perfect. It really deserves a 10/10. I wish people would stop reserving a 10/10 for some Holy Grail of a movie that will never be made. This folks, is what a 10/10 looks like.

The Conjuring 2 (9/10),"Rarely does a big time director of a hit horror movie come back and make a direct sequel to his work. James Wan seems to take up this challenge and it's refreshing that he has the desire to continue his original story with another solid outing. It almost seems that The Conjuring franchise is quickly becoming on the level of the The Exorcist franchise, in terms of story and film quality in the possession genre. Wan's ability to create a frightening film relatable on a human level is a remarkable talent. An initial strength of The Conjuring 2 is how topical the premise is to the actual landscape of paranormal perception. For example, an important part of any real-life exorcism is the doubt that the vast majority of people view towards the subject in question, in this case a girl played by a good upcoming talent, Madison Wolfe. The Conjuring 2 outlines the media scrutiny towards exorcisms very well and also the genuine nature and belief in the paranormal field by strong grounded people. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are simply incredible in these roles, flat-out polished acting chops and never wilt once on screen. A well-written story, strong cast and crew and hair raising scenes and dialogue it's really not that surprising to see The Conjuring 2 crush at the box office as well as critical reviews.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Competent Sequel,"Very rare do you get sufficient sequels, especially if they're in the horror genre. Luckily The Conjuring 2 is everything you really need for a well structured horror movie ( and as a sequel)! The first Conjuring is my favorite horror movie of all time and thanks to James Wan once again, this is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. There are more jump-scares in here which can bother people but thanks to James Wan once again, they are not poorly constructed. My only issue I have is that there is a plot hole that kept me scratching my head and it had to do with the nun (who was disturbing in the best way possible). I just didn't understand what the purpose of having a nun in this sequel was despite being a very ominous presence. Regardless, I loved this movie and it stands out to be a well-done and incredibly scary movie with a very haunting score composed by Joseph Bishara ( who even played Bathsheba in the first film)!

Finally signed up on IMDb because this movie was so good.,"The Conjuring 2 was the best horror movie I've seen in YEARS. The plot was good and scares were well-paced throughout the whole movie. The movie was long...over 2 hours...and I never got bored. Usually, when I got to the movies, I start to get restless after about 90 minutes, but not with The Conjuring.There was no nudity, swearing or gratuitous gore. Not that I'm a prude - I don't mind that stuff - but I know that bothers some people. So if a family with teen-aged kids want to see a really good horror flick, you don't have to be worried about anyone being mortified over nude scenes and/or sex.Also,it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the first ""Conjuring"" movie, so don't let that hold you back.A bunch of people clapped after the movie.

They succeeded in doing that effectively.There was no problem in the acting department. Even the kids did there part very well. I've always been a fan of James Wan. He did miracles here too.

"Jump scares, some good acting, and not much else","It's not the worst thing ever, but it's clear the story doesn't have enough substance to occupy its runtime or a real ending.

By the end I was physically wincing at how cheesy everything was, and it was pretty clear they had no idea how to end it so they just threw some stuff together.The whole thing relies entirely on jump scares for the horror aspect, which is telling in itself. They try to do some visual horror, but it comes off as cheesy and frankly just bad. Atmosphere seems like it wasn't even attempted.The girl is an American faking a British accent, but even to an American ear it sounds all over the place.

This left the audience craving for a sequel, and after the release of the somewhat disappointing spin-off movie called ""Annabelle"", the developers finally released the sequel called ""The Conjuring 2"" this year in 2016.The Conjuring 2 is a very similar movie to the first movie and follows a similar plot line. The movie is set three years after the first Conjuring and once again a family in distress is haunted by an evil spirit in their place of residence in England. The family begs for help for Ed and Lorraine Warren to help them, after it is obvious that the local authorities or the priests could not control the situation. What separates this plot line from the first movie is that this particular job is more personal for Lorraine and Ed Warren.Much like the Conjuring, this movie is based on a real life case, although it has been glorified for theatrical and dramatic reasons to engross the audience. This movie actually comes off as more scary than the first movie, because the spirit or demon in this movie seems far more powerful and dangerous than the one the prequel and there is more focus on the horror sections as compared to the first movie. The first movie did very well due to its dramatic performances from the lead actors and comparatively was not that scary.Performance wise, the cast does really well. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are almost perfect for the role of Lorraine and Ed Warren respectively and give their best effort. Madison Wolfe who plays the possessed girl Janet, also performs very well in her role. Frances O'Connor who plays the role of the mother of the children, also does an excellent job of playing the role of a mother who is traumatized with what has happened. The rest of cast also gives a commendable effort.The sound effects of the movie are done remarkably well as they add to the horror element of the move and intensifies the scary moments in the movie to engage and gripe the audience, and this results in many nerve-racking moments throughout the entire movie. The movie is not heavy on special effects or gimmicks, the special effects are just on point and the creepy background and demonic voices only add to the horror element of the movie.My main problem with the movie would be with the length, the movie goes longer than 2 hours and somewhat drags by the time it reaches the climax. The movie drags on so long is because of the heavy involvement of the media in it, some people in the media were hell bent on proving that the family was faking the incident. This movie could have done without these sections.Overall the Conjuring 2 is a great supernatural horror movie and a great follow up to its predecessor. Nowadays, movie sequels hardly deliver and are more of a cash grab that is not the case with the Conjuring as the movie is arguably almost as good as or even better than the first movie, and in many instances also creepier than the first movie. This is a must watch for anyone who likes to watch horror movie, it would be a mesmerizing experience from the start to the finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not as good as the first, but definitely worth watching","An excellent continuation of the series; watch the first, then this one (assuming the first is something you enjoy..........and it had better be as it is excellent!!! :P).A lot of reviews are including things like 'nothing new' or 'not groundbreaking' etc, but in the sea of crap horror movies the Conjuring movies stand out for doing things *right*. The characters don't do 'stupid things' just to keep the movie going, no cheesy crap to TRY to scare you. With incredibly few exceptions everything is 'purposeful' and nothing takes you out of the movie. You don't wonder 'why didn't they do this?' or 'why did that happen?'I can't begin to count the number of horror movies I've watched, and the vast majority, literally within 5-10 minutes of the movie starting 'force' something to happen to establish the plot, and you never get sucked into the movie. So far both Conjuring movies avoid this and many other common pitfalls of this genre.The only 'negative' is for the whole 'universe' of the Conjuring, the Nun, Annabelle, etc etc, etc, which is the 'spin offs' are almost entirely drivel and have little if any involvement with James Wan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The conjuring 2,"Great horror movie, i got scared in while watching the movie. The story of the movie was not outstanding it was is expected, the scare moments was really scary, Lorraine.character was annoying, the acting in the movie was average, the cnidarian actors was good, i Surprising that many people hate this movie unlike the first, For me, the two films are at the same level, with a slight advantage in the first part.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Loved it!!,"I've been waiting for this movie since the first and i must say i really enjoyed it. It's a classic James Wan film, great direction, acting, and of course, its damn scary.But The Conjuring 2 isn't as scary as the first film, but its almost there. The first film had a little more classic scares(can't forget that hide and clap scene). But its still terrifying and intense. The point is it is very difficult to make sequels of horror movies. But James Wan nails it. The performances too are solid. The character Janet is the star of the movie and Madison Wolfe portrays it beautifully. Incredible acting and you actually feel sympathy for her. Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson continue their epicness over here and more heart is given to their story.The Conjuring is definitely worth watching. James Wan puts his horror tricks to a good use yet again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The captivating magic of horror, intensely terrifying and equally inviting.","With the new cooler scenery and entirely likable victims, The Warrens take on another haunting case in the retro England. This setting serves more than cosmetic, it differentiates itself from previous movie's warmer tone, while also providing a good vehicle to usher the horror. Along with the pristine visual, ""Conjuring 2"" brings back the veteran demonologists and introduces an oddly charming family, especially the little girl in peril.James Wan already had a knack for showing eerie camera angles, this time he adds more movement and less cut to the mix. He knows how to attract or distract the audience's attention in a clever way, the more flowing camera offers more focus and in turns allowing the audience to follow these characters closely as they stumble and frantically run.The family consists of a single mother and her children. From the first five minutes they will appeal to viewers, and it's a significant boon for a horror movie. Madison Wolfe as Janet, the little girl is impressive, she has a good on screen chemistry both with the family and the Warrens. The way she's putting a brave front even though she's exhausted from the abuse, but also creates a bit of skepticism is simply excellent.Her siblings are easily identifiable and equally sympathetic. They have a casual tone, almost crude yet alarmingly funny as well. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine are visiting a known territory. They just fit in the picture, in rather creepy homecoming kind of way. There are residues from the familiar ambiance yet it's presented in more rainy gloomy tone.""Conjuring 2"" is a pleasant gift for horror. It's frightening, yet it never fails to engage, drawing us to stay in the darkly atmosphere and cleverly crafted spectacle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Big jumps, little content","A little surprised this film hag received such glowing reviews.
For me its just a lot of scary, jumpy scenes and more like a collection of short stories than one well formed film.
It relies on jump scares and creepy scenes almost to the clock! You know after 10 minutes your going to get a jumpy AND LOUD scene.
So boring and no real content. The only reason i give it 5 is for a couple of scenes that were well done, but again don't do anything to form another layer of the story.

One of the most frightening supernatural horror films I've seen in the longest.,"I can't remember the last time one of these movies had me jumping out of the seat like I did for this.James Wan proves that hes's a master at this when he's behind the director's seat. I've seen plenty of these movies where he produced them or whatever, but he needed to have his director's hat on for them to be this scary. The experience is so much better.Everything was timed so perfectly. The Ghost were right behind the victims at the right time blended into the shadows to make you scared of what your looking at. A lot of camera tricks that make you think nothing is going on until you look long enough. The sounds echoed just at the perfect time to get your heart pumping. It was slow for just the right amount of time and you don't see the Ghost for just the right amount of time.This film will having you clinging to your seat form the opening frame to the very end.

Silly,"Just silly. The Conjuring 2 is a spectacular example of showing too much and leaving too little to the viewer's imagination. The movie started out very promisingly though, utilizing dark corners and unseen horrors stalking the story's family, only to trip very early on and dispel all the horrifying mystery with bad CGI and ""scary"" apparitions with yellowish eyes and boring, nextdoor-grandpa lines.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Liked this even better than the first,"I don't get scared by horror movies, but I've enjoyed this series because of the emphasis on likable characters, from the family to ghost-investigator couple. These are good stories, with believable relationships between family members who care about each other, not simply a bunch of jump-scares (although there's that too).As good as the first one was, it was narratively a fairly simple & straightforward haunted house story. I'd rate this one, the sequel, a little bit better because, although featuring a similar premise, it actually goes in a few unexpected directions and introduces additional hurdles for our protagonists.This one also clearly has a bigger effects budget, which doesn't hurt. Many of the effects are really quite creative and visually impressive (e.g., a girl slowly transforming into someone else the unfocused/blurry background); but also some that look a bit more silly than scary (e.g., the Crooked Man).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Near perfection for a sequel.,"The Conjuring 2.James Wan is a genius. I'm just going to throw that out there. He builds tension like Alfred Hitchcock. He enjoys the long shot, similar to Martin Scorsese. There was a different style of horror in this film and it seems to have drawn its inspiration from Hideo Nakata's Ringu. By that I mean he plays with the audience. Building up all of this uneasy feeling only to have ultimately, nothing happen. Without feeling empty inside you feel shaken and scarred emotionally. I've said it before that: James Wan does perfect jump scares. To get you when you least expect it and to leave you wanting more when you do expect it. He never gives you the scare when you're expecting it though.Enough fan-boying over James Wan, lets move on to Vera Farmiga who plays again Lorraine Warren, wife to Ed Warren. Vera is super expressive, which is probably why Scorsese picked her up for The Departed.Patrick Wilson must have done something to make James Wan want him in so many of his films. I'm sure I have my research cut out for me to find out why. He's okay at acting, but I believe it's Wan's direction that really helps him out. I say that since I didn't enjoy his acting in Watchmen, Passengers, or Bone Tomahawk, and I loved Bone Tomahawk.Madison Wolfe is going to be a star, oh wait, she already is. You probably just don't recognize her yet. She's phenomenal as the possessed child. Seriously look up the movies she's been in.Because of the wonderful writing in the film. This has made me actually want to go watch House of Wax. One of the films I've avoided because of Paris Hilton. Carey Hayes wrote both Conjuring films and another film I liked called Whiteout.The Conjuring 2 is easily one of the best Horror movies this year, and could be considered one of the best horror sequel. Scream 2 being up there along with Halloween II. Aliens being my favorite horror sequel.Verdict: Watch with someone who scares easily. If the name James Wan doesn't make you want to watch this movie then would it help if I called him a young Stephen King, John Carpenter, or Wes Craven?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The conjuring 2,"First, the all-important question: Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like, jump out of your seat, watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichéd haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does use-well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest moments-like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight-are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Superior, Scarier Film than the Original CONJURING","I don't generally put a whole lot of faith into horror sequels. More often than not, they're just trying to recreate the success of what made the first film popular and fail to bring anything new to the table. So many of them are unapologetic cash-grabs that I often won't pay attention to news that sequels are in the pipeline, even when I enjoyed the first film. I thought INSIDIOUS was a creepy, fun little film but I never once cared about the second chapter and still haven't bothered to see it. Until just a moment ago, I was completely unaware that there has, in fact, been a third chapter and there's a fourth in production. Speaking of James Wan and Patrick Wilson, the first CONJURING was another decent horror. I think it was over-hyped and I might've gone in with my expectations a little high, but I enjoyed it. I had zero interest in the idea of a second film, believing they'd gone the route of every other successful horror with a seemingly never-ending explosion of sequels and spin-offs (for the record, I never saw ANNABELLE and have no desire to do so) but I was caught off-guard when THE CONJURING 2 started receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and in the end I'm glad I did because I'm actually of the opinion that THE CONJURING 2 is superior to the first film. So I suppose it's a rare exception to the rule.THE CONJURING 2 revisits the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two of the most famous paranormal investigators. It opens with a glimpse into their involvement in the investigation of the Amityville house, where Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) conducts a séance and comes face-to-face with some sort of evil spirit in the form of an evil nun. Unlike the first film where their Annabelle investigation was just a cold open to introduce the pair in action, the nun becomes an integral part of THE CONJURING 2, tormenting Lorraine long after finishing at Amityville with visions of Ed's (Patrick Wilson) death. It's her confrontation with the nun and these spectral threats that lead her to swearing off hands-on investigations, and she and Ed decide to limit their activity to seminars and interviews. Meanwhile, in England, a new supernatural occurrence has taken up residence in the home of a single mother and her four children. It's set its sights on the youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), and it's not long before her over-stressed mother takes notice and affirms that this isn't a child's prank. Her family is being tortured nightly and Janet is suffering more and more as the entity breaks her spirit in hopes of possessing her body for its own purposes. The misery of a young child proves too much for Lorraine to turn away, and she and Ed jet off across the Atlantic to verify the poltergeist's existence and hopefully get the Catholic Church involved in exorcising the spirit.The Enfield Poltergeist is apparently one of the more famous Warren investigations. I wasn't familiar with the details of it prior to this movie but I had seen the photographs of Janet's supposed levitations referenced before in my limited readings on the paranormal. Of course, the whole situation has been debunked as an attention-grabbing hoax but, for the purposes of this movie, it's all treated as gospel and it makes for a great movie. I remember the first film leaving me uneasy in a dark house when it ended but THE CONJURING 2 was way more effective at leaving me shaken. James Wan is a talented horror director and one of the few out there that can put together a strong ghost story without the reliance on shocking gore or over-used jump scare tactics. He uses camera lenses, lighting, film score, and the performances of his cast to build a sense of dread in a way that many other modern horror filmmakers wish they could. There's a little bit of questionable CG in the film when the spirit takes the form of a children's nursery rhyme named the Crooked Man but it's a minor misstep and I can forgive its cartoonish appearance because everything else works so well. The first CONJURING seems to have soaked all the hype but CONJURING 2 is the one that gets my respect. Fans of the first one won't be disappointed and, for once, I'm eager for a horror sequel and hope they continue digging through the Warrens' files with a CONJURING 3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definitely NOT a scary movie.,"Wow, this was the worst movie that James Wan has ever made. Talk about long, boring, boring, boring, and no horror shocks or scares at all. This was so bad that in the first place, the Warrens NEVER even were called to investigate this supposedly true haunting in Enfield England in the early 70's. Don't waste the 2 hours and 18 mins. watching this stinker.......come on James, go back to making really scary movies like the first one, or Dead Silence. This was just awful. Went with others who were ready to walk out.If you want the scary version watch the 6 hour docu-series that was just on BBC America last month or so, that was so so so so boring, but at least it was more interesting than this was.

The Conjuring 2 - Movie Review,"There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house.The Conjuring 2 is one of those rare squeals that wasn't terrible, but rather good. The squeal did a lot of things better than first film in terms of character's, the twist and the unpleasant atmosphere. But it's kinda rare that we get a squeal that's just as solid as it's predecessor with plenty of surprises under it's sleeve.I have no idea how James Wan dose it. I seriously don't know how he manages to take the things that I usually can't stand in today's horror and somehow turn it into gold. That's why The Conjuring movies always stand out from the rest of the paranormal demonic movies, because movies like 'The Conjuring' actually have an atmosphere and characters with depth. Even the jump scars are effective and used at appropriate times. James Wan is the only director I can think of that I trust when it comes to directing horror movies, as he understands the genre well. Wan does it again here with tension that builds and the good old sense of death.The acting from everyone was pretty damn solid. Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Frances O'Connor were all great in the movie. Even the littler girl (Madison Wolfe) was really good, as she actually looked terrified and it was a very convincing performance, even for a child actor in a horror movie.What really surprised me about ""The Conjuring 2"" is that I actually did care for the character's. I mean, compared to some horror flicks that are somewhat similar to this, but with the character's that are forgettable and so boring to watch on screen. Luckily this movie had character's with emotional weight to them.The camera work, the score and the cinematography are the highlights of this film. It also takes it's time and uses different ways to scare or spook you. It may not impress a lot of people, but I do admire the film markers for taking a risk like that.Enfield haunting case has been a hot topic for years now with people debating if it's a hoax or not. And while the ""based on a true story"" may be bullsh*t (or just any movie that uses that headline for attention), I'm just so use to it now that it's getting numb. A lot people complained that this was too Hollywood or it was not accurate to the original story. I have seen plenty of documentary's and stories about the Enfield haunting case, and it's so BORING. I literally found nothing interesting about it and all the evidence for the paranormal haunting seemed a bit fake. I'm so glad this movie wasn't accurate to the original case that may or may not be real. The film markers took something with it and told a different story with events that's very loosely based on an actual case.The problems that I had with this movie (which is not a lot) is the use of CG for scenes involving the Crooked Man. It took me out of the movie and it kinda took away the terror from the Crooked Man character that Wan beautifully created. And yes, Javier Botet (who is about 6' 6¾) plays the Crooked Man, but the CG is so noticeable when he starts jumping around or growing tall to scare the little girl that he's haunting. I think practical effect's would have been so much better and scarier.Overall rating: The Conjuring 2 is a solid squeal that's way better then the avenge horror squeal. It takes your expectations and turns it completely around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
better than before,"I think The Conjuring 2 is better than the first movie. It is scarier,more intense and has more of those ""pls don't be there"" moments.Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and especially Lauren Esposito did a wonderful job, you can really feel the fear and tightness in Margret's psyche. Maybe one of the jump scares here and there could be omitted. And James Wan could have also leave off some horror cliché moments, but all in all The Conjuring 2 is very high above average with some moments and scares you can expect and some pictures and scenes you have seen before but probably not that that well done. Especially the evil and demonic side is very well done and manifested.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
We want love in horror genre!..,"Modern day compositions seem to lack the element of refinement with patience... Everything is so fast that in a couple of years a good number of practices and ways will be altered with speed for the sake of non-persistent productions. And the horror genre, in the field of cinema, has been exposed to this tendency the most.On the other hand, this movie tries to whip off the horror genre. Not because of its strong originality, but because of its devoutness in cinematography, screenplay, and acting.Not only the lead actors are of the best quality, especially Ms. Vera Farmiga, but the rest of the actors helped it seem like the story actually ""was"" taking place when we see it.The scenes were prepared carefully along with the unvarnished, austere movements and shots of the camera.The screenplay was originally derived from a true story, yeah. But it is not the sole reason behind the success. In fact, the writers changed it a lot to the point that it had cooperativeness, helpfulness and love that was missing from the original story at the time of which the people and the media treated the Hodgson family as zoo animals.Okay. Time for truth...Every horror fan knows that a good horror movie should scare us really well and be of originality doing it. But if we look at randomly selected 100 movies, we were to see that most of them chooses a way that contains emetic amount of blood, stupid decisions, musical pieces that were composed rather by chance, the showing up of the killer out of thin air irrationally when you least expect it, the appearance of the killer / the monster after the character(s) cuts in the frame and thereafter steps aside, etc... We could really go on...But this one kept as far away from these commonplaces as possible. Of course it is not a huge success for that matter. But their centering the story not around the horror but around love is the real achievement of this movie.For I would not find anyone that won't notice the love between the lead characters and their compassion towards people (in need). That is what the world needs. Yep!I will give this movie a ""8,2"". Yes. Love.Hey Mr. Patrick Wilson! Hey Ms. Vera Farmiga!..

Great Sequel,"In a genre where franchises are milked, it was inevitable that The Conjuring would get a sequel. Luckily, director James Wan, a master of his craft, returns to helm the movie. The result is something exceptionally rare for this genre - a sequel that is actually better than its predecessor. It continues with the Warren files and covers the Enfield Poltergeist, which occurred in London in the late 1970s. While it's not exactly an original idea, it does everything so well that it's completely excused. The success of Conjuring 2, much like its predecessor, is driven by the bond formed between the Warrens and the Hodgsons. This is something different from most horror movies, which are driven solely by the need to scare. The Warrens and Hodgsons are both characters given a full treatment, and by the time the movie ends a real trust forms between them. Not too many horror movies do that as well as this.The movie does have excellent scary moments in it. It did introduce Valek, the demon that takes the form of the nun, which is the main villain of the spin-off The Nun. In Conjuring 2, the nun's few scenes are some of the best, with the first being one of the best jumpscares in any horror film. The Crooked Man, despite having very little screen time, was awesome. The movie's dark atmosphere is also very well done. The environments, the lighting, the soundtrack, are all great. One thing that the Conjuring movies do, much like The Exorcist before them, is the light in the darkness, the holy that vanquishes the unholy. That is why Valek takes on the form of a nun, to be a corruption of the holy things the Warrens hold dear. The movie fully embraces this and handles it quite well. The Conjuring 2 is one of the best horror sequels ever made. (It's certainly better than Conjuring 3, that's for certain)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"As scary,brilliant and original as the first film!","When I heard about the conjuring 2 I didn't know what to think,I thought it would be good and I thought it wouldn't but when I went to see it with my father as a sort of present as he left to go to England for work,the first 30 minutes was so creepy,I knew I'd like it and after about 150 minites..I loved it. This film was a lot scarier than the first movie,the jump scares were more scarier although some were a bit predictable. I loved the acting like the first film and I just have one thing to get out of the way that I didn't like about it...CGI. This film had really bad effects but that doesn't mean it was terrible and I didn't think about it till my dad said it had a lot of bad effects and I thought that was what was annoying about the film but I still loved it like the first film. The conjuring 2:the Enfield poltergeist is a really brilliant horror film starring Patrick Wilson,Vera Farmigia and Bonnie Aaron's and Frances O'Conor. 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Conjuring and Conjuring 2: First Horror Movies I've Ever Liked,"Although I'm an avid movie-watcher, horror has never been one of my favorite genres. I've found most horror films to be badly written and directed with poor acting, and ultimately unsatisfying and not at all enjoyable.However, both The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are the exception. The acting is excellent: Vera Farmiga is exemplary in both movies, and the rest of the cast perform very well, especially in The Conjuring 2. The story isn't shallow and intended only to frighten as in most horror films, it's deeper and much more carefully written, as if more intelligent thought has been put into creating the dialogue.Although I liked both, Conjuring 2 was for me an even better movie than the first, which is not the case with most sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So Sad that People Like this,"First one hated and regretting seeing it, then I see the sequel knowing that the first one sucked, this one has to, too. It was exactly as I thought. First one was considered R rated for scares alone, and there was not one scary part in it. Like a TV-14 movie from TV got put on the big screen.As for the first paragraph about this one, is the same. No difference on rating. Must of been a teenager hired to preview the movie before released to get the rating for it. Now, they rated R, but really should be TV-14 rating.People actually got scared off these two movies? Annabelle was spin off the first and was not even scary, and had more gore than both of these two together and did not get scary. What is wrong with directors and producers now a days?Both Sinister movies was hell of a lot better than all Annabelle's and The Conjuring movies. They are not making any more sequels to the Sinister movies. That is a shame. I rather see many, many more sequels of Sinister movies, than this crap.These two movies put shame to the R ratings. Blasphemy is what this is. No recommendation as for horror movies to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sequel of amazing horror,"I've watched a lot of horror movies and time and time again not many can be considered 'good', 'amazing'. When I said a lot, I mean I've scoured the internet for any horror movie that is practically watchable and not cheaply made ranging from American ones to Korean, Singaporean, Indonesian, Thai, Japanese, Malay, French, Australian and Chinese. Indie horrors would be my best choice until James Wan smartly came up with The Conjuring. For a sequel, I still couldn't believe how it blew my mind. The moment the movie started, I was already assaulted by various well played scares and darkly eerie scenes. The way Wan framed his shots were great. Not only giving the audience POVs but extreme close ups that brings us into their world as if we were there, watching it unfold. There were lots of build ups throughout the movie but... the ending was rather rushed. Would have loved to see a little longer and more climatic end. Kudos to the portrayal on Ed & Lorraine's romance which Patrick and Vera played wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case - When the Demon Sits Down and Eats the Whole Meal,"The Warrens are like the Rolling Stones of the paranormal: they're always on tour, always delivering hits, and seemingly ageless. This time, they land in Enfield, a London suburb where even the bricks look haunted. Called in to handle a chunky poltergeist, things quickly spiral into supernatural chaos. A possessed kid, furniture doing the cha-cha, and a demon that makes Freddy Krueger look like a volunteer at an animal shelter. Enfield? It's the Warren's ""final boss"" level.Thought nuns were just for singing in Sister Act? Think again. This is Sister Act meets Apocalypse Now. The demonic nun is so terrifying she deserves her own movie (and bam-spin-off delivered). Every time this horror in a habit shows up, you'll want to hide under your bed. And that opening scene with the cursed painting? Thanks for the sleepless nights, James Wan.The film walks a tightrope between reality and hoax, keeping you guessing for two hours. Is Janet really possessed, or is she just a teenager with a subscription to bad decisions? Wan plays this balancing act brilliantly for most of the film, keeping the suspense taut. But then he flips the switch to full-on fantasy by the end, with some scenes teetering on the edge of absurdity. The demon going Super Saiyan in front of the Warrens? Yeah, we could've done without that.The cinematography is pure gold. Shadow play, dim lighting, and that sticky atmosphere that makes you check if your crucifix is still on the wall. The cinematographer is the real MVP here. The sets? Gorgeous. Even the Hodgsons' wallpaper looks possessed.James Wan is like the Tarantino of horror-every shot is a reference. Fans of the spin-offs and the first Conjuring will get their fill of ""Oh, I saw that in Annabelle!"", or ""Hey, that's the grimoire from The Nun!"" And the end credits, with real photos from the Enfield case and those eerie audio recordings? Chef's kiss. Thanks for the masterclass in horror, James.Conjuring 2 isn't perfect. It drags at times, and the finale goes a bit overboard with the fantasy. But damn, it's effective. Scary, polished, and carried by a stellar lead duo. If you love horror with a touch of British class and demons that steal the spotlight, this is for you. Just remember to keep the lights on afterward.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

New soup on watered down broth...,"As sequels go, then ""The Conjuring 2"" seems to fall into the same trap as many other movies do, and it didn't manage to surpass or live up to the first movie in the franchise.That being said, don't get me wrong here. I am not saying that ""The Conjuring 2"" is a bad movie, it just didn't manage to reach the same level of intensity or be as scary as the first movie did. It does still have some impressive moments here and there.The story is focusing on the actual 1970's Enfield haunting phenomena that revolved around the Hodgson family. However, ""The Conjuring 2"" is not the first movie to portray these disturbing events. And it did an adequate job in doing so, perhaps mostly because of the aid of the actors and actresses portraying the various characters. Storywise, then ""The Conjuring 2"" didn't bring anything new to the table.Patrick Wilson really carries this movie quite nicely with his performance and portrayal of the Ed Warren character. And while he is not the one that the movie revolves around, he still steals the show to the point where he is the focal point.The effects in ""The Conjuring 2"" were quite good, as they have to be in a ghost movie. A ghost or haunting movie without proper effects is an immediate killer to the movie. I will say that the special effects team here really did a good job, especially since the effects were doing what they were intended to do, and doing so without being flashy enough to steal away focus from the movie.I was already familiar with the Enfield haunting story, so there was little new here. But still, director James Wan did manage to handle the story nicely.As with the first movie, then it was nice to revisit the cellar of the Warren home. There are so many interesting pieces to be seen there, and a myriad of possible stories to be told on the screen.While ""The Conjuring 2"" is not a groundbreaking movie, it is still enjoyable and entertaining enough for what it was. Just don't expect to be blown away. A fair enough continuation of the first movie, albeit it hardly did the first movie much justice.My rating of ""The Conjuring 2"" is a mediocre five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This isn't as good as the first film but still a great addition to the horror genre,"Conjuring 2 (2016) is a movie I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a family that recently moved into a new house and is quickly plagued by spirits within the house. As the spirits ruin their lives the local church escalates the concern and the Warrens are called in to see if the haunting is real. There are various elements that appear real and some that appear to be fake. The Warrens will need to first determine if the haunts are legit then see if they can save the family.This movie is directed by James Wan (Dead Silence) and stars Vera Farmiga (The Departed), Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy), Madison Wolfe (I Kill Giants), Frances O'Connor (AI), Simon McBurney (The Last King of Scotland) and Maria Doyle Kennedy (The Tudors).The Amityville opening and background story was a great way to start this film. The old man as the primary spirit was awesome and the Nun and crooked man were great subplots. The nun painting was great overall. The background music used to create intensity is always brilliantly selected and utilized in a Wan picture. The teepee was also a menacing aspect to the storyline. Wan really does a great job of creating the elements for a great horror film filled with various types of scares from errie, to creepy to jump scares, you'll get them all in here.Overall this isn't as good as the first film but still a great addition to the horror genre. I'd score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A sequel better than the original,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but this is a better film than the first one in almost all the aspects.You notice a bigger budget, but Wan was also very creative in how to create tension in almost every scene. The first act here is totally different, faster and stronger, not afraid to take some risks and surprising us at every corner. It's scarier than the first and I think the English environment with neighbours, instead of the usual house in the middle of nowhere, gave it a very different and realistic vibe.While the first is a well executed but a bit formulaic and not scary movie, this one is much more innovative (even in the way ""the monsters"" show to the family) and scarier, keeping the same production values (in fact, I think Wan use much better the camera here, with a better sense of urgence and creating suspense in a perfect way in some specific scenes).",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Top Notch Supernatural Horror - Brilliant!!!,"There's something terrifying in Enfield, and it's not bleach-blond tarts tottering around in heels and short skirts. First class spookiness that almost had me crying for my mummy. Jumps and scares a-plenty. A well written script and some fine acting lubricated the swallowing of the ""true story"". Thankfully, the film provided a satisfying ending that will enable you to sleep after watching, albeit with the lights on. Real life events were less conclusive. The only disappointments were the squalid living conditions of the family and the casting of an American girl as Janet. Come on Yanks, we Brits know how to clean.

Demonstrates the true essence of horror movies!,"One of the greatest horror movies I have ever watched. Still cannot decide which part is better, first or this one. If you are true horror fan, you will enjoy every minute of 2 hours! Excellent and convincing story in the background (not something often seen in the horror movies), perfect acting followed by nicely developed characters and lots, but really lots of scary scenes. I have a feeling that scary scenes are brought to the new, higher level. While watching the movie, there is almost no space where you can relax a bit and feel no tension at all. Even during the daylight scenes you don't feel safe in your seat! Something rarely seen in the horror movies. I just like the way how shoots are made and how camera moves. Everything seems so natural, almost like you are participating in the movie. Don't be fooled that you will feel more safe and not so frighten if you go to cinema in company, it doesn't help at all..Really, absolute horror classic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan never disappoints !,"Saw this last night. Absolute masterpiece in horror genre.It is better and different than the first Conjuring.The story is so detailed and nicely done. The character development for the characters in the movie is well done. The cinematography by James Wan and his team is so beautifully. The shots and the camera movement stood out for me and I loved it. The acting done by everyone is fantastic. They are all really talented, no doubt. The scares are awesome, some are predictable, some are not. So many new things and creativity in this movie. The soundtrack is creepy and kinda Insidious-y which I loved a lot. The twist in the end and the climax was so well -edited, it was pure satisfaction. Overall, a fantastic horror movie. I can't find any flaws in this film. James Wan didn't disappoint.

A movie that outdoes the original...,"When The Conjuring first came out in 2013, it broke records for a an original horror movie based on real life events.

ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING! Even BETTER than the First!,"It's very rare that a horror sequel outdoes its original, and The Conjuring 2 is one of those sequels. Don't get me wrong; The Conjuring (2013) was very scary with quality horror, great acting, and a great plot. But The Conjuring 2 surpasses the story line, overall quality, acting, and most importantly the terror. I'm a big fan of paranormal/horror films, especially those based on a true story and actual events. I loved The Conjuring (2013) so I just had to see The Conjuring 2. And let me tell you...I was blown away (and I had to keep the lights on in every room after watching it).The film starts out with Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) conducting a seance at the Amityville house in 1977. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, astral projects and relives the horrific events - and comes face-to-face with a terrifying, demonic nun (who'll play a bigger role later on in the film). Meanwhile an equally- diabolic haunting is taking place in Enfield, England, where 11-year-old Janet Hodgson is being tormented by a ghost. Ed and Lorraine come to the rescue and things get frightening from there!The first thing I must greatly compliment about this movie is the acting (especially Vera Farmiga's). I was very impressed at how much the cast looked so much like the original people and investigators involved. Each actor and actress was very passionate about their roles and they made things pretty intense - sometimes even emotional. I also loved the realistic visual effects that delivered the activity and scares. The sound editing was brilliant, the soundtrack was eerie and bone-chilling, and the costume design was great (I'm including the costume design because the actors wore what the original persons did during the investigations, making it all the more authentic).Overall, The Conjuring 2 possesses a very eerie, creepy, haunting feeling throughout the film which is rare in today's world of horror movies. It makes you feel tense and uneasy during AND after watching it, as if something dark and inhuman is watching you. I had a hard time sleeping the night I watched it, which almost never happens to me as a die-hard Horror fan. You can tell director James Wan put a ton of time and quality in the making of this one, and recreating the horrific events that happened to Janet Hodgson in 1977.FIVE STARS and 10/10! I highly recommend it! I can't wait for The Conjuring 3 as well as the confirmed spin-offs (""The Nun"" and ""The Crooked Man"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Visionary director James Wan instills fear of all types in this superior sequel,"Now, I must say I was reluctant to see this movie, because I obviously get scared by horror movies (dur) and the only sessions were at 9:40pm every night... But, I knew my audience would want it, and so I gritted my teeth, and stepped into the movie theater. I hope you guys know the sacrifices I make for you!But I walked out of the theater very impressed. I don't have LOADS of horror movie experience, but what I do know is that most of them have one priority only- to scare the audience. While this was definitely present in this movie, I was pleasantly surprised at how layered and intricate the plot and characters were. Australia's own James Wan directed this movie and I must give a standing ovation for the job he did here. Bravo. I don't think I trust many other horror directors aside from him. The cinematography of this film was genius and flawlessly executed, and was probably the scariest part of the movie! The use of wide shots and a slowly panning camera back and forth from a source of horror was brilliant! And this was fantastically complimented by the set design, extensive use of props, and the eerie and enigmatic lighting. Roughly half the time something would emerge from the darkness or from behind the props, while the other half of the time, nothing would happen, but the anticipation was what scared viewers. I would not be surprised if Wan or the cinematography team were nominated for an Oscar. Look out for the scene where Janet is being interviewed by Ed Warren- the camera-work really shines there, you'll know what I mean.And that wasn't the only source of fright for viewers. It just didn't stop throughout almost the entire movie. By the end, however, it kind of lost its initial effect. Maybe I just became more acclimatized to it. And of course I have to address the biggest cliché plot convenience in all horror films- walking TOWARDS the source of the horror. Why? Just why? There was one scene however when an entire family, after being scared enough, sprinted out of their house to the neighbors next door. I thought 'that was the most sensible thing anyone has done in a horror movie'. Anyway, to the plot! I did like the spin they put on that the whole thing could be a hoax concocted by a bored girl (which was an element present in the true story of this case), and exploring that from different perspectives. It's something that the world deals with all the time- skepticism. And that element was used deftly in a plot twist that invigorated the story line when it needed it most. For those wondering, the actual events of this case are dramatized significantly to make the finished product. I've seen the real evidence, and I'm still not convinced that any of it was real. The poignant tone at the end of the Conjuring movies is something that I both hate and like at the same time. Yes, it gives the franchise some originality, brings some themes to the table, and makes the plot more intricate, but at the end of the day, this is a HORROR MOVIE. I want to walk out of the cinema shaking, but the 'and they lived happily ever after' takes some of that away. That's where I feel a franchise like Paranormal Activity trumps The Conjuring.The cast has familiar faces Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, with new guys Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito, Benjamin Haigh, Patrick McAuley, Simon McBurney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and Simon Delaney among others. Not many horror films have names you might recognize. Farmiga's and Wolfe's performances were the stand-outs in this movie, with the ensemble cast performing valiantly as well. Wilson and his character were a bit too fearless for me. I loved Wilson and Farmiga's cute chemistry. It was a nice, light element to bring to the table. Speaking of, genres included action, horror, thriller, mystery, and romance, while themes were family, unity, incredulity, and the media. The costuming and production value was done well, and special effects were fine except for the 'Crooked man' sequence (contained animation)- not sure I liked that very much...The running time was pretty long, but it felt like a journey because of the character development and how I was engaged. The soundtrack and sound editing was effective in the way it was intelligently used, and a sequel is definitely possible- the Warrens have a fair amount of source material to draw from. You don't need to have seen the original or Annabelle to enjoy this one, but you will have a greater appreciation of it if you have.To conclude, it could be improved through less of a happy ending- even if its just one shot at the end or the possibility of a reawakening force, and more thriller elements- in terms of the villains credibility- to really solidify the fear in the audience. But, I judge a good movie on how it stimulates emotions, and there were definitely some emotions brewing inside me!For more reviews like this; see chrisbreviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horror done right,"I do not understand why so many have trouble making a horror movie now a day. All you have to do is just use James Wan's creative genius as a guideline and you should, in Theory, have horror gold. Let me start off by stating that I thought the first conjuring was one of the scariest movies I have seen In a loooooong time, and put together so brilliantly, that when I heard James Wan was going to be putting out a sequel I knew we would be getting another horror masterpiece. The Conjuring 2 much like the first one has Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help out a family who have encountered a demonic spirit. Although the concept of the story, similar to the first, it is all the little things and over all plot that made this sequel really stand out. The way James Wan builds up the story and does not kill you with cheesy jump scares, but instead pure suspense is something that a lot of writers and directors releasing horror films seem to miss. Wan builds a story taking events from the real Enfield haunting, stretching things at times for sure, but at the end puts together a movie that will leave you with chills. I am a horror fanatic, and I appreciate how cold the scenes feel at times, how bone chilling the darkness can be, and how simple sound effects can make ones skin crawl. Aside from the horror aspect there are scenes that get you attached to the Warrens all over again. This is not your typical horror film where the story is replaced with scares, and gore. We have a story, we have suspense, we have a connection with the characters, and even some comic relief in places. The only warning I have coming into this movie is that if you really want to sit there and enjoy it, wait for the crowds to die down. So many people come into these horror films the first week in groups it seems like, and laugh / talk after every scare. I myself will be seeing this a second time in a couple weeks once the hype dies down, that way I can really take everything in that this movie had to offer. Overall a must see as James Wan has done it once again. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Absolutely fantastic horror!,"This movie is absolutely excellent, I enjoyed every minute of it. Seen it 2 times in the cinemas.I don't know what it is exactly that James Wan manage to do to keep the scare factor at max all the time, maybe he simply knows what's truly scary and not?The sound design is extremely good and I do think it plays a huge role in terms of the scare factor. I also love how the movie delivers truly aggressive horror where the main characters either have to chose fight or flight.I'd say this is one of the best horror movies I've seen ever. I also think this movie is even better than the first one. I would absolutely recommend this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Though it's never quite as chilling as its predecessor, ""The Conjuring 2"" excels nonetheless thanks to James Wan's grand visuals and a surprisingly heartwarming story.","Whodathunk that one of the biggest highlights of director James Wan's stellar sequel ""The Conjuring 2"" was not one of the dreaded jumps that the movie relishes in... nor the creaking of a doorway in the distance... nor the eerie music that chills you to the bone... but rather, a pleasant little scene where a man tries to bring a little happiness and joy to a family by plucking the strings of a guitar and singing ""I Can't Help Falling in Love with You"" with a smirking Elvis impression?Yes, it may almost seem counter-intuitive, but the thing that's so admirable about ""The Conjuring 2"" is that it sees past the clichés and tropes of the standard horror sequel, and instead places its main focus first and foremost on creating a grounded scenario that audiences can identify with and populating its story with loving and thoughtful characters that you can't help but root for, while the horror elements frequently take a back seat.Based on yet another of the Warren's case files (though obviously heavily exaggerated and embellished for the sake of drama... this ain't a documentary), the film moves the focus to London, taking inspiration from the famous and infamous Enfield Poltergiest case. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren must help a distraught mother (Frances O'Connor) who is struggling with a deranged, seemingly supernatural force that threatens to tear her and her children apart- in particular young daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe), who seems to be this dark force's main target... However, the growing media firestorm surrounding the case, questions of whether or not Janet is faking the haunting, and a recurring premonition of Ed's death may prove that this case could be too much for the famed supernatural investigators...A huge part of the appeal of the original film was the absolutely magical chemistry between stars Wilson and Farmiga, and this is only improved upon in the sequel. The duo really do light up the screen together, creating a wonderful set of leads for the audience to follow. Wolfe is a revelation of a child actress, and is both adorable and highly convincing in her role. O'Connor gives a satisfying and compelling turn as a mother in desperate need. And supporting roles by the likes of Simon McBurney and Franka Potente are well cast and deliver good, memorable performances.Director James Wan excels here. Quickly becoming one of the finest filmmakers working in the world of horror today, Wan is an expert at delivering the goods. His expert sense of atmosphere and complex camera-work work wonders at building a sense of all encompassing dread that helps the horror to really hit home. But he's also grown quite a bit with the other material, having learned and honed his skills at telling thoughtful and sensitive scenes that help to develop the characters and story in such a delightful way. I've been a fan of his since way back when the original ""Saw"" hit theaters, and I'm glad I've stuck with his work. It's been a pleasure to see him grow and mature as a storyteller over the past twelve years and I look forward to his next projects.The script by Wan, Chad Hayes, Carey W. Hayes and David Leslie Johnson is just a blast of pure fun. The four writers really have a good grasp on structure, pacing and balance. It's carefully crafted to not only give many strong punctuation's of scares and thrills, but to expertly develop the characters. As I mentioned above, even to points where the horror elements often take a backseat. But I didn't mind. In creating such a delightful setting and characters, it makes the horror hit harder. The group also really knows how to create memorable foes, with the new demonic forces at play being absolutely bone-chilling in their execution.However, despite the gushing, I must also address a few of the film's minor faults. To start, even though the horror elements at play do generally work... it never quite comes off as chilling or as frightening as the original. It's almost more intriguing and interesting than it is scary. I also think that there were a few scares early on that do fall flat, feeling like wasted screen time that could have been spent elsewhere. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't notice the film's overlong runtime a bit. It could have used a bit more refining.But those faults being said, ""The Conjuring 2"" is still a completely enthralling and engrossing thriller. Not only a solid sequel, but just a darned fine movie in its own right. Another win for director James Wan. Here's to hoping we get a ""Conjuring 3"" that continues to maintain the high quality of the previous installments!I give it a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well done and worthy of positive reviews...director James Wan,"Absorbing, and well crafted horror film. If you looked into the 'real' story over the years, with great care, director James Wan touches on soooo much of the already documented research: The way the kids look/behave, Maurice the researcher, the constables, the way the townhouse is layed out and it's decaying condition - almost exactly like its event from the 1970s. Then, yes, he adds amped-up effects and situations (that didn't happen) to make a fun film and very aggressive.Wan employs excellent, alluring cinematography with the situations, careful shadows, and kinetic editing that cares about his characters & sets up the wicked scares; you must watch this in widescreen or you miss a lot. Wan also takes his time, and some may complain about a few slow spots, but I enjoyed it. A strong film predominately b/c of the talented James Wan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"return to greatness, for real","I've avoided new horror films for a few years now, considering they all seem to cater to young audiences with no ability to concentrate or follow a plot. Recently however I've been baffled by a few new comers, such as the Conjuring and its sequel.Not only is this film scary, it's beautifully shot, and the set dressing is quite simply astonishing. Some of the gags come a bit out of nowhere, but overall the atmosphere is great. The film has an attention to detail you just don't see very often.The con artists whose adventures this series is based on have a long list of other exploits, and I really hope there will be a whole slew of films like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My favorite of the Conjuring series,"It doesn't happen often and most likely the second is not as good as the first. This however is an exception. It is better than the first in the Conjuring series in my opinion.I only have one complaint. And that is that this movie (unlike all the rest) is not available in the 4K format! What a crime!Lots of atmosphere. I love the time that it was set in. Have watched it many many times as it is very re-watchable. In my opinion, very few movies compare to it in terms of re-watchability. We usually watch this movie at least once per year.I like the third in the Conjuring series as well. The more I watch it, the more I like it. The second is still my favorite though.Hope you will like it as much! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Almost Too Scary,Watch this alone in the dark - if you dare. Grabs you and the beginning and keeps your adrenaline going the entire movie - almost too intense.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Summon with all your might,"Hello and do not be tired of serving all viewers of the style of fearIt was excellent, it had no flaws, neither in the characterization, nor in the special effect, nor in the story.

beating expectation and breakthrough elements!,"I saw conjuring 1 back in 2013. Up until that point, I had yet to see any good American horror films (Asian ones are the best for you ghost movie fans). The conjuring 1 was a difference maker and completely changed my attitude towards American horror films.Fast forward 3 years, I was extremely excited when the Conjuring 2 was about to release, and I had very high expectations. The movie smashed my expectation in every way, which is amazing in itself. There were many good things about the film, however, one thing stood out:This is the only ghost movie I remember, and I have seen many as a big fan of the genre since I was before 10, which featured a male ghost that is not a 10 year old boy, and he was scary. Up until now I thought only little boys and women can be ghosts.Other than that, the plot featured a very good twist at the end, which I will not spoil.Great movie! If you are a horror movie film fan, this is a must see. If you are curious about the genre, this is still a must-see. There are many bad movies in this genre (Just look at the average rating of most movies), and this one is one-of-a-kind. I hope there will be a Conjuring 3 sometime in the near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pleasantly surprised!,"Usually not a fan of sequels, but this one really surprised me! It was nice and long (just over 2 hours) which is rare for a horror film. This allowed for much better character development than the first one IMO. There were also some really well done scares and beautifully shot scenes in general. One of my favorite scenes involved a creepy painting (without giving too much away) that had me on edge the whole time. Acting was top notch - especially the girl who played Janet. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have great chemistry as well. If you liked the first one I highly recommend checking this one out as you won't be disappointed. I think I may have even liked it better than the first - which is something I never thought I'd hear myself say!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best movie in horror genre i have seen,"I thought it will be a slow start as it did it first part and later engage audience with the actual story, but woooww... i was at the edge of the seat from the minute go till the end. Well directed, well acted and very well scared :D .No blood shed,nothing brutal or violent but sheer thrill and suspense as to how it would turn out in the end along with good spine chilling scary scenes and BGM good enough to keep you at the edge.A kind of movie that wont scare anyone when going to sleep :PPossibly the best horror movie i have seen. Ready to be scared with Conjuring 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterpiece in Horror,"Finally a real horror in a long time! after ""The Conjuring"". This is the way scary movies has to be made. Suspense and fear is created by great cinematography mix with music.This is made up with many top grade special effects to create horror. I surely hope that this movie raise to top of horror genre.Go see it, you will not regret about that! (Don't forget to watch first one)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Disappointed,"After enjoying the first installment I was expecting to be let down with the sequel of the conjuring; lets face it that's usually the case. However I loved every minute of The Conjuring 2 from the get go. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson really held this movie together; the chemistry between them was believable and the acting superb. I'm from the UK and at an age where I remember the story causing hype in the media. I've seen the documentary's and other versions of this story in screen plays, but they always fell short of being authentic, especially with the set and backdrop of the era. However The Conjuring 2 does not fail to add every detail by showing just how decrepit and humble life on welfare was in London during this time. I love a good ghost story and this movie did not disappoint. I really hope there will be another Conjuring movie in the future, with the same leading actors. This movie is now in my top 3 scary movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An outstanding film with  fascinated story line.,"WOW, Jameswan plotted this remarkable story according to his plan.what an outstanding sound effects along with horrifying scenes. While talking about story line, story was superb and fascinated. Ed and Lorraine made this film outstanding and Demon Nun was one of the most elagantly horrified character i have ever had watch. soundtracks were great which were according to their time. I must say This is the most scariest movie which was brought in after conjuring.James Wans trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great movie by itself,"Positives: It is an independent movie from the first one, you can watch this without watching the other one; it has a lot of coherent content, well put altogether - you don't feel like it wastes time; for once the characters behave like you'd expect them to in a paranormal situation (probably because the movie takes inspiration from real life); the child actors were pretty good, which is unusual.Negatives: There was one scene in which the chronological sequence didn't make total sense; there was a bit of an ex machina that could've been resolved in a better way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Movie!,"Wow! It was an amazing movie! I have to be honest, it's little to none the amount of horror/scary movies I've seen. The Conjuring 1 wasn't all too scary for me, which was a novelty, although it had an amazing story line and more than enough suspense, but this one?! Oh Jesus! It got me jumping in my chair super scared, my glasses even flew 2 rounds of chairs towards the front (which I'm not proud to say). So much suspense, such amazing actors, really really good.Since the beginning they catch your attention, and they didn't loose it. The demon in this movie is a genius. And the movie keeps everyone fooled for a while. Oh, and the Elvis impersonation we get? (you have no idea what I'm talking about :P ) Lovely! Go and watch it! ;)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An effective, awesome, horror sequel that doesn't really rely on scares.",This movie is one of my favorite horror films. The fact that both conjuring films are real makes it feel like you in the movie. It seems like nothing in the movie is CGI everything feels real. The nun amazing and terrifying and the fact that we all thought bill was the person haunting the place is awesome.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Welcome To Spooky Street : Population 2!,"Unfortunately a lot of sequels to successful horror movies tend to suck. This is not one of them. This is a really good horror movie. At times it is absolutely terrifying. I really enjoyed it. After having watched both I would have to say that I think I slightly prefer the first movie overall (I'm not exactly sure why) but that this one is actually even more scary. These movies do borrow a lot from other classic movies, but they do such a good job of putting it all together that I don't mind at all. There is some stuff that reminds me of The Exorcist or The Shining, but it is definitely its own new thing. Another classic horror movie. The people who made this really know how it all should be done. Good show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Suspense Movie,I am Really happy to watch this movie. Amazing !! Try to watch these type of movies as many as times.....,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A fine follow up,I really enjoyed the first one so I was a bit reluctant after reading some of the negative reviews on this site I think the characters in the first one were a bit more likable other than that this one was every bit as good I can only assume that the negative reviews people who are nothing short of ignorant If you saw the first one you def need to see this one You wont be disappointed I've heard rumors of a 3rd one so hopefully that happens The only thing that I was disappointed at (and it's minor)was that Lorraine had to come up with a name (I wont say name of what or its a spoiler) and I've heard that name quite a few other times in different movies All in all though a fine movie and am glad I finally had a chance to watch it,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Can A Movie Be Too Scary?,"The acting and other technical elements of The Conjuring 2 make it a well made film but most movie-goers just want to know if it really is that scary. I say it most definitely is. There is no edge of your seat excitement and there is nothing fun about it, it's just really scary. Some scenes were similar to the first movie but most of the time I forgot I was watching a sequel. All the characters seemed equally important and Vera Farmiga is very pretty but all of that gets overlooked due to how scary it is. It was a bit uncomfortable to watch and I wanted it to be over but I mean that as a compliment.Some of my favorite horror movies are An American Werewolf In London, Phantasm, the original Halloween, the original Fright Night, and some films in the A Nightmare On Elm Street series. Those are classic scary movies that play each year on certain networks during the month of October and fall into that category of a worst case scenario. Imagine how scary it would be if your nightmares could get you in real life or if a vampire moved into the house next door to you. Those are movies you can watch at home with the lights out while snacking on popcorn and chugging a soda and having fun while being scared. The Conjuring 2 however is a seriously terrifying two hour commitment that I do not want to watch at home alone. What if that hideous demon in the movie comes to get me? There's no fun in that!I remember seeing commercials for Paranormal Activity that showed the audience scared and looking away from the screen for a moment before peeking back and enjoying the experience like a sort of amusement ride. I like the films in that series. The Conjuring 2 had a different effect on the audience. The theater was silent throughout the entire film and after it ended people left the theater quickly and in silence. I got the feeling they were scared out of their wits.Rather than repeating myself by saying it was really scary, I'll sum it up. This is not a horror movie you mix in with teen-screams, slashers, or monster movies. It goes with The Exorcist or The Shining, especially when they were first released. One that will have even the most seasoned horror fan checking their closets and under their beds before going to sleep. See it in the theater if you can and good luck!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not bad for a James wan movie. A good follow up,"Yeah, skipping Annabelle for now since, at least on my account, it isn't out on Netflix yet at the time I'm writing this. Off to the review: The Conjuring 2 improves on its predecessor with a more gripping story, ratcheting up the tension and scares, better performances, improved blend of scary moments and quiet moments and a genuinely menacing villain. To cut a long story short, this third entry in the franchise avoids reiterating the same information as its direct predecessor and creates an atmospheric, exhilarating horror-thriller that enhances its direct predecessor's merits just the way a sequel should.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Empty,"The first one is still spooky, scary and a great drama. But this one is too Hollywood for me. I've missed that feeling during watching this one. The goosebumps not from fear, but because the story just grabs you. However it is still a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring 2: A Haunting Symphony of Fear and Faith,"""The Conjuring 2"" isn't just a horror film; it's a masterclass in building suspense and unease. It's a chilling symphony of fear, played out in a haunted London home, where the line between reality and the supernatural blurs with every creaking floorboard and flickering light.The film masterfully weaves a tapestry of genuine terror and genuine emotion. The story, while rooted in the real-life Enfield Poltergeist case, transcends mere documentation. It delves into the depths of human vulnerability, exploring themes of faith, family, and the enduring power of love in the face of unimaginable darkness.The performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, as the iconic paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, deliver nuanced portrayals of unwavering courage and deep compassion. Their chemistry is palpable, their commitment to their roles unwavering. The supporting cast, particularly the young actress playing the tormented young girl at the heart of the haunting, delivers equally powerful performances.Director James Wan, a master of the genre, crafts a film that is both visually stunning and emotionally resonant. The cinematography is masterful, using shadows and light to create an atmosphere of constant dread. The score, a haunting blend of orchestral and electronic elements, perfectly complements the on-screen action, amplifying the tension and dread.""The Conjuring 2"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's not just about jump scares and ghostly apparitions; it's about the enduring power of human resilience and the unwavering belief in the unseen. It's a film that will make you question what lies beyond the veil, and leave you wondering if the darkness you see in the shadows is real or just a figment of your imagination.While the film does rely on some familiar horror tropes, it elevates them with its masterful storytelling and emotional depth. It's a film that will leave you both terrified and strangely comforted, reminding you that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The best sequel of all times,"After watching 'Conjuring 1' l have always tried to imagine what 'Conjuring 2' was going to offer. My imagination was really nothing compared to the outcome, the film was definitely scarier than the first one. This sequel did not let me down not even a bit. It turned out to be more interesting than the first one. If you are looking for Real horror then let James Wan show you what it is. All actors gave amazing performances. Suspense scenes made it even more engrossing. From the beginning it captures you and keeps your eyes glued to the screen not willing to miss any scene.There is no way one can not enjoy this one. The plot twists and plots within the movie were truly amazing.Not mentioning the soundtrack would be a terrible mistake. It was impeccable and it created a great atmosphere.I have never been much of a fan of sequels but this one was just one of the best to be ever made. Definitely a movie to watch in the cinema. A wonderful movie it is and deserves a 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A film that reinvigorates an entire genre.,"A film that reinvigorates an entire genre and keeps horror alive on the big screen to scare us all.The horror genre has been far from my favourite over the last 10 years with the passing of greats like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th giving way to many, many terrible reincarnations of what filmmakers think is considered scary and worthy of praise. Lots of 'jump scares' and bad CGI monsters later we finally seem to have found a winning formula in The Conjuring.The scares make you jump, the monsters look frightening and certain scenes are incredibly tense and terrifying. But for me the film truly succeeds in the other elements that make it complete. Comedic moments that are genuinely funny, a great storyline focusing on love, family and getting on with life and that's just between Ed and Lorraine.Overall one of the best horror films of the generation and with everything it tries it accomplishes, not without its faults but The Conjuring series offers a non loving horror fan plenty of storyline, tension and entertainment to make it a truly great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
2 hours I will never get back.,"After checking the reviews of this movie on this site I couldn't wait to watch it. I really enjoyed the first one so I though, hey, this should be great. Was I wrong.... Let me just say, I absolutely love horror movies but for me it must be so scary that I am tempted to actually stop watching the movie. With this movie, I was tempted to stop watching it for a whole other reason. I found it to be extremely predictable and quite boring. One big horror movie cliché - and not actually scary at all.. The first one was 100 times better. So, if you like ""horror"" movies that don't make you think before you walk down the passage to the toilet - this one is for you!",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Fiercer, Scarier, and Smarter 'Conjuring'","Directed by: James Wan Most horror sequels have a tendency to be predictable and follow the same template as the first installment. You know where the evil is and when it will pop out and make you jump in your seat. Jason leaps at you with the machete, Freddy sneaks up on you in your dreams, and so on, tale as old as time. Being a fan of the first film, I expected this one to have the same tropes and construct with the characters and themes. I was wrong, dead wrong. This is one of the rare breed of horror sequel that is scarier than this original and raises the stakes for everyone including the audience.Based on another one of Ed and Lorraine Warren's paranormal investigation cases (more specifically The Enfield Poltergeist), The film opens post-Amityville and we see our heroic duo famous but weary doing talk shows debating with skeptics about the incidents. Lorraine also worries that Ed might die in a future investigation after seeing a vision. They are then persuaded to visit a family in England who are being terrorized and discover something more sinister than they've ever faced before. When I say the stakes have been raised, that is just the tip of the iceberg. If the first installment was the first circle of hell, this one cranks it to the tenth, maybe even eleventh. Not since I rented the original ""Evil Dead"" when I was in high school have I been this scared. But the scares are just the beginning as the film also deals and balances weighty themes of faith, skepticism and facing our own fears. We care and fear for everyone as there is not one character that is disposable or purpose-less unlike in other horror franchises which have a habit of swapping out leads and side-characters like batteries in a remote. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga give fantastic and award-worthy performances as Ed and Lorraine Warren.The Conjuring 2 is scarier than the original and also more thought-provoking that leaves you not only breathless but also raises some interesting questions and discussions in the process. If you weren't frightened by true evil before, this one might just change your mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
