Quinton Tarantino's Most Underrated Film,"I never saw this film back when it was released in 2015. But, I did manage to buy a copy of Blu-Ray. Now, when I first saw it, I thought this movie was flawless/perfect. I now know that no movie despite what anyone may say, is perfect. But I am firm believer that this is in fact Quinton Tarantino's most underrated and under-appreciated film. Everyone I've talked to, says the Hateful Eight isn't Tarantino's most re-watchable film. I disagree. With a phenomenal cast that really gets into their characters. Each one stands out and not one is forgetful. Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell are the stars of this film and it shows. Their performances (in my opinion) were Oscar worthy. Don't even get me started on the story. This is basically a Who-Done-It play turned into a film. The complexity of this story should make the audience feel confused and turn their heads going, ""what the hell is happening?"". But it does the exact opposite. Everything flows perfectly. The pacing of this film, while it is almost 3 hours, it doesn't feel like it. The cinematography is great. The score brings tension and makes the audience uneasy. But I think my favorite thing of this film, is the scenery. Having these 8 characters who all hate each other, trapped by a blizzard. Really builds up the tension of the catastrophe that is coming. The only thing that is working against this film is the lengthy setup shots at the beginning of the movie. The first five minutes of the film is plagued by it and those tend to drag on. Beyond that, everything about this film is great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Pretty, glorious, and brutally funny","I saw Quentin Tarantino's 8th film on opening night in 70 mm, intermission and all. It was pretty big and fantastic, if not a little bit exhausting. Thankfully, the intermission allowed for a bathroom break.I just watched it again, now 4 years later, as the extended edition on Netflix, broken into four episodes, and in UHD 4K.The snowy vistas in high def digital are as epic and beautiful as you'll see in any film. The majority of the story happens indoors, though, in Mimi's Haberdashery, which provides a more intimate feel, as if you are alone with these characters with the blizzard outside, and the noisy footsteps on the wooden floors inside (You need two boards!)The featured racism of Tarantino's films, and liberal use of the ""N"" word, doesn't age well with time. It jars. It seems less funny, and even a little sad. But it is what it is, and will stand the test of time in its quality, and what it tried to say as an adjunct to entertainment. What cannot be denied are the performances that Tarantino brings out of his eclectic mix of characters. Walter Goggins still is a standout performance, and thankfully, a redemptive one.I look forward to seeing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, knowing that QT will once again bring together time, music, set pieces, gore, dark humor, pulpy dialogue, and more - and would also like to see how his take on the more regrettable aspects of our culture has (or hasn't) evolved over the last few years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I do not understand the hate the movie for me it is one of the best Tarantino movies,"I was a bit sceptical about watching the movie, judging by reviews online and some friends who watched it,but in the end I really liked it.The acting was great .The story was very intriguing with the whole ""Murder Mystery"" theme.Another plus was the score by the one and only Ennio Morricone.The cinematography was also brilliant
especialy with all the breathtaking sceneries in the early part.My only promblem was that the violence was a bit too extreme in some parts,but it is a Tarantino movie so this was expected.Overall it was a good movie that I will definately rewatch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A stage play of a ""Who-Done-It"" murder mystery - with highly political undercurrents","OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a ""classic"" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.2. Don't expect any exciting ""action"" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost ""spoiled"" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a ""Who-Done-It"" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 ""commandments"", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Minnie's Haberdashery, where the elite meet","You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film is ended.80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog crackle. If you think you're going to see a western the kind that John Ford or Howard Hawks or Henry Hathaway did back in the old days, then don't watch The Hateful Eight. Hateful is the operating word with these characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't stand out any more than any of the rest of them. The Hateful Eight also earned Ennio Morricone an Oscar for the best musical score for 2015.The Hateful Eight is a great western, but it ain't your grandpa's kind of western.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Perfidious Pack of Partisans...,"There's a bounty hunter ploughing through the snow, wherever he moves Daisy Domergue moves too, but they need a place to stay, until the storm has gone away, Minnie's cabin's quite close by, so there they go. Before arriving they encounter men adrift, a Major and a Sheriff cadge a lift, but there is tension in the air, mistrust, suspicion and despair, chains are attached; and shackled round loose wrists. At the cabin there are others taking cover, four lone strangers it transpires don't know each other, but they settle for the night, although you know there'll be a fight, and more than one will be impaired, and truly suffer.Plenty of hate spews forth as well as a number of other less palatable projectiles, but you'd be disappointed if they didn't from the master of magnificent movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Damn Tarantino ! You are still a Genius.,You Guys Need To Watch This Masterpiece.There are too much dialogue and slow movie but after the first half you will enjoy the movie.

Don't believe the 1's and 2's or the 9's and 10's,"The film is too well crafted to get the really low scores, the cinematography is too good, the acting too high caliber, the direction too solid, the score too nice, and the flick too engaging for such ratings.This also applies to the other end. The ""twists"" are unimportant and add no spice, the pacing just slogs along, the joy too nonexistent, the characters evoke too little emotion either way, the story too light on satisfaction, the story telling too inconsistent, the length too needless,the magic (other than on the technical side) too absent, and the rewatchability too minimal for me to see greatness but maybe a second viewing will change my perspective but it will definitely be on video for me, only the lure of a hot date fixated on going could get me into the theater again other than maybe just for the experience a 70mm screening.I'm a pretty avid Tarrentino fan but I didn't overly enjoy this effort. I more appreciate it and can't say I wasn't engaged but I also can't say that I'm eager to see it again and worse for the first time I have little inclination to do so with a flick by Q.A generous 7/10 (rounding up from 6.5) for me but I could see ceiling of 8 and a basement of 4 at the lowest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Everyone seems to be missing the point,"If your willing to jump on the bandwagon and avoid this movie just because a couple of thin skinned reviewers are complaining about all the blood and all the ""n-words"", then you might as well just shovel your money into Disney's pockets and see star wars because that's the movie for you. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. If all these negative reviewers would just look past the blood and the guts, they would find a truly masterful piece of cinematic art that reflects both the expertise and effort that went into making it. The storyline is a simple one, but it's told in a complex, interesting, and relatively unique way that is guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the entire 3 hour run time of the movie. Tarantino's direction is unparalleled as usual, and the performance of the entire cast combined with the wonderful cinematography and deeply engaging dialogue make for a remarkably fun time at the theater, if your willing to sit through a lot of grisly violence and mean spirited subject matter. And although many people are complaining about the heavy political undertones of the film's storyline, to me that is one of the main components of this film that stands out the most. The plot of this film serves not only as a compelling metaphor for the racial tension amongst the American people immediately following the civil war, but actually manages to outline the visceral anger and unpredictability of the racial tension that the American people are facing today within society. In a world hell bent on purporting sensitivity and being politically correct, it's nice to see a movie that's willing to raise a middle finger to that social stigma so as to hold a mirror to the racial confrontations that are still plaguing the American people to this very day. Obviously this film is undoubtedly the most sick, twisted, and violent of Tarantino's filmography, and I'm willing to admit that it's not for everybody, but for those of you willing to toughen up, keep your trigger happy insecurities in check, and enjoy a mean, gritty, and badass film that offers no apologies for what it does best I highly recommend this film. And for those of you who are willing to let Tarantino's comments about the police force get in the way of your enjoyment of this film, like I said; Disney is more than willing to take your hard earned money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not worth the hype... or hate.,"Let me start off by saying. That anyone giving this film a 1 or 2 is embarrassing themselves and anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm not saying this because I like this movie, I'm saying it because it's true. Hardly any movie in the modern era deserves this rating unless it is shameless schlock without character or plot. The Hateful 8 is not that movie. The acting alone gives this movie a 6.5 because it is so good. If you were bored by this movie, I hope you can at least admit that the people involved with this film are extremely talented.Now, having said that, I'll get into the meat of the review. I enjoyed this movie. However, I must admit that the main aspect of this film (and biggest cause of disdain), the dialogue, is so prominent that it might as well be the entire first half of the movie. When a movie is this dialogue heavy, it tends to put audiences to sleep. However, the cinematography and musical score is what kept me interested. I'm not usually one to notice music in a movie, but Morricone has done an excellent job of creating atmosphere and tension throughout this film. Without him, it's a real snooze-fest. Not to say that the dialogue wasn't top notch either. The lack of characters allows for more streamlined and focused storytelling. The movie stays away from unnecessary dialogue and story padding and focuses more on character building. It is clear from dialogue alone what every characters motivation is unless it is intentionally hidden.I respect what this movie tried to do and I think Tarantino succeeded in making the movie he wanted to make. He created an atmospheric and genuinely intriguing mystery movie with a western theme. Now, that movie may not appeal to wide audiences and make tons of $$cash$$, but they tried something ambitious and I believe it payed off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not Tarantino's best stuff,"While Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson carry the load, this film just didn't do it for me. It seems like it's just mechanical, and tries too hard to be a Tarantino film. It fails at almost all levels, with over the top blood and gore, along with a script that just didn't seem to flow. I know some people gave it 10/10 and some people said it was a complete dud, but they may be comparing it to his other films. If it's not compared to other Tarantino films it's an average movie, maybe a bit above average. But considering this man made films like Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and the Kill Bill movies, made me expect more.It's worth a watch if you have a few hours to kill, but it falls short of expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Glad I saw this for free,Sadly there will be fans of this movie. I cannot understand why a great director needs to produce this boring garbage. The film did nothing in the way of entertainment though it must have cost all of five grand to produce. The hardest part was staying awake in the hope of it getting better. Please watch a Clint Eastwood movie to try and get some idea of what a good film should be like. Thugs and gang members will love this film. For the rest of the population I say save your money as the film is just not worthy of your hard earned cash. The best bits were the credits as it meant the boredom had ended. I have seen all of this mans work and been entertained in the past but this particular just left me bored with dialogue overload of expletives and the lack of and decent action.,3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Theatric and Detailed,"This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.The blizzard provides the necessary isolation to the story. These characters are stuck with each other, and this forced closeness is central to the story - they're all Hateful, and that hate reverberates among them, destroying peace and hope. Hate is what brings them together and hate is what tears them apart. The blizzard also provides some interesting incidental elements that are fascinating to watch, like the hardship of a simple task like preparing guidelines, or going to the outhouse, and the cold hell explodes inward at times (when the door is opened) with punctuating effect, providing some breaks to the narrative, and even some needed laughs.And the bar... This film's action takes place primarily in one large room. It feels very much like a stage play (as another reviewer mentioned), allowing greater intimacy with the characters and their interactions, while providing us with an opportunity to witness multiple scenarios unfolding at the same time. This density of action is very cool. We are afforded third person omniscience without losing connection with the motives and perspectives of the players.And the stage setting meshes very integrally with the acting. We see the principal actors doing top-notch with not only their primary motivational actions, but nearly every choice in blocking and busy action. The director and production team make a very wise choice in showing the small little details of what's going on here. Attention is paid to realistic procedural actions, and reactions, for these details. The result is that we see characters behaving in reasonable ways to their environments, pausing to disarm a stranger, or undo a shackle, not simply because the plot calls for it, but because it's a reasonable choice that they would make at the time. Very refreshing to see, actually.On the negative side, Tarrantino's choice to use narration was weakly executed. I don't know if there would have been a way to do this without narration, but the actual usage detracted from the ongoing story. Also, there were a few points in the action where the characters seemed to be a little too accepting of the events that transpire around them. This is purely a fault of direction/writing.But overall, a very watchable film, that is notably unafraid to portray some very dirty and uncomfortable bits of the human psyche. Some folks seem to have an issue with this last part. My advice to them is to loosen up a bit and accept art that hurts a little. That's one of the things good art can do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!,"This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling.Go damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino style.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great,"Everything you would come to expect from Tarantino, just on a more confined scale. The original screen play and acting both amaze, it is always refreshing to see some of the banter and slang he comes up with. Yes it is super violent but once again the director makes it so we really don't care, the music fits perfect as well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The scope of things,"You could say this is a Western version of a children song, ""10 little ..."" (and whatever probably racist or at least discriminatory thing came after that in your country - it's Indians in America, which kind of seems fitting replacing them with Cowboys, mostly). And let me make clear that I did watch the 70mm longer version of the movie, that also had an Interlude. Kind of as they did in the old days ... though the movie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance in the old days (playing in cinemas that is).Tarantino also seemingly making fun of people criticizing his scripts or rather the use of the ""n-word"" by his characters. It seems like he listens and does care. With Madsen and Roth you have a couple of Reservoir Dogs thrown into the mix. Both terrific actors, but almost everyone is being put to shame by Russel and Jackson. While Will Smith had a great role in Concussion, the real Academy Awards miss was not nominating Samuel L. Jackson! Strangely enough Jennifer Jason Leigh did get a nomination. She's good, don't get me wrong, you just wonder, why she's the only one to get the nod from this movie.And that's because it's an overall amazing group effort. Some may feel this moves too slowly, not enough is happening. That would either mean you're not familiar with QTs work (he loves his dialog and we do too) or didn't read up on where this is taking place. Don't get it wrong though: Because when it gets violent, it really goes all the way. Not for the squeamish at all.Quentin made this feel very operatic and the larger than life setting suits the movie and the characters in it. It's a mind game and it's a words game too. But it's also about who is faster than the other person ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Don't believe the hype, it's okay but Tarantino can do better","So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Long-winded and self-indulgent,"The headline says most of it. Tarantino's use of banal dialogue as a device has long since worn out its luster. Most scenes are painful to watch, because you know what is coming: repetition of banal lines that were never interesting to begin with. The excessive amount of gore adds nothing. Certain segments defy credibility in the interest of exploitation-type effect, e.g. the General Smithers bit. The usual Tarantino craft ensures a degree of quality that lands a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This is the movie critical viewers have been waiting for all year.,"Well...If you're the type of person that zones out during nowadays action scenes and is always hoping for strong dialogue, unexpected twists and some dark humor that is.But still, this movie will give you powder-keg confrontations that will even grasp anyone's attention. And yes the movie absolutely delivers on the sheer moment-to-moment pleasures fans have come to expect, combined with dynamite dialogue . Armed with vicious humor and an intense story, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is as brutal in its insights into race relations and human nature as it is in its depiction of violence in the old West.I'm starting to doubt if Pulp Fiction is still his best movie to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Succeeds in some parts, fails in most","Okay, the movie is beyond unbelievable. That aside it has a few shining moments. Some of the dialogue is good and there happens to be some good acting. The bad, it drags on. It's almost three hours that could have been cut down to an hour and a half which would have raised it's rating. Quentin Tarantino again loves to flaunt the fact he can use racial slurs. He must feel he gets away with it because he adds black actors, making them main characters many times the hero.A disturbing part of this film is the graphic detail Samuel L. Jackson gets into describing him raping and sexually assaulting a white man. While Quentin Tarantino makes cameos in his movies he doesn't here, he does for the first time in this movie start narrating right after this descriptive scene. He is lisping with delight as he talks.Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh are good and each brutal in this movie.To sum up, this is a western that takes place 90% of the times in a one room building, the fact they pulled this off is impressive, would be a lot more impressive if the movie was actually better.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's most underrated work,"Quentin Tarantino has been on a roll since he literally started making movies and The Hateful Eight is no different. One of the first things to come to mind when it comes to this film is the incredible, award winning score. You hear it almost immediately when the movie starts and it is absolutely captivating and stress inducing. Ennio Morricone was simply a legend and is greatly missed. Once again, we have a film with the iconic Tarantino style that manages to pull you in immediately and never let you go. The choice to film on digital with the Ultra Panavision 70 lenses was a great one and really adds to the classic western feel that Tarantino desired. I'm not being over dramatic when I say that this was one of the most tense and stressful movies I've ever seen and I absolutely love that about it. I love a good slow burn that builds the tension up, all culminating in a wild third act, which is exactly what this movie does. The mystery is so well done here, I was intrigued from the very beginning and the answers I got were satisfying. But the movies greatest strength is the characters and the star studded cast that plays them. Everyone gives top notch performances to these unique and interesting characters. In a film with so many characters, it's easy to write some as forgettable but not so here. Add in the absolutely amazing dialogue that really takes the film to the next level and you got yourself another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece. I'm honestly surprised how underrated this film is. Perhaps it gets lost in the mix as it came out between Django Unchained and Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood, two of Tarantino's all time best in my opinion but don't let the scarcity of talk this film gets deter you. It's a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A dash of Peckinpah, Leone n Takeshi. The harsh weather n the set up is heavily inspired by The Great Silence n Wheels aka Tockovic.","Tarantino's direction, the performance of the entire cast combined with the deeply engaging dialogues make for an awesome experience.
Robert Bridge Richardson's cinematography n Ennio Morricone's score adds more flavor.
The film is focused around the dialogues, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces a la Reservoir Dogs.
While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold a la The Great Silence.
The weather in this film is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters.
Good to see Kurt Russell with the coolest handle bar mustache. He was good in Bone Tomahawk too.
The story line was intriguing. Found a lil similar to Tockovic aka Wheels n Reservoir Dogs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
It's easy to see why some people would hate 'The Hateful Eight'.,"Before I begin my review, I'd like to emphasise that there are two different versions of Quentin Tarantino's eighth film, the 70mm print which runs for 187 minutes including an overture and intermission, and the 168 minute version I saw which has been released in digital cinemas. Now, on with the review!Quentin Tarantino burst on to the scene with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"". Since his debut effort, he has made only seven other movies over a 22 year period and he insists that he will no longer direct after his tenth film. He has made some excellent films in that time including one of my favourites of 2012, ""Django Unchained"", and 1994's brilliant ""Pulp Fiction"". If you are familiar with his movies then you'll know that he includes terrific, often witty dialogue, and violence that can be stomach-churning. He's at it again with The Hateful Eight, especially with the violence, but not so much with the dialogue which isn't as biting as some of his other scripts, possibly because it loses its impact over such a long running time. In fact this is Tarantino's longest ever movie.Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter whose progress has been halted by the blizzard-like conditions. He comes across another bounty hunter in John Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is travelling in a stagecoach with a criminal he has captured, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Discovering that Ruth is heading in the same direction as himself, Warren asks Ruth if he can place his captured fugitives on top of the stagecoach to collect his bounty at Red Rock. Along the way, they meet up with the new sheriff of Red Rock, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins). Before they arrive at Red Rock, they stop over at Minnie's Haberdashery, which is being patronised by an assortment of characters including Englishman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and Bob (Demián Bichir).Most of the film is set inside the haberdashery which promotes a claustrophobic feeling and with the amount of dialogue that takes place, it occasionally lends itself to a theatrical setting. When the outdoor locations are used, the grandeur of the snow-filled landscape provides a sense of remoteness. Both the interiors and exteriors generate the tension that Tarantino's script doesn't always display. There are moments of intensity that are interrupted by a throwaway line. It is a sprawling story that meanders at times so an edit of about half an hour would have resulted in a tighter, more efficient production.The acting is solid with spectacular moments provided by Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular. It's no surprise she has ended up with an Oscar nomination for her gritty performance. Jackson overacts at times with his grandstanding speeches but he is rather renowned for those in many of his movies. It's fantastic to see Russell in a different type of performance where he isn't embraced by the audience. In fact, the nature of many of the scenes makes it difficult for the viewer to embrace any of the characters so this may affect your opinion of the movie. If you are offended by women being beaten, men engaging in forced oral sex and innocent people being killed, then you will be turned off by several aspects of the story.At the tender age of 87, Ennio Morricone composes the brilliant score which features his renowned violins and brass. He brilliantly captures the tension of the story and the score is reminiscent of his spaghetti western days. Perhaps that's why Tarantino decided to go with Morricone as this is rather like a western but if you are seeking end-to-end action you will be disappointed. This is more of a character piece with a mystery thrown in. Tarantino may have included too much but you cannot blame him for trying something different. He even includes himself as the narrator in the second half of the film but this was unnecessary and distracting. He is an exciting filmmaker and even if not everything works, he makes sure you have something to think about.The violent bloodbath and the scene where one character is forced at gunpoint to perform fellatio have resulted in an R rating in Australia. Surely this is enough warning for people who are easily offended not to even bother seeing the movie. However, if you do not see ""The Hateful Eight"", you will be missing an intriguing, although slightly meandering film. It will be shame when Tarantino retires from writing and directing for he has provided some innovative and entertaining films in his time. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A decent movie of Quentin Tarantino.,"I've seen a lot of movies made by Quentin Tarantino and this one is a decent one. It didn't disappoint me, nor it didn't amazed me. I can see the usual signature of Quentin, which combines the comedy with the drama. I liked how almost the whole movie was shot in the same location, because in a small space a lot of things could happen... I can only say that I didn't waste my time with it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Soulless,"The Hateful Eight is an absolute unmitigated disaster and a complete embarrassment for all associated with it.There is not a single character you give a damn about. The story moves as slowly as molasses. The plot is almost non-existent. The genius at the helm decided to shoot a movie in 70mm and have Ennio Morricone write the score, and then decided to set the entire damn movie in one room.Remember that Quentin Tarantino snappy dialogue? No sign of it here. The entire movie sounds and looks like a bad high school production of a badly written stage play.When everyone starts projectile vomiting blood all over each other and getting shot in the nether regions, and it isn't interesting, cool, or even mildly diverting. It's just over-the-top and soulless.That's the word I'd use to describe Hateful Eight: Soulless. The work of an arrogant director who thinks everything he does is so awesome that he doesn't need to bother caring about the product he produces. A bunch of actors who don't convey for one second that they care at all about what they are doing, all of them reading a screenplay where nobody has bothered make you care about about a single one of them.The only reason I made it to the end of it was because I truly believed it HAD to get better at some point. Unfortunately, it never did.I've kind of soured on Tarantino over the years, but I was still eagerly anticipating The Hateful Eight. From the opening credits when he bills it as literally ""The eighth film by Quentin Tarantino"" on down, every single thing in this movie is not only done with ineptitude, but is covered with a veneer of arrogance that is more offensive and shocking than Tarantino's gratuitous use of the 'n-word' and blasé attitude about everyone taking turns beating the crap out of a woman.Better movies than this go straight to cable/Netflix every day.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The most disappointing film of 2015...,"The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's latest odyssey into his depraved and (somehow) brilliant mind. Unfortunately, those looking for a repeat performance from Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds will walk away very disappointed. The Hateful Eight is merely a three hour epic dedicated to showing just how great Robert Richardson is as a cinematographer and how full of himself Tarantino can be. It features some of the weakest Tarantino we've seen since Jackie Brown. The film starts by introducing us (slowly) to each of the titular eight, played by Kurt Russel, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins (who steals the show) and Demian Bichir. Among the eight, we're peppered with new faces to Tarantino's world along with some very familiar ones. Along with the familiar faces, we're given a familiar story, one that is closer to Reservoir Dogs with a mix of And Then There Were None... To be completely honest here, The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's worst effort as a writer and a director but it is his best film visually. The film is more of a showcase for Robert Richardson's impeccable cinematography rather than a typical showcase of Tarantino's talents. While there are some truly brilliant (yet bloated) dialog pieces, especially one from Samuel L. Jackson that is AMAZING, the film is so lopsided and uneven that it makes it hard for the audience to fully enjoy what's there to be enjoyed. For the first two hours or so, we are subjected to one bloated monologue after another then for the last hour we're subjected to a blood and bullets fest that is awesome to see but comes too late in the film to care about. The run time is where Tarantino is the most self indulging. Most of these scenes could have easily been cut down to gain a better sense of pace, but Tarantino is so confident that his material is brilliant that he just let's us bask in it. While these performances are perfection, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is absolutely brilliant in this role and deserves any award that they throw her way, the film ultimately suffers from it's best attribute...Quentin Tarantino, himself. The problem here is that this film is nowhere near interesting enough to sustain a three hour run time. The scenes of banter between the nasty eight are scenes that could have used a serious editing session. At best, the film stands as an ode to classical cinema and it succeeds in doing that. Outside of that, The Hateful Eight is a painfully slow film that could have benefited from about 30 minutes of cuts and a director that isn't so self indulging in the way he makes a film. However, at the end of the day, we're left with what we are left with. The Hateful Eight is not only the most disappointing film of 2015, it is also the most bloated. As a Tarantino fan, I was disappointed but I will say this: The Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's worst films...but even his worst film would be any other director's masterpiece so keep that in mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
parlor mystery in a room,"After the war, O.B. is driving a stagecoach to Red Rock, Wyoming carrying bounty hunter John 'Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his $10k quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They stop for Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is stuck in the middle of nowhere with his three dead bounties. Next, the group picks up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock. Warreb and Mannix clash over their separate war exploits. The group seeks shelter from a snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery. Minnie and Sweet Dave are gone and Bob (Demián Bichir) claims to be in charge. There are passengers from an earlier coach. Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is the hangman going to Red Rock. Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowboy. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a former confederate.This is actually more like an Agatha Christie movie except Quentin Tarantino has his own special blood-splattering foul-mouthed ways to resolve the mystery. He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play.

A car could have it me in the face and it wouldn't have spoilt how much I enjoyed the film,"Throughout his career the revered Quentin Tarantino has developed more than just a genre of himself, but a collection of work that has proved that he is a national treasure transcending being merely a modern cinematic icon but ultimately a classic and timeless figure in cinema.The Hateful Eight has to be his most precise and literary film that accumulates a career of brining together some of the most talented people in their field of work from production design to cinematography to the spellbinding, stellar cast of actors.First of all, the whole 70mm panovision thing that I expect the large majority of the audience will be uninformed of may wonder if it is some gimmick, as may even the cynics who apparently know what they're talking about. To cut it short, its what makes the hateful eight look so exquisitely textured. every shot; every frame even, is like the most intricate oil pastel paintings like a Baptiste Chardin or Liotard. It is a mouth waveringly, beautifully shot film. An epic format for an epic film.Secondly, the work of Robert Richardson (cinematographer) who's long lasting collaboration with Tarantino is certainly reflected in this film as a culmination of all the best skill and artistry of the Tarantino collection which makes me happy, because I have seen this man grow into a master. Moreover, the production design by Yohei Taneda and the art department; all of the behind scenes people involved have seriously got their work cut out for them because this film is a masterpiece.What is also great is the fact that this film has some long lasting collaborations in terms of acting and a group of people who are just ,obviously, so in tune with Tarantino's writing that it is just a joy and pleasure to watch them speak the Tarantino language. Every single performance brought a smile to my face and again we are presented with so many quotable lines from a director who's so far embedded into popular culture that when you search the term, you often are given Tarantino as a result. I loved this film, if you have never seen a Tarantino Film then typically what you have is an artistry in violence and at the fore front a script full of witty, philosophical, quotable dialogue. However, if you usually don't like Tarantino and his style, firstly why? secondly, give this film a chance because you could possibly miss out on a masterpiece.

MASTERPIECE. Period,"Why I am giving it a 9? Cause I think Quentin could have done better. How? I don't know, only he might know.But I think he can.Is it better than Pulp Fiction? No, it Pulp Fiction better? Maybe yes, just because he was young ands less experienced, thats about it.Now, the movie... Its more than 150 minutes, the first hour is very intriguing, the next half hour gets a little slow and maybe could have been a tad shorter.But then the last hour is like a full throttle hormone rising epic like you have never seen before. I am 43 and having seen all the movies, from Kurusowa to Cameron to Nolan to Guy Ritchie to Hitchcock, not that my saying matters, but this movie sits Quentin at the very top 3.Every character is brilliantly crafted, so beautiful, every scene in the movie is epic. I don't understand the 70mm concept of this movie being the last of it, but the camera work and the angles were just perfect.Rusell, Leigh, Jackson and Goggins were just too good. You also have Quentin's steady arsenal in Madsen and Zoe Bell, cameos from both.The story... set up in the 19th century, 3 men are taking a outlaw and they rest in a deserted cafe in the midst of a blizzard and there is something happening, you can only sense, but you wont get anything more. And that is the brilliance of Quentin, he unfolds the story in an amazing way, not even giving you any hints, but you know something is just not right abd then...BOOM! 1 gun shot and then the epic happens, that is the last hour and the first 1 and half hour is just the dosage to build that final BOOM.If you love movies, if you love art (but mind you, its very very gory, typical Quentin) if you love story telling, if you love screenplay, if you love acting, if you love anything to do with movies, you will love this film.I am not from America, so if there is apolitical undertone as a reviewer has mentioned, I didn't get it, but undertone or not, this movie is a treat.And the music,,, oh the music, the background score and all which is always a big factor of Quentin's movie, probably the best of all.And just to repeat, what an awesome camera work.Quentin delivers again, even out does himself, I don't know how, but he does",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
some places you can't leave without a fight,"Quentin Tarantino has made a career paying homage to cult movies, often casting little known or retired/forgotten actors. Having focused on revenge with ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", he shifts his focus with ""The Hateful Eight"". The setting here is a haberdashery in the snowed-in mountains of Wyoming some time after the Civil War. A group of morally ambiguous people converge on the haberdashery, but all is not what it seems.Tarantino continues his tradition of snappy, realistic dialogue, and over-the-top violence. To be certain, most of the characters in ""The Hateful Eight"" are smooth-talkers. Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson finally gets a lead role as a bounty hunter with extra insight into the haberdashery (and yes, Jackson does use the word that he pretty much always has to use in movies).The story has to get seen in the context of the modern United States. Much of the story centers on the tension amongst the characters, in particular as it relates to race. Killings of unarmed black men continue to this day, and Tarantino even attended a rally against police brutality in New York. It's as though this octet represents the worst elements of the United States.I liked the movie. Even if you don't know any of the references, you gotta love the characters played by Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and James Parks. All are scoundrels in one way or another, but they're determined to ride out this blizzard no matter what (and I do mean no matter what).

There is and intention of having stylish characters, but the goal is not fulfilled as in the good spaghetti or contemporary Westerns. The film is not properly bad, but is far from being good as I waited for. It is highly overestimated just because Tarantino was turned into a fashion brand.

A masterpiece - Tarantino never lets you down,"If there is one director who never lets you down, it's Tarantino. His newest film, The Hateful Eight is an excellent thriller with great story, cinematography and music - but who would expect any less? Right from the start The Hateful Eight captures the viewer, even though it has its slow pace.Tarantino is a very skillful writer. His characters are real, and not just some plain cardboard characters to fill out the blanks between the story. His dialogue is natural and amazing. The story of The Hateful Eight is simple when it's explained shortly, but it has many layers, just like most of his movies. And just like most of his movies, the events aren't in chronological order, but important pieces from before are revealed when needed. The thrill of the story is well built, and the violent action scenes are balanced with slow, calm scenes.I am glad to see Tarantino doesn't rely on mindless 3D technology to make a mediocre film look better. Many films that don't need 3D use it anyway. The Hateful Eight does look good though - it looks amazing. Every shot has whatever they need, the colours and details are astonishing.Tarantino's films always have the most amazing soundtracks. The soundtrack of The Hateful Eight has several amazing pieces that shouldn't work with the movie, but they do, and they do so beautifully. One this kind of track is Apple Blossom by The White Stripes. Also L'Ultima Diligenza Di Red Rock by Ennio Morricone - and all the variants played throughout the film - is haunting. It reminds of the beginning of The Shining, except this is way better. That track also seems out of place, because it would suit some classic yet indie horror movie because of the sinister vibes it gives. But it is perfect for this film.I think I loved every detail of this film. Of course there are slurs thrown around all the time, but it gives the certain effect to the characters: they are far from perfect. I don't think there was one character here that was completely good and pure.The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece. The rhythm is good, the film is balanced and it's violent in almost a funny way. This is definitely a film I will see in the cinemas again, because the big screen surely shows The Hateful Eight in its full potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Bringing guilty men in alive is a good way to get yourself dead.,"'""The Hateful Eight"" 70mm Roadshow pays tribute to the grand film exhibition style popularized in 1950' and 60's and that brought audiences to theatres with a promise of a special event. It delivers a unique experience that hasn't been had in over fifty years.''The Hateful Eight' truly is a unique and special event. Three hours long, including a beautiful musical intro, a ten-minute intermission in the middle and a small souvenir program. This format pays tribute to pictures like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur and a handful of others that were presented in the same, captivating manner.The Roadshow Engagement really changes the underlying nature of a modern day cinema experience, making it seem as going to a theatrical performance. The Ultra Panavision 70 format, which was used to shoot the movie, and Tarantino's masterful editing, have greatly enhanced that theatrical feel. The camera provides an incredibly wider and more detailed image. Each scene simply captures more and thus gives the viewer more room to explore the intricate details. Only a handful of movies have ever been made in this format, with the last motion picture (Khartoum) dating 1966.It seems that Quentin Tarantino is in the best possible way 'indifferent' to critical acclaim, in same magnificent way Coen brothers or Paul Thomas Anderson are, amongst a few others. He is shooting about 'what he truly loves' and his pictures consistently retain an unbelievably unique flair.It is an incredibly rare example of a director and a writer who is mindlessly comfortable in his own style and given all the means to conceptualize and visualize that style; and yes, that style happens to have controversy, dark humor, raw violence, vivid portrayals of greed, revenge and hatred.'Eight' might be discredited due to it's seeming 'shallowness'. Many will argue that the dialogues are pointlessly long, the 'N' word is this time aimlessly abused and the bloody violence is not so much out of place as it is simply not qualified for. The Tarantino 'hero' has usually evoked violence based on something noble, like 'The Bride' in 'Kill Bill', 'Django' in 'Django Unchained' or the bastards in the 'Inglorious Bastards'.Yet these exact arguments could and should be turned upside down. In 'The Hateful Eight' we receive a work of a master that is not afraid to experiment with rare formats and movie plots that contain solely antagonists. Tarantino knows that he can 'get away' with almost anything and he utilizes it to his advantage. He loves to examine ruthless characters motivated by questionably noble causes that are placed in the worst situations that bring out the worst in human nature. While this might at times look and feel 'over the top', this is exactly what makes Quentin one of the most fascinating directors of all time.'The Hateful Eight', Tarantino's 8th film is by all means no exception. Containing an incredibly captivating and thrilling storyline, in the best possible way it pays homage to Tarantino's first movie, 'Reservoir Dogs', adding the so- familiar, crime-fueled 'confusion'. In detail, we examine Eight bad guys that 'find shelter' in Minnie's haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard. As events unfold and true motivations are slowly unraveled, we receive a violent, bloody tale fueled by merciless revenge, racial tensions, rage and integrity.The dialogues are wonderfully smart and satirical, however what truly makes them stand out are the actors. The all-time, old school Tarantino cast seems as comfortable with the director as he is with violence and blood. This results in some of the best performances that a cast could possibly produce.Legendary Ennio Morricone marks 'The Hateful Eight' as the first Western he has composed music for in forty years, with the last movies being 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Once Upon a Time in America', 'The Untouchables' and many others. His music is fitting to the plot and to the scenery, at times softly flowing with the story and at times doing the exact opposite, adding even more emotion and suspense.The exceptional 70mm format, that practically transforms us into the freezing, gorgeous, remote, wintery landscapes of 'Wyoming' and the remarkable skill, experience, and thorough knowledge of Quentin Tarantino, all make 'The Hateful Eight' the best Western of the 21st Century as well as one of the best cinema experiences one could ever encounter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Not Tarantino's Finest Work... But If You Like Tarantino, You Should Enjoy The Hateful Eight.","Well, the 'King of Cool' is back and once again he's created a slick, smart film, which excites all those little nerves that us blokes (and women - no sexism here) find so appealing! Yes there are slick lines, yes there's blood... and yes, as always, there is a shootout... my god, does Tarantino love a shootout!I don't want to give any spoilers away, and given that we know so little about the film going into it, I fear that saying practically anything will give something away. So in short, The Hateful Eight is about two bounty hunters, heading to Red Rock, Wyoming, to claim their bounties. Not only do they pick up one interesting and suspicious character along the way, but due to a nasty blizzard they are forced to make a pit stop at 'Minnie's Haberdashery' where they run into several more of these types, all of whom may or may not be telling the truth about their identities or their reasons for being there. Our story then revolves around these eight (well nine if you include the driver) characters' stories and how they interact with one another. Think Cluedo/Clue but in a blizzard, in America, in the 1870s.I know this film has very much split Tarantino fans but for me, if you like Tarantino, you should enjoy The Hateful Eight. The only reason I can think some may be put off, is that it does move significantly slower than much of Tarantino's work. It is much more of a slow burner and revolves more around the characters' actions and dialogue, than the actual scenes themselves. That being said, it had me gripped enough that I wasn't looking at my watch (despite the near 3 hours running time), so it can't be too drab!So let's do some quick fire bullets to prevent this review getting too lengthy:No this isn't Tarantino's best work. No it isn't close to my favourite of his work. That being said, it is once again a very well made piece of cinema from a director who continues to make films in a way no one else really can. Another engaging, funny, smart story from Mr Tarantino. I can fully understand why The Academy have failed to recognise it however, it may just be a little 'action-gory-type' film for them I expect. It certainly doesn't carry the distinction of say, a 'Revenant'. But I certainly preferred it to The Revenant, Big Short, Brooklyn, Room etc.The acting across the board was excellent. One of the major strengths of the film were its characters, each having its own distinct personality and back story. This is not only testament to the actors themselves but also to Tarantino on the writing front. I thought Tim Roth in particular was superb and although no really considered from what I saw 'pre-awards season', can count himself unlucky not to get a Best Supporting Actor nod. I'd certainly place him higher than Christian Bale in The Big Short, that's for sure.Jennifer Jason Leigh played her crazy, but calculated character very well and is definitely worthy of her Oscar nomination.The film also provides a huge role for Walton Goggins, who I must confess I've not seen before, but will no doubt be cropping up in more feature films now I expect. He did a very good job in this, especially given the actors he was lining up alongside.And finally, Ennio Morricone... He is very much deserving of the Oscar. And unlike Leo (who deserves it because of his body of work, rather than for his specific role this year), this score would more than be worthy of the win. Despite my love of Thomas Newman's Bridge of Spies score, I have to accept that it was relatively samey throughout whereas the variety of compositions that Morricone has had to put together for this is impressive... more so because each works so perfectly with the scene/s it's attached to. Very Hitchcock-esque... including one part having a hauntingly similar relation to Psycho... which would explain why I appreciated it so much. So yes, although Thomas Newman's Bridge of Spies score is my favourite so far this year, this is probably better in terms of achievement and quality. Besides... how can you deny the composer of The Mission & The Good, The Bad and The Ugly finally receiving an Academy Award?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Eight down, two to go. Do something!","I just got back from seeing ""The Hateful Eight"" and my head is spinning because it's such a weird movie I'm not sure if it's somewhat good or exceedinly awful. What's sad is that it starts off wonderfully -- I felt myself getting excited by the prospect of Tarantino returning to form for about a half hour -- then keeps getting sillier and sillier until it's nothing but a comedy -- and the comedy is so unsubtle, it might have been made by Mel Brooks or Jerry Lewis on acid.What's funny is the much touted, rich color of the Panavision stock and the fake cabin interior of ""Minnies Haberdashery (not a hat in sight)"" makes the film look like the over-saturated movies from the sixties like ""Paint Your Wagon"" which always looked vaguely fake to me -- a plastic universe cobbled together on a back lot and lit with huge overhead arc lights. Add big splashes of red blood and it started to look like the garish color of some the 60s Disney films, so there was this bizarre set of associations going through my head.When the finale of the film turns to grand guignol slapstick in these hyper-pumped colors, I felt like I was having a flashback to a bad 60s Dick van Dyke comedy like ""Fitzwilly"" or ""Cold Turkey,"" and, honestly, I left the theater stunned by the near absurdity of it all. It's as if someone unearthed an awful 60s comedy (Sergio Leone? Hah? That's a laugh) that was buried in the vaults by the studios.This ""love letter to the cinema"" is really a love letter to himself, as Tarantino riffs off elements of his own movies like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and throws in some steals from Paul Thomas Anderson (it almost sounds like Anderson doing the narration. Narration? Where the $%^& did that come from? Wow, talk about the weakest attempt I've ever seen to clue an audience when some sloppy structuring fails the film.)The dialogue is Tarantino-lite, like a second-rate writer trying to imitate him (Samuel Jackson's goading of Bruce Dern is probably the worst monologue Tarantino has written) and the story is Agatha Christie with a lobotomy. There are some good performances (Kurt Russell is great as John Wayne) and some awful ones (Tim Roth at his over-the- top worst) but the film itself unravels like a spoonful of spaghetti Western. And this isn't a spaghetti Western, it's a pizza and beer comedy. I'm sure it will be a big hit at frat houses across America.I'm amazed how some people (known critics, as well) even venture to justify the racial undercurrent as social commentary. Tarantino has never written symbolically or allegorically. He writes character, and that's that. ""The Hateful Eight"" is a ""political statement"" in the same way that ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is an indictment of contemporary religion. Please.How do I sum this movie up in one word? Well, the one that comes to the top of my head right now is: ""Goofy."" Maybe those big Panavision camera got to Tarantino because he subconsciously started to think he was making a bloody version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""I need to have a drink. At this rate, I have to say ""thank god there's only two more to go.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Western. Quentin Tarantino At His Best.","The Hateful Eight is an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and a memorable score. All of those elements make The Hateful Eight an unforgettable film that is Quentin Tarantino at his best.Set in post-Civil War Wyoming,The Hateful Eight tells the story of eight people including Major Marcus Warren(Samuel L. Jackson),a bounty hunter,John Ruth(Kurt Russell)another bounty hunter holding fugitive and prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh)and Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins),a man claiming to be a new Sheriff,Bob(Demian Bichir),Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth),Joe Gage(Michael Madsen)and Sanford Smithers(Bruce Dern)who are all in a stagecoach holdover trying escape a blizzard. But all of these strangers will be involved in a mystery with twists and deception.The Hateful Eight is a brilliant and entertaining Western from Quentin Tarantino and it is a thrilling,bloody,brutal and epic film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western,Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight Tarantino has made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films Inglorious Basterds(2009)and Django Unchained(2012)which are very much alike in scope,look and tone and if you seen those films or Tarantino's other films it has all of the known elements:rich dialog,over the top violence and memorable characters that will stay with you. Like those two films The Hateful Eight is long in length you will not be bored. While a companion piece to both Basterds and Django,The Hateful Eight in terms of structure is more of a call back to Tarantino's classic debut Reservoir Dogs(1992)in which a bunch of strangers are together in one room where there is distrust and paranoia among them but this time set in the 19th century. The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is well-written and strong,with Tarantino giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny,interesting and make scenes standout. As for the main characters each one of The Hateful Eight is memorable but the characters Marquis Warren,John Ruth,Daisy Domergue and Chris Mannix are standouts and are classic characters from Tarantino who are going to liked or disliked depending on your point of view but are delightful in true Tarantino style. The photography(which was shot in the glorious 70mm format)by Robert Richardson is beautiful and visually stunning whether it's the shots of snowy mountains or inside shots the movie is amazing to look at. One of the things I love about The Hateful Eight is how it's the story is structure and told with not just the dividing chapters but amazing build-up. The first 90 minutes of the film is a dialog and character driven affair like a stage play where we get to know the main characters about who they are and what they are about and we as a viewer are fascinated. The second to last half of the film takes a different turn and becomes a violent and insane bloodbath mixing together Western violence with an Agatha Christie-style Mystery in the vein of Murder on The Orient Express and Ten Little Indians where there is twists and turns all around and you keep your eyes glued to the screen trying to solve a puzzle and put the pieces together and wondering who will survive this bizarre tale. The Action and violence is riveting and surprising with the blood and gore just coming off the screen at as if you were the movie with the characters. If you love storytelling the structure and mixture of Western and Mystery will be a great watch. The ending of The Hateful Eight is terrific with great Action,dialog and thrills that brings the movie full circle. An amazing conclusion.The cast is amazing. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent,memorable and at his best as Major Marquis Warren,a bounty hunter. Kurt Russell is terrific as John Ruth,a fellow bounty hunter. Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding as Daisy Domergue,a fugitive in Ruth's capture. Walton Goggins is wonderful as Chris Mannix,a Southern renegade. Demian Bichir does a fine job as Bob,a Mexican caretaker. Tim Roth is amazing as Oswaldo Mobray,a hangman. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage,a Cowpuncher. Bruce Dern is fantastic as Sanford Smithers,s southern soldier.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is fantastic and stylish with Tarantino bringing his usual flair,look and atmosphere to the film. Amazing direction,Tarantino.The score by Ennio Morricone is epic,mysterious and intense matching the tone and style of the movie greatly. Sensational score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you watch The Hateful Eight,an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that Quentin Tarantino at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely terrible!,"I can't decide which is more sickening. This movie or that there are so many good reviews for it. What is wrong with you people? There is no plot! The only far fetched plot that could possibly be extruded from this movie would be that of Agatha Christies ""And Then There Were None"". If you are still planning to see this movie expect to watch paint dry for the first hour of the movie. Then you can expect two more hours of disgusting/ revolting/ stomach churning bloodshed that doesn't help or propel the plot in any way. It is completely irrelevant and is only there to appeal to the sick minded people who get their rocks off from watching such gruesome acts . To all the normal people out there please don't see this movie. But if you are into steampunk, without a job, and have a Grunge band in your parents basement you'll probably love it!Seriously please don't see this movie!Have some class America!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Zero stars - go watch Blazing Saddles instead,"Tarantino has some good movies, some great movies and now a total fecal matter movie. Skip this one and watch Blazing Saddles instead. Blazing Saddles has better use of the n-word, is less boring and has an actual message.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/If you want I'll spare you the interminable three hours and sum up the Tarantino version, here it is >>Spoilers<< Just say niggler minus the l over and over again until you pass out from boredom.Honestly that word so many times was distracting and just smells of lazy writing. Might as well read a dictionary - at least you learn something. Do not pay money for a piece of fecal matter like that.The term niggler is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. The senses labeled Extremely Disparaging and Offensive represent meanings that are deeply insulting and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense. It is so profoundly offensive that a euphemism has developed for those occasions when the word itself must be discussed, as in court or in a newspaper editorial: ""the n-word."" Despite this, the sense referring to a ""black person"" is sometimes used self-referentially among African Americans in a neutral or familiar way. The sense referring to other victims of prejudice, especially when used descriptively, as to denounce that prejudice, is not normally considered disparaging—as in ""The Irish are the nigglers of Europe"" from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments —but the other uses are considered contemptuous and hostile.Niggler in senses 1 and 2 can be found in the works of such writers of the past as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens, but it now ranks as perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English. Its use by and among blacks is not always intended or taken as offensive, but, except in sense 3, it is otherwise a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry.-NIGGLERnoun 1. Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a contemptuous term used to refer to a black person. a contemptuous term used to refer to a member of any dark-skinned people. 2. Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a contemptuous term used to refer to a person of any racial or ethnic origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc. 3. a victim of prejudice similar to that suffered by black people; a person who is economically, politically, or socially disenfranchised.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A different kind of Tarantino. Thoughtful and in-depth character portrayals.,"I've never been a fan of his use of gratuitous violence- but I will always go to see Tarantino's films because they are unique. There were some elements of the 'western' genre that I would have enjoyed seeing more of - but what it tried to achieve, I think it did brilliantly well. This is not a film for anyone who has a short attention span or needs instant gratification. It requires patience to go along for the ride and to wait for the plot to unfold. What I was most impressed by were the in-depth, rich characterisations and there were some superb performances. I did not find that the run-time of the film was too long, nor was I offended by the portrayal of any of the characters or the language they used. Although (love it or hate it) Tarantino's humour frequently refers (both subtly and not so subtly) to the present day, it needs to be taken in the context of when and where the film is set. As for the violence - expect the 'usual', but if you don't let it detract from the rest of the film, you will enjoy it as a very good piece of cinema and the quality of both the cast and the writer/director shines through. There are also some real 'laugh out loud' moments which I wasn't expecting!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Tarantino Back to his (and America's) Roots : A Heartfelt Ten to ""The Hateful Eight""...","Eight strangers, caught in the middle of a blizzard must share a cabin, time, stew and coffee. Everything oppose them, the one thing they got in common is that you can tell the actors had fun playing them, and you can build some of the best acting out of fun.Meeting in the stagecoach, you have John Ruth,a paranoid bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) handcuffed with a female black-eyed criminal, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) taken to Red Rock to be hanged. And you have a black Union veteran, Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who also happens to be a bounty hunter with three dead men to carry to Red Rock, too much for his horse, rest in peace. The friendly two meet a Lost-Causer named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who happens to be the future Sheriff of Red Rock and has good reasons to see the Yankee with a black eye (lousy pun, sorry).In the stagecoach stopover, you have Oswaldo Mobray, a suave Englishman (Tim Roth) who happens to be Red Rock's future executioner, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a cowboy who's going to visit his mother although his face screams ""desperado"" more than ""mama's boy"", General Smithers (Bruce Dern), a Confederate veteran with a grumpy menacing look and ""Bob"", a Mexican worker (Damien Bashir) who took the place of the seemingly absent owners, much to Warren's surprise, as he's used to stop at Minnie's famous 'Haberdashery'. So, the least thing that can be said when all the characters are exposed, is that there are too many coincidences to suspend our disbelief, and maybe the two bounty hunters have good reasons to be suspicious.What follow is a fantastic behind-closed-doors (with nailed boards) mystery drama with as much anger, deceptions, lies and ugliness as in ""12 Angry Men"", ""Sleuth"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" combined, it even has the demographic relevance of Lumet's movie as the whole cast incarnates the entire post-Civil War nation in microcosm. What a great movie finally.I say ""finally"" because, in all honesty, when I learned that Tarantino was making another Western, with a title à la ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Magnificent Seven"", I thought it would be another 60's-70's B-movie's remake with some score-recycling and revenge-fantasy plot, that would again appeal on the basis that the director-can-never-go-wrong.But this time, he didn't, and I don't even know where to start, but I'll try to make it through eight points, after all, eight is the fetish-number and it's like Quentin Tarantino's ""8½"" with all the references made to his previous work, well, the film feels like Tarantino, BACK TO HIS ROOTS and that's for the first strength.2/ THE SLOW PACING isn't just the usual quiet-before-storm stuff, the film leaves room (literally) for a few seemingly-friendly exchanges that feel like exposition (well they are) but they put you at ease, you know it will pay-off, in a bloody way, but you actually enjoy the long conversations the film features independently from the plot.3/ TWO STAND-OUT PERFORMANCES: despite the slow placing, there are the usual angry tirades and eloquent storytelling but the quieter moments belong to some of the greatest actors' interactions Tarantino ever directed and on that level, Jennifer Jason Leigh, deservedly Oscar-nominated, and Walton Goggins really stole the show, which is saying a lot.4/ UNRELIABILITY: basically, you don't know who's the good or bad guy. Think about it, all the previous films had clearly established villains (although charismatic) and heroes (although flawed). ""The Hateful Eight"" strikes by the fact that you never quite know whom to trust, or to believe. Is the story a lie? Is the letter a fake? Is Minnie absent? We're back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" claustrophobic entrapment enhanced by that ugly blizzard going outside as a dark comedy running gag.5/ VULNERABILITY: There's nothing, no status, no strength, that makes anyone immune to bullets. The violence strikes everyone in its blindest, ugliest and most surprising way, and it's precisely because Tarantino puts some slow and talky moments in the right places that the outbursts of violence really take you off-guard and you never really see them coming, while in his previous movies, where it was all about the good guy taking his revenge, we had a sort of cinematic instinct telling us when it was going to get ugly.6/ INTELLIGENT SUBVERSION: the film was panned as misogynistic. I think the treatment Domergue got spoke loud statements about the danger she incarnated and that 'embiggened' her aura more than anything. No offense to the Girl-Power trend that affected the action genre with ""Star Wars"" and ""Mad Max"" but I found the two most interesting portrayals of female protagonists in movies this yeas were Jennifer Jason Leigh as Domergue, and Emily Blunt in ""Sicario"", and both happened to be violent yet stylishly realistic and pervert movies.7/ A BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY8/ IL MAESTRO: an original score by Ennio Morricone, which shows that, for once, Tarantino took his material more maturely and seriously than usual, though some bits were originally made (but not used) for Carpenter's ""The Thing"", one of the movies that inspired Tarantino, and you can tell, there's something personal in this movie, as it really feels 'different'.But this difference didn't meet the same acclaim than ""Basterds"" or ""Django"" and the screenplay wasn't even Oscar-nominated. It seems like people are more openly critical toward ""The Hateful Eight"" than any other Tarantino movie, as if all of a sudden, the characters were too mean-spirited, and violence too much to handle, yet it was cool when it was against Nazis and slavers.For once that Tarantino doesn't go over a simplistic and intelligence-insulting good vs. evil antagonism, he becomes the bad guy, like they say, Nature hates emptiness. Well for ""The Hateful Eight"", I give the 'bad guy' a heartfelt Ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Brilliant,"I'm not one of these people who can watch a film over and over again in a short space of time. Once I've seen a film that's it . That is unless it's a Quentin Tarantino film. I can watch them over and over and after seeing this I'm going to watch it again next week. The best way to describe this is that it's Reservoir Dogs meets Django. It starts relatively slowly with Kurt Russell , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson laying down the foundations of the story while taking a horse and carriage ride in the snow but when they get to the infamous , Minnie's Haberdashery , the fun really begins. There are some great performances , especially from Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson and there is plenty of Tarantino dialogue to last the three hours , not to mention the blood and gore. It's not the best film of his , for me that still goes to Pulp Fiction but this is up there with Inglorious Bastards , Django Unchained and Reservoir Dogs.

A Gem For Your Favorite Prude!,"The film seems so in love with itself. There are many repetitive jokes, and mostly of the overly vulgar variety, just for the sake of repulsiveness alone it seems. Some parts of the film are delivered with purposely slow development, overly slow in fact. Some of the characters are quite boring and so are many of the scenarios. It almost seemed like this was Tarantino's spoiled brat movie, him basically saying a great big, ""F.U., I can do whatever I want now"" to the mainstream audiences that have actually made him a very rich man over the years. And so he can! In that way, the film really made me laugh, as I know many people in the theatre were repulsed by it, and I think I'm not the only one laughing about this, Tarantino definitely is too. However, overall it's a very simple and somewhat dull plot making this one of Tarantino's worst efforts yet in my view, (To me only Death Proof was worse.). I did enjoy the film to some degree for sure, but it's not a film I'd bother to watch again. It is after all quite hard to dispute that this is a very long and fairly dumb film, with little to no point at all except to repulse some prudes, (And that's really the best it can offer.). If you know some uptight prudes you'd like to rile up, recommend them this one for sure, lmao! 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Overrated - Wait For Redbox,"I am a big Tarantino fan and loved most of his movies so I anticipated this would be the same. I was surprised and disappointed. The first hour and a half was just plain boring. The actor performance was questionable given the script they had to work with and Samuel Jackson lead the pack on a decent job. I completely blame the script.My wife nearly dozed off an hour in and that means it was not a normal QT film. The added narrative by Quentin sounded strange and misplaced as well. His normal rushed speak rather than a professional speaker was off of the mark. I listened to interviews with him about the movie and I think he missed the boat this time on what he was trying to accomplish. Wait for cable or DVD IMO because I had free tickets and still felt disappointed. This was no Kill Bill or even From Dusk to Dawn. Not even close.In summary, the movie reminded me of a bunch of actors sitting around reading their scripts but their hearts were only half in it.How do some give this a good review?

Talent,"I really enjoyed seeing many talented people work together that are not of the same generation. For that alone,the movie deserves recognition. No,it isn't a typical western,and it was bloody. I don't expect all books or movies to only express my views or thoughts, I actually want more from them than that. So I was glad to see something from the world of entertainment that wasn't cookie cutter writing and directing. Mr. Tarantino did not let us down loved the symbolism and the harsh environment of the blizzard. Glad he did not shelve it. What it did do was work from a plot with intense characterizations of strong people with some twists along the way. Was there room for improvement?

A lot of great characters leading to nothing,"When you hear the name Tarantino in our modern era of cinema, you expect greatness. The man has turned out some of the most iconic and memorable movies in our time but this time he was in my opinion why in over his head. Hateful Eight is an entertaining movie from start to finish carried by the actors and performances, but if dose hadn't been good, the movie wouldn't have a lot to it. It´s a movie without much plot and substance to it and asking for 3 hours of that is a lot.In a cabin, trapped in a snowstorm, 9 people most survive together. There is a lot of tensions, and someone might not be who they say they are.What drives this movie is Tarantinos amazing dialogue. If a lesser writer had written this movie, it would not have been worth your time. The dialogue is so fun and creates great this tension between characters. The way the different characters feel distinct by their mannerisms and the way their different backgrounds are told are so well done.This is also carried by the amazing performances here. Every single actor gives it their all and really disappear into their role and without them giving their all, this movie would, again, be much lesser than it is. The standout is of course Samuel L. Jackson as Marquis Warren. Giving a commanding and room felling performance.The costume and set design are also great. The different characters also feel distinct by their wardrobe and all the different costumes look great. Same with the set of the cabin, it feels so well designed and detailed. There are so many things in the background, and it feels lived in and not like a set.The camerawork is also incredible. Using a what seems to be a wide lens. Tarantino creates these long frames, reminiscence of old cowboy movies. It creates some really creative and cool looking frames throughout. Although there was a thing in the last chapter I didn't like. It was a frame where the front- and background was in focus while something was unfocused. That annoyed my eyes.The movie also isn't as quirky as other Tarantino movies so when he does something like narration and especially unnecessary slow-motion, it really sticks out like a sore thumb and took me out of the movie.But my big problem was the lack of plot and substance. This movie is mostly about characters and relations but not much more. Sure it´s fun and entertaining throughout, but there isn't a lot to the movie. It has a ""who done it?"" aspect to it, that isn't done perfectly because of who did it. It kind of undermines that genre since the answer is kind of easy expect one aspect that is the big middle twist.Hateful eight is an entertaining watch throughout but other than that there isn't a lot to it. I think Tarantino wrote himself into a corner, trying to give himself too many challenges and rules to obey by, but ultimately fell flat because he thought characters and dialogue could save the entire movie. The movie just asks too much of its viewers, asking them for 3 hours, with a movie taking it´s time to ultimately nothing that grand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Django Bound by Stories,"Have you noticed how some people are better suited for a certain age? The teenage jock who was popular with girls looks miserable in middle age, the awkward bookish loner is finally comfortable in an adult skin. Think of Michael Madsen and Mel Gibson as the former. Some people are the best version of themselves early, others late. It's a blessing to be able to transcend self and evolve without qualms so that there's never early or late.I'm reminded of how immaturely Tarantino has aged every time I see him in interviews and compare with earlier memories. Starting out, he had infectious energy and a boyish charm that bulldozed through formality. He was natural as infant terrible. I'm talking about the person here, but as that factors into the work. Fresh was the word that came to mind to describe both Pulp Fiction and the person who made it.Now my gut reaction every time I see him is of a churlish, crude 50 year old, bloated in his idea of self-worth, the rock star carelessness of youth now registering as impatient sloppiness. I pick up a sense of combative inadequacy that comes with knowing that the best version of yourself is in your past. As if to make up for it, he's more absorbed with each year with the importance of his own filmic universe.His lack of growth in a cinematic sense is that he decided he wanted epic scope after a point but never bothered to learn how to use the camera. Leone grafted situational Italian humor only after he had mulled long and hard about the operatic fabric, being a Milanese maestro first and then a Roman joker. Tarantino pressed ahead with just bullish ego, writing, and visual effects. The result, starting with Kill Bill, was these lumbering patchworks of dialogue scenes and separate visual interludes and montages that linked actions.You will see this on display in very first few minutes of this. A theatric scene of dialogue, and then wholly separate a visual interlude of horses running in slow-motion. The first thirty minutes are colorfully snarled explanations about who each character is one after the other.But either by consequence or design, he wrote a set-bound story around a few characters this time, and once they hit the cabin, this eliminates most of his weak spots. Now the place imposes limits on how far he can sprawl. Now he doesn't have to be visual more than he was in Reservoir Dogs. This among his late work is the one that most recalls his early days of Dogs and Pulp Fiction.Different characters as unreliable narrators. The whodunit is inconsequential, the thrills come from reinventing characters and story. He is as inflammatory and provocative as ever but a lot of it comes from the swap of stories. A most harrowing scene that rivals Marsellus Wallace at the basement is obviously a story spun to elicit a reaction from the racist general. Offended pundits will be too angry by that point to notice that this Django is later emasculated and has to rely on the Confederate sheriff.All of the on-screen action is still crude and theatrical. Tarantino doctors viewpoints and has them swapped from the mouths of characters, none of it organic. But I perceive a more honest thing here, structured as it is around storytelling and mediated truth. He even offers a measure of emotional realization by the end; a letter that urges reconciliation in a divided country that he wrote to be able to make his way in a world ruled and bound by stories. It's all in the bittersweet timing of the reading; when he's a broken man who was bushwacked, not a cocky bastard.But the most marvelous thing in all of this I thought was Jennifer Leigh. Just look at what she does with so few words; it's all body language, face, posture, how she leans in. They're warden and prisoner with Russell but didn't you also get a sense of husband and (abused) wife? That's almost entirely Leigh. She gives a masterclass in embodied acting while everyone else struts like peacocks.The row about Oscars being white was obfuscation. The tragedy for me is that an actor of her caliber isn't gracing us yearly with works worthy of her. I see that Lynch has nabbed her already for Twin Peaks.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The eighth film about eight wretches,"""Eight"" - a western, combining elements of drama, comedy and detective. The director of this picture is a man who needs no introduction - Quentin Tarantino. Each of his film - an event in the world of cinema.Because of his talent as a scenarist, he twisted a simple story that its simplicity does not prevent you to have fun. Tarantino has always excellent scenarios and ""Eight"" is no exception. Duration of film is three hours and almost all of this time action unfolds in one large room, but the film does not look tired. Sometimes it seems that Tarantino was inspired by such films as "" Dial M for Murder»"" by Alfred Hitchcock and ""Panic Room"" by David Fincher, these movie is also conversational, and filmed in one indoors, but they are very interesting to watch. Tarantino is the king of dialogue, he is one of the few today who can transform an empty chatter into interesting squabbles between the characters that grab more abruptly of any action film. Characters is also very bright and memorable. They rapidly expanded in the course of the film, so you will change the attitude to almost every one of them. But they do not have a particular depth. Because characters are many and everyone is given an equal amount of screen time. Tarantino to the smallest detail described the fleeting attitude of the characters inside haberdashery, but to represent them outside of it very difficult. Their backstory did not have enough time and space, so that about life each one we can judge from the fragmentary information from the dialogues. The script came not perfect, but I was satisfied. Events in the film is so unpredictable that regularly receives gap pattern, enjoying spectacular dialogues, and subtle situational humor was diluted tensed to the limit atmosphere.As for installation, I liked it in general, but it has its own peculiarities. The film is literally a chamber, scale and wealth of locations is not here, but the room itself is where the action occurs, is very detailed. Brand Tarantino's violence in the film is present, but it also has been minimized. But the music, as always, at height, which was written by a talented Ennio Morricone. The film is very reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"", where the main action takes place in an enclosed space and the main stake was made on the dialogue and the relationship the characters. ""Eight"" is essentially a theatrical production and haberdashery shop is a stage beyond which there is absolutely nothing, but to break away from this play is still impossible, of course, there is a great merit of the actors. Cast in Tarantino movies is a real balm for the soul and the eyes of any movie lover. Michael Madsen is looks briskly. Samuel L. Jackson never fails to fascinate. Kurt Russell is slightly surprised, unusual to see him in such a brutal role, but here he looks like a glove. Jennifer Jason Leigh, perhaps, played a most interesting role. Tim Roth left mixed feelings, on the one hand, he played better than Jackson and Russell, but on the other I have visited many times the feeling that in its place should be Christoph Waltz. But most of all I was impressed by Walton Goggins himself and his character. The whole movie he is so consistent and so cool reveals at the end, that at some point even eclipsed Jackson. In general, in the acting of ""Eight"" - this is the second powerful force after the script, the quality of which is not subject to any doubt.Overall was excellent dialogue unpredictable film. Yes, sometimes it seems that it is too theatrical, but on the background of all - it is a strong Western, which is worth a look all fans of the genre, film lovers and fans of Tarantino.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Self-indulgence to some, sheer cinematic brilliance to others","Settling down to sit through Quentin Tarantino's eight film, The Hateful Eight, I was both excited and a little cautious. Excited because Tarantino has made some of my favourite films yet cautious because The Hateful Eight had a three hour runtime and there was a chance it could become a little self-indulgent.Tarantino has always been a bit of an acquired taste and he certainly has his critics, particularly of his last few efforts however, with The Hateful Eight, Tarantino has struck gold again. It's a tense game of Cluedo that, much like any Tarantino film, brings character and dialogue to the fore.John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter known as ""The Hangman"" who, with his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is on his way to Red Rock to hand her in and watch her hang. With a heavy blizzard on their tail, they pick up two stragglers in Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), also on their way to Red Rock.The plan is to make a stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge, and wait for the blizzard to blow over. What wasn't on the cards though was Minnie's being occupied by four strangers; Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), one of them not being who he says he is.Being a Tarantino film, you should know to expect long drawn out scenes of dialogue and the occasional explosion of violence. Both are very apparent from the film's opening scene and from that very moment, Tarantino holds you in a vice like grip and keeps you guessing at who's who until the final few moments of the film.It's the quality of writing again from Tarantino that helps make The Hateful Eight such an engrossing experience. His words and exchanges between the characters are so intricately written that switching off could lead to missing out on something pivotal to the film's plot. With The Hateful Eight mainly taking place in one location, it has to be spot on and thankfully it is. Much like Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, this is a dialogue driven film where each of the backstories will leave you guessing just as much as John Ruth and Marquis Warren.It's clear that Tarantino writes his films for certain actors and he is joined by a number of frequent collaborators such as Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Every member of the cast brings their own qualities to their respective characters and it makes for such great viewing when they're all firing each other like this.I loved pretty much all of the performances but for me the stand-outs were Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. Jackson performs the words of Tarantino like no other, Leigh doesn't have much to say in comparison yet she shines when she does get a word in and uses facial expressions often to comedic effect, and then there is Walton Goggins. Goggins had a bit part in Django Unchained and has been doing the rounds on television for a while but in The Hateful Eight, he gets his moment in the limelight and he sure as hell makes the most of it. I really enjoyed the performance of Channing Tatum too in his small role that I won't go too much into right now.I had heard that this was a violent film after its release across the pond on Christmas Day and yes, when it gets violent it really is quite violent however, like both Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, it seems more like a cartoon when the violence begins than in his previous films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. All the proceedings are accompanied by an original score from the legendary Ennio Morricone, his first complete Western score in 40 years.It may not be to everyone's taste and I don't quite know yet where it fits in my ranking of Tarantino films but The Hateful Eight is one hell of a treat in the first week of the new year. Don't let the runtime put you off as it simply flies by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

It must be a totally different experience, an awesome one! So if you can, just watch it this way. That being said, I'll simply add that the movie is full of awesome stuffs, from the cinematography to the dialogs, from the first shot to the last, I had a blast. It's closer to Reservoir Dogs than it is to Pulp Fiction, no surprise here, and it's a good choice to go back to those roots.AWESOME. Nothing else to say.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Twizard Rating: 100,"Don't go into this Quentin Tarantino film and expect it not to be over-the-top bloody. In fact, after the first hour and a half, you think maybe it's not going to be. Guess again. Perhaps Tarantino does this to create suspense during a time in the movie where tension comes merely from his captivating dialogue.Like a Steinbeck novel, taking several pages to paint the scene and get to know the situation in order to make it live in our heads, The Hateful Eight doesn't rush anything. Some may not like this approach, but it's done in order for us to live in the world that has been created.The pacing starts off slower than usual, but builds at a consistent pace. Every word that is spoken is positioned very carefully. This is what Tarantino shines at. He doesn't make boring dialogue and he doesn't waste pages. If he makes a three hour movie, it's going to be for a reason.The Hateful Eight is a western mystery in the style of Reservoir Dogs. Kurt Russell plays a bounty hunter who is bringing his prisoner, Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to the town of Red Rock for her to be hanged. Along the way, he picks up Marquis (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who soon becomes the main protagonist of the film.Jackson is always at his very best when teamed up with Tarantino--a fact that has been proved time and time again. His tumult matches up perfectly with the director's exploitation style of filmmaking.Leigh's performance might be this year's best. She does an incredible job, and without saying much, controls the tone of the entire film with her insanely believable machination. You stop and ask yourself if they picked up the actress from the looney bin before filming.Everything is perfect, from the camera-work to the set pieces to the enthralling musical score. I attended the 70mm Roadshow screening, which is a unique experience in itself, fully equipped with a large program and a 10-minute intermission.If you like Tarantino, you will surely like this movie, but if you're not a fan of his gruesome flair, then be warned that this one is probably his most violent.It doesn't have quite the same impact as, say, Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained, but it's refreshing to see a neo-Western done so simply, yet not by-the-numbers. It might not be the story you were hoping for following his previous two, but as far as filmmaking goes, The Hateful Eight may be the year's most solid selection.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Occasionally a fun ride, but unsatisfying","Massively self-indulgent but the upside is Tarantino's indulgence is at least skillful, so we'll take it. Acting and cinematography are superb. Tarantino, too, adds his own flavor of wokeness which, like Django, straddles the uncertain line between commentary and exploitation trash. If we're offended, we can just dismiss it as another over-the-top ingredient of Tarantino's style. If we love it, then the table-turning has satisfying gore galore.In the end (which takes FOREVER to get to), the fault is Tarantino's. This is a beautiful gift box with too little inside. It certainly isn't empty, but it's a lot less than you expected. Even by the time the blood starts to spill, you're not shocked, just tired. And we've seen it before. We know the drill. It just took an extra hour to get there this time around. Oh, and not only that, it was better the other times.The only reason to re-watch Hateful 8 is to count up all the plot holes. The set up is so contrived and Rube Goldberg it beggars belief, even by Tarantino's standards. ""But but but if you go back to those old exploitation flicks he's drawing from, they also had a myriad of implausible contrivances."" Well, that's true, so does that get him yet another pass? Maybe so, but it's really starting to feel less like a fresh take and more like a crutch.Hateful 8 is a 5/10 film that becomes a 6/10 or 7/10 depending on how much the acting and gorgeous visuals move you, but make no mistake, it's not a great film and it's one of Tarantino's weakest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Better than Django,"Solid movie, even better then Django. Bought into the humour and its characters. Funny and very gory. Enjoyed every minute of it, also had a great ending.

Visually stunning and funny too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Gore aplenty spoils a tense Hitchcokian tale,"I always approach a Quentin Tarantino film with a degree of nervous excitement. The nerves arise since the levels of gratuitous violence in his films is about 2 notches above the level I personally find comfortable. The excitement comes from the fact that the guy is an undisputed genius of storytelling through film.The Hateful 8, Tarantino's 8th film, is a case in point. Even the opening titles are gripping: Ennio Morricone's insistent and stressful theme just sends a shiver of expectation through you.Kurt Russell plays John Ruth - a Boba Fett of the old West - famous for always winning his bounty by bringing in his prizes alive for the hangman rather than dead as offered. This time it's the murderous Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) chained to his wrist, heading in a stagecoach to her 'final destination' in Red Rock. Also taking his prizes to Red Rock (in a less healthy state) is fellow bounty hunter Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson). But Red Rock is a good distance away and a blizzard has other ideas. In the middle of nowhere, the group are snowed in at ""Minnie's haberdashery""with an assortment of others including Tim Roth (with an appropriate job) and Bruce Dern (as a former confederate war hero). Are they all who they seem to be? (That's a rhetorical question - you can guess the answer).I just loved the start of this film. The claustrophobic nature of the stagecoach scenes (a vehicle fitted with the most amazingly smooth suspension for the age!) and the set-up of the lead characters were somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's classic ""Stagecoach"" (but with added violence). There are some glorious shots (an attaboy to Tarantino's regular cinematographer Robert Richardson) of the Colorado landscapes, and Tarantino clearly got a new drone for Christmas: the camera skims through the tree-tops as the stagecoach proceeds through the snowy landscape. A close up of the galloping horses to another piece of classic Morricone music is just breathtaking.Once we arrive at Minnie's, the tone changes, more akin to classic Hitchcock's like ""Rope"" or ""Rear Window"" and this segment is equally gripping. With dramatic cut-aways and clever editing, the tension builds and you are constantly waiting for the wave to break.What emerges is just how unpleasant all of the 8 protagonists really are. It takes some of the other cast (the list is not limited to eight) acting 'normally' to make you realize just how inured to the violence and hate you have become.When the proverbial brown stuff does hit the fan, it hits it big style with gore a-plenty. While the whole thing is done with significant style and Tarantino's usual brand of jet-black humor, in my view it goes way over the top. There are some clips I would wish to ""un-see"", and the film is poorer as a result. It would be fascinating for Tarantino to film a more accessible ""PG"" version of the film, that builds on the mystery and tension of the story rather than his usual crutch of shock factor violence.The standout performances for me were from Russell and Jason-Leigh, the latter spitting blood, teeth and acidic comments spectacularly. (As an aside of movie trivia, Jason-Leigh is the daughter of Vic Morrow, the marvelous character actor who was so tragically killed by a helicopter during the filming of ""The Twilight Zone"" movie. Her dad would be proud of her here).The most annoying performance for me comes from Roth, with a highly affected English accent that grates enormously.If you like big, bold, entertaining yet astonishingly violent spectacles then this is for you. If you are high on the ""Love Actually"" scale, this is one you might like to miss. By the way, if you do go i recommend woolly socks and a jumper - it might not be cold in the cinema, but after getting on for 3 hours of this film with all that snow, you WILL start to feel the cold.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

Tarantino at his best,"I have grown to admire Tarantino's work as a director despite his obession with the use of the ""N word"" in some of his movies. Jango and Inglorious being my two favorites of his, even over cult classic pulp fiction. Not a huge fan of his most recent outing with over hyped once upon a time but the Hateful Eight was his last good film in my opinion. Tarantino at his best with a good script and great tension building along with good cinematography, The Hateful Eight despite being in one location and being originally made for a stage play, it's quite entertaining and keeps my attention throughout with good characters and cast chemistry. Tarantino's ability to use actors to speak loudly with their body language without sometimes saying a word is very unique. I also was very inspired how Tarantino went old school and brought back the formality of how movie premieres were done way back in the day with his limited 70mm screenings with even well made brochures and a small gift handed out about the filmmaking process before the movie, it brought a sense of awe back to cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Average in a sea of spectacular Tarantino films.,"It seemed like Tarantino movies were on the course to the stratosphere. His new movies out performed his already amazing previous movies in creative and brilliant ways. I walked out of Django Unchained saying to myself, it's a treat to be alive as we witness Tarantino continue to do what only he can do. As you can imagine, my expectations were at their all time high for The Hateful Eight.In my opinion, this movie was missing Tarantino's signature. The dialogue, plot, and acting performances were all missing a level of his style of cleverness. Cleverness is replaced with explainable logic and reason due to previous events in the back-story. Nothing seemed to happen that was not expected. There was no character development, no clear protagonist or antagonist, and no character to identify with or particularly like. The story seemed to unfold mostly in one afternoon, on a mere few dots on a map.Did I miss something? Maybe I was too distracted by the details and didn't get the social commentary, overall message, or the new frontiers reached in cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Massive bomb-ola! Stinker.,"I total waste of time unless you want to see yet another flick with Samuel L. Jackson's Boston terrier face. Laughable. Stupid. Lurid. Seamy. Visual sewage. Typical Tarantino. He trashes the American Western as he has trashed every other genre he has recycled. The product of a dirty mind and a diseased imagination. There is not a single redeeming quality to this mess. The time has passed in America when this kind of crap was popular because of the salacious and ugly content. The reviewers are generally bought and paid for, so this give the kind of reviews that will send more money their way. Of course, most of them have a perverted desire for the hideous anyway. We can only hope that this stinker ends Tarantino's flatulent career.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hate Filled 8th,"Seems a huge pity movies like this even find an audience let alone progress beyond the scripting stage. That people have lowered their expectations to Tarantino's sub-standard content is incomprehensible. Some misguided individuals tend to think sensationalist 'nigger' calling (among endless other perversions) coupled with violence on both sides, acts as a deterrent for racial bias, not so - it's more likely to encourage it! Looking at just one aspect of the technical dept; Producer/distributors like the Weinsteins will foolishly give this hugely overrated movie maker large sums of money to play out his immature fantasies, so they can garner profits from his folly. Who else would be fool enough to indulge him with a budget that allows for Filming in Ultra Panavision 70mm? – especially for a film where up to 90% of story takes place in a dingy snow bound cabin?! It's also little wonder this director covers himself by using the same cinematographer for the majority of his works - without this talented chap to grace his titles they would probably look rather limp. With all this money and talent, technical reality is still thrown away with the obvious over lighting of a set - which in all historic fact, could only have been a dim candle lit situation – sure we all want to see the subject but, such super bright led lighting in the 1800's is rather ludicrous.Taking a quick look at the moral dept; Further testimonies to a general lowering of standards can be found within some of the analyses written about the subjects of these movies. When third rate hatred and ultra violence replaces intelligent observation or character study - it shows critics and fans have allowed themselves to become blinkered. Some, unbelievably, argue these movies are serious studies of social history, while completely overlooking the simpleton approach taken with dialogue, characterisations, and historical accuracy. Only an industry out to make profits from over the top graphic violence and obscenity would defend these actions - against claims made by numerous health professionals the world over. In one particularly repugnant sequence a victim is stripped naked at gunpoint, forced to walk through snow, then told they would be spared if they performed fellatio while the perpetrator screamed obscenities – only to be shot through the head at the end of the act. What is this if not the writer/director's own perversions being acted out on screen? So much extended moronic nonsense is thrown at the audience including someone being shot between the legs at point blank range, then somehow being able to laugh while they drag a woman's body (dangling at the end of a hangman's rope) up and over a ceiling rafter - with the energy to hold her struggling body in the air till she dies. It beggars belief that anyone could write such trash let alone commit it to film. What's in the minds of those who laud this stuff? - certainly not intelligence or any understanding of morality.Prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone said after his first collaboration with Tarantino he would never work with him again. Tarantino knowing the value of having Morricone's name on his credits - simply made an offer he could not refuse, giving even more of the producers finances to entice him back. While the Academy saw fit to award an Oscar to the score, it remains just another re-run of earlier Morricone works and sounds every bit like the composer never saw a frame of the movie (which he didn't!). Morricone was 'too busy' to look at any of the footage and simply sent in a score that, many others agree, was then rather poorly used in the final cut. Such an odd business. Yet again Tarrantino copies Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (+ others) right down to the over-length 3hr running time (someone should introduce him to the cutting room floor). The endless episodic 'Chapters' and somewhat corny voice-over, at times reduce the pace to a plodding bore.If this is Tarantino's 8th movie – then spare us the 9th and 10th. Hang up your guns or consider turning them on yourself and spare the world any further sludge.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"""No One Comes Up Here Without A Damn Good Reason""",""" The Hateful Eight"" fulfills the promise, making his 8th film a real QT project "".Every human being has the ability to dictate a good or bad verdict regarding a film seen, everyone have the opportunity, 'Star Wars' has its bad and good side but Tarantino films it is impossible to find the negative side. With 52 years of life, "" a film by Quentin Tarantino "" tag is the main reason attend a theater, regardless of history, cast, or none of these, is only Quentin. Relatively this director ever have a bad project, so ""T. H. E."" is one of his best weapons to be dazzled.Quentin has broken the tradition of 2015 (remakes and a interesting thing) creating a new epic world, but occasionally introducing small variations of ""Reservoir Dogs"". One of the characters most hated, in a cabin, having to wait two sweet hours while a storm passes, What bad could happen? No one there is who appears to be. Like any Tarantino film is remote strictly to the experiences of the odious eight. This man is a master that all can do, and I think more than difficult, unnecessary to create a theatrical piece (possibility) of this beautiful and unique work, serious as adapted Mad Max.Tarantino is a guy who has been steeped in the world of the cinema since childhood, absorbing every good material that looked to translate it into their own and original projects (directing and writing) so this guy knows what it does.Beyond a beautiful costume, the details of the time, production design or any of all the perfect items, the established location is the best way to start, a western in the snow.It is very bold picking a desolate place to lock up for some reason a group of strangers.From the moment in which the film opens, show majestic landscapes, a strong snowfall and a muddy Jesus Christ of snow, we knew that was going to be quite an adventure. It's funny to think that a film's lasting 3 hours and 7 minutes did not come to feel tense and boring, instead of this, its suspicion and intrigue going on the rise, generating in the spectator an enjoyable experience.Anyone who is seen the 8 films of director, could tell that own merit and as it is logical the first lines are for his most repetitive actor, Samuel L. Jackson who has collaborated with the director for the sixth time. When this black man opens his mouth, already is deserved a nomination for the Award Academy. Throughout history, the film is told in a way that personally I had never seen, making his film a proposal different to all evidenced today in day. As you might imagine, this film has continuity thanks to many matches, that the way in which Quentin implanted it everything looks the way more natural.One of the most frequent clichés among viewers and modern dramas is to point at first sight a hero implemented as the main character, However, who could be the hero here, where no one is good? He renews this constant with a smart and fresh variation on the rotation of each of the members, being impossible to point to the protagonist. But I feel very subjectively, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson will steal the limelight. Come to a stop (Minnie) really when everything feels strange, creating in the audience, What could happen?A true lover of the films of this guy can say that one of the primary aspects of atmosphere to empathize more in history are the intractable and typical scores for his films where in this case chose to Ennio Morricone to form tension, achieving very well.The storm is long and continuous, creating an atmosphere breathtakingly stressful. More of one we share the view to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in this film and ""Anomalisa"" is a complete pleasure. The title is accurate, and not to be the eighth Tarantino film is called ""Eight"" if not for call ""Hateful"". The Quentin formulas can be a little confusing, but it does explain at the end each parameter that seemed difficult to understand at the beginning. There are several scenes of duo for highlighted, one of them is the individualistic ability of Samuel and Dern generate one battle of a sentence against another, a total feast.Undoubtedly, Quentin latest invention has become my favorite, the film more Tarantino. Beautifully photographed and directed 'The Eight' hides too much of some characters through shots and hits. Tarantino is one of my best directors capturing all explicitly as it imagines, not afraid to show a nudity, fellatio, and too much blood, just by caring for the rating and not the chance to fill his pockets of money not to allow the entry of young people. Violence in this work is essential and fun, even to look like a gore. This project does not disappoint being shooting in the 70mm majestic. It's outrageous and insolent lack of participation in the 2016 awards season, taking a film gem in their hands. For Tarantino fans, ""The Hateful Eight"" will be the best Christmas gift, because it is one of the best films of the decade, Tarantino and the general film world,¡Thanks Quentin!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of the Most Uneven Movies I've Ever Seen,"Quentin Tarantino is finally becoming the very thing he tries most to resist: a cliché.I've continued to defend Tarantino against critics of his films who claim he does nothing but peddle in senseless violence and that he's made a career out of borrowing other filmmakers' styles rather than develop one of his own. But after ""Django Unchained"" and now ""The Hateful Eight,"" I'm finding my interest in defending him starting to wane.After reading the divisive reactions to ""The Hateful Eight,"" many of which confirmed my sinking suspicions that I would be in for yet another pointless bloodbath like ""Django,"" I found myself pleasantly surprised by the film's first half. Tarantino's penchant for creating colorful characters and giving them juicy dialogue is in full force, and he's assembled again a cast of actors who, even if in some cases aren't really good actors, are able to convince you for the length of this film that they are because they sound so good saying the things they're given to say. And some of them ARE good actors, like Jennifer Jason Leigh who steals the show as a degenerate gang leader, and who knows exactly how to land every joke Tarantino throws out, which are numerous and which make the first half a riot. But the movie, after all the rambling dialogue and plot exposition, has to eventually come to a conclusion, and unfortunately, Tarantino has seemingly lost all ability to end a movie in any way other than killing off all of his characters as gruesomely and graphically as possible. The very violence that used to give his movies punch and get people talking has now become boring and routine and, worst of all, predicable. I watched the end of this film play out and thought, ""he gives us this great set up and these great actors and this is the only thing he can think of to do with it all?""Tarantino has taken a lot of heat for being misogynistic and racist. I don't think he's a misogynist -- nothing happens to Leigh's character that wouldn't just as easily happen to any of the men, and in his own way Tarantino gives us a rather feminist character in his refusal to concede anything to Leigh's gender; she's as nasty, if not even more so, a piece of work as any of the male characters. As far as racism goes, I don't think Tarantino's a racist either, but I'm not sure what he's trying to say about race relations. If ""The Hateful Eight"" is any indication, he's saying that blacks have been so mistreated by whites that they are now free to do whatever they want to the white man with the added bonus of it being hilarious because it's so deserving. In this complicated and sensitive time of revived racial conflict, this is a poorly-timed moment to address the topic in so juvenile and facile a manner.""The Hateful Eight"" is above anything else one of the most uneven movies I've seen in a long time. It can't settle on a tone or a point of view. It's too long, too excessive, and Tarantino clings too rigidly to tricks (like topsy-turvy chronology) that have made his previous movies interesting but now just seem so tired. One thing I can unequivocally say the film has going for it is its magnificent score, courtesy of Ennio Morricone, who won a well-deserved Oscar for it. The rest of the film's not a wash, but it did leave me feeling like it's time for Tarantino to crawl out of the sandbox and start playing with the big boys.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of Tarantino's heaviest films.,"This is a Tarantino film that emphasizes every bit of content in this film. The characters, the environment, the food they eat, the liquor they drink, etc. Nothing in this film is not addressed in some point or another. One of his most dialogue heavy films, and one of his most gruesome films as well.Everybody in this film gave an amazing performance. Has one of my favorite Samuel Jackson characters ever, followed by the phenomenally cast Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kurt Russell, making for a great duo. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth were a little underplayed but still fun to watch. The cinematic view is glorious, even if it is all mostly shot in a cabin. Though few, the shots of mountains with horseback carriages in the distance makes for some beautiful scenery. Once again, this has one of the longest screenplays in any other Tarantino. Every scene has at least five fifteen minute discussions about a backstory, or some food or the cabin or the owners of the cabin. Many critics have considered it one of his slowest movies, though it is filled with story and it makes you feel informed throughout.Hateful Eight is right, because this is one of the most hateful, mean spirited movies ever, with probably the highest number of N- words in any movie. Even those who have an understanding are at each other's throats in this. There is zero friendliness in here. I will admit I was hoping for less white and black confrontation in this, since that's a big discussion in the film, and it feels worn at this moment in Tarantino's career.Overall, It's very different from what he's done in the past, and it's better than his two recent films. Even though it isn't perfect, it's a story to remember with some very colorful characters and plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
a movie with no reason for being,"I'm a very big fan of Tarantino's earlier work. I thought Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were, in their way, important movies. He was saying something very relevant to the world of cinema about the difference between movie violence and real violence, especially in the nineties on the heels of the action craze of the eighties.Indirectly he was saying that we romanticize these types of events and people, but really they're just a bunch of normal guys who tell stupid jokes, talk about nothing, and screw up their job, which are despicable. The hit men in Pulp Fiction aren't superhuman killing machines - they're two jerkoffs who get paid to kill people; sometimes they're cool, and sometimes they're stupid, just like regular guys.But starting with Kill Bill, it felt like Tarantino had begun to run out of things to say. Those two movies, which would have been one good movie if anyone had the balls to edit him, were really just about themselves. It was more of a series of compelling scenes than it was a single coherent story. But there was a voice in there, and there were things being said.This movie is the ultimate expression of that trend. It has no reason for existing, other than itself. The story isn't compelling or new, and there's no new angle on it that makes you see things in a different way. The dialogue comes across as extremely self-aware and fake, even for a Tarantino film.Even some of the visuals seem poorly executed and the tone is a little choppy. For example, early in the movie he's apparently trying to create a sense of claustrophobia by cutting between the outside of the wagon, with the tiny shelter of the wagon contrasted with the brutal, all-encompassing blizzard, and the conversation on the inside. But the conversation is kind of ridiculous, and the framing makes it seem almost comical, which completely undercuts the tone that it seems like he's trying to set.Even if it weren't a pointless movie, it would be far from his best work. But when you take the relatively minor flaws in the structure of the film, and combine them with the fact that the movie has nothing to say, you end up asking yourself why he bothered to make it, and why you bothered to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Entertainment for a mentally ill culture that is sick and demented,"I knew very little about Tarantino so I had no idea what I was getting into. After researching a little deeper, after being extremely disturbed watching this movie, I found his expertise seems to be in entertaining people who love to see humans tortured, dismembered, exploded, etc. What amazes me the most is that we live in a culture in which many love this kind of thing. This is beyond violence or even horror. It is simply a demented mind feeding other demented minds who have a thirst for the most gruesome and sick violence imaginable. This should not be rated R. It should have its own rating created for it that is much worse than R.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"I hated ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015)","""The Hateful Eight"" (2015) might be the first Quentin Tarantino film that I entirely disliked. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10 for being an overlong, overwrought story inhabited exclusively by irritating, overly stylized characters who are constantly shouting. It was alternately boring and grotesque. It even managed to occasionally be glumly depressing, given the violence it depicts against defenseless innocents.And I'm surprised, because this movie was highly recommended to me by my college-aged nephew - he's a smart kid whose judgment I trust. I certainly hope that he has seen Tarantino's classic ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), as that movie seems to be this one's direct inspiration. Throughout ""The Hateful Eight's"" lengthy running time (it clocks in at just over three hours), I kept thinking that this was a failed effort to transplant ""Reservoir Dogs'"" story setup to the old west.That probably was the director's strategy here. You see an attempt to recreate all of the story elements that made the earlier movie a success: quirky characters; idiosyncratic dialogue; unexpected violence; tragedy; and black humor.Regrettably, it just didn't work. The movie was so long - and so loud - that it even made priceless performers like Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson and Tim Roth come off as annoying.For me, the movie's sole bright spot was Jennifer Jason Leigh's damned terrific portrayal of the plot-driving, brutal gangster, Daisy Domergue. I had no idea that Leigh had such incredible range (not to mention some Vaudeville-style comic timing). Her performance isn't enough to redeem the movie, but it surprised me and easily stole the show.Look - if this is the first Tarantino movie you've seen, then please don't let it dissuade you from seeing the man's other work. Seriously, go watch ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996).https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A movie to see over and over,This movie has a lot of great acting. The characters of the this movie are well played. It is violent but I find it also very funny at times. The music and scenery fit right in with whole creativity of the film.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Wonderful masterpiece from Tarantino,"A snowy western with exceptional cinematography and captivating mysterious characters! I love everything about Hateful Eight, I think Quentin Tarantino can't do a bad film. Every cast member is a delight throughout even with grotesque violence that occurs, there's great amount of tension/suspense in the bulk of the film. I'm happy with how things play out especially with the music I'm glad that won an Oscar! Walton Goggins is perfect for this, I love most anything he's in. Long winded runtime but well worth it I recommend see this Tarantino fan or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino is HUGE!,"First of allI haven't read any critics yet, I went to see this movie because I love Tarantino, that was it! So, before you continue I will be honest. if you like bloody but artsy movies go, you will love it, but if you are the Disney time this is not your movie, you will not enjoy it at all! About the movie: As always it has an incredible photography and art direction; also it has an incredible cast that always amaze you and connect you to the characters. The plot was great, it has some turns that make you confused and never allows you to have a theory that you can keep for more than 20 minutes. I loved every second of it, it was funny, bloody, well directed, with an amazing photography and settings and it was full of killing and bad words!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""Got room for one more?""","The Hateful Eight is directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern.Some years after the Civil War, in the cold winter of Wyoming, a hangman and his prisoner stumble upon a bounty hunter looking for a ride in their stagecoach. With conversations had and deals made, they head up a way until they bump into a soon-to-be Sheriff. The only thing these folks seem to have in common is their destination: Red Rock. But on their journey they are forced to hold up at a stagecoach stopover cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery until the blizzard calms. As time passes by, the eight folk start to get a little eager to figure out who each of the men really are...Firstly, I was lucky enough to attend a special roadshow event for this movie, and I am glad I spent the (now incredibly reasonable) £20 ticket admission price. The movie was presented in Ultra Panavision 70 and projected on the classic Cinerama single-projector system. There was a musical overture to start, with an intermission after the first act of the movie. We were also given programs as memorabilia. This is a roadshow. And since the 50s-60s, hasn't been done in this fashion. Tarantino was very specific and direct in how he wanted to shoot, and present this movie, and has done so, wonderfully. Special thanks to the staff at ODEON Leicester Square; working the projectors - a seamless run, with no problems.The Hateful Eight is an experiment, of sorts. Tarantino wanted to see what would happen if he threw eight strange and compelling characters together in a small space and see what would happen. This is reminiscent of his first movie, Reservoir Dogs, yet has so much more strength in character background and screenplay that it completely blows it out of the park. He has a drive to get long, beautiful and interesting shots that can last 30 seconds to 1 minute, with no cuts. The opening shot lasts around a minute or two, with the full credits of cast and crew appearing on screen with haunting music by legendary Maestro, Ennio Morricone. When you're watching a Tarantino movie, you're getting an experience that no one else can deliver quite the same way.The acting all around is just outstanding. The 'hateful eight' are incredibly strong characters that interact with each other with so much energy that it would be ridiculous if it were to miss out on Awards season. From Russell and Jackson, to Jason Leigh and Roth; the charisma in both taking everything they've got to portray these characters as Tarantino imagined, and delivering lines, was spot-on. They are genuine, realistic performances.The script is roaring with strength throughout, with quotable lines and humour. This is something that needs to be perfect, or near-perfect in a movie. But with The Hateful Eight, being a dialogue-driven event, it needed to be interesting. Tarantino has worked up a wondrous script with so much life and passion that it completely takes control of the movie and doesn't let up one bit until the credits roll. This is how you make a good western. It has that classic ""who done it"" thriller genre nailed down tightly. There hasn't been one like this for a long time, so it's much needed.Music by Ennio Morricone is hauntingly beautiful, making a big return to the western scoring front after 40 years, with original music bleeding through the landscapes and performances by all of the cast. I had listened to the score before seeing the movie and was curious to see how it fitted with the picture, but Morricone being the genius that he is completely changed the way I listen to the score. It fits perfectly with the story. This could be one of the last western scores that he releases, and I believe it's a triumphant return.Visual effects are few and far between but if you're familiar with Tarantino's work then you know there's some violence and gore in there somewhere, which is correct, and it's over the top and extremely bloody. Which I'm a huge fan of, so I was absolutely loving it. There's more I could say but that would eventually mean spoiling and that's something I really try to avoid.My verdict; The Hateful Eight kicks off 2016 in style, with the largest 70mm release in over 20 years. If you have the chance, get to a cinema that's screening the movie in film, it's absolutely worth the price of admission. Quentin Tarantino is still on his filmmaking high and I'm sure will continue this reign of storytelling for years to come.The Hateful Eight, 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Pretty good movie,"This is my first review in almost 7years of using IMDb. I'm really surprised by all the bad reviews people are giving this movie.What's not to like? Simple and fluid plot, good acting, good directing and usual Tarantino visual effects and maybe mediocre cinematography. If you're hating the movie, you should go watch something like avengers. I'm not saying Avengers is a bad movie, but you know what I'm talking about... It's a good movie indeed, if you're a Tarantino fan, you should watch it. If you like movies that happen mostly on a stage, you should also watch it. If you expect to see a western/action movie, this movie is not right for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino western,"If you like Tarantino's style of telling a story with intrigue and surprise, you'll going to like this movie. For me it was a little bit too long with its three hour clocking time. But then again I'm not the biggest Tarantino fan, so if if you're a fan you probably won't complain. The characters are interesting, with some great actors. I liked the beginning the most when it's the outdoor traveling setting, but most of the movie actually takes place inside a cabin. In a way it's like a stage play because it's all about the characters. I personally like more about stories that have different places but that's just a matter of taste.I think there is a Kurosawa-feel in the plot, and knowing Tarantino's fashion of snatching ideas from old movies, I wouldn't be surprised if he took the plot idea from some samurai film. This is just guessing.Quite safe to say that if you like Tarantino, you like this film, and if you don't you probably don't like it. I'm somewhere in the middle admitting it's well made but not a personal favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hateful Eight: Tarantino is back,"First of all, let me say this: Quentin Tarantino is my favorite film director of all time. Yes, even better than Scorsese, Fincher, Spielberg or Kubrick. So, I had pretty high expectations on the Hateful Eight, the new Western by Tarantino. Let me explain you how and why these expectations were met.All you need to know about the plot of the Hateful Eight has been said in the trailers. Eight strangers are stuck in a lonely cottage, due to a blizzard. You don't need to know more and you shouldn't know more than that, before watching the film. These strangers are played by Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russel, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Like in Inglourious Basterds and Pulp Fiction the film is divided into chapters. Most of the movie takes place in said cottage. The story overall is very thrilling and unpredictable. While the first half of the movie consist almost entirely out of dialogues, the second half is more typical Tarantino.The acting in the Hateful Eight is superb. Especially Sam Jackson, Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh do their job very well. Like people are expecting, when it comes to Sam Jackson, his character is pure badass and Jennifer Jason Leigh even got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a supporting role. Tim Roth, Kurt Russell and Bruce Dern also play their parts with excellence. Channing Tatum has as well a small role, which he also plays good (Yes, I know it's Channing Tatum, but Tarantino once even managed to make Til Schweiger play OK, so why not Tatum?). The script is brilliant and very quotable, even for Tarantino standards. Sam Jackson's character also has a few very intelligent and interesting monologues.One of the most anticipated features of the Hateful Eight was the soundtrack. Tarantino is known for using music, composed by Ennio Morricone, since Kill Bill. However, for the first time, apart from one single song in Django Unchained, Morricone composes new original score for a Tarantino movie. Ennio Morricone is, together with John Williams, my most beloved film composer. The soundtrack overall is excellent and fitting. Although I think Star Wars VII, which has great music too, will win the Oscar for Best Original Score, I hope Morricone gets the honor.I find the Hateful Eight to be Quentin's fourth best film to date, right after Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained and Pulp Fiction. Beautiful visual, amazing and unpredictable story, many characters with unique traits, excellent acting and all the things that are typical Tarantino. 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
So bad that I walked out of the theater,"This is only the second time in my life that a movie was so bad that I had to leave the theater. I stayed in the theater until the last 15 minutes of this long and disgusting film, which was an hour and a half longer than I should have stayed. Please don't take a child to see this film. If you like movies that try to shock you with the gory violence of blood and brain splatter then you'll like it. Most of us can sit through a certain amount of violence for a great story line, but the story line was weak, making the violence intolerable. I hated this film so much that it caused me to write my very first movie review to help you save your money, your time, and leaving the theater with an awful feeling in the pit of your stomach!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Disappointing Eight,"The Hateful Eight (2015)** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino's latest has bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) transporting his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) through a blizzard on the way to her hanging. Along the way they pick up Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and soon they're taking shelter in a small room with a number of colorful characters.Tarantino is one of my favorite writer-directors but THE HATEFUL EIGHT did very little for me. I wish I could point my finger to anyone but Tarantino but sadly he's to blame for this film, which is shockingly boring. I never once thought I'd call a Tarantino picture boring but THE HATEFUL EIGHT clocks in at nearly three hours when it probably would have felt too long at even just ninety minutes. Obviously the biggest villain here is the screenplay, which contains non-stop dialogue that adds up to nothing.Again, it's hard to believe that this here is a Tarantino screenplay because all of his wonderful talents just aren't on display here. If it wasn't for the ""N"" word constantly being thrown around then I'd be willing to bet the writer had nothing to do with this piece. What's so shocking is that we've got nearly three hours worth of talking going on and very little of it is interesting. I get what Tarantino was going for but I don't think it works on any level. The setting is mostly one room and I'm sure the film was supposed to build suspense throughout but it never does. Once the incredibly graphic violence happens towards the end you're just counting the bodies until the end credits start.There are some good moments scattered throughout the film. I thought Russell and Jackson were both very good in their roles and they do what they can with the material. The Oscar-nominated Jennifer Jason Leigh easily steals the movie as the racist trash who is hiding a few secrets of her own. With such boring dialogue it really makes you feel that there are too many characters so Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern and Michael Madsen just do what they can. Ennio Morricone's score is another plus the film has going for it and the 70mm cinematography is also extremely good but it also seems wasted being trapped inside a building.THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a disappointing movie on so many levels. It never really feels like the era that it takes place and I'd argue that it really comes across more of a stage play or, worse yet, a rehearsal for a stage play. While there are some good things scattered throughout the picture, at the end of the day this is a complete misfire.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A movie of a play,"The first thing I would say after watching this movie is that it is very Tarantino but unlike any of his previous movies. It is a character based drama in the Western genre. The focus is on characterisation and morality. Please do not watch of you are expecting an action- packed film. Instead, this is a stage drama: a limited setting that allows exploration of the characters and the interpersonal relationships between them. The setting could almost be a microcosm for modern day America. There are no likable characters within this: they truly are a hateful eight. However, this does not make the viewer disengage. Instead, interest in each of them is heightened as you attempt to work out the truths and lies. A thoroughly enjoyable journey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Or Worst Tarantino Film? Neither,"I felt that The Hateful 8 was, if not Tarantino's BEST, it certainly ranks among his best work. Cinematography? Fantastic. The open landscapes slowly closing in by way of the snowstorm until finally we are trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery is enhanced and made more immediate by his choice to use the 70mm Panavision process. Script? Maybe not his greatest, but it certainly was as well written and nuanced as his previous work. Acting? Tarantino has a way of taking less well known and under-appreciated actors and bringing out their best work. Overall it's not perfect, but it is engaging in spite of its length.What I specifically want to address is the reaction both this film and Django received over the use of certain racial terms and the violence. Although working in a different medium, Tarantino's work strongly resembles Frank Zappa's in one very specific way. Zappa made some of the most important and intricate music of the 20th century and cloaked it in some of the most misogynistic and ugly lyrics ever written. BUT those terms and images were there to make a point and to remove the closed minded in the audience at the start. Tarantino is much the same. If you cannot get past the violence and apparent racism/sexism in his work, you probably won't get or appreciate the rest. Tarantino was making a point about race relations in the US and he did it well. What he said needed saying. And I don't see many minority directors willing to go as far out on a limb as he did to say it.Also, Tarantino is criticized for ""ripping off"" genres and directors. In my opinion what he is doing is very much the same as DJ and Hip Hop culture sampling earlier works and making something new out of them. By remixing tropes from earlier films, Tarantino is not only making NEW art, he is paying homage to earlier work AND he is satirizing those tropes at the same time.I honestly don't believe Tarantino's talent will be appreciated in his lifetime. He's too far ahead of most of his audience. More's the pity for them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A must see masterpiece.,"It is all about the atmosphere. Winter... Snowy Wyoming surroundings drowning in blinding blizzardy coldness. A warm cabin in the middle of nowhere. See the contrast here? Warm and cold, good and bad, alive and dead... In their reviews, many people are complaining that the film is somewhat lengthy, chatty, and gruesome and all that stuff. Hey, it is Tarantino, baby! As a matter of fact, the movie is so much fun to watch! Every part of it is filled with wit conversations, great acting and suspense. Every word uttered by the cast is well measured and precise. Samuel L. Jackson's lines are mesmerizing and catchy. The best thing about the movie, is that it really makes you wanna see it over again, now that you know what the deal was about... It is kinda cool!) Remember, QT makes the movies that lasts long. And this one will definitely will stay with you.

Brilliant first half ruined by the second half,"The first half of The Hateful Eight is absolutely amazing. I was glued to the screen. The director managed to create an atmosphere similar to that of John Carpenter's The Thing, which is one of the ingredients for making not just great, but a timeless movie.During the time when movie was focused on Kurt Russell AND Samuel L. Jackson, the movie was amazing, easily a 10 out of 10.Unfortunately, at the start of the second half, the director made some dumb choices, which broke the flow of the movie and made me disappointed.It's still worth watching, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A brilliant film with twists and turns the Tarantino way,"I decided that no film ever, never mind another Tarantino film, would surpass Pulp Fiction. I never would believe it. Well, I am not here to lie to you people, but this film unfortunately didn't do it. But I have to say, it definitely delivered in film terms, and definitely didn't disappoint the hungry film goer that I am. The use of chapters makes us know that it's a Tarantino film we're watching, not some boring everyday Western from the '50s. As we watch on and see people being brutalized at every angle and second, Mr. Tarantino creates cliffhangers half way through the film, making us want more before the film is over. I would recommend this film to a lot of people, giving it an honest review that it is a top film. The screenplay is interesting, giving Samuel L. Jackson killer lines as always, and the acting is superb. If you are unsure whether or not to watch this film, just give it a try. It pleased me and I bet other film fans alike",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino being Tarantino.,"Tarantino's ability to write and direct strong, interesting, and violent films has been unquestioned since the debut of his first, Reservoir Dogs, and The Hateful Eight has no exception. The film that I expected to see was just another violent, comedic drama, and by no means is it not. However, the Hateful Eight also ended up transforming into an exciting and intriguing murder mystery, with an unbelievable amount of well-used tension. The ultimate star of the show is obviously taken by Samuel L Jackson who displays a true standout performance. Jackson's performance is paired well with the tense relationship of Kurt Russel's and Walton Goggins' characters. The story's location could not have been more perfect, a snowed-in shack, in which inevitably highly raises the tension. However, the pacing does seem quite slow for a film of this magnitude, which does not help justify it's 3 hour run-time. All in all, it may not be his best work, but, it is still a true Tarantino.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
reminded me of his first film Reservoir Dogs,"HATEFUL EIGHT review by Mike SmithIn post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive? Quentin Tarantino does it again!!! This is the 8th film Tarantino has made but it kind of reminded me of his first film Reservoir Dogs. That being said, it is way different as well.I loved the story from start to finish, betrayal, deception, a bit of humor and action. The classic Tarantino formula is tried and true for some good entertainment and the story is as good as the cast and Hateful Eight has an all star cast. Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson play some of my favorite characters and this film is no different. They have some of the best lines in the movie and they work really well off of each other and I hope to see them together in a film again. Jennifer Jason Leigh was the one person I didn't know much about in this film and from her first line in the movie I enjoyed her character. Walton Goggins had a quick role in Django Unchained but in Hateful Eight his character is a great blend of funny, serious, also a jerk and Goggins shows he can pull it off. Now without giving too much away the rest of the cast (as always) are amazing at bringing Quentin Tarantino's work to life.The cinematograph is classic 60's - 70's film style that Tarantino brought back to the mainstream. The set feels authentic to the time the film takes place in, but the most stunning part are the landscapes. Ice cold mountain land with the sounds of the snow crunching and the wind blowing, I felt cold and chilly, it all made me immersed in the film.I knew I would enjoy this film but every time Quentin Tarantino makes a new film it is better than the previous one, it sticks with me for days and I can't get enough of it. Sure, as always, Tarantino films are not for everyone with the strong language, violence and gore that may make some people uncomfortable. Although, I'm not like that so I loved this film. I highly recommend that before the end of this year that you cap it off with this masterpiece and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch.10 out of 10Edited by: Samantha LockeFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews/twitter: @FatMikeTPK",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Don't overthink it too much,"I would like to start with a different movie. I saw it in a theater and I remember being terribly disappointed at the end. It was Coen's No Country for Old Men. When I was outside, I heard a man behind me say, ""What the $#^@#^@# was that all about?"" He sounded very angry and I must admit that I felt a little angry too.But a few days passed and I couldn't stop thinking about it, and after I went to see that movie again, I realized that I didn't just like it. I loved it. It was a piece of art. It happens sometimes, at last with me it does. It comes to people later and it stays with them.The Hateful Eight is just like that, an abstract piece of art. At first, it's hard to understand and it's also hard to like, because it is so confusing. But it is a beautiful work nevertheless and for a whole myriad of reasons.The scenery was gorgeous, shot with 70 millimeter lens.The story, or I should say, multiple threads of the big story, as hectic as they may seem at first, were not broken or disjointed. They intertwined and unwound slowly with a good purpose, in a classic Tarantino style. The dialog is as smooth as silk, also very Tarantino like. Even, ""you need two pieces of wood!!!"" provided not only some comedic material, but also explained how the door got broken earlier.But acting? That was just superb. There was not a single underdeveloped characters in the movie. There was nobody there whom you wouldn't remember later on, even the girl who was plucking a chicken. The general and the Major Warren story. A whole series of expression running across Daisy's face after John Ruth broke her nose and the bewildered look on Major Warren's face as he looked at Daisy and saw her looking back at him.For me, this movie falls in a special category. This is one of those movies that I watched for 3 hours and wished it didn't end. No Country for Old Men (second viewing) was like that and both Blade Runner movies.I suggest that people wouldn't overthink this movie too much. No need to try too hard to understand it. They should just sit back and enjoy it. The meaning is there. It will come. I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Riviting but maybe a little too much blood and brain bits.,"Very dark with a lot of blood and splattered brains. Whether you are nice in this film or nasty , your blood ends up soaking into the floorboards.

Humour is unevenly sprinkled in my opinion.... the captive woman being assaulted for the least infraction was funny...if brutal- or the 'haberdashery"" door having to be nailed shut against the wind every time it was opened. The rest is unrelenting slaughter...as someone remarked, talk talk talk murder talk talk talk murder! One would have to wonder about a mind that can think up this sort of brutality.

Absurdly Violent with Fantastic Over-the-Top Performances,"During production on THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to retire after he's completed ten films. That is probably the saddest cinematic news I've heard, especially since this marks his eighth film (he counts KILL BILL as one, thankfully) and it means he may only have two more left. Tarantino movies are an event for me. I get more excited for the release of one of his films than any other director or franchise out there. For the first time ever, I was even able to partake in a film's special event coinciding with its release. Roadshows and limited releases generally don't happen too close to my town (unless I feel like driving two hours to Orlando) so when I found out the roadshow cut of THE HATEFUL EIGHT would be playing relatively close, meaning only one hour away, I was ecstatic. I drove out to that theater just late enough to miss the showing I'd aimed for and gladly sat in my car for three hours in the parking lot of that theater (I'd recently been by a bookstore so I had some reading material to keep me sane) until the next showing because it was a Tarantino film. It was worth it. I got the souvenir program issued with the showing, got to enjoy the full experience with the overture, intermission, and additional footage, and I was able to mingle with fellow Tarantino enthusiasts who were just as thrilled to be there. It was a fantastic time.That being said, how was the movie? It was great but it wasn't one of his top tier films; it fails to reach the levels of PULP FICTION, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, or DJANGO UNCHAINED. It has a few pacing issues. Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson were so proud of the gorgeous western landscape footage, covered in snow and shot in beautiful 70mm, that we get long shots of just the landscape at times to let us soak it all in. The story is also a bit thin so there's a lot of padding in the form of long scenes included just to add more flavor to the proceedings, like the characters putting out a guideline between the haberdashery and the outhouse at the onset of the blizzard. We sit on that scene for what feels like an unnecessary amount of time but I don't hate it because it just reinforces the old west atmosphere with a reminder of how rough and inhospitable life could be. None of that matters to me though because it's part of the experience in his films. He's a cinema nut and he loves to have fun with his work; no one's going to tell him what to do or what not to do. He has a vision in mind and he intends on delivering that vision to the audience to share in it with him. It's exactly why people like me drive to a theater farther away, so we can get that full experience when opportune.My quibbles with THE HATEFUL EIGHT are all minor and they're drowned out by pretty much everything else in the film. It's a Tarantino film and you get everything you'd hope and expect to find. Questionable characters. Sharp, often crude or unsettling, dialogue. Larger than life performances. And those strange bombastic genre touches he loves to toss in. The cast is phenomenal and loaded with familiar Tarantino collaborators, with some new ones tossed in. No one really steals the show because everyone is bringing their absolute best and having fun, but if I had to point out the highlights it'd probably be Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins. And Demián Bechir as Bob the Mexican. He almost borders on caricature but he steals scenes with his bizarre performance. Honestly, the only person who didn't outright blow me away was Michael Madsen and that's because he was sort of just doing his usual: narrowed eyes, few words, and an obvious threat despite the fact the movie is supposed to be a bit of a mystery as to who can be trusted and who can't. He stands out as a hidden enemy the moment you meet him on screen but it doesn't matter much because no one in this movie can be trusted. Every character trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery has darkness in their past and a real mean streak. The fun is in learning about each of them and watching them interact with each other as the time rolls on and we approach the inevitable breaking point for this tense standoff. This is why THE HATEFUL EIGHT, despite not being Tarantino's strongest film, is almost mesmerizing for me. You sit me down in front of it and I'm not moving until it's over. Tarantino fans will certainly find something to love in THE HATEFUL EIGHT but others might be put off by the pacing, the racial undertones (it's set soon after the end of the Civil War), and the mounds of Tarantino dialogue filling it out before the action explodes. Frankly, I don't care. I'm just excited we get at least two more and remain hopeful he'll rescind his decision to retire so we get Tarantino films for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Wasn't what I expected,I was hoping it was going to be like a proper western movie but it wasn't quite different from that. I thought it was unnecessarily long.

Love Q.T. but really???,"Let me preface by saying loved!!!! Pulp & Reservior but this was reallllllly slow. In fact, last movie walked out of was some 13 years ago- Flintstones; sorry QT. First hour was one of the slowest most painful in my movie watching career. Sadly, even if it ends in a kick ass way, will be waiting till released on Netflix and can fast forward through the 1.5 hrs previously had to endure to see if actually redeems itself. And to put things straight; asked and received full refunds for tickets. Plot was the most slow to develop of any movie I've seen in last 20years.

Exaggeratedly performed liked a Drama played on a theater stage,"90% of the film was played inside of a depot cabin, so when you watched the movie, it's like you were seating in a theater, facing a single cabin interior setting that never needed to change, a scene from the very beginning to the end performed by all the characters of this dramatically staged setting from different angles played by different characters, walking and sitting around, delivered their allocated dialog to each other in sequence, with exaggerated acting that only when you attended a staged drama house to watch a Ibsen's or Eugene O'Neill's play. From the very beginning to the end, every actor on the stage just dutifully delivered their dialog with dramatized, overly exaggerated Southern dialect or British or Mexican Chicano accents to make the whole one single interior setting on a stage falsely looked intense. Quentin, the writer and the director, used his overly used but obsessed ""Rushomon"" WHODUNIT? Japanese plot to throw in WHOsWHO? WHOsOnWhoseSide? formatted guessing game plan to keep the audiences' patience not to side-tracked and digress off the one-way street or Cul-de-Sac.This is just another typical, heavily formatted Quentin drama, relied heavily by and/or upon his generously used traditional gimmicks, unnatural exaggerations, overkill dramatization, over-the-top wise-cracking dialog, masking a core-simple boring story to last a two hours long contrite, everything looked just so staged pretentious one setting coverall crap. Even by so many gimmicky manipulations and so much exaggerated Southern accent in so many staged dialog, this film just turned out barely watchable and sometimes you just wanted it to finish sooner. A very tiresome watching experience with the typical gore and slaughters among the usual suspects.There's nothing new or needs to be praised, 'cause Quentin just gave you a same sh@t, different titled, same-old same-old crappy film.

A Cinematic Landmark,"Most people will stream this film, especially because of Netflix's extended edition release. That's a damn shame. The clarity produced by the 50 year old lenses they modified and adapted to modern cameras is astonishing. This clarity defines the film, for the devil is in the details. That's where I feel like the movie loses a lot of people; it is a slow film that's designed to captivate you and immerse you into that time period. Sure, the movie is foul, brutal and harsh. So was 1870s Wyoming. Yes, the language and dialogue are coarse and to the point. So was the average vernacular of a person in the1870s in Wyoming.

One Of The Best Whodunits,"Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is the director's second most maturely paced film. However, it is also his second most over-expository film. Almost every instance of characters having conversations includes segments or entire monologues that only exist to explain backstory or current situations to the audience. Still though, when characters aren't in simple conversations and instead are face to face within intense confrontations, the film is masterful. All of the acting, most of the writing (mainly from chapter three and onward), and the beautiful direction of Tarantino, combine together to create one of the most suspenseful movies that you will ever watch. Also, there's one mistake that was annoying at the beginning of the film when Major Marquis asks ""Got room for one more?"" He uttered this QUIETLY and there is no way that O. B. would have heard what he asked him. Anyways, check it out. Tarantino does a fabulous job at showing the audience exactly what they need to be shown at the right times so that the suspense is the best it can be.95% or 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I liked it a lot.,"Oh dear. I almost missed this film having read several of the reviews but could not equate them with an average of 8 on IMDb so decided to chance it. SO GLAD I DID! One of the best 3 films seen in the last 12 months and the most interesting and engaging.Over three hours but I did not notice the time and did not even fidget. I found it an interesting. engaging, enjoyable, humorous, beautifully filmed and choreographed, well acted, story based film, wondering what will happen next as it is full of surprises. It's not a film for those who are not so interested in story but think action is the be all and end all like the last Captain America or the Fast and Furious series, even thought 7 was not too bad. Nevertheless it has quite a few shocks and had my partner clutching my arm a few times.

The last hour is a masterpiece in itself.,"An earlier review by 'gogoschka-1' pretty much sums up what I would have wrote about the film in a much better and detailed review.

I say onto you 'negative reviewer' ""Shut the hell up"" in my Samuel Jackson voice.Reason 2. These same 'people' said the film was boring. I guess they expected the movie to play out like the trailer, full of spontaneous action along the way. So I say again to these 'people' ""Shut the hell up"" in my Kurt Russell voice.Reason 3. The last hour of the movie is every Tarantino fan's wet dream, a masterpiece. Suddenly everything got turned up a notch: the acting, the dialogue, the cinematography, the little plot twists, the violence, the humor.

Theater performance registration,"There doesn't seem to be a real plot, or moral in this story and it leaves you feeling bad, rather than excited or inspired. When certain truly sick-in-the-stomach making action takes place you hope it will lead to something good, but this film only gets darker.As most of the film is indoors talking heads, with totally unrealistic lighting, the whole thing feels like a theater performance registration. I was for the first time truly distracted by how theater-like unrealistic the lighting was. Also the blizzard during the entirety of the film is most of the time just some gentle snow with a light breeze, that was attempted to feel bigger with heavy sound effects that did not rhyme with the visuals. In general all Foley was larger than life and sounded 'too good'.Shooting this on 70mm film in 2015 is nothing more than prestige and makes no sense, considering the cinematographic choices.Still 6 stars because the actors did great, And the practical effects that I had rather not seen, where also very well executed by the artist(s).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Don't hate, celebrate!","Three-hours and 10 minutes! That's how long it takes for accomplished director/writer Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction,"" "" Reservoir Dogs"") to tell the Post-Civil War story about two grungy bounty hunters (the terrific Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell) trying to cash-in on their equally grungy catch Daisy Momergue (the amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh). When a blizzard hits, they find themselves stuck in a cold tavern with want-a-be Sheriff (Talton Googins - ""Django""), an aging General (Bruce Dern), and several questionable personalities (Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir, Channing Tatum). Only time will tell who is who, and who will survive. Tarantino proves once again, he knows how to tell a story, create characters and set a stage for suspense, action and intrigue. Jennifer Jason Leigh is all the buzz here for her performance as she is beat-up, spit out and chewed up time and time again. As 2015 becomes the year of ""ensemble"" work, the cast here is performing at their individual and ensemble all time high. Could this film have been shorter? Yes! Could this film have done without all the usage of the ""N"" word? Yes! Could this film have done without all the blood and guts? Of course! But, then it wouldn't be a Tarantino film. If the Academy can get past all the later, ""The Hateful Eight"" could be one of the sleeper films to beat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Hateful Eight,"Now, first things first. This movie lasts for two hours and forty five minutes. Get ready for that. I'm saying this because if you expect a beginning with a lot of action, like Django, it won't happen. Nevertheless, there is not a single reason why that should be something bad and it isn't. And to end this quick introduction, Tarantino delivers once again.Tarantino follows the same structure he's used before but his style did change a lot for this movie. It is interesting as it gets and you will definitely not get bored with this (unless you're expecting an-Inglorious Basterds amount of violence which is why I mentioned the first thing). There is quite an amazing deepness that we get of the main characters and their stories. Tarantino also likes to get to a specific time in history and represent everything about it, the social and cultural aspects, and he does it again in here. And the violence does get screen time, don't worry, but it is in just the right amount to build tension and also to not make the story longer than it should be.Quite an amazing movie, I totally recommend it. For those who haven't seen it, enjoy. And for those who have, I hope you were able to appreciate the quality of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
complete bumbling mess,"Every master film maker knows that 70mm is the best choice to shoot a movie in plain white snow where the gray sky and white ground are almost indistinguishable, but at least it's about 5 minutes of something worthy of being shot on 70mm. After the snow portion of the movie, over two hours take place in a one room cabin... which once again might be boring, but in 70mm...The 70mm is a complete waste, the lighting inside the cabin looks horrible also, I couldn't stop looking at all the ultra bright tungsten sources above every table although the movie takes place right after the civil war. The moonlight coming through the windows is as bright and harsh as the sunlight in the day scenes; and if that's not enough to take out of the movie, there are at least 10 separate times throughout where the film falls so flat that I had my face in my hands saying to myself, ""what the hell is this?""... ""This is a Quentin Tarantino movie??"" ...""HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS CRAP IS THERE???""two of the most obvious are when, after a droning two hours, Tarantino himself starts narrating inside of his own movie, and starts explaining a plot device to the audience as if he's in the pitch meeting instead of the final edit. You'd think somewhere in those two hours, in place of so much bad dialog, he could of found a way to simply foreshadow a clue that the coffee is.. or could be poison... but no, he has to make it ridiculous.The intermission... it's like him going, ""since we're shooting the first draft of my script, and since we won't be using editing to make this more interesting, go take a break and then you can come back and then try to get through the rest of this."" Because if you went to the bathroom any time other than the intermission, you'd miss SO much by the time you got back.Another time was maybe the 3rd or 4th time they had to show you that you need two pieces of wood to nail the door shut. Other 3 hour movies use their time to sprawl and show passage of time and distance and development, this one wants you to see them nailing a door shut over and over in real time.Eventually somewhere around 2:15 into the movie my only thoughts were, ""can someone, anyone on the screen, just kill everyone else so the movie can end!?""",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Seems setup for tightness and tension but then combines it with slow pace and sweeping scale, which don't wholly work together","Although I am not blind to his weaknesses, I do confess that I enjoy Tarantino's work and in particular love his writing of pulpy dialogue and the way he can draw tension from even the most innocent conversation. His films are littered with examples, and it is this element of his work that drew me to The Hateful Eight. The combination of a single location with a load of actors capable of delivering the material, made me assume we were in for a film where tension built across the whole film in the way he has done with individual scenes before.The reality is that the film partly manages this, and for sure there is pleasure to be had in his combination of dialogue driven scenes with sudden violent interludes. However at almost three hours, there is simply too much film and not enough content. Considering that the film is more or less set in a single room for most of the film one wonders why it also tries to be such an epic in presentation. Okay the opening hour is mostly on the trail and has some great sweeping landscapes and vistas, but even then the real action is inside a wagon. This duality did work against the film for me because it feels so sprawling, but yet the actual narrative seems to be driven by scenes that require a tightness and tension, and it doesn't wholly come together. The setting and the spread of characters occasionally has some interesting things to say about race and politics, however it is too saggy in the delivery and takes way too long to deliver everything, that it does tend to lose impact in many ways.Those that like his work (as I do) will still find a lot to enjoy (as I did), but Hateful Eight is a flawed film. The cast really enjoy their performances even if they don't quite have the presence of equivalent characters or scenes, whether it be moments that invoke Reservoir Dogs, or Tim Roth for some reason playing a version of Waltz's character in Django. The film looks gorgeous and has a great score, but it is the writing that brings in the issues. The lack of discipline in the delivery robs the film of a lot of the power it should have had, and in the end while it should be a satisfying resolution to the mystery, instead it because loud, bloody, unpleasantly mean-spirited and surprisingly unengaging and lacking the tension all the parts suggest it should have had.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino does what Tarantino does.,"THE HATEFUL EIGHT: Quentin Tarantino has an imagination like no other. He wrote and directed. His characters are unique and well drawn. His dialogue is profane, earthy and real. His stories are, well, let's just say, 'different.' His direction is pretty straight forward and he lets his actors do what they were hired to do. I can't recall a single false note from anyone. MC may have stated it best when she said, ""After seeing a Tarantino movie, ya just wanna take a shower."" The less you know about the plot, the better because it unfolds rather like an Agatha Christie novel, and early on it had an 'Unforgiven' vibe. It's pretty slow-going for the first hour, but as one character says, ""be very patient"". That may be the operative word here. There is a lot of ground work to be laid, but patience does have its rewards with the last half filled with plot twists and Tarantino (I don't want to give anything away) 'business'. Everyone turns in a very strong performance, but Samuel L. Jackson is a standout followed closely by an unrecognizable Jennifer Jason Lee and a rousing Kurt Russell. An interesting side note: It has an old style opening with upfront credits and the closing credits are on cards instead of the usual crawl. There will probably be Oscar nominations for screenplay and direction and a good possibility for Jackson. Score: 8.5. GO. Best on an empty stomach.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Just sit down, and enjoy the movie!!!!","Right off the bat, I'll go ahead and say that this is unlike any other movie that I've seen before. This truly was a masterpiece of a film! No director handles dialogue quite the way that Tarantino does. This review will be a spoiler-free review of what to expect of this film.First and foremost, do NOT listen to negativity that you hear on a lot of film sites. The negativity in the film can most be attributed to the fact that Tarantino made a very controversial comment about the NYPD saying that they are all murderers. This gave a lot of former fans of Tarantino a negative and unfair bias of people who are now going into this film to hate it. Put aside your biases, forget that this movie is a Tarantino film. Go into the movie theater with a positive attitude, and be ready to be amazed.First off, the dialogue in the movie is utterly fantastic! Each character has his or her own dialects and ways of speaking that are each unique to each other. For instance, the southern sheriff has a different way of speaking than a retired war-veteran does. This is captured perfectly in the lines of the people just by the way they speak. It really creates a diverse atmosphere in the film and really shows the difference in characters.Again with the dialogue, the writer spends as much time as he can putting in subtle exposition-dialogue so the audience can really understand who and what the characters are. He doesn't do this through constant monologues or any other form of cliché per-se. He does this through funny arguments, and simple conversations. Sure the build-up to the climax is very long, and may seem slow, but this is definitely okay in the fact that we fully understand who are characters are.This was definitely not some cheap screenplay that a movie studio purchased from a back-door writer. This is a high-quality well- written masterpiece. The plot of the film is ingeniously planned out and subtly foreshadowed at the beginning of the film. There are lots of subtle things that we as the audience see thinking nothing of, but actually have bigger meaning than one might think. There are lots of subtle details that we may not notice, but will be brought to our attention by a character. I thought that the writer really showed that he had everything in mind already played out, and wasn't just writing as he went along. I love the fact that the writer really adds an ""everything happens for a reason"" kind of tone to the movie.This is not your typical western with a typical dueling cowboy soundtrack. The soundtrack of the film sounded very ominous and fit the overall tone of the movie perfectly. Tarantino used this film to his advantage tons of times in the film. He did this especially well in a sequence of the raging blizzard outside; the ominous organ is blaring in our ears and only gets louder when the wind blows harder. Then all of sudden, the shot quickly changes to indoors where it's calmer and warmer. The change from the soundtrack felt like a snap of a finger, and the writer used this masterfully. Just like Jaws, this film has it's own special sinister score that shows when danger is near, and I personally believe that this score should be just as iconic.Man oh man! The acting was just perfect in the film. Every character was played perfectly by an awesome ensemble cast. These faces are very familiar to fans of QT films. As I said before, each character had different dialects. Not only was the overall tone of the characters masterfully shown in the movie, but the manner of speaking felt very authentic. Frequent QT actor Samuel Jackson played his role perfectly. I figured since this is his 2nd western movie with QT and his 6th movie with QT as well, he'd show a bit of other characters that he played in his movie. However, this was simply not the case. He showed no trace of his other characters and masterfully acted in this film. The character that he plays was suited perfectly for him, and I feel like even Samuel L. Jackson as well as the rest of the ensemble cast loved their characters.Again as I said before, do not go into this film wanting to hate it. Go into the film with a positive attitude and just sit down and enjoy the damn movie. Who cares about what Tarantino said, who cares about any controversial statements he might have made. As we saw in all of his other movies, Tarantino is a very controversial man, and should just be given to his credit on screen rather than in person. Focus on the awesome dialogue, acting, and overall great film itself! Go out and see it! You will not be disappointed.P.S. I very rarely rate movies a full 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A wasted opportunity?,"Before seeing the hateful eight, if you were to offer me a Tarantino movie, set in western times about a group of characters trapped inside a cabin and having to bounce off each other with signature Tarantino dialogue and writing, I would have bitten your hand off!Unfortunately, the Hateful Eight doesn't get good until the second half of the movie, where Samuel L Jackson delivers an iconic, hilarious monologue that rivals the likes of Jules' ""vengeance"" speech in pulp fiction. After this point, the Tarantino-isms truly kick into gear, and the suspense, the wit, the gore, and the characters truly shining and being some of Tarantino's best work, with Warren and Mannix being the stand-outs.However, what makes this film so frustrating is the incredibly tiresome, boring, and irrelevant first half, which definitely should have been cut down, not only to make the film better over all, but to increase the rewatch value. Out of all the Tarantino movies I've seen so far, I feel I am least likely to revisit this one, with its nearly 3 hour run time and monotonous first half, which feels like another writer trying to imitate Tarantino's style, rather than an actual Tarantino movie.If you were to take one thing from this review, I would say completely skip the first hour and 20 minutes or so to where Samuel L Jackson delivers a speech about his ""big black pecker"" and watch the chaos from there! But because of that first half, I feel the Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's weaker projects, or at the very least the most frustrating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Some of Hollywood's finest,"Apparently there's some unhappy feelings around Quentin Tarantino's 8th motion picture. I can see why. Tarantino's latest movie is a movie specialized for the fans. I can't imagine how weird this movie must feel when you haven't seen movies like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, because this movie is a gift for the fans of Quentin who loves Ennio Morricone, Samuel Jackson and long, moody dialogs. I can agree that Tarantino doesn't challenge Hollywood and himself as much as he could. But when it's Tarantino i'm watching, i want Tarantino.Without revealing too much of the plot i can tell that The Hateful Eight circles around 8 strangers. The first one we meet is Major Marquis Warren(Samuel L. Jackson) in the cold. After his horse collapsed, he has to hike with another fellow bounty hunter: John Ruth(Kurt Russell), and his travel companion: the wanted criminal: Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock where they have different kinds of business. On this trip they get another companion, as Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins), a man who claims he's the new sheriff in Red Rock appears in the cold. Because of an ongoing blizzard who concerns the travelers, they have to take shelter in Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive, Ruth, Warren, Domergue and Mannix meets 4 other strangers: Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth), Mexican Bob(Demian Bichir), Joe Gage(Michael Madsen) and Sandy Smithers(Bruce Dern). John Ruth on the other hand, suspects that one or more of the other travelers has some desires to stop him of delivering Domergue to the authorities and claim his 10.000 dollars. This and history between some of the strangers, is some of the complications the 8 strangers have to deal with.The title itself seems like a wordplay of the movie: The Magnificent Seven, but i don't think Tarantino tries to be classic 1930's-western. He is well aware of his own trademarks, and how he uses them. It has also been a long time since i have seen Samuel L. Jackson in this form. His performance as Major Marquis Warren was overlooked at the Oscars, and should be remembered as one of his best performances. Kurt Russell is amazing as John Ruth «The Hangman». Jennifer Jason Leigh got a deserved Oscar-nominee. Walton Goggins is one of the most promising stars in Hollywood right now and does a fine job. Demian Bichir is one of the funniest roles in the movie but unfortunately he gets a bit forgotten because of few lines and the other actors. Tim Roth does possibly the best role in the movie as Oswaldo Mobray, and is both funny and brilliant as one of the most sneaky and interesting characters. Michael Madsen is always a joy in Tarantino-movies, but i feel his role is a bit repetitive and feels almost like his Mr. Blonde-character from Reservoir Dogs in disguise. It's amazing to see Bruce Dern in his age play such a complex character.The pictures and the soundtrack is like drugs, and is some of the best i've seen in my life. The landscape-pictures in the start, and the whole intro sequence colored by Ennio Morricone's beautiful soundtrack is one of the biggest movie-kicks i've had in many years. Even though this movie has it's flaws, it's still one of the best movie experiences i've had in many years. This is Tarantino's second western-feature, and even though his western- movies has been satisfyingly original and moody but i hope Tarantino doesn't overuse the western-theme. According to the man himself, a gangster-flick similar to Bonnie and Clyde, in Australia. If that's so, that would be the movie i'm most looking forward to of all up and coming movies. Tarantino has said this is his 8/10 movies, which means there's 2 more to go and our generation's best director isn't done.SORRY ABOUT THE MISPELLING OF SOME WORDS, IM FROM NORWAY ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good but needs editing big time,"Let me first say that I'm a huge Tarantino fan. I pretty much love the plots, intensity, actors and extreme violence in all of his movies. The Hateful Eight had some good plot twists but overall it was a bit disappointing. First of all it's way, way, too long, 3 hrs, 7 minutes. If they cut out an hour of the movie (maybe 90 minutes even), and turned into a fast thriller I would have bumped the rating up to an 8. There are definitely some scenes and conversations that could have been cut and it wouldn't have been a big deal. The second problem is that 95% of the movie takes place in the cabin. There is some brief but spectacular cinematography of Wyoming (nee Colorado). I definitely wanted to see more, I was going stir crazy in that cabin. How about throwing in a few flashback scenes of the Domergue gang in action or making it into a town somewhere? Overall if you're a Tarantino fan it's worth watching the movie just for the great actors, violence and plot twists, but the first 90 minutes are pretty slow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

QT has delivered one of his best movies yet,"I enjoyed his last two movies a good deal, but The Hateful 8 is even better. The soundtrack is perfect, the acting is top notch, the direction is great, the dialogue is wonderful and the cinematography is breathtaking.Have to see it again a few more times but as of the first viewing I must say this, my 3 favorite QT movies before this had been Resovoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. This one is right up there with his best in my opinion! As much as I liked his last two movies, they did both could have finished a tad better. The Hateful 8 though was near perfect the whole way, for such a long movie its crazy I didn't once fee like part of it should have been taken out, everything had a reason to be there it felt like. Reminded me of a Western version of Clue, interesting dialogue, gorgeous cinematography, brilliant acting, good directing/editing and a soundtrack to die for.Eli Roth, Jackson and Mr Woggings stole the show as far as the acting goes, wondering what the blu ray release features of this will be when it finally drops.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
You Can't Hate This Eight.,"Quentin Tarantino is back with his eighth film and his second foray into the world of the western with his typically familiar dialogue driving this thrilling whodunit of sorts, backed up by a score that takes the audience on a time warp to the yesteryear of cinema. To put it simply, this is as good a Quentin Tarantino film as any before it, with every little detail carefully included into the whole spectacle, creating an event for the audience that is both fun and special. I got an awesome surprise when my flatmate came back from Bali with a copy of 'The Hateful Eight', but immediately coming to the conclusion that it was going to be poor quality. I readied myself for a viewing in the traditional manner but with the DVD's quality top shelf I settled in for an afternoon on the couch to witness the three hour extravaganza.Growing up with Tarantino, his films have become a voice for the X Generation. His way of presenting his work to the audience personifies 'cool', fabricating many memorable scenes that have stayed with all of us throughout our lives. The narratives that have been the linchpin of some truly special movies still submit a strong voice and there isn't a day that goes by without somebody in the big wide world mentioning a Tarantino moment. The great thing about all this is that the iconic Director doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Why would you when you have been at the helm of classics like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" that are now well entrenched in Hollywood folklore and the more recent productions, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", considered to be his best work.'The Hateful Eight' is a risky film for Tarantino. He has taken a step into a genre that is a little unfamiliar but with perseverance, simplicity and rising to the challenge, this new installment under the Tarantino banner has just as many memorable moments as the films that have come before it.'The Hateful Eight' signals its arrival with an eerily sombre score from legendary spaghetti western composer, Ennio Morricone, highlighting the Director's obvious pulling power when it comes to employing the very best. The industry want to work with him and want to be apart of the whole set-up.Set in a very bitter Wyoming winter just after the American Civil War, a stagecoach is hurling itself through the snow before it is stopped by a bounty hunter going by the name of Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). ""Got room for one more?"" And so it begins with the audience quickly introduced to John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his vicious little prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), with the famous Tarantino banter immediately coming hard and fast. The three actors have fun dishing out the dialogue with Quentin's main man, Sammy L, letting loose to give his character the authentic charm that it commands. Jackson is made for these flavoursome productions and it is his presence that the other talent feed off. Kurt Russell is amusingly brilliant but little Jennifer provides the biggest punch as the very 'polite' Domergue. Ninety percent of the film is shot entirely in a cabin in the middle of nowhere but it provides the perfect backdrop for what unfolds. It is the ultimate showdown for Tarantino's vast array of suspect characters and it provides sparkling and amusing entertainment. Tim Roth and Michael Madsen return to the world of 'cool' playing suspicious men, Oswaldo Mobray and Joe Gage respectively, with Roth particularly watchable, throwing himself into his role. Cameo appearances by 'old timer' Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum round off the star quality but like all of Tarantino films, 'The Hateful Eight's' greatest achievement doesn't lie in the narratives plot; no, no, no. It's the glorious ride that the audience endues. It's the interaction between the awesomely crafted characters that brings the punters to the box office.'The Hateful Eight' is great viewing. It is quintessentially Tarantino but to some fans it may not be the right fit for their expectations. The film burns slow but with a little patience it does provide the usual violence and gore that we have come to know from a film of this calibre. Look for a wonderful little rendition of an old convict ballad by Daisy Domergue that only heightens my suspicion that the Director is mad about everything Australian. This is a mature film for a mature audience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

You've to make yourself watch this even if it's a bit long when compared to the level of one's attention span .And you'll be thanking yourself for a film you often visit back to back.

A Tense Snowstorm of Suspicion and Secrets,"Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' is a masterclass in suspense, dialogue-driven tension, and character interplay. Set predominantly in a single, claustrophobic location during a raging blizzard, the film grips you with its intricate narrative and keeps you guessing till the very end. Tarantino's signature style of long, engaging conversations and sudden bursts of violence is ever-present, making every moment an unpredictable thrill. The ensemble cast, featuring the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, delivers performances that are both riveting and nuanced. Ennio Morricone's haunting score adds another layer of unease, perfectly complementing the movie's bleak and tension-filled atmosphere. 'The Hateful Eight' is not just a film-it's an immersive experience into the minds and motives of flawed individuals forced into a perilous situation. It's a Tarantino spectacle in its rawest form, making it an essential watch for fans of intense, dialogue-driven cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"The Hateful Eight is an incredible film with great dialogue,interesting characters and a story full of twists","The Hateful Eight is an amazing film and one of the best films of 2015.The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's eighth film and it is a western-contained thriller- mystery film.The movie's plot is original,interesting and full of twists and revelations that will keep you in the edge of your seat.The film has Eight main characters that hate each other(as the title suggests).Almost all of those characters are developed and have a unique personality and chemistry between each other.The majority of the film takes place in a small motel and doesn't have any action sequences but it is definitely not boring because of Tarantino's incredible dialogue and masterful directing.Tarantino's directing was also old school and it makes you feel like you are watching a film made in the 60s but it still has the right amount of modern touches.The film had a lot of Tarantino's trades like the fun dialogue and some violence and gore.The Hateful Eight is not as rewatchable as other Tarantino's film like Pulp Fiction.It goes without saying that the performances were amazing especially the performances by Samuel L Jackson,Kurt Russel and Jenifer Jason Leigh.Forgot to mention that the music score by the legendary Ennio Moricone is great and even won an Oscar.In a nutshell The Hateful Eight has interesting and unique characters, amazing dialogue,very good performances and an intriguing story with twists and revelations.If you are a movie nerd like me you really have to see this movie(but you probably saw a million times).But if you are just a mainstream moviegoer that doesn't really enjoys great dialogue and characters but just wants to have some fun at the cinema or watch a movie at home and spend his time,you probably won't enjoy it(no offence,I am saying this because I saw this movie a few times with people that aren't really into films and they didn't enjoyed it a lot)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very well done,"In the '80s, movie reviews went so much simpler. You said ""It was good, OK, or sucked"". And, nowadays, movie reviewers seem to write a short essay. And that ten line requirement by IMDb doesn't help either. Anyway, it was good.Sure, it had some Tarantino staples, like the out of sequence storytelling, which can be a little annoying. One modern song which takes away from the movie like Django Unchained's ending shooting scene. Also, a lot of blood and dialogue. Overall, it was really good. Way, way, way better than the #1 movie of 2015 (Mad Max Fury Road).Hope to see more westerns like this and Bone Tomahawk (which I thought was even better, BTW).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
MJM REVIEW,"This is a fun movie! A great new concept and refreshing idea of a Mashup of Action/Mystery/Western. Great soundtrack, It really sets the tone. The characters were almost like they originated from a comic book, If this was intentional, then it worked for me. I thought every single character was unique and brilliant in their own way.Walton Goggins who is relatively less known compared to the rest of this remarkable cast was Hilarious. His performance playing Sheriff Chris Mannix was sensational! Kurt Russell and the Big Dawg Samuel L. Jackson were outstanding as usual. However, Kurt Russell really shined and stood out for me in his role as John Ruth, one of his best performances that I have seen from him.All of them were great! From Joe gauge played by Michael Madsen to prisoner Daisy Domergue played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. A unique movie with a very well-written plot and excellently directed from the Legend Quentin Tarantino. I read this was originally supposed to be a Django sequel before being a stand-alone film. It does have that same vibe as Django to be honest, and I love that because Django was Awesome. Epic movie. I really enjoyed watching this. Great work once again from Quentin Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
absolute waste,"Slow, boring and painful to watch. I'd like to be reimbursed for the3 long hours I spent masochistically waiting for something meaningful. After nearly in agony at the end, I decided to sacrifice another ten minutes to set up an account and write a review in hope of offsetting the impossible to explain high rating. Instead of the mysterious and misanthropic tale I was expecting I stumbled upon pure boredom plain and simple. Good performances throughout but a pretty graphic, pointless, violent tale better suited for a graphic novel rather than a movie.I had quite an expectation after ""Jango Unchained"" and I wouldn't have endured this otherwise. If you're waiting to see something like this, move along and spare your time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Hateful 8th – Is There a Mystery Behind the Hate?,"First, this comment doesn't aspire to become a movie review in any proper sense, so I will say nothing about the movie's plot, performances etc. – many others have already done that. Second, devotees of Nietzsche whose ""formula for happiness is a Yes, a No, a straight line"" may also want to skip this piece and save themselves some time.Having said that  In truth, the first part of the comment's summary above refers to the feelings that QT's latest seems to have largely induced among its audiences rather than my sentiments. Despite the fact that I've never been into this filmmaker (given Chapter Three – NO PUN intended) or due to it, I didn't hate it myself, nor did I find it overlong and boring. I think it runs as long as it should and can make a single viewing fairly entertaining. Unless, you're to suggest that this stuff shouldn't have been made at all. Which leads us to the second major complaint – the movie has no meaning that could really justify its existence. And that's already serious.But if we look at the complete filmography of QT, as far as I'm concerned, there's only one entry there with which its author actually said something – that's the very first one. The finale of ""Reservoir Dogs"" did create a real drama with a real meaning behind it. Moreover, the latter was compellingly conveyed due to the genuine poignancy of the former. It's too bad that Ringo Lam could slightly paraphrase Kurosawa's remark on Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and say: ""It's a fine finale. But it's MY finale"". Undoubtedly, QT's original dialogue and no less than brilliant rearranging of the dramatic structure, along with subsequent competent directing, lifted Lam's material to another level in cinematic terms. But the meaning and its impact were mainly produced by the last scene. And it was also  hmm  lifted.""Pulp Fiction"" followed and was moderately interesting as an extreme postmodern experiment with genre-related ""pulp fiction"" cinema. And ""Jackie Brown"" had a glimpse of something truly humanistic. But that's about it. The rest were self-indulgent 'loony toons', stylistic games of different degree of interest (for QT fans) or disinterest (for everybody else). Of course, any of later movies can be seen as making some points or at least trying to do so. However, kind of ""serious"" meaning can formally be ascribed to practically anything – like any Mike Myers comedy, for instance. But ""Godfather"" is about legacy (in a way) and ""Austin Powers"" is about legacy (in a way). Still they do not quite work at the same level, do they?And here's where the core of the problem lies. QT wants to see his movies as art. But what is art? It's hardly just something capable of being entertaining, even if for whole three hours in a row. I think a work of art is nothing more and nothing less than a necessarily honest and hopefully meaningful utterance on any aspect of reality. And all accomplished ones do deliver such utterances. That's why they are of value. On the other hand, playing with oneself, which QT was primarily engaged in all this time after ""Jackie Brown"", may be an appropriate activity to be exercised in the privacy of one's home.But why a multi-million ""home video"" reflecting on this activity should be of interest to anyone else is a minor mystery.And now we're to get back to the main one – that of the hateful ""8th by QT"". Since, I believe, in this case pun was definitely intended – what's behind it? Is there anything behind all we have to encounter in the movie? Would it be possible to discern some legitimate meaning there? In principle – yes. Many people stated that they had been put off by the fact that the movie did not have any likable characters. But what if it WAS the whole point? What if implicitly it's not just about racial issues and how the past may be projecting into the present? What if the director is trying to hold a mirror up to our society as a whole – in which if there are innocents they are the first to be gone – and say: ""This is how we look like and this is how we are going to end"" – just because we are what we are? I mean, look around – honestly, would it really be THAT far-fetched? Quite naturally, nobody wants to recognize themselves in this ugly reflection completely lacking any redeeming qualities. Hence – the hatred, kind of divined and 'word-played' into the title.My own little problem with this theory is that we are dealing with some sort of a 'junk food' version of something like von Trier's stuff then. Because if, for example, Trier's ""quartet for the end of time"" (""Dogville"", ""Manderlay"", ""Antichrist"", ""Melancholia"") was undeniably totally and utterly starless and bible-black, it was also made through applying appropriate cinematic means. The way in which this movie is made, however, simply does not allow taking it or its message dead seriously, if I may put it so in the circumstance – it's way too, errr  absolutely everything and, albeit in its own fashion, probably TOO keen to entertain. So, instead of being edgy, ultimately winds up with the exact opposite. This kind of art turns out to be just like that Lincoln's letter. It's not bad. But it's still a fake.So QT should probably indeed consider quitting. Or better still rethink his ""I don't care about your dumb movie, I care about my dumb movie"" attitude and become a producer. He has knowledge, experience, leverage. Why not to offer it to those who actually have something to say and not afraid of actually doing so? While himself remaining an integral part of the process that would create REAL art.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A more serious addition to the Tarantino Collection,"At start, I'll say that my favourite films by Quentin Tarantino are Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. I also liked his part in Four Rooms as well as the iconic scenes in Jackie Brown or Reservoir Dogs. I consider the dialogue in True Romance to be a masterpiece. Therefore, it can be safely said, I am a fan of Tarantino's more humorous, more pop-culture-oriented films.The Hateful Eight did not fall into that favourite category of mine. It was a serious and brutal film, where the more humorous moments were provided mainly by the gruesome death scenes. The characters were incredibly vivid and real, but not particularly memorable. Over two hours of the 160 minute film takes place in one room. The focus is on the character interaction, with a lot of attention devoted to highlighting racial differences. The plot driving the film forward however, is quite limited.The film is very well made. The beautifully shot harsh environment, the music by Ennio Morricone, the costumes perfectly fitting with the portrayed characters, all make for a very captivating watch. It does not quite feel like a Tarantino film though, at least not in the sense I was used to. It is definitely worth watching, for the grit and character interaction, but I missed the incredibly quotable dialogue and the pop-culture icons of Tarantino's other works.7.5/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

From the extremely tired plot, to the overly drug out scenes. I'll forever regret the time and money I invested in seeing this in the theater. P.S. As much as I appreciate this and past casts, it would be nice to see some fresh faces which don't remind me of all the other characters they've played in past films.

A Jolly Good Time!,"Trust Quentin Tarantino to give us a good time & he does! 'The Hateful Eight' is A Jolly Good Time, thats high on violence, sadistic humour & relentless entertainment. The Performances are Top-Notch, while the Writing & the Direction by the Genius, are purely awesome!'The Hateful Eight' Synopsis: In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters.At 3 hours, 'The Hateful Eight' refuses to slow-down & turns out to be a memorable watch. Watching 8 despicable people come together & go at each-other in 6 brilliant chapters has never been so interesting before. Tarantino nails every bit of 'The Hateful Eight' & celebrates human madness with no filters!I loved 'The Hateful Eight', because it blends violence, sadistic humour & entertainment, perfectly. This is Typical, Vintage Tarantino showing his powers yet again! His Screenplay is fast-paced & brutal. But it never falters. This is among Tarantino's Finest Screenplays to date. As for his Direction, Tarantino creates a world of unruliness, like only he can! Robert Richardson's Excellent Photography & Fred Raskin's Razor-Sharp Editing compliment Tarantino's twisted vision. A Special Mention for the Awesomely Choreographed Action-Sequences & Ennio Morricone's uplifting Score.'The Hateful Eight' is filled with Great Performances. Jennifer Jason Leigh takes the lead with a Tour-De-Force performance, thats impossible not to be haunted by. Leigh is unstoppable here, nailing her wicked character to the T. Get The Oscar already, will ya! Kurt Russell is in top-form! And its so good to see the Legend portray such a menacing, violent part. Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely terrific & shines all through his role. Walton Goggins is astounding; easily his best work to date. Demián Bichir is perfectly morbid, while Tim Roth & Michael Madsen are flat-out fabulous. The Legendary Bruce Dern dominates much of the proceedings, adding another highlight in his late film career. Channing Tatum fits in correctly in the Tarantino setting & sparkles in his brief bit.On the whole, 'The Hateful Eight' is a mighty winner! Do Not Miss!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
C'mon Quentin,"Let me just start by saying that this film is just like boiling a pot of water. It may seem like an odd analogy, but it sums this movie up perfectly. You put it on your stovetop and patiently wait for it to come to a boil. Its boring and uneventful, until those bubbles begin to appear. Except with The Hateful Eight, the pot never reaches its boil. The bubbles begin to appear after a while, but that pot of water never comes to a full boil. Let me just say that I opted for the 70mm screening, which looked beautiful no doubt, and was a cool experience. But man oh man. You better bring a good pillow and a blanket, as this sucker will set you back over 3 hours, 3 hours of boring dialogue and characters with a try too hard plot. Not to mention, the whole thing takes place in a room, minus the first 15 minutes. This would work if the story, script and characters were better. Things do start to sizzle a bit in the third act, but it's still very underwhelming. This movie is so long, there's an intermission. Thats right, you heard it, AN INTERMISSION. This isn't The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It's The Hateful Eight. Which is a pretentious, boring, 3 hour long opus that screams ""Quentin Tarentino trying too hard.""And OK, all of you are going to say ""you just don't appreciate good cinema"" or ""you just didn't get what Quentin was trying to capture"" blablabla. I'm just as much of a cinema buff as the rest of you, but The Hateful Eight is easily Quentin's worst movie. Stay home, rent it, save the trip and your money. This movie is not nearly as good as his previous movies. In my opinion, maybe Quentin should give his head a shake, dust off ye ol' ego of his, and get back to making great movies that don't rely on hipster 70mm projection gimmicks and roadshow theatrical releases.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Quentin Tarantino at his best,"I never saw Django Unchained, but I didn't want to miss The Hateful Eight. The title is a play on the western The Magnificent Seven. It was a western and also a murder mystery. Has the story slowly evolves, and the twist and turns. I don't want to tell you anymore, it's one off those movies you half to see to believe.Quentin Tarantino really shines here, with such clever dialog, and beautiful western setting. The actors really come alive, Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson shine incredibly, so do Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tim Roth are also good. If you don't like violence, then you should probably stay away. But I was entertained by this. Tarantino pays homage to his film Reservoir Dogs in spots.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Trapped,"The film opens with wide shots of snowy North American mountain ranges, and I thought that Tarantino might have discovered his sense for landscapes. I felt that he might be paying homage to Sergio Leone, too. But these are just a few opening shots, and for most of the remainder, the movie stays indoors.The dialog in the coach, on it's way to Minnie's cabin, feels rather slow, especially because it is at the very start of the story.From the very beginning, these things indicate that Tarantino had a lot of time, a lot of film rolls and total freedom in terms of decision-making. The scene with the door and the nails is hilarious at first, simply BECAUSE it drags on way too long, but when it gets repeated for the third time or so in full length, any editor or playwright or producer would have objected, I guess.The story in Tarantino's films was always rather simple, but it didn't matter because they were a tour de force of sharp dialog and good acting. Reservoir Dogs, my favorite QT film, even deliberately ignored the story and instead focused on the intense chemistry and the funny statements of the characters, and it worked brilliantly. The dialog in The Hateful Eight is not as exceptional as we might have expected, and since the story is extremely simple and unfolds in one location only, the only thing that keeps us interested is the acting, really. It is mostly well done, even when Madsen seems to be totally trapped in his way of walking and talking, and Roth coming across as an imitation of Waltz at one point. Russel and Jason Leigh as the odd couple stand out and create much of our interest in the plot in the beginning. Some character's development seems unlikely, especially the swift conversion of the more racist ones.Takeshi Kitano said in an interview that he finds Tarantion's films to be very well produced B-movies, and I think there is a truth to that. Like the movie characters that are stuck in the cabin, Tarantino seems to be a bit stuck with his semi-trashy, comic-like way to tell a story. He explored this in 8 films now. He could start to use landscapes or create characters that have motivations that go beyond a bag full of money, and I really wonder what his power as a filmmaker could do with those other aspects of the medium. But I guess that's not his thing, and he obviously is not reinventing himself. He does add a new facet to it though with a few political statements here and there.Never mind the violence, which is just a lot of fake blood and bits and parts flying around, but never shocks us with its realness. If you would like to explore what violence looks like outside of the world of a comic book geek, I suggest movies like Gomorrah by Matteo Garrone. The fellatio scene has it's equivalent in the basement scene of Pulp Fiction.All this might sound harsh, maybe too harsh. I wasn't bored throughout the almost 3 hours running time, but I have to say that I have been watching a lot of slow movies recently, so my patience has been trained. There were a few twists and turns in the second part of the movie, and the end was somewhat interesting, but it also felt a bit weak after a 3 hour buildup. No reason for a 1 star rating, since the acting, the costumes, the sets etc. are too good for that. I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Dead or Alive,"Greetings again from the darkness. If one is to believe Quentin Tarantino, the leaked script scandal nearly turned this into a novel, rather than what it clearly needed to be  a Quentin Tarantino movie (his 8th). It could even be considered a companion piece to Django Unchained (though this takes place in snowy Wyoming, as opposed to the balmy Deep South). It's set soon after the Civil War and there still exists a palpable uneasiness between Confederate and Union types, creating a constantly teetering milieu between violence and progress.Tarantino's obsession with classic film led him to utilize the same Ultra Panavision 70 lenses used for Ben-Hur (1959), which required the retrofitting of 50 theaters across the country for the ""road show"". This presentation includes an opening musical Overture, a midpoint Intermission, and approximately 6 minutes of footage that highlight this rarely used format  stunning snow-filled vistas and wide shots of the frontier. When the film opens nationwide, the digital version will be straight-forward (though still nearly 3 hours in run time). The ""road show"" features are bonuses for us film geeks, and will have no impact on whether one enjoys the film or not.Rather than follow in John Ford's majestic Western footsteps, QT has the vast majority of the story take place within a one-room set called Minnie's Haberdashery. Thanks to a record blizzard, the general store/saloon turns into a human snake pit filled with nefarious types who are quick with a quip and a trigger. The diabolical assemblage is made up of John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell, featuring world class whiskers), a bounty hunter who is handcuffed to his latest prize Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh); another bounty hunter (Union) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson); British fancy boy Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who says he's the hangman for Red Rock; the self-professed new Sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins); General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a former Confederate officer; quiet cowpoke Joe Gage (Michael Madsen); and Senor Bob (Demian Bichir), whom Minnie left tending the store in her absence.Now as you might expect, some of the above descriptions may be true, while others could be considered ""conveniences"". What you also might expect is a steady rain of Tarantino dialogue delivered by the perfectly chosen cast. Each of these players grasps the cadence required to make this work  they have the rhythm of a stage play – a new direction that Tarantino has hinted at. And have no fear, over-the-top violence fills the second half of the story as the confined space and contradictory missions begin to clash.No more need be said about the characters or the story. Russell, Jackson, Goggins and Ms. Leigh are especially effective at enlivening their scenes, and they are joined by supporting actors such as Dave Parks (son of the great Michael Parks), Gene Jones (who didn't wish to call the coin flip in No Country for Old Men), Dana Gourrier (as Minnie), QT favorite Zoe Bell (as Six-horse Judy), and even Channing Tatum.Legendary composer Ennio Morricone delivers his first western score in about 40 years, which is important since he's the man behind the iconic music of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. On the topic of music, Morricone's score is complimented by only a smattering of other songs (including a Roy Orbison gem and a solo from Jennifer Jason Leigh), which is unusual in the Tarantino canon. Three-time Oscar winner Robert Richardson re-teams with Tarantino and seems to have a blast with the challenges presented by the one-room set  he plays with focus and depth to create some fantastic shots. It should also be noted that the Sound is spectacular – everything from gunshots, to swirling wind, to boots and spurs, to galloping stage coach horses, and even the pouring out of coffee.All of the above results in a stunning movie experience with the anticipated QT humor, violence, and anti-racism sentiment (though the N-word usage is once again tough to take)  yet somehow the final product doesn't equal the individual moments of genius. It comes across as a blend of Agatha Christie, (Tarantino's own) Reservoir Dogs, and John Carpenter's The Thing minus the cohesiveness required for a great movie. So enjoy the characters, the technical achievements, and the terrific dialogue, but know that it's unlikely to be one of those that cause you to stop down while surfing cable channels in a couple years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Film of 2015,"I went to see Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight last night at the 9:30 showing. With 2 hours and 47 minutes of stellar entertainment, I left the theatre after midnight, walking to my car in the dark parking lot, feeling energized despite the time and the cold of winter. And unlike Roy Orbison's song at the end credits, I wasn't among the many not coming home.It played in auditorium 6, which has stadium seating and a larger screen. Very ideal for a film shot in the breathtaking 2.76:1 aspect ratio. I would have loved to see the Roadshow version of the film, which is only in select theatres – 50, the last I heard – which are retrofitted with 70mm film projectors. The roadshow version also includes an overture and an intermission. Although I didn't need an intermission; I was too mesmerized by The Hateful Eight's greatness.As expected, Tarantino has not failed to disappoint. Aesthetically, The HateFul Eight is the best film of 2015. Here's an example: There's a scene at the end with Samuel L. Jackson lying on the bed in the background, and Walton Goggins resting on the floor in the foreground. There is a shallow depth of field, but both characters are in sharp focus. How is this possible? By using a diopter split-focus lens. This makes sense, since John Carpenter's The Thing – which Tarantino said was an inspiration for The Hateful Eight – uses this technique.This film has one of the best opening credit sequences I have ever seen, and definitely the best for 2015. We see a barren, snow covered landscape, then a closeup of a large, erected Christian cross, then the camera pulls back while the credits are displayed, with a six-horse stage coach running through the frame. This is all scored by Ennio Morricone's ominous music. I agree with Tarantino's Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert comparison. The opening is so awesome, and such a great way to set the mood of the film, and I feel sorry for those who came in late.Although very different in their techniques, I enjoyed the The Hateful Eight's cinematography more than Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant. Alejandro is also the director of 2014's Birdman, a film that was photographically superior, but with a story that didn't captivate me much. The Revenant is like Birdman with the use of fluid, steadicam shots, with a wide angle lens.This film is similar to Tarantino's debut Reservoir Dogs, in that most of film takes place inside one room, but a haberdashery for The Hateful Eight rather than a warehouse. Two bounty hunters, a female prisoner, a stagecoach driver, and a future Sheriff make their way to Minnie's Haberdashery, where they meet four other characters. The nine are now shacked up together while they wait for the Wyoming blizzard to pass. They gradually grow more and more distrustful of each other. That's nine characters right there, and there are more to come, so who are The Hateful Eight? It is the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino, but I'm guessing the title is in reference to eight of the characters. Minus the female prisoner, there's eight for the first half of the film. Or if you were to minus the stagecoach driver, there's eight for the first of the film. Who comprises the eight hateful characters?Filled with a plethora of story-telling and comical dialogue, and sudden bursts of extreme, yet often cartoonish violence, Tarantino's signature trademarks are in The Hateful Eight. The film forces us to multitask by listening to the lengthy talk of its characters while being stunned by the beautiful cinematography, and it's evident that Tarantino hasn't lost his touch. A masterpiece, which I'll be watching again and again.http://www.stockofbabes.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
People are dishing out way to much hate for the eight,"This is an instant classic Tarantino film. It's like all of his other movies put into one. He also uses mostly actors from his other movies... well even more than the usual. Admittedly this film can start off slow if you are not a Quentin Tarantino fan or don't know how his movies are. As a fan you watch and wait anticipating a good finally and it doesn't disappoint. He seems to cater this movie to the fans of his previous titles and so the haters are out strong on this one.Like Django unchained, this film starts off post civil war but doesn't touch on the black and white topic as much. Still though with Samuel Jackson being a black bounty hunter back in those times has its similarities with Django unchained. You will also see major similarities with Reservoir Dogs, but since they are both great movies and he's only copying himself I don't see a problem with that.As soon as you realize that you are watching a ""who-done-it"" western you can just sit back and enjoy and watch the characters unfold.The actors all do an amazing job and although not his best... Quentin Tarantino delivers. I gave it a solid 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's brilliant writing and oddball characters make The Hateful Eight a great western thriller,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers with a unique voice. Most of the time, you could find one of his movies like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained and identify that it's a Tarantino movie right away, even if one were to start watching it in the middle. A lot of it has to do that he clearly writes his characters before the story. It's just that they are so well built as oddballs that are capable of anything given their circumstance that you'd probably want to watch them regardless of what they were doing. Even watching the characters of Reservoir Dogs play poker would be interesting.By looking at his movies, you'd see that they are slow stories that rely on the characters dialogue then the actual action. That inspiration comes from spaghetti westerns like A Fist Full of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which contain the same slow pace. Impatient people may see that as a bad thing, but when I go to the movies, the best stories are the ones that are being told by the most fascinating people. Django Unchained had it and so does today's movie, The Hateful Eight.Some time after the Civil War, bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is trying to get his set of dead bodies to the next town of Red Rock, Wyoming so that he can collect his money. It's cold and a blizzard is approaching, so when a stagecoach arrives, he asks for a ride. Inside the stagecoach is another bounty hunter, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (played by Kurt Russell) who has captured fugitive Daisy Domergue (played by Jenifer Jason Leigh) and is taking her to town to hang. They take Warren, along with a man Chris Mannix (played by Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, and make it to a cabin before the blizzard catches them.The cabin is a lodge for stagecoaches called Minnie's Haberdashery that's being looked after by a Mexican Bob (played by Demián Bichir) while the owner is out visiting her mother. Also in the Haberdashery is British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (played by Tim Roth) quiet cowboy Joe Gage (played by Michael Madsen) and former Confederate General Sandy Smithers (played by Bruce Dern). The eight individuals are all in for a hard couple of days as the blizzard rages while they discuss the post Civil War and maybe fire off some guns.Just like Tarantino's previous movies, The Hateful Eight's biggest strength are the characters. They had to be good characters, given that the movie is primarily set (for the most part) in it's one cabin location. Every one of these people are so well constructed that they seem like they have come from other stories and that they have managed to find themselves in this one. I think my favorite had to be Kurt Russell's Hangman bounty hunter as he seemed to be the one most comfortable in being in a western.With the characters comes a sort of a classic ""who-done-it"" mystery that's so much of a nutty scenario that I'd rather not give it away. I can say that the movie feels like two halves; the first being the introduction and the back stories while the second half is bloodier and the reaction to the reveals. Parts of the first half felt a little too slow (perhaps a few minutes could have been cut from it's three hour running time), but it all pays off later on when things are revealed and were in our seats trying to find out who's going to make it in the end.I'll give this nine stagecoaches out of ten. The Hateful Eight is definitely not for those that are too squeamish by the violence and language level, but I promise that this is one of the best of 2015. I have yet to see a truly bad movie from Tarantino and this proves he's nowhere close to slowing down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent performances with a sharp screenplay,"Quentin Tarantino has delivered a lot of solid films over his career and The Hateful is a part of that.The Hateful Eight follows eight characters that are stuck in a cabin during a blizzard and they're all suspicious of one another.I really enjoyed watching this film. I do have to admit it's a bit too long and some scenes do drag but I was consistently riveted from start to finish. This film was meant to be a stageplay and it does feel like that. Majority of the film takes place in one single location and it's hard to keep someone's interest for 2 hours and 40 minutes if it happens mainly in one location but Tarantino managed to do it. There are so many scenes where characters just talk to each other but Tarantino makes it so engaging because of the spectacular dialogue and performances on screen. There is one scene where Samuel L. Jackson delivers a lengthy monologue and it's one of the most captivating and intense scenes in the movie. The third act gets super entertaining as it goes full Tarantino.Despite being in one location most of the time, this is a really gorgeous looking film. The outside cinematography looks so beautiful and I really felt the icy cold weather portrayed. I wish I saw this on the big screen as the experience would be elevated so much more. It's shot really well and the costumes and makeup is excellent. One issue I have with the third act is the use of narration. Tarantino has used a fair amount of narration in his previous films and The Hateful Eight is no different but I don't think it was properly utilised. It's a storytelling choice that Tarantino hasn't been able to master yet.The well written dialogue kept me hooked but it was also the performances that kept me invested. This is Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in recent years. He delivers dialogues extremely eloquently and is so fun to watch. Kurt Russell and Bruce Dern are also really good. This is the best I've seen Jennifer Jason Leigh in a film. She was awesome. It was great to see Tim Roth and Michael Madsen in a Tarantino movie after a long time. Demián Bichir was really good and Walton Goggins was another standout performer.The Hateful Eight is by no means Quentin Tarantino's best work. It's more towards the weaker side of his filmography but I loved it regardless. The sharp dialogue, phenomenal performances and gorgeous scenery made it an extremely fun experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's Best Since Pulp Fiction,"On December 28 that I was fortunate enough to see the film in its glorious 70 millimeter, anamorphic Ultrapanavision film experience. While visiting my sister in Tulsa, my girlfriend, my sister, a good friend, and I packed into the car and made the trip to Oklahoma City to see The Hateful Eight Roadshow during it's brief week-long early release. We were given limited-edition pamphlets to reinforce the 1950s grand film exhibition style showing, something very exciting to experience in 2015.This wasn't the last time that I got to see the extended film version of The Hateful Eight, however, as on March 21, the older theater in my area, the one that still has film projectors, was playing that version. Ryan, a big Tarantino fan also, asked me to tag along with him to this showing, and for reasons I will soon expound, I was eager to do so.The film opens with an overture (and clearly labeled as such) which emphasizes the, perhaps, best aspect of the movie: the incredible score by Ennio Morricone. The great Italian composer of western staples (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly for one) delivers some of his most haunting and powerful sounds in The Hateful Eight. The main theme lingered in my head for hours and I still enjoy listening to the music by itself or with a good game of Bang! the Dice Game (one of my favorite board games and one that plays out a wild west shoot out where everyone has a hidden role; I kept thinking I was watching Bang!: The Dice Game: The Movie). The suspense and intrigue Taratino captured in his anamorphic lenses are even better capture by Morricone's menacing motifs.As the overture fades back into background music, the viewer is greeted with awe-inspiring wide images of snowy Colorado as O.B., the driver, and notably not one of the titular eight, leads his wagon down a winding path. The stubborn desire for Tarantino to shoot the film in a 2.76:1 aspect ratio is immediately understood; not only the for the breath-taking images, but also the magnificent flicker. It's not easy to see a movie actually played on film these days (and a big reason I tend to prefer the term movie to film). The score's theme builds as an aesthetically pleasing title sequence plays (the climax of the theme occurs as Morricone's name appears, a nice touch.)Inside the wagon are two of our eight, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Daisy ""The Prisoner"" Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They are soon (well, this first section of the is almost an hour long) joined by Major Marquis ""The Bounty Hunter"" Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris ""The Sheriff"" Mannix (Walton Goggins). The interplay of these characters was one of my favorite aspects of the film. Tarantino's dialog is quick and witty, anachronistic yet still believable. As he frequently does in his movies, Tarantino deals with race, gender, and, in this case, nationality you might say, disputes head-on in an at once hilarious and profound way. As the group arrives at the haberdashery, where the remaining two hours of the film take place, a whodunit mystery is flamed as John Ruth tries to figure out which of the many shady characters are after his $10,000 bounty on Miss Domergue. The slow action, strong suspense and intrigue, and engaging dialog brought me immediately back to Reservoir Dogs, one of my all-time favorite films.After the intermission, and yes, there was a 15 minute intermission, lights on and all, I wasn't quite as satisfied with the film. Suspenseful sections seemed to be answered too quickly without permitting the view a chance to solve anything. The film went to more high action, reminding me more of Django: Unchained rather than Reservoir Dogs. Don't get me wrong, Django was fantastic, but my favorite aspects of Tarantino's films are the dialog and the slick aesthetic paired with the intrigue of a great story. I don't think those decisions made it a bad movie, but I was personally a little disappointed. Still, the ending of the movie was exceptionally well done and tied up the story as well as the themes of the story beautifully. I have already seen the film twice in four months and I would watch it yet again tomorrow. Rewatching the film, I had new appreciation for the character's and was also able to pick up on a lot of the subtle foreshadowing. When you go back and watch a movie saying, ""How could I be so blind?"" you know you're watching a great director. I place The Hateful Eight among my top four Tarantino films at least, and, thereby, as one of my favorite movies period. I need to listen to the main theme again right now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Exploitation cinema as good as it gets,"I can start off by saying that the plot makes absolutely no sense if you think about it for more than a millisecond. That being said, there is the obvious response that the film is really about the dialogue and the characters. Are these characters and their inflated utterances from reality or are they clones of Tarantino in various moods? You decide: I resign.
I give three stars for performances. Some might weigh performances higher than I; but I prefer solid, disciplined, *actual* writing and plot. I don't care for fluff disguised as something higher.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Next Jackie Brown,"Quentin Tarantino's eighth feature film includes a terrific cast of experienced QT veterans (with the addition of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Channing Tatum) who all come come together to put on a theatrical performance filled with classic Tarantino gags (blood, guns, exploding heads). The story is told in six chapters, divided by an intermission halfway through the film. Tarantino's insistence with making the movie an ""event"" (i.e. the inclusion of an overture and the intermission itself), are pretty much the only things this movie had going for it. It was neat to sit through the film as theater-goers back in the day would have, but once the movie began, it never really picked up.The story itself is not particularly engaging; it's essentially an ultra-violent ""who- done-it"" flick. The vulgarity lacked purpose and purely existed for the sake of maintaining and keeping with the director's violent reputation. It's not a special or even interesting film, but it does contain, during some parts, his unique cinematic style.Visually, it's nice to watch. The ultra-wide format allowed for some awesome exterior shots, but once we get inside the cabin, where 70% of the film takes place, the ultra-wide serves no purpose. This lead to a surplus of unmotivated lighting, especially once nightfall hit.Production value was off the charts, the set decoration and wardrobe are perfect and the acting is decent, but the characters portrayed are neither likable nor hatable. It was difficult to root for any of them, which took out any inkling of suspense. Since I didn't care who died, I was just waiting for the next person to get shot. None of the characters possessed charm, making each of them just as dreadful as the next. As a die-hard QT fan, I don't regret seeing it, but if this was any other director, I'd suggest waiting for the DVD. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

gratuitous violence and unnecessary gory details,"I guess I *used* to be a Tarantino fan, but this flick now puts me on the side of the ""I once used to like his films"". With great anticipation, went to see the special 70mm version, an expectation that was elevated even more when I discovered that the first 8 showings in three days at my city theater (chosen for the 70mm release) was sold out, and that I had to purchase tickets for a showing two days later.Don't get me wrong, it was WELL MADE. But I don't think the gratuitous violence and gory details give any additional value to the plot. I could just have well been at a B-rate flea market and for a dollar, purchased a used DVD of some obscure horror film director, showing blood splatter and body parts dangling.And if you are using the privilege of shooting in 65mm lenses, then you should exploit it for grandiose outdoor scenery. No. Not here. 95% of the plot is indoors. Wasted.About the Ennio Morricone full score: not impressed. The overture of music only was nice. But that's about it. The rest of the plot had very little need for musical support. The rest of the plot was just a string of sequential quotes from verbal dialogue that had very little need for musical background. Sergio Leone employed Morricone's music very differently, where the sound, tunes, and lyrics ARE the dialogue. A Sergio Leone close-up is a rugged Klaus Kinski face, twitching nervously, and a jarring sound track supporting its expression. But Tarantino never NEVER uses the music to his plot advantage. So, what's the music for ? left the theater unsatisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
WHAT WAS Tarantino THINKING?,"Let me say upfront that I have liked all of Tarantino's Movies up till now. But his latest offering, The Hateful 8, is way below his usual standard! To begin with he shot it in 70mm, which is normally reserved for film- makers making some sort of epic production....this film is no epic production, and is in fact far from it! The movie is way too long, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the amount of dialogue is excessive, and to be quite blunt, boring and unnecessary. I am also fed up seeing Samuel L. Jackson continue to play Samuel L. Jackson! Is Tarantino unaware there are far better black actors in the cinema world? There could have been at least 30 minutes cut from this movie, and maybe, just maybe it may have made it a bit more bearable! Maybe it's time Tarantino takes a break from writing and directing, and starts rethinking his approach to movie making? He may also need to sit down and watch some Coen Brothers movies, just to see that a good movie can be made, without gratuitous violence. I hope he does not have another Western in mind for his next movie, and can move on to the present?

Tarantino fan? You gotta watch this. Otherwise skip it,"OMG I loved this film. I have always been a Tarantino fan for years and years. I have loved everything he has done. And what he manages with Samuel L Jackson is amazing!! I mean seriously this is just amazed me to no end. This is a film that lives and breathes off the dialogue and speaking. It has a lot of commentary about the world we live in and I love this movie for doing that. It is also just a really interesting film on racism in the same way Django was, but this film is no Django. This movie falters because of its premise. It just isn't strong enough. It is also too long. Not like Kill Bill either where it was long, but didn't feel long. This film just has a really slow burn to get into the story before it does get interesting.The acting is superb tho. Not just Samuel L Jackson is great, but Kurt Russell wins. Jennifer Jason Leigh is just funny with all of her lines. \ Walton Goggins also is a new actor who won me over with this movie as well, and deserves a lot of the love in the film as well.Overall this is a film that I would recommend people go out and give a shot too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Unrecognized greatness from Tarantino,"Listen close when I say it is absolutely criminal for this to not have been nominated for more, and of course I know that it was nominated for three Oscars (while I don't think Jennifer Jason Leigh is that deserving of a nomination), but there were so many categories I thought this movie would make it into. First and foremost Tarantino is a bit of a scumbag and conceded, and while it gets annoying when he does interviews about his movies, he is still a brilliant writer, and has such a unique style that is so appreciated, and I think at this point everyone just comes to expect greatness from Tarantino. I am no Tarantino fan-boy mind you, this movie has flaws, for example I think the character of Joe Gage was unnecessary, but man was this written well! And everyone keeps talking about how racist the Oscars are and mentioning Straight Outta Compton, and the lack of non white actors being nominated, and there's a fantastic actor, Samuel L Jackson, just begging for a nomination. A lot of people are really Hateful(pun intended) on this movie when it really is up there with Tarantino's other films, everyone should check it out because it is the best adaptation of Clue we will probably ever see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
My attempt at an even handed review,"I have had mixed feelings about Tarantino and his films since the outset. I don't like his his world-view (sadists are cool, victims are contemptible) and think he's a one-trick-pony whose every film relies on a single mechanism (manipulating the audience into applauding cruel violence). But, that said, I can hardly deny the fact that Tarantino was a seminal voice of late 20th century cinema, and that some of the fan-boy adulation is warranted.Regarding Tarantino as a persona, for me the elephant in the room is how sad it is that an obviously gay man is not brave enough (in 2016!) to come out, when he would be celebrated with hysterical adulation were he to do so. Instead he makes film after film that manage to be camp as a row of tents yet grotesquely homophobic at the same time.On to the film. The old Hollywood saw says that ""a movie with a message is like a gift with the price tag still on"". Well, The Hateful Eight is like a vulgar nouveau riche snob swanning into a poor relative's humble home, bestowing a gift far too expensive to be reciprocated, then going on and on about exactly how much it cost.We all got the message - America's history of slavery and its relationship to the civil war has cast long shadows that affect black/white relations in the US to this day. The symbolism could hardly be more on-the-nose. All 4 of the horses of the stagecoach for Caucasians were black, but SLJ had a black horse and a white horse working together. And there was a chess board with black and white pieces, but only white men ever sat in the two chairs. And the single Mexican character said people had tried to teach him the rules but they never stuck, nevertheless he wouldn't mind watching from the sidelines etc. etc.Regarding the overuse of the n word: kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for turning down the role of Daisy. I can sort of visualise that meeting - she took one look at Daisy's first line, ""Howdy n****r"", and said ""Um, what are the shoot dates? Oh no, the thing is, I might have a headache on those days, but thanks for considering me"".Anyway, the film overall was a fairly entertaining, modestly clever, sensationalist genre film, and usually I like those. If it had been an hour shorter, and shot by some scrappy teenagers on a budget of $90k (or even $350k as an upper estimate) like Raimi's The Evil Dead, I would be praising The Hateful Eight to the skies. But it wasn't made under those circumstances - it was made on a budget of $44 million by a veteran Hollywood darling director with every resource imaginable at his disposal.What annoyed me most was the preposterous decision to shoot what was effectively a stage play on 65mm film. That's like hiring a supertechnocrane to film a pack shot. There weren't even that many wide shots - whole 15 minute sections of the film were pretty much just MCU singles and 2 shots filmed in studio.I can only imagine that it was a deliberate industry in-joke that Tarantino decided to make a movie that was almost completely ""tell, don't show"". The script went:Actor: You don't know about (character X)? Well I'll tell you about (character X).or,Another actor: Hey, don't I know you? You're (character Y). Didn't you (blah blah blah) at (blah)?In fact it was nearly all verbal exposition, right the way through to the end of the film.Regarding the acting. Well, they're all great actors, so I can only take it that they were delivering their performances as per Tarantino's direction. But the absurd macho posturing by everyone involved (including Jennifer Jason Leigh) ended up looking like a bunch of drag queens throwing shade in a vogue femme dramatics battle.To paradoxically counter that, the most egregious homophobia in this one was SLJ's goading of Bruce Dern's character with the anecdote (amazingly, some back-story actually shown on screen, presumably to allow Tarantino to get in some ""shocking"" full frontal male nudity) about forcing his son to suck his dick, as if a white man having to suck a black man's cock were the *most* humiliating and shameful thing that any human being has ever had to do. Of course we understand that this is how SLJ's character hoped Bruce Dern's character would consider the scenario, but I don't fully buy it - it seemed more to me like the same projection of Tarantino's own internal homophobia that he has trotted out in pretty much every one of his films so far as a sort of public therapy session on a transparent throwaway account.I can imagine Tarantino sitting down thinking: OK, I've got grind-house, I've got spaghetti western, I've got blaxploitation. But something's missing I know, let's throw in a chronology shift, a bit of voice-over (uncredited of course, in my new ""manly"" voice that I can pull off for a few seconds at a time), and see something we've already seen, but from a different angle. Ah god, there are no car boots available... oh, I know, let's have that guy Charly hide in the coal bunker so I can get a low angle shot of someone opening the door from the outside. I've got two more films to do to get to 10 which seems like an iconic number - I guess I can stretch these elements out until then - if it worked once, repeat it, that's what I always say (and do).Overall The Hateful Eight was not bad - acceptably entertaining in fact - but it was certainly not good, and definitely not worthy of its current 8.1 stars. I'm giving it 5 out of 10 because it was just OK and nothing more or less.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

What else did you expect from Quentin Tarantino?My friends, he's done it again. The Hateful Eight is something you absolutely can't miss. This is the western that Tarantino has waited his entire life to make, and boy, does he let you know it. Without spoiling it, it's Reservoir Dogs in the old west, with a murder-mystery that would leave the makers of Clue green with envy. Every performance is heavily committed and excellent. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a crazed wonder, and she nearly stole the movie for me. In 70MM, it looked stunning. I'm sad that it only was a roadshow, I miss film dearly.It made me laugh, it made me gasp and it made me squirm. Once you see it, you won't be able to stop talking about it. What a spectacular season to see this and Star Wars playing at the same time. The movies aren't dead, man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
three hours of your life you will never get back,"If you are among those once-discerning viewers who believe that everything QT does is wonderful because he is smart and clever and the rest of us so hobbled we can just barely appreciate his genius, then just hit the NOT USEFUL key and go on about your business. Don't bother with the rest of this review.For those viewers who still have an ounce of common sense, my comments are:1. Once again, QT makes an attempt to pay homage to the Italian westerns, using the camera angles and plot lines most associated with this unique genre of film that appeared in the 60s and disappeared in the 70s. Jackson plays the Lee Van Cleef character (and does a very poor job of it) and the rest of the cast, all major talents in their own right, do their best to keep up with the director's ""vision"" - but ultimately fail.2. For the record, for the six or seven readers who are still with me, I watched all the original Italian westerns in that era. In theatres. Even the ones where the distribution companies could not afford to redub, and used subtitles. All of them. I loved them. I loved the way the tight camera angles and overdone sound effects would set you up for the scenes of explosive violence that followed. There was a unique ""beat"" or cadence to these films -- dialog, character development, slow stretches, explosive action, conflict development, more action, less dialog, less development, much more action, more action, ... and a final culmination.3. QT, as with everything he does, believes he not only understands the inner workings of these films but can (heavy sigh) improve on them. He should google the term ""hubris."" And his many fans (too many) should re-read the story of the Emperors New Clothes.4. This film turns the original formula -- which worked -- into an overlong stage play full of hackneyed dialog that doesn't work at all. Some of the best talents in this business are wasted because they are compelled by the script and the director to deliver performances which they instinctively realize are atonal. There is no viewer engagement. There is no audience connection. I feel especially sorry for viewers who never saw the originals and came to the theatre believing, based on the sycophantic reviewers, that they are watching something wonderful and amazing. Like the opera-goers who fall asleep during the performance, and afterwards pretend it was a treat.I wonder if viewers of the future will look back at the QT phenomenon and wonder what the heck we were smoking?",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Hateful Eight"" (2015) is a bloody great entertainment. If you never were a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this movie probably won't make you his fan now. Nevertheless, ""The Hateful Eight"" is closer to ""Reservoir Dogs"" then anything he has ever made, it is like ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the old west.The plot is very simple here actually, i won't go into the details or spoil anything, but this is kinda straightforward story. But it is done SO good, that at running time almost 3 hours i was involved, intrigued and engaged with a story very much. Script is great as usual, acting is electrifying by all involved, music is haunting, directing is very solid. As much as i enjoyed ""Django Unchained"", which is more epic in every way, i have to admit that finally ""The Hateful Eight"" involved me more into the story - sometimes less i better.Overall, this is a great movie. It has a very simple yet jigsaw type of plot, great performances, amazing and involving writing. ""The Hateful Eight"" is much more serious in tone then ""Django Unchained"" and is much more closer to ""Dogs"". All in all this is a great movie on all accounts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
So great,"The magic of Tarantino once again hits the vein with a perfect storm of melodrama, splatter, mystery, western and comedy. Too bad a lot of people, it seems, don't appreciate his masterpiece. But maybe we shouldn't focus on them, and rather just love the movie for what it is - superb in all it's quirkiness.First I was hesitant to see it in the cinemas, because I'd heard it was very violent, even for Tarantino. And I didn't want a very violent 3 h picture. But as we all know, we who've seen it, it is not very violent, at all really.The performances of especially Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggings and Jennifer Jason Leigh are great.So what's not to like about this movie? Well, it's long. That could be negative. The movie is slow (relatively slow), that could be negative. The movie is character and dialogue driven. That could be negative. Most of the movie is inside a cabin. That could be negative. If you on the other hand don't find any of these circumstances to be negative, and you rather like the whole plot, story and premise - well, then you are in for a treat. Tarantino arches the craft to a maximum, and when he touches lightly on the red line it vibrates perfectly.You will rejoice, laugh and have a really, really, good time. You won't puke.Tarantinos second best film to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"""Oh, a Haberdashery, it's a joke.""","I had the suspicion watching this again that this could become like another JACKIE BROWN for Tarantino - a film that is somewhat (not altogether but somewhat) under-appreciated and will gain in following and status over time. It's a difficult film to embrace, and yet watching it again I don't know if I can call it completely 'nihilistic'. That's the belief that everything is meaningless, in nothing. I think that these characters, or some of them, want to believe in *something* - hell, even Daisy has a family, right, that has some meaning to it - but it's really about the *FAILING* of meaning, how meaning is screwed up by the promises and hopes of the American dream.The Lincoln letter, the leaders of the confederacy and the ""Renegade Army"" and of course what slavery did and continues to do, so that even those who are ""free"" like Marquis Warren are never really free, not in their own life time (and if you read in-between the lines this is much more of an ex-slave getting revenge than Django, who was ready to go on his merry way once he got his bride), these are all things that poison and distort the truth of things.So in a way it's actually an extremely moral film - well, EXTREME and MORAL as a film put together when you think about it - and that it's all acted by the gathered performers without a missed note (seeing it again the depth to which Madsen gives Joe Gage sticks out a little more, the image of the ""Cowpoke"" who is a twisted nightmarish killer), and while I don't think Tarantino is an overtly political filmmaker he's certainly seen his rather large fair share of spaghetti westerns and many of those were very political, plus he is not untouched by the world around him so in a way this reflects the country we're in far more than anything else I can think of in the past couple of years.Not to mention the direction, seeing as this is all shot on gigantic 70mm cameras and there's no space for things like hand-held shots or zooms like on other films, he has to shoot much of this straight on. We can't look away from these mother****ers, QT may be saying, and with the way he frames shots it makes a stark, delicious contrast: often exquisite cinematography (not only the shots of the bitterly cold wilderness, an ideal backdrop for this story where nothing green or natural grows, but those details in the confining Haberdashery), and the subjects themselves are mostly rotten (except for Warren who is my favorite character, bar none, and Jackson makes him vivid and awe-inspiring and yet very human and vulnerable by the last act ).Also, it does have a lot of stuff Tarantino's done before - theatrical ""acting"" to win over other characters' trust, verbiage that almost goes on too long but hey, hell with it, he can do it better than anyone and every word feels like it should be there (cut out one and it might start to unravel), and some gruesome violence (though on repeat viewing it's not THAT gruesome - I'd say it's about on par with Pulp Fiction on the scale, so much less than the Kill Bills or Django or Basterds, so if there are a lot of bodies that hit the floor and blood that flows in the 2nd half, it stands out because of how we've come to this.... okay, the throwing up of blood is still sick, but hilarious) - but when it's Tarantino and I love his stuff, I can't complain.good times, QT salad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
the first time you can truly say that he's overdone it,"From the amusingly warped mind of Quentin Tarantino comes this combination western/whodunit/character study set in post-Civil War era Wyoming. In the midst of a brutal blizzard, the titular strangers seek shelter at a local tavern but it soon becomes clear that not everyone is what they seem as startling revelations come to the fore. By now you know that whenever you hear this director's name and get pulled into his world that nothing will go quite the way you expect it to, but despite a flavorful cast of characters, vivid setting, and the expected scintillating dialogue, this is a surprisingly unmemorable effort; begins with an effectively tense and teasing build-up, but goes on way too long, with a final act that's relentlessly (and needlessly) violent, ugly, and mean, instead of twistedly fun like so many of the director's previous efforts. Playing out like some weird amalgam of Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained, and Clue, this is self-indulgent to a fault, and doesn't provide a very resounding resolution given the excruciating length of time it takes to tell this story. **½",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Quentin Tarantino at his best.,"This.. this is quentin Tarantino at it's best. I don't want to say anything about it. Just go see it and you wont be disappointed. Especially if you liked Django Unchained you sure as hell will love this one. It's again a story of plot twists and violence. samuel l jackson puts on a great performance of bountyhunter.But the movie itself is all about Tarantino and his obsession with bloody gritty pulp stories.

"Not His Best, but...","If you are reading this review, no doubt you have read some 1s and some 10s as well. I am in- between those reviews leaning toward the 10s. The movie was not what I expected. It was not Inglorious Bastards or Django Unchained. It was a simple Who Dunnit without the butler. However, the acting is so good that the movie worked.Basically shot in real time, Tarantino has this way of shooting long shots with one camera where you really feel that you are part of the dialogue. It is quite captivating.And, most importantly, The Hateful Eight blew away The Revenant (a movie I just did not get).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Funny, Gory, Beautifully Shot Western","Quentin Tarantino, whether you like his films or not, deserves credit as one of the best directors of our age, because his films are so consistently great. Tarantino's ""Hateful 8"" should be experienced as he intended, in 70mm film showings, because average theaters can't quite do the film justice. The Hateful 8 is blood covered fun, with a story that is surprisingly unpredictable, and features truly beautiful cinematography. A note for anybody not aware, Tarantino's films are extremely gory and feature strong language, so if you don't like that kind of subject matter, this film isn't for you.Tarantino's is notorious for his use of gore and language, but he always finds a way to make it fun. The Hateful 8 is no exception as the film is both extremely gory, and often hilarious. One of the biggest reasons the film is so funny is Tarantino's iconic, and witty dialogue. It is widely discussed that Tarantino is one of the best writers of dialogue and ""The Hateful 8"" is a great showcase of that.Before seeing the film, I was curious, because the film was advertised as a story of 8 people trapped in a cottage during a blizzard, while that is a part of the story, it is far larger than that. The best example is that entering the film Channing Tatum was confirmed to be in the film, and it seemed unclear what role he could have, however he has a pretty significant role in the film. In many ways the plot unfolds like a game of clue, and the story is unpredictable in what turns the plot will take next. The unpredictable plot helps save the almost 3 hour running time, which is a little too long.An example of why the run time is just a little too long, is a lot of the film focuses on the cinematography, which is why the 70mm film showings are truly worth the time to see. Most of the film is set in the gorgeous snow covered mountains of Wyoming, and the use of 70mm film gives the entire film a sleek and classical look. While the film could have been tightened up a little, if there wasn't such a focus on the cinematography, the film would lose a little of the spectacle that makes it so special.In the end The Hateful 8 is a spectacle, that should be experienced the way it was intended to, in a 70mm film showing. The film is beautiful, funny, unpredictable, and extremely violent, but it all blends in a very clean way. Tarantino has once again made a great film, and considering his resume, it seems logical to say that he is one of the best modern directors. If you like Tarantino's previous films, or films similar to Tarantino's it would be a good idea to check out The Hateful 8.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Lesser work from a great director,"Only a Great Director (TM.) would have the gall to make a movie like this. If this were a book it would be a short story or a novella at most. As a Tarantino movie it's three hours long.The movie also attempts to be a mystery, and being this unwound is fatal to it. Mysteries need to be taut, so you pay attention. There were times during ""The Hateful Eight"" where I stopped watching.I'll never know what happened to Tarantino's ability to write good dialogue. ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were nothing but quotable lines. Where were the quotable lines in any of the movies he has made since? How many lines can you remember from them, if any at all?Tarantino made a great movie with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", and an absolutely appalling one with ""Death Proof"". ""The Hateful Eight"" is like the bridge between the two. It may not have memorable dialogue or characters, but at least they don't prattle on about god-knows-what for an hour before getting killed, only to introduce a bunch more vacuous motor-mouths who do the same thing.It's still very well made, well acted, and feels like a lesser work from a great director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Django II - A play for those who'd love to kill,"Another Tarantino movie about a bunch of depraved killers, another three-hour bore-fest by the master of unabashed hate. The plot of TH8 is simple, but told very heavy-handedly, with lots of chitchat & filler scenes; several times, for example, we have to watch people meticulously nailing a door shut, because the lock is broken. This slapstick idea goes surprisingly well with the rest of the movie. Four fifths of TH8 take place in a single big room that looks like a theater stage. Before the violence starts the air of a popular theater play from olden times is not far away. For the TV edition Tarantino should consider to add boo, hiss, laugh, cheer & sob tracks to really give it an authentic ""Calico Playhouse""-feeling and to spice it up with some severely missed emotions.TH8 is again about bounty hunters, that creepy American institution. The first one, John Ruth, is called ""Hangman"". He doesn't hang his caught ""Wanted Dead or Alive""-guys himself, he just takes them back to town, where an official hangman will do this job. In the Tarantino-universe this is considered to be an irrational, stupid behavior. The desperate captive will try to flee; some companions might try to free him. Why go through all this trouble, if he could just kill them? The debauched answer is: He really loves to see people hang. That's his kink. TH8 tells the story of his journey to get his captive, Daisy D., to a place where she will perform her ""last dance"".The second bounty hunter, Marquis Warren, is quite obviously an old version of Tarantino's Django. His motivation is rabid racial hatred. He uses every excuse to kill white guys. He is the only character in this movie that is sufficiently described by the adjective ""hateful"". Why don't the white guys consider his permanent bragging about killing whites as a threat to their own lives? They are very modern that way.While the stage decoration looks genuine, the dialogs are all too frequently anachronistic, very obviously written by a social justice couch potato. They are soaked with features of an obnoxious zeitgeist: historical revisionism, hypocritical race obsession, ignorance of the human nature.The worst element of TH8 is the violence. Never before has Tarantino celebrated it with such blazing sadism. In the age of exploding zombie heads this might sound silly or like a special accomplishment, but the violence in TH8 is really sickening and repulsive. Its most sordid manifestation is during TH8's only sex scene, featuring a woman and two men, who revel in their vicarious Estragon-&-Vladimir-moment. To what depths of depravation Tarantino's groupies will follow their master?As for the title: Is ""Eight"" Tarantino's nickname? Or did he ponder: ""The hateful ate my last offerings; they will swallow even more of that stuff."" The answer is revealed at the very beginning of TH8: this is Tarantino's 8th film. How much more hate does the world need?",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Tarantino at his worst,"Well don't expect much from this lazy take on Reservoir Dogs.The only reason for the cinematography of Ultra Panavision 70 was built for great scenes of open plains like the old westerns. This film lacks those after the first few minutes. I mean, what's the point. After 10 minutes it is all set in a barn / shack /house.The characters are introduced like an Agatha Christie Novel and the plot is weak. If you like boring films this is for you. It's not a Tarantino film I would rate. It's a boring film with blood and some guts, as he always does, but apart from that its just awful.

"""Keeping You At A Disadvantage, Is An Advantage I Intend To Keep""","Tarantino's best since, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and one of the best westerns in recent memory. Excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, costume, score and acting. All of the cast deliver top notch performances. Russell, Leigh, Jackson, Roth and Goggins in particular stand out creating some very memorable characters. The plot is set in post - Civil War Wyoming when a well known bounty hunter known as, ""The Hangman"" and his current prisoner Daisy are joined by another bounty hunter and a man claiming to be the new sheriff of the town their heading to. The four are forced to stop at the well known Minnie's Haberdashery due to an impending blizzard. There they encounter four strangers already inside the stop. Things don't seem right to some of the eight including the fact that Minnie isn't there. That's where the mystery and interragation of the eight strangers begins. The plot is clever, funny, gritty, dark, brutal, violent, unique, duplicit and has a phenomenal ending. The dialogue is unparalleled and you'll hear fans of the film quote such lines as the Hangman's, ""Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep"". That line could be relative to Tarantino and his contemporaries. The film is captivating throughout which is difficult to do when most of the plot takes place in one setting. That's the brilliance of and speaks volumes of a true artist like Tarantino. This is the best of his westerns and is one of the very best in the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I wanted to love this film,"This film is a remarkable piece of cinema. The character development is carried out in a painstakingly methodical way. QT's association with Samuel L Jackson goes back a long way, though some might say that this was the ""easy"" casting option. Anyone upset by the language or violence should not have gone to see a QT film.However, for me, there is a problem and that problem is Inglorious Basterds which is an unbelievably taut, well crafted, gripping, believable (?) work of art.Watching Hateful Eight for the most part all I could see were the I.B. references, which though it is often a directorial trait, missed the mark.With regard to scoring the film I would have given a 9.5 if I had never seen the Basterds. QT says he will stop at ten films. This might not be a bad thing in my opinion as he may well have peaked too soon in 2009.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Long and derivative but still marginally fun,"This Tarantino piece, a blend of much superior western ""The Great Silence"" and ""The Thing"" is perhaps not the best of Tarantino movies, but it is still fun to watch, especially if you watch it like a miniseries it was supposed to be. It imitates Sergio Corbucci, who is a longtime Tarantino influencer, in its nihilism and graphic depiction of violentia, but falls a bit short of the second greatest SW director. Tarantino tries to say something about contemporary America, built on random killings of natives through the ages, from so-called red skinned Indians, to the present day inhabitants of Middle East, and with profound divisions and hatreds deeply build into psyche of the failing empire. The first episode depicts two bounty hunters, likable black and white men, second of which has a despicable bandit prisoner while the first one (nod to Corbucci masterpiece) has lost his horse, and are later joined by future serif on way to his duty. Then in the subsequent episodes they are stuck in some wilderness cabin amid a snow storm and apparently someone (or more than one) is a collaborator of the witchy bandit on a way to her well deserved hanging. Not exactly ""The Thing"" level of paranoia, but the old Tarantino tries. Turns out paranoia was well placed, and in the outburst of shooting everyone dies in gruesome detail, whilst white guy and black guy, mortally wounded, below the despickable hung female bandit who did give one nice dance before she went straight to hell, are bleeding to death, similarly as in much more subtle ending to ""The thing"" they are left to freeze.

The Magnificent Eight- Credit should be given to maestro Ennio Morricone,"""The Hateful Eight"" always been my Tarantino's favorite film since my first viewing (at home). The atmosphere, the acting, the production design, and most of all is the score by Maestro himself Ennio Morricone. This is kind of (western) noir film you shouldn't miss.As the film opens, my favorite first scene already gives me creeps. Not gonna lie, Ennio's score at the beginning is the best thing that happened and I'm addicted so bad to ""L'Ultima Diligenza di Red Rock"", a threatening crescendo that is reminiscent of horror movies, and in best Morricone style, towards the middle, it explodes, and transports the central theme he suggested to Tarantino: the ride of a carriage towards an uncertain future, in an atmosphere of menace. The oboes play joyously and add to the creeping up of the coming mayhem. A real Morricone thriller, but not so much in spaghetti western tradition.This is a thrilling, bloody and brutal film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western, Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films like Inglorious Bas. and Django which are very much alike in scope, tone and look and if you seen all QT's pieces, it has all of the known elements: rich dialogues, the top of brutality and memorable characters that will stay with you for the rest of your life. It has also a great companion to Reservoir Dogs in terms of structure to this film, in which a bunch of strangers are together in one place where there is distruct and controversies between the characters but this time take place in the 19th century.The screenplay and direction by Tarantino is strong and fantastic with bringing his own usual flair, look and atmosphere to the film like his previous.The cast is magnificent starring: Sam Jackson is excellent as always as Marquis Warren, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins are terrific. Roth, Maddsen, Bichir, Tatum and Dern as a cast ensemble are great in one film.Overall, I give this film 10 out'a 10 because Tarantino hasn't done something like this before (except his style stays the same).

People Need To Relax....Honestly!,"Just saw the 70mm roadshow version last night and it was AMAZING! The experience that goes along with the movie (overture, intermission, little gift) was something that i personally think, everyone should experience and, this is the way to see this movie.I was skeptical at first reading some reviews with people complaining that it was too long and dragged and was too violent but its not true. Its your typical Tarantino film. Yes, it is 3 hours long but it doesn't feel that long at all. Its all about patience and its entertaining dialogue with amazing acting that sets up the last three chapters perfectly. No one in the theater complained about the length and i think the intermission comes at a perfect time. As for the violence, typical Tarantino. Shots to the heads, overkills, etc. There is one scene at the end of chapter that gets you off guard with how messed up it is but it perfectly sets up the rest of the movie.In general, the first three chapters are just a big guessing game. Dialogue heavy, introducing characters with stories that might or might not be true which causes suspenseful interactions. Then, the last three chapters, all hell breaks loose and no one can do it better than Tarantino himself. Walton Goggins is the star in this movie. Honestly, i don't see all the hate its getting.

Also, for anyone complaining about the characters being unlikable, that is the whole point! There is no one person to root for as they are all cynical liars from which the audience is left to guess.This is a movie for true fans of the mystery genre.

"The Hateful Eighth, Good. Bad and then Ugly.... From Pekinpah to Platinum Dunes.","I was one of the few people who saw the original run of Reservoir Dogs when it opened in the UK. After reading a review with a picture Tim Roth, swimming in blood with a freshly emptied 9mm, I was hooked.QT's ground breaking debut was not a success on release, it only gained notoriety when it was pulled last minute from the TV schedule of Channel 4, who had helped fund the movie, primarily due to the cop torture sequence.The media uproar drew enough attention for a second run in theatre and the rest is history, a legend had rewritten all of the rules and shot them in the face for good measure.From that point on we were spoilt with the wild ride of Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Natural Born Killers as Quentin Tarantino was, quite rightly, hailed as a genius, but he seems to know this and that's where he falls down.The steady pace of the more mature Jackie Brown polarised audiences, as did the 2 part Kill Bill, which I felt could have been told in one film.Death Proof was pretty much unanimously kicked, Inglorious and Django were seen as a return to form even though their flaws (disjointed storytelling, last act issues, that stupid Australian accent) are widely debated or acknowledged.The Hateful Eight is no different, with the added bitter disappointment that Quentin has not learnt any lessons from his last few outings.The first half of his 8th movie is a master-class in cinema.The opening theme is a statement, the cinematography stark and beautiful as the film unfolds in its own sweet time on Quentin's trademark colourful dialogue.Kurt Russell's bounty hunter is dogged as his recent and sublime turn in Bone Tomahawk, Jackson is Jackson... 'nuff said, and Jennifer Jason Leigh looks like she's having the time of her life in her role as a gang member in chains who's every bit as brutal as her male counterparts.Enter Walton Goggins in a role that seemed written for him, and on rolls the story to Minnie's Habbidashery where the mystery unfolds in true 'whodunnit' style reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs where we meet the rest of a perfect ensemble cast and things start to really get fun.Until the sudden introduction of a condescending directors voice over...Previously that day I listened to interviews with Aaron Sorkin and Harrison Ford, both of whom bemoaned the use of exposition for expositions sake, Ford quite scathingly inferring that it was a lazy device in a visual media, particularly when the point has already been made verbally.For 90 minutes Quentin trusted us to patiently invest our time, drip feeding the mystery piece by piece as the greater puzzle started to fall into place through clues in the dialogue, vicious glances and suspicious body language, all shot in this epic photography when suddenly 'out of the f****n' blue' he starts describing what's going on, on screen.At this point, the film lost me. I was completely taken out of it, like Django and Inglorious before, by a random, jarring, amateur swerve- ball. A turd in the punchbowl. It just didn't fit, it wasn't needed and felt vain. A lot like that Australian cameo in Django.From here on the movie took a sour turn.While not without merit, there was plenty of excitement to be had when the bullets started flying but when the violence escalated to epic proportions it lacked the visceral edge of Dogs or the sudden twists in Jackie Brown.After his heavy handed exposition, the language started to feel clumsy and misjudged as the ""bitch"" and ""n****r"" count started to rise with gleeful abandon and the explosive gore-fest seemed less pulp fiction and more torture porn. It felt more nasty and mean spirited than edgy. A movie that had started out with ambitions of Pekinpah was now looking more Platinum Dunes.Maybe if the film had been voiced by Sam Elliott and started with narration, maybe that would have sat better with me, who knows? But what is certain, is that I'm increasingly frustrated with Tarantino's growing propensity to almost give us the perfect movie, yet always seems to be one final, ruthless edit away from the true genius he is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Absolute Masterpiece,"At a time when American cinema appears to be intent on producing rubbish, Tarantino saves the day, by doing what he does best. Making great movies.I sincerely hope that this brilliant movie will both embarrass and inspire the rest of the so called Producers/Writers/Directors and Actors, to up their game and follow Tarantino's lead.With this offering he has once again set the bat very high, but has also shown that American cinema can be saved.If you do not watch another movie this year or next, be sure that you do not miss this one.You will be well rewarded for your time and effort.I will not even comment on the acting/production/story etc... as there just is no way to do it justice. I will simply say that absolutely everything about this movie is beyond brilliant.It is the must see movie of recent times.....Enjoy!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A let-down but still worth a look,"The good - it's Quentin so the dialogue is interesting, the characters are colorful, and the direction is stylish. If you're a fan of his work, you'll probably find something to like here even if, like me, you don't love the movie as a whole. The bad - it's overlong, surprisingly stagy, dripping with anger and ugliness with far too many of the usual Tarantino excesses. The coarse language, cheap attempts at gore, and constant racial epithets are nothing new but it just felt like he was trying too hard and I'm not really sure what he was trying to prove. Just a suggestion but perhaps it's time for Quentin to evolve as a filmmaker and learn to make his points with some eloquence instead of throwing feces at people to get attention. Probably the biggest sin is the length of the film. There's no reason for this to be nearly three hours (and certainly no reason for it to be over three, as with the roadshow version). The first hour needs severe cuts as nothing much happens and whole scenes feel like they're repeating what happened five minutes earlier. The cast does a fine job playing unlikable characters. Yeah, they're all over-the-top, but given the slow pacing and the fact that the movie feels like a foul-mouthed variation on the old ""drawing room mysteries,"" some loud performances are kind of necessary. Look, I know most of my review has been complaining but it's not that I hated the movie. I just think it could and should have been better. As it is, it's worth watching but not one of Tarantino's best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Genius writing with a slow burn and a hell of a pay off,"Short and sweet this review shall be. With many people seem to be hating on this film. I don't understand why, its brilliance in its writing with dark humor, great cinematography and all round great performances from the cast, Whats not to love? If you don't like long movies, don't watch it. If you like fully realized original cinema and can stand some violence, then you will love it. There are also a hell of a lot of throw backs to old school cinema and westerns in this, and the 700mm film used for it adds even more to that classic feeling. The score is also amazing, and really brings to life the kind of ""clue"" searching feeling Tarantino was going for with this movie. and as for the pacing, it may start off a bit slow, but the pay off is very well worth it, which is typical of this director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not even Tarantino's best movie and it's still bloody brilliant,"I don't think it's Tarantino's best movie, he has set a really high ceiling for himself with Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, Resvoir Dogs and Inglorious Basterds (and yes, that's my order) but it's still bloody brilliant.The cast, wow! The cast! It's like he just toke his favourite actors from his other films and just put them this western masterpiece! Michael Madsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins! Even Bruce Dern is in it! And his newer additions such as Channing Tatum and Jennifer Jason Leigh",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of my favourite movies.,"Yes the movie might be unreasonably long with a few aspects some people find uninteresting. But overall the movies is a spectacular experience. The movie has an
intriguing storyline with funny, intimidating and thrilling moments. The best thing about the movie must be the dialogue. Tarantino has a remarkable talent for making witty dialogue that's not only humorous but also meaningful.The movie had several twists and turns that kept me constantly on the edge of my seat. The characters were unique with fascinating backstories and personalities.In conclusion this movie delivers an unique experience to the viewer with an unexpected plot and great acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Sporadically thrilling but ultimately frustrating,"For his eighth feature (as the film's introduction reminds us), film-maker and cinephile Quentin Tarantino capitalises on the critical and commercial success of Django Unchained (2012) and delivers another western set in the South, where racial tensions are high. Set post-Civil War, as opposed to in Django where the slave trade was very much in full swing, The Hateful Eight lumps eight characters of dubious moral fibre in the same shack while a raging blizzard whistles outside. Evoking memories of his breakthrough feature Reservoir Dogs (1992), Tarantino's latest ultimately suffers from stretching a wafer-thin plot over a three hour plus running- time.Peppering the movie with chapter titles a la Inglorious Basterds (2009), the film begins with a magnificent long take as the credits flicker on screen to the sound of Italian legend Ennio Morrecone's beautiful score. Grizzled bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is transporting notorious criminal Daisy Domegue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock to collect his reward and see her hang. Fellow bounty hunter and war veteran Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) hitches a ride, and they also pick up former Lost-Causer Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who is on his way to Red Rock to be sworn in as sheriff. The three men discuss their past and future, but find each other hard to trust.As a wailing blizzard approaches, Ruth's stagecoach pulls up at Minnie's Haberdashery, a cosy rest-stop which has been apparently left in the temporary care of Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir). This instantly arouses Warren's suspicions, who has frequented the place before and knows the owners well. Also resting at the haberdashery is eccentric British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the shady loner Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and former Confederate general Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). Locked up together with no hope of moving on until the storm passes, the eight naturally talk and size each other up, with the events of the Civil War still firmly in everyone's mind. This being a Tarantino movie, it isn't long until guns are fired and blood is shed.The dialogue crackles in the way that only Tarantino can deliver during the opening half, but an absence of humour and some twists and revelations that hardly come as a surprise throughout the second act tests the patience. Similar to Django, conversations go on longer than required, and unnecessary narrative devices - such as the sudden introductions of a narrator that comes and goes without reason - distract from a central story that needs to be more complex and unpredictable to justify the lengthy running time. Still, there's much to savour. Tarantino has always made inspired casting choices, and the ensemble - Russell, Leigh and Goggins in particular - are sublime. Filmed in 70mm Panavision to Morrecone's score, the film captures the glorious wide-wide screen beauty of the great westerns of the 50's and 60's. Sporadically thrilling but ultimately frustrating, The Hateful Eight ultimately fails to reward the audience for their time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Only Fanboys will love it,"If you want to watch a 90 minute movie morph into a 3 hour movie with scenes it doesn't need, poorly developed characters and a cast that doesn't meld together well at all. (Samuel L Jackson did phenomenal and Kurt Russell had moments where he looked to be the right person for the part, where in the end, he simply wasn't. This is for you, oh, and Fanboys, you'll rave this is Just Tarantino"" and ""You just don't understand.""The dialogue was lacking, the entire time. There were a couple quotable lines, but for it being a 3 hour movie, it lacked. My favorite actor in the entire movie Walton Goggins is written much better in the FX TV series Justified, and I was disappointed with the sheer inability for Tarantino to bring this amazing actor, and maybe even character, to life.The plot had legs, I mean, how can you go wrong with a 21st Century take on 10 Little Indians, but the big reveal is revealed far too early. The beginning took too long to develop, and when it did, it finished way to quickly, but somehow leaving an hour 'til the movie ends.I love Tarantino, his work is some of the best in the business. However, this time, I feel, like he wrote past his reputation and we just need to call it as we see it. Tarantino dropped the ball, and with a 44 million budget he has(d) no excuses.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
If you have a free 3 hours.....watch The Revenant instead!,"I signed up just to write a review of this film. I watched it a few nights ago, knowing Tarantino was a lover of the old spaghetti westerns, as I am myself, I was hoping for a modern version of the good , the bad and the ugly. Something that contained a story and characters as deep and involving as those. Seeing Kurt Russell in a leading role gave me hope. Samuel L Jackson didn't.I liked Pulp fiction, I liked Reservoir Dogs, I liked Jackie Brown. They were original, the characters were strong. Kill Bill 1 was fairly good, but since then it seems to be a downwards spiral. The recent Tarantino movies have been tongue in cheek comedies, it worked in Django to some extent.This film never had any depth, the characters were never developed, you couldn't relate to any of them, they were not believable. The story is set in ""Millies Haberdashery"" From the first moment it looked like a stage, a plastic setting, it did not look authentic and this theme continued with the rest of the characters. As was stated by previous reviewers the white teeth of the characters stands out a mile, the blonde female from NZ was completely out of place. Millie herself to me sounds like she should be a hard faced haggard of about 60 years old, instead we get a 20 something pretty black woman when she actually enters the film, plainly ridiculous. The ending is a waste of time, and the only thought you are left with at the end is, did I just spend 3 hours of my life on that?Tarantino needs to go back to the drawing board, forget his own hype. His fans need to get off their high horses, and stop using his name as a vehicle to show how ""arty"" or ""cultured"" they are. This may have worked with pulp fiction, a truly intelligent and original movie but not with this farce.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Cozy Thriller,"""The Hateful Eight"" is another proof of Tarantino's talent.A rather long story, which lasts almost 3 hours, flies by very quickly.And so in a 3-hour snow thriller we can expect: charismatic characters, cruel weather conditions, extreme cruelty, twisted dialogues and switching genres.I would like to dwell on the genres and their elements.Snow Western: a wooden inn, horses, hats and revolvers.Closed thriller: a closed room, several strangers and mistrust of each other.Detective: elements of mystery, hidden personalities and a detective in the person of Jackson's character.Horror: horror music, human cruelty and denouement.Black comedy: the kind of comedy that only Tarantino can do, there are no jokes, but sometimes it's very funny.Social commentary: the ending of the film is the best answer to this point.Despite all the immorality, The Hateful Eight has a lot of moral content, which some characters utter.I will say that the film is worth watching in the original, it's a real voice play. Kurt Russell's hoarse voice adds several points to his character. Walton Goggins' ""fox"" voice plays into the character's hands, because until the very end we won't know who he is.I am very glad that Morricone won an Oscar for best music. The music of The Hateful Eight is a separate character with its own character.The Hateful Eight is an underrated Tarantino film. It can be put on a par with Jackie Brown and Death Proof.I want to believe that in 10 years people will look at this film differently.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Old School western movie,"Well first I noticed negative reviews for this movie than I realized that is only from fan-boys of Tarantino. As I thought fan-boys are demanding and always not real in reviews. Becaase they expect something that that don't even know what. This is really very good movie with strong characters, great acting.. slow moving plot just like western movie has to be. I really liked ambient in the movie, the house in the middle of the nowhere caught in the blizzard , and the music is awesome by old school master Ennio Morricone. I recommend this movie who likes real movies, not some mambo jumbo CGI shits from todays cinemas. So I rate this movie 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I didn't mind the slow pacing at all,"Before I watched The Hateful Eight, I saw a lot of negative reviews. Many people were complaining that the first 2 hours were painfully slow and it remained very boring up until the final hour. I was pretty concerned after reading all of those reviews and I was afraid that Quentin Tarantino would repeat the same mistake he made in Death Proof again. Hastily, I decided to watch this movie and hope for the best. I can safely say that I am very thankful that I watched this movie.In order to take shelter from a blizzard, a group of people take shelter in a small cabin and decide to wait the storm out there. Among them is a man taking a female criminal to town so she can be hung for her crimes, a bounty hunter transporting the bodies of 3 outlaws to Red Rock, an incoming sheriff also traveling to Red Rock, a quiet cowboy going to stay with his mother, a former Confederate general, and several others. As more info is revealed about the different people there, rivalries begin to appear and they start to grow bitter hatreds for each other. It becomes possible that none of them will make it out of the cabin alive by the time the snowstorm stops.For some reason, many people were complaining about the pacing. Sure, it does take a pretty long time for the gunfights to occur, but I found all the buildup to be exciting. I loved the sense of claustrophobia the movie provided and I felt that it provided a lot of suspense to the film. Also, the movie moved the story along nicely by slowly building up rivalries among the characters. It had several suspenseful scenes and the movie never felt boring because of this. I can understand why someone would get bored by the first 2 hours of the movie, but I didn't feel that at all. The movie kept me entertained from beginning to end. I feel that some people were expecting this film to have action from beginning to end.As Tarantino fans know, Tarantino often likes to put his plot lines out of order. This has worked great for many of his movies and it works even better for this movie. Often, at times, the audience knows something that the characters on-screen don't know and it results in some of the most suspenseful scenes in years. It is revealed at one point that someone poisoned the coffee and it leaves the audience to wonder who will drink it. It is also revealed at one point that a gun is hidden under the table and someone who knows about it sits by it. There are also a few other details in the film which make the flashback scene very tense. Because of the disjointed plot structure, it made me want to watch it again.Speaking of suspense, this movie sure contains a lot of it. In the final act, there are so many times when the characters come very close to getting killed and I become on the edge of my seat during them. As the movie approaches its end, I was fearing that something bad would happen to the characters I was rooting for at the very last second. My favorite scene in the film was when Bob plays quiet, relaxing songs on the piano while Warren taunts Smithers. The peacefulness of the piano combined with the arguments between Warren and Smithers creates a truly suspenseful scene for the ages.There isn't really that much character development in the film, but this didn't bother me at all because of the consistent feeling of claustrophobia and suspense. That distracted me from it so well that I didn't even notice it. Character development has been a problem in some of his other movies such as Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, but this movie was actually able to engage me enough for me to not notice it.Tarantino has had issues with sadism in his past movies, but there actually isn't a whole lot of it in this film. I'd say that the only scene which bothered me was the scene when Warren forces someone to walk through the snow naked, do something very gross, and kills him. That scene didn't have to be as sadistic as it was and it felt very crass as a result. Besides this scene, however, nothing else in the film really bothered me. Also, that is an incredibly minor complaint. Some might find the scene when one of the characters (I won't spoil who) get hung to be overly-sadistic, but I really hated the character who died in that way and I felt it was a very fitting and deserved end. I was rooting for that person to be killed and I'm sure everyone else was.The cinematography is also pretty excellent in this film. Snowy landscapes are gorgeous to look at and the cabin provides an inviting and cozy feel to it. Also, the acting is very great. It gets better as the film goes on. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show and his acting role is very haunting due to how closer he gets to death as the movie goes on. Also, Tarantino's narration is actually pretty interesting and entertaining.In conclusion, this movie is amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better film. The slow pacing didn't bother me that much and I found the movie to be very suspenseful. It had some of the most tense movie scenes I've seen in years and the disjointed plot structure works better than ever. I understand why some people didn't care for this movie, but none of their reasons affect my opinion of the movie. If you're a fan of Tarantino then this is a definite must see. Just don't expect this to have action from beginning to end like many of his other films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Not sensational by any means but certainly worth the watch.,"I will start bluntly and honestly; this is Tarantino's weakest film to date. However that does not mean that it isn't good. When considering the repertoire of Tarantino films at hand, it was always going to be near impossible to replicate the feats of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I must say though that, to me anyway, films such as Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained were not far off that high level. They had intensity, sharp dialogue and they captivated audiences. The Hateful Eight does not quite have these comparable qualities.I'll begin with the positives; the acting in this film is stellar. Samuel L Jackson does a fine job as the main role here and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also every bit as good as Daisy Domergue. It is hard to fault anyone's performance in all honesty. Everyone in this cast grinds out a fantastic performance which is an obvious redeemable quality for this film. The cinematography and score are outstanding likewise, particularly for the atmosphere that both create. And of course, there are some very memorable scenes as expected in any Tarantino films and these scenes are in abundance in this film.With all that said, this film just has one too many flaws for it to be considered a superb film, let alone a superb Tarantino film. The dialogue does not have the same punch as I would have hoped - it does not hold my attention as it did in Django Unchained or Inglorious Bastards. The story line is a bit thin and at times and given the length of the film (3 hours), this proves to be a problem. I have never had an issue with the length of Tarantino films up until now and I believe that says a lot about The Hateful Eight. The pacing of the film just is not up to scratch i'm afraid. It seems to plod on rather than move with any intensity. The film just did not grip me like other Tarantino films have in the past.Don't get me wrong, this is a good film. But with all the hype and the wonderful director and actors at hand, it does not quite live up to expectation. As I said earlier though, I think it is hard for Tarantino to live up to any expectation now. For someone who's first two films were Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two films that redefined cinema, it was always going to be a challenge to direct on the same level. Django and Bastards were rightfully acclaimed in their attempts but the Hateful Eight falls short. A good film that is certainly worth watching but not of the level we would expect from Mr. Tarantino.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hateful Eight out of Ten,"Tarantino's non-sequential formula works yet again in this tense Western mystery. It achieves what great movies do and leaves you thinking even after the credits rolled, giving you thoughts like, ""What if this guy was lying?"" or such.

Tedious and  Boring,"This is the worst movie Tarantino has ever made. It seems like a western but it fails miserably. It takes place in the west after the Civil War. I know it's not real and just Tarantino's fantasy, but what he depicted here is not at all believable, even if you know it's just a movie. He uses a lot of blood and gore, but he doesn't use it effectively, so it just comes across as gratuitous, as a crutch, like in a badly done student film. The way it's shot gives you feeling that you are watching a play, but all of the details of a movie like this don't fit into such a limited frame, so the effect is that it's sloppy.

Eight Sinners in a Cold Hell,"A near perfect film. The Hateful Eight is a tense yet comedic western about a few bounty hunters taking shelter in the midst of a billizard. The story goes on as more and more suspicions arise on which of these men can be trusted. Simple, sweet, and to the point.This is really meant to channel the great classic westerns of the 1950s. They even got Ennio Morricone to compose the score (whose work here was met with an Oscar, deservedly so). Except unlike those films with John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, this is filled to the brim with cursing and Tarantino style violence, which would not have flown by the censors back then.A lot of what works here works because of how it was written. The dialogue flows so eloquently. It is both blunt yet cutting and witty at the same time. Everything goes from the page to the screen smoothly, one of the benefits of having the director Quentin Tarantino be the writer also. The way that the bounty hunters, Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson, are so callus, almost cruel in nature, but Tarintino is able to make them likeable is a feat.The humour here is infectious. The dialogue is only one of the many things that add to this pot. The cartoonishly OTT violence is wonderful as always, and so much can be said with only a face by some of the actors here. Jennifer Jason Leigh would be the stand out here. She is the prisoner of Kurt Russels, John 'The Hangman' Ruth. All throughout her exceedingly miserable situation, she is delightful to watch. The way she is met with bludgeon at any act of rebellion yet continues to defy and taunt her captures in the face of a broken nose. She is in such a grim situation, yet she remains so smug and self-confident in the face of it all.The mystery elements will always derive a certain interest in me. The moment something happens and we have to find out who did it, the cogs begin to turn. You yourself are trying to figure out the story of the film as it is happening. The blizzard is the perfect catalyst to kick off this tale of events. It keeps everyone on edge, and it gives them no where else that they can turn. I may also have forgotten to mention that this is set in 1877, so not only is the political tension strong, post civil war, but the character mostly consists of racists. Which provides its own tension on top of that.I feel this is a rather intelligent film, filmed with plenty to adore. I haven't even touched upon the cinematography, shot in 70mm. That's good too. But I could see myself easily watching this this again, on a cold winter day in a warm blanket and soak in the scenery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A good film with a slow second half,"I think most people were expecting a action packed romp like kill bill or pulp fiction form Tarantino but I think that's both his and their faults as he's been directing mostly action flicks and as such has built an audience around them. The reason I respect Tarantino as much as I do is that even though he knew what his audience was expecting and demanding from him, he made the film he wanted which is something other directors could learn from him. Russel and Jackson are great and are followed by an equally great cast, I don't think I didn't enjoy anyone's performance. There is the racial undertones and sub-plot that I, as more right leaning white person, enjoyed and I do think that racism is something that we should take seriously and we shouldn't try to cut it out of our history as if we pretend that we never made any mistakes than we have nothing to look back and learn from. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries and dramas but maybe not action flicks or westerns.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Most Quentin Tarantino Quentin Tarantino Film (yeah...that is a compliment),"The Hateful Eight is a pretty straightforward film about 9 people stuck in a cabin in the middle of a blizzard in which hilarity and violence ensue. WARNING - the title of this flick accurately describes the personality of the characters. If you do not like films where there is only despicable and horrible human beings, this movie is not for you. This movie is wonderful in the fact that it is presented almost as a play in which there are few sets and heavily dialogue based. Which is the perfect setting for Tarantino to excel in his craft of witty dialogue and it does shine through. I do not want to delve too much into the story because that takes away the fun of watching everything unfold.THE MAJOR PLAYERS (5 Best):Director & Screenwriter - Quentin Tarantino (Best 3 Credits - Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill)Jennifer Jason Leigh (Best 3 Credits - Weeds, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and The Spectacular Now)Walton Goggins (Best 3 Credits - Justified, Sons of Anarchy, and Django Unchained)Composer - Ennio Morricone (Best 3 Credits - Once Upon a Time in the West, The Thing, The Good The Bad and the Ugly)Cinematographer - Robert Richardson (Best 3 Credits -Kill Bill, Platoon, Django Unchained)HONORABLE MENTIONS - Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful in the movie as he is in pretty much everything he does. I love Zoe Bell and honestly believe he is Tarantino's new muse. She was perfect at playing the sweet-hearted Six-Horse Judy. My favorite honorable mention is James Parks who almost stole the movie with his hilarious character.MVP - Walton Goggins needs to be a bona fide A-Lister after his performance in The Hateful Eight. He was by far the bet aspect of The Hateful Eight.THE VERDICT - See it in Theaters as soon as possibleIf you like other Quentin Tarantino movies or The Thing (original), you will like this movie as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Worse than average,"Let me start off by saying that I care nothing for the controversies surrounding this movies, nor anything for the 'n-word' or the feminist stuff.Rewatching Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained before heading in to this movie, excited to see what Tarantino will add to the experience this time, I was hoping for a tense opening scene, like with the previous mentioned. The opening scene however was average, one could even argue dull and dragged out. That was the tone for the rest of the movie. Dragged out.This movie could have easily been 2 hours long and not lose any of the storytelling. I normally love movies that are long, but dragged out isn't exciting.The acting was very good, there were some funny moments, but not even that could save this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Mmmmmmmmm........No,"Pros. Start studded cast. Curt Russell is as tough as ever. Samuel l. Jackson can really tell a story. Lets face these guys are cool as hell. Love the back drop and the beginning. It starts of interesting and keeps you interested at about a 70%. Then it just stays at about 70% for a while till it just drops off.Cons....Who the hell is the main character? Tough to say by the end of the movie. You might think you have some good guys at the beginning but clearly threw the middle of this poorly writ story takes a turn and your not sure who to root for. Clearly the use of the ""N"" word repeatedly makes the audience uncomfortable but the story Samuel l. Jackson tells in the middle made the audience very very uncomfortable. Is he gay, evil, crude, there should be a time when an actor just says ""No I'm not saying that"". A story so ignorant that it makes you question the honor of the actor in real life and the writers intention, clearly a very racist sad empty volatile writer. This story make no sense at all and uses music and the shock value to keep you watching. So many things about this movie are pointless and just beyond stupid writing and from the past Quentin Tarantino movies, this movie falls in line with him needing some psychological help in the adolescent sexual orientation area.Did anyone notice the plowed roads in the old west?I am a movie lover and can watch the same movie over and over because the writing just moves me. Im a big fan of Curt Russell movies and clever movies, romance movies, feel good shoot'em out hero good guy movies.This movie left my wife and I saying...1. that was just stupid. 2. Waist of money. 3. Never will I need to see that again. 4. A very limited type of person could watch this movie. And 5. I really hope Curt Russell didn't read this script before he was committed to doing this movie cause it would change our perspective about the past movies he has done.In just 3 words, sorry but ""NO"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Everything you want out of Tarantino + Super in-depth character development,"The Hateful 8 is all the best things you get from Tarantino. You have the intriguing violence, the fantastic cinematography, the phenomenal dialogue, and a plot that keeps you wanting more. But what makes this movie perhaps one of his best is the character development and relationships. Some might find the pace to be slow due to the focus on dialogue and lack of changing locations but this what makes the movie great. Because his characters are from several different backgrounds and beliefs (I mean hey its during the reconstruction era) the tension never stops. It is because of this tension, each character is challenged in their own way, and you really get to see what kind of person they are. It will surprise you but you have to pay attention. This is why there is no single protagonist, because all his characters are intricate.You have to go see it for it completely engages you and rarely have so seen so many complex characters together. In Pulp Fiction you jumped from different character stories and perspectives, here you watch it all at once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Reservoir Cowboy Dogs....Great!,"Another great film by Tarantino. If you are reading this chances are you will have seen some of, if not all of his other movies.....where does this rank amongst the others I hear you ask. Well It's better than Death Proof and Dusk Till Dawn and perhaps as good as Reservoir Dogs.....in fact Mr Blonde ( Michael Madsen ) is in it, wielding a six shooter instead of a razor blade. Tim Roth is also here and the film essentially takes place in one room...a bit like reservoir dogs does. It is different though, as this is more of a whodunit tale along the lines of Agatha Christie's 10 Little Indians. Samuel L. Jackson is on top form and Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is very memorable. Beautifully shot, it has great music by Ennio Morricone and it's funny, violent, shocking and gross in parts......which is what you want!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Vicious, Violent & Venomous Western That May Be Quentin Tarantino's Bleakest Film To Date","A wickedly gripping, strangely alluring & downright hysterical blend of The Thing & Reservoir Dogs, the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino is another impressive showcase of his remarkable storytelling ability, is shot in glorious 70 mm format that gives it a grandiose look n feel, is all the more strengthened by an outstanding ensemble, and also happens to be the first Tarantino film to feature an original soundtrack, composed by none other than the legendary Ennio Morricone in what is his first composition for a western in over 34 years.Set in post-Civil War America, The Hateful Eight follows John Ruth who's taking fugitive Daisy Domergue to Red Rock alive in order to see her hang & collect the substantial bounty on her. On their way, they encounter another bounty hunter who's seeking a ride to the town. They are soon joined by one more fellow who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. But when their journey is cut short by a severe blizzard, the group is forced to take refuge in a stagecoach cabin where they meet five more people who may or may not be what they claim to be.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, the story of The Hateful Eight is covered in 6 chapters, with all but one unfolding in chronological order. The whole picture is his homage to John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, sharing many similarities with that classic and despite that, it's wholly original in content, is overloaded with Tarantino's patented trademarks, and is presented as a western to its audience. The screenplay puts greater emphasis on the characters inhabiting this tale and is another winning material from the master storyteller, even if it's a tad too full of itself.Where Tarantino succeeds is in establishing an effective claustrophobic ambiance that brims with palpable tension & persistently looming paranoia. The interplay between characters in a Tarantino feature is almost always interesting and The Hateful Eight is no exception for it has a firm grip on viewers' attention from the start but there are also a few moments when its narrative starts feeling like it is stretched too much to fit its daunting runtime. No one blends violence & humour as ideally as Tarantino does but thanks to the bleak tone of the story, the balance is slightly off in his latest feature.The majority of the plot unfolds in Minnie's Haberdashery, the stagecoach lodge, and the production design team does a commendable job in filling that place up with props that are in tune with its timeline while the snow-covered surroundings steadily bring in the element of isolation. Cinematography is truly epic in both the staggering details of the images filmed in 70 mm format as well as the extreme widescreen aspect ratio it employs to narrate its tale while the cold colour tones, smart lighting, clever angles & slow but fluid movements of its camera help a lot in enhancing the story's unnerving atmosphere.Coming to the performances, The Hateful Eight features a terrific ensemble in Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walter Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern & Demián Bichir, all playing characters that are downright despicable, deceitful & driven by hate. Russell nonetheless turns out to be quite charismatic in his role of John ""The Hangman"" Ruth and is brilliantly supported by Jackson & Goggins who play the bounty hunter & sheriff, respectively. However, of all the hateful people, the most memorable performance comes from Jason Leigh for she's absolutely manic as Daisy the fugitive plus her chemistry with Russell is absolutely spot-on.And yet, despite getting most things right, Quentin Tarantino's latest is marred by a few drawbacks. First, the story he's written doesn't live up to the grand canvas it makes use of. Second, its 167 minutes of runtime isn't justified for many moments feel unnecessarily stretched just to accommodate for its intimidating length. Third, Tarantino's own cameo as narrator doesn't fit. Fourth, the excess self-indulgence nearly destroys some sequences, that ""Red Apple tobacco"" wink being one example. Fifth, the first half feels like a chore due to the slow pace & character introductions but the film picks up amazing well in the remaining half to correct that particular issue. And there's one more!The Hateful Eight marks the first time in Tarantino's filmmaking career that he has made use of an original score instead of incorporating different tracks into one eclectic soundtrack. Music has always played a key role in every Tarantino film and it's one aspect he's very careful with for it can make or break a picture. Now, Ennio Morricone does deliver on that expectation with a full-fledged soundtrack that's moody, ominous & totally fits the narrative's themes but the groovy element that Tarantino's own musical choices brought into those sequences, acting as an antidote to the gruesome violence being perpetrated on the screen while at the same time contributing to the roller-coaster experience, is somewhat missing.On an overall scale, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a vicious, violent, vibrant, vindictive & venomous western spewing poisonous hatred all over its frames, is another biting critique of United States' blood-soaked history, and is possibly the bleakest film he's made to date. The narrative scores high marks in quality but it's also blemished with few shortcomings that could've been avoided. Starting on a slow note, the film does manage to redeem itself with a nail-bitingly tense second half and finishes on a satisfactory note yet the whole experience of sitting through this western epic isn't as rewarding as some of Tarantino's finest works. Ingeniously directed, skilfully scripted, gorgeously photographed, patiently edited, methodically scored & superbly performed by its stellar cast, The Hateful Eight is another compelling cinema from Tarantino that's destined to please his fans.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""One of them fellas is not what he says he is...""","After a leaked script of Tarantino's next project, The Hateful Eight, he swore that he would not film it. Instead he did a live read and it got a lot of applause. This apparently gave him enough reason to shoot the film anyway...and in 70mm no less. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino finally steps out of the revenge theme that has steered his career since Kill Bill. This is a welcomed change of pace, but he still succumbs to things that plague his recent output of films, mainly self indulgence and a lengthy running time.A bounty hunter is travelling to Red Rock with his bounty, a woman by the name of Daisy. Along the way he encounters two men stuck in a blizzard and unenthusiastically gives them a lift. They reach shelter where there are other men shielding themselves from the freezing cold. Yet something seems odd, are these men really who they say they are? Is one of them lying? Will anyone make it out of this cabin alive? For the first time since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino dives back into a little bit of mystery. In Reservoir Dogs, someone was a cop, here, we have no idea what it going on or who is who. This perfectly amps of the tension and in typical Tarantino fashion, he lets us stew in it for a really long time. It's not a Tarantino movie if there is not a long winded, yet well written and cool monologue that will undoubtedly end in blood shed. This film delivers that in spades as the blood does indeed shed and everyone has their chance to give a few quips here and there.One thing Tarantino always seems to hit the nail on the head with is his casting. This film is no exception. Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir all play their roles perfectly well in this slow burner that feels more like a stage play than a film shot in 70mm. Tim Roth's character reminds me so much of a role that Christoph Waltz would play that it was hard NOT seeing Waltz in this film. Roth stands out in the crowd with a more exuberant character in line with Waltz's Dr. Schultz. Leigh is also on the bit eccentric side and deservedly should be recognized come awards season. Always being a fan of Kurt Russell it's nice to see him back in the Tarantino fold after Death Proof, which Russell was the best thing. Goggins is also a stand out, but if you've followed him enough than you'll know that this is not a surprise. He's always one of the best things about whatever he is in. Dern and Madsen aren't really given too much to do and Madsen in particular seems to be on auto-pilot. Not that the man gives great performances, but Tarantino usually gets a bit more out of his actors.The opening shots of the winter landscape look glorious, of course. Then we are subjected to interior shots of people talking for almost the rest of the film. Which makes one wonder why bother shooting or even seeing this in 70mm. Tarantino has said that after he's done making movies he'd want to direct a stage play. So far, this is the closest he's gotten to it. Most of this film is merely interactions between people within a log cabin. The interactions are wonderful and show us the talent of Tarantino and those on the screen. Even at 2 hours and 47 minutes, the film never really feels like it drags in any parts. That was the biggest surprise to me. I felt engaged the entire time. Maybe on repeat viewings this will die down a bit, since most of the tension and suspense will be gone, but imagine the basement bar scene with Fassbender from Inglorious Basterds, only extended to a feature length film.There are two sequences that took me out of the film and it's one thing that happens twice. Tarantino did the same thing with Inglorious Basterds, where random narration pops in to tell us exactly what we are seeing on the screen. Adding insult to injury...it's Tarantino himself narrating the events on the screen. I was confused more than anything. Why include this bit of storytelling randomly? If you want narration, give it at the start, not two random scenes, it makes no sense.Tarantino falls back on his chapter storytelling element here. Much like Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds, the film is split up into chapters with scene headings. Also, like his other films it also includes flashbacks, this has become a staple in his films and I feel like his uses the same font every damn time. Again, like Django Unchained, the film contains a lot of racist remarks from the characters casually throwing around the n-word. Something that has become too common in his films. Small quibbles aside, The Hateful Eight is exactly what one would expect from Tarantino. It's violent, it's talkative and packs one hell of a cast. Hateful Eight finds itself in the middle road in Tarantino's resume, it's nowhere near his best, nor his worst.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A great addition to Tarantino's filmography,"Since I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I was really looking forward to this movie and though I can say at this point that it's not my favourite, it did not disappoint. Among the cast we find the regulars such as Samuel L. Jackson or Tim Roth It's quite impressive how Tarantino manages to direct this 2 hour and 50 minutes huis clos without boring the audience to death. In my opinion, he's one of the only contemporary directors that can pull off that kind of thing.I think this is partly due to the fact that the characters are so well-drawn and that even if they all are in some ways « hateful », you really create some kind of bond with them.On the downside, the movie was a bit too violent at times and I think some scenes of beheading weren't really necessary. But then that's a Tarantino movie so that was to be expected and that wasn't a big bother. The only thing that really let me down was the score. To me music is a majour aspect of Tarantino's movies and The Hateful Eight's original soundtrack was kind of lacking compared to the director's other films.I also have to admit I was kind of afraid it was going to be very similar to Django but it had nothing to do with it. I loved how the tension grows during the whole movie and you're kind of on the edge of your seat and not totally relaxed, but in a good way.One of my favourite characters was Jennifer Jason Leigh's, or Domergue, pretty much the only female protagonist in this movie. I had never seen her in another film, and I found her performance both riveting and hilarious.Overall, that's not the best Tarantino but I would definitely recommend going to see this movie while it's still playing in theatres.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hateful great!,"There was not much to hate about Quentin Tarantino's latest chatty & blood filled cinematic offering ""The Hateful Eight"". The fact is that it's no Pulp Fiction, but ""The Hateful Eight"" is still unchained with plenty of charismatic basterds and unreserved dogly humanoids. Before you want me to kill the bill of puns that I am firing and will continue to fire, please read along so I could provide you my cuento on Quentin's latest. Tarantino returns to the western genre; this time focusing on eight nefarious characters trapped in a Wyoming cabin under a profound blizzard. Kurt Russell plays bounty hunter John Ruth who is chainly transporting a female convict named Daisy Domergue to hang in Red Rock. On their way, they come across a Capital One card and look for Samuel L. Jackson in the vicinity; give me a break, there is lots of cerebral cortex pun dysfunction in my brainy wallet. Anyways, Ruth & Daisy do come across Samuel playing Mayor Marquis Warren who desperately needs transport so he does not die due to the storm. Moreover, on their transport another hateful hitches on for a ride and that would be Sheriff Chris Mannix played by the latest Quentin regular Walton Goggins. So the hateful quarter reach the cabin and inside are the the not-so-better-half of the hateful eight which consists of Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), and Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth). What they are doing in the cabin is something I won't reveal in order not to be a hateful spoiler. Tarantino again delivers with witty and enigmatic direction & screen writing. The entire cast shined but my favorite was Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue; hope all turns out daisy for Jennifer Jason Leigh on Oscar night as she has just been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her exceptional performance. I will cease fire to my hateful puns and complete this review. But make sure your travels take you soon to ""The Hateful Eight"". You will love it! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Creative Western whodunit is an amusing black comedy, but also profane and repugnant","RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" is a Western about a cruel bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) taking an outlaw woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in to Red Rock, Wyoming, to hang. Along with a black bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the new Sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins), they hold up at a rural haberdashery during a blizzard with several dubious characters (Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum). Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small roles.This was Tarantino's second Western in a row after 2012's ""Django Unchained,"" which ranks with the best Westerns of all time. This one's not as good, but it certainly has its points of interest, like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere, which is to die for. Moreover, the plot is intriguing. It's basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West. Roughly 90% of the film takes place in the haberdashery and, less so, a stagecoach. It's basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a Western.The movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score, his first full-length score in over three decades (!). Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantino's strong suit; and so it is here. The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the one-dimensional setting. Everything's SO exaggerated that you can't take it seriously. The movie's intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained; otherwise you'll hate it.On at least one occasion the overindulgences don't work, like the disgusting fellatio sequence. I get that Marquis (Jackson) was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw, but we didn't need a visual on his fabricated story. It's sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie, except gay porn, but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be ""edgy"" or whatever.The excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme, which is humanity's fallen condition and dire need of redemption. The title, ""The Hateful Eight,"" is a perversion of ""The Magnificent Seven."" The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious. Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race, gender, sectionalism, faction-ism, envy and rivalry. Furthermore, men divided by hatred of culture and race can unite in hatred of something else, in this case misogyny.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 47 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Quintin Tarantino...please never retire.,"This was an amazing movie. the story of 8 highly questionable individuals stuck in a bar for several days with a high valued criminal and the knowledge that one or more individuals are not who they say. within the bunch you find Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a career criminal and murderer. she is crude, vulgar and extremely dangerous. Domergue is being taken to be hung for her crimes by John Ruth (Kurt Russell), The Hangman. his name is given because, as Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) explains, ""...when John Ruth the Hangman catches you...You hang"". Major Marquis, is another bounty hunter, with a violent past who mysteriously appears before Ruth and Domergue, but comes along as he and Ruth have a past together, making him semi trusted. later we meet Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a man that, like Marquis, suddenly just appears and rides along. he claims to be a the new Sheriff in town,but as you watch the movie, looks can be deceiving and not everyone is to be trusted. these four arrive at a bar due to a coming ice storm. there they meet Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the actual hangman.

Maybe the time has come for QT to get a little taste of humble pie.,"Tarantino once said something to the effect of how he wished certain directors would watch their older stuff to be reminded of the great movies they once made and that if he ever got to that point he'd consider quitting making movies. I can't recall the exact quote or source but something like that. Anyways, it looks like that time may have come for Tarantino. And it's a sad day in hell.Depending on your tastes for westerns this could be considered Tarantino's weakest effort I guess. Having said that it's still OK. I enjoyed it to an extent. Vicious humor, intense story, etc. I want to talk about what I didn't like and what could have been done better. There's potentially a really good flick here but:For what it is, it's too long. A) People need to say their lines faster. Don't get me wrong, I think Wall-E promotes ADD, but come on. I didn't see any real good reason to drag out dialogue so much like that. In fact it kind of makes you look like a jerk as a director. B) Cut out unnecessary stuff. If this was a tighter flick, closer to 2 hours, I'd bet my life people would have less issues with it.Secondly, sometimes the film treats the audience a bit too stupid. Like the narration or the second shot of the gun under the table when Madson's character asks to sit down. Just unnecessary.Thirdly, in an increasingly PC time, the psychosis and violence might not go over too well with people.Overall, not sure if it's Tarantino's weakest. But maybe second weakest after Death Proof. Death proof had so much unnecessary dialogue but it was such a cool idea. I think, instead of threatening to quit and whining over projection, Tarantino should take his own advice. Then keep going. We love you buddy, just take a bite of humble pie sometimes and respect the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

What lies beneath,"Quentin Tarantino's eight film is The Hateful Eight. By this time we know what to expect, lots of talking, some of its fast and loose.Even though the publicity blurb mentions John Carpenter's The Thing as an inspiration (Kurt Russell even riffs a line from that film about going without sleep,) it really is an Agatha Christie style mystery done Tarantino style.We visit the snowbound wild west post civil war where the wounds of war are still raw.Kurt Russell is bounty hunter John Ruth better known as the Hangman. Where other bounty hunters kill and take the bodies for the reward. He brings them back alive so they can hang. He is taking back Daisy Domergue, a female captive with a big reward for her head. On the road he meets Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) another bounty hunter and they ride together until they meet the designated new sheriff also on his way to his new post at the town they are heading to.A blizzard means they have to hole up in an inn where there are other people staying. Bruce Dern is the bitter, racist confederate General Smithers trying to find the fate of his son. Tim Roth is Mobray on his way to the same town as the sheriff to be the new hangman. There are several other people, we believe that some of them are bluffing. Ruth thinks that one of them is not what he claims to be and lies have been told.As I said there is a lot of chatter, maybe too much, lots of suspicion, lots of rubbing people up the wrong way. We do wonder what this is all leading to, as maybe events are unravelling too slowly and then bang, the bodies start to fall and Tarantino does his reveal.The film has dark twisted humour, mean characters bristling with menace, bloody cruel violence.

"""The Thing"" + ""Reservoir Dogs"" + ""Clue"" + ""Django Unchained"" = ""The Hateful Eight""","Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated ""The Hateful Eight"" further augments the director's portfolio of transgressive, innovative, and influential filmmaking. He successfully enhances the quality of his film with the use of the 70mm extended edition featuring an overture and intermission. Tarantino pays homage to the epics of the 50's and 60's with this long forgotten film technique. It pays off very well because it provides the viewer with more of an experience rather than just an ordinary watch.""The Hateful Eight"" is a film that is highly influenced by other films. It features the same atmosphere and tension of ""The Thing"", the talky ultraviolent stage play of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" the whodunit mystery of ""Clue,"" and finally the setting, genre, and vengeful mood of ""Django Unchained."" QT masterfully creates well rounded nefarious characters in an enclosed environment. The characters are brought to life by phenomenal performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, and Jennifer Jason Leigh -- who was the only person to get an Oscar nod. These performances were guided by QT's extraordinary writing. Also the score was excellent from legendary composer Ennio Morricone, and really made rather slow moments more suspenseful. Finally the cinematography was great and almost matched ""The Revenant"" in artistic beauty.The main complaints about the film from critics are that the film is overlong with excessive dialogue, excessive violence, and finally an absence of character morals. The dialogue did drag on especially in the first half but it was all made worth while in the second half with the violent interplay between characters, the gut twisting climax, and finally the jaw dropping monologues QT is known for. The film is incredibly violent but it helps set the hateful and brutal tone of the film. Finally the characters are mostly despicable, and lack morals. But how many movies actually have a 'bad guys vs. less bad guys' storyline? Like seriously this is the core of the movie -- the characters are hateful! It's called ""The Hateful Eight"" for a reason and the characters certainly are not sugarcoated or lionized in any way.Overall this film is another brutal and highly entertaining masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I can't believe that Channing Tatum would even take a role in this horrendous movie. The only reason I continued watching was in hopes that maybe further into the movie would show me why the rating was so high. But, no, that never happened.

Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film, a Jacobean western, intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing his own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale. Moreover, Tarantino now makes a serious star of Walton Goggins, giving a hilarious performance as the deeply unreliable Chris Mannix, soi-disant Sheriff Elect of Red Rock, Wyoming. And Ennio Morricone has composed a score which is as sinuous and catchy as anything he has written: a theme with a tense and gloomy tread, coolly cranking up the tension.

Quentin Tarantino returns to form with his latest film.,"I'll admit - Tarantino was one of the very first filmmakers to inspire me to start taking movies a little more seriously. I've enjoyed almost everything that he has worked on. I have seen every film that he has directed - and 'The Hateful Eight' is the latest one.However, putting my fandom aside, I will try to review Tarantino's latest film with as little bias as possible. Before I dive in, I have to say that this film is not as action-oriented as 'Inglorious Basterds' or 'Django Unchained', nor as game-changing as 'Pulp Fiction'; if anything, 'The Hateful Eight' falls more in line with Tarantino's first film, 'Reservoir Dogs'.Although this is by far my favourite film of the year, I do not consider it to be the best.All the main actors are delightfully despicable. They are the main reason why I stuck around for the entire 2 hrs. and 48 mins. of this film's runtime. Not only do they bring a great deal of enthusiasm and energy to their characters (trust me, every actor seemed like they had fun with his/her role), but they also managed to create this undeniable chemistry for them. There are no interactions that feel awkward or forced - everyone just kind of works naturally off of each other. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the standout here; without giving away too much, her performance as Daisy Domergue will more than likely make your skin crawl - she is scary good in the role. Samuel L. Jackson also gives his best performance in recent years. There are scenes where his delivery can either get a crowd cheering or laughing their guts out (all because of how unexpected he can be).The score by Ennio Morricone might possibly be the most memorable of this year's. It's a dark and creepy vibe mixed with Morricone's signature western vibe - and it sets the mood perfectly for what's to come.The story is unlike anything I've seen on the big screen before. This isn't a traditional story of good guys vs. bad guys - it's a story about morally ambiguous characters who couldn't trust each other less. It is both suspenseful and unpredictable - something that a lot of films these days aren't. I personally had a lot of fun trying to figure out what would happen next based on the clues left by Tarantino. Yes, the film does feel incredibly slow at times (especially during the middle), but Tarantino makes up for it by making each payoff more shocking and rewarding than the previous one. The final climax is a fantastic surprise - perhaps one of Tarantino's finest.The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. Every time there's a wide shot of the stagecoach galloping across the snowy terrain, my eyes can't help but go wide. Unfortunately, most of the film takes place inside, so there aren't that many shots of the surrounding natural environment. However, that's not to say that the indoor shots aren't also great to feast your eyes upon. Even though the film is shot with 65mm film (and projected to 70mm), Tarantino and Richardson (D.P.) still managed to make the most of showing off the film's wonderfully designed haberdashery.Tarantino's daring direction and bold decisions not only make 'The Hateful Eight' one of this year's most unique cinematic experiences but also one of this year's more problematic films. As mentioned, the film is LONG - and one can really feel it drag on at certain points. The pacing will throw off those expecting a lot more violence (don't worry, there's some good bloody violence in this film as well). Finally, a lot of what happens in this film doesn't contribute to the main plot, but to character development instead (and to great effect).In reality, if I weren't a fan of Tarantino, I would give 'The Hateful Eight' a 7/10. For an average viewer, the film will seem like a long and boring journey. For a true film fan, it won't be something you'll want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Exciting, Funny, Tense, Thrilling, Original, Unpredictable.","Exciting, funny, tense, thrilling, original, unpredictable. This film had everything a great movie should. Quentin Tarantino strikes gold again with this wonderful tale of lies, deceit and good old fashioned bloody murder. Directed and acted to perfection the run-time of 2 hours 47 minutes flies by as if it were an hour, truly keeping you entertained and captivated the whole way through.Its extremely hard to pick fault with this film but the only reason I would give it an 8 is purely based on the fact that the story structure meant it revealed the outcome at around the 2 hour mark leaving no guessing or mystery in the remaining third, However you were still truly engrossed beyond the outcome to see what fate the characters would meet.A superb story and easily one of the best films I've seen, not a film you would watch multiple times but a must see for all true movie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

6/10,"This is the first time I actually come out of a Tarantino movie, majorly unimpressed. I am so sad about that. I didn't love Django as much as everybody, yet I still found lots to enjoy about it, yet this time around I really feel uninspired by it, something that never, ever happened with Tarantino. Now, I don't want to give the impression that I am the number one fan of his, I'll admit up front I am not. I love almost all of his movies and he is a filmmaker that taught me a lot about cinema, but with the exception of the masterpiece ""Inglourious Basterds"", I've never fallen head over heels for his work.Yet, lets give a break to all the depression here. My vote for the film is still positive and deservingly so because it does have many things going for it that I managed to appreciate. The fact that I am talking so negatively about it is because I am so used to high standards with him it is strange to be in this place where I actually have something to actively criticize about his film.Before that I will say that the score of the film is fantastic. The sound is fascinatingly crafted and contributes more than the cinematography in giving the film a vibe. Talking about cinematography, I'll admit I didn't see this in 70mm but on a standard screen and I found it to be pretty standard on that front. Nothing really exceptional, the thing that's really to like about it is how beautifully it is lit and how exceptionally broad and warm the color palette is, and it fits right into, thanks also to some really admirable production design. Yet, at no point in the film I thought: ""wow look at that shot"", it all went pretty over the shoulder.There is an interesting conversation to be had on this film because I truly realized how the photography wasn't serving the story the majority of the time. Now, of course it is extremely difficult to make that work in such a narrow setting, ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Dial M for Murder"" being the best examples where they actually found a way to tell that story visually too, despite being locked in a room for all film. Yet here it is absolutely disconnected.And this really brings me to the focal point of this film and it's problem: it is not ever telling a story. You take something like the opening scene of ""Inglourious Basterds"" which might be as perfect as scenes get. You look at what the characters say, how the camera moves, how the actors are placed. Everything there is about telling the audience something, making them feel every drop of sweat of the farmer. Now, I look at the entirety of ""The Hateul Eight"" and it seems the total opposite. I couldn't believe the dialogue I was hearing, for heaven's sake, the characters talk exposition for three hours straight! At no point in this film there is a genuine conversation with subtext and tension. You are constantly told by the characters on screen what is going on, what was going on and what will be going on, there is absolutely no space left for storytelling and tension. No wonder the photography is so disconnected, it wouldn't be possible to give any type of context on a screen to these conversations since they are absolutely emotionless. I was truly baffled by this, I was constantly unimpressed and unengaged and I wonder how could I have possibly been so if the film is just a three hour exposition! And it doesn't stop there because it also feels the need mid way through to get Quentin Tarantino himself to start explaining the plot to us. I truly wonder how can it be possible for someone to get emotionally engaged in such a narrative. And the more I write about this the more I realize how cheaply the film is built around this. Not to mention the fact that it is so dam unnecessarily long. There is a scene in which it takes 10 to 15 seconds for a character to get his glove off. I found myself thinking constantly: ""you could have told that whole thing in two shots and two cuts"" whilst the actual movie was taking twenty minutes to do so.Basically I think the screenplay of this film is really its big weakness, because I think too that as a director, Tarantino manages to pull off some really good stuff here. Spot on casting, amazing performances from everybody, it is so unfortunate their dialogue is so boring, but thanks to some truly brilliant collaboration between the cast and the director, they manage to make three hours actually bearable. Tim Roth being the big stand out for me followed by some inspired work by Walton Goggins, that is simply brought down by the fundamental problem of the film.This is a really big step down in my opinion for Tarantino and I realize that even more so after having written this review: it is incredible how I found the dialogue to be bad, that is surreal to say for me with Tarantino. Still, this isn't a failure of a film by any stretch of the imagination, it still offers a good serving of fun and acting that can be still enjoyed at a certain level.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Better Than I Expected,"First of all, I want to define something. When I say ""better than I expected"", I don't mean that it was a bad movie but you'd be able to see it at last. No! I knew from the beginning that we were talking about something good not only from the director or the screenplay, but from the cast, the pictures and the atmosphere. A very good mystery movie with a western background. Some deaths and everybody are suspects. Known formula, good plot, everyone played very well (especially Jennifer J. Leigh) and after the first hour you can't even take a breath. Personally, I think it's Tarantino's best movie. Even better than Reservoir Dogs. However, he payed to much attention in uninterested things such as how they all of them met together and although it started very good it ends with a LOT of blood. Just like every of his movies, but it was really a lot. It wasn't necessary. Never the less, it was a good movie, I have already watched it twice. It was a new chapter on westerns movies. I highly recommend it!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This review is coming from a veteran film critic and true Tarantino fan.,"When I first saw the trailer, I wasn't really hyped as much as I wanted to be. Even as a huge Tarantino fan, I had some doubts about how this film was gonna turn out. The concept didn't make me want to count the days for it to release, but after seeing it I'm really surprised I wasn't.The story is pretty simple, but also pretty complicated like a good detective crime series. Tarantino has a special kind of humor, some like it some don't. I really like the dark, brutal humor in his films. And most of all, this films is a real blast to watch. I was surprised by the fact that it was really funny. Samuel L. Jackson really shines in Tarantino films, and this one is no exception. Samuel manages to perfectly fit the brutal sense of humor from Tarantino.Fact that it's all pretty much in a single location doesn't make it boring at all, for the ones wondering.For the ones that like dark and brutal humor, bloody action scenes, detective like development and the brutal satisfaction at the end of Tarantino films (like Kill Bill, Django, Inglorious Bastards) this will be one of the best films you see this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

It was mostly dialogue with some great action scenes here and there, but it was perfect. I found myself again and again wondering what was going to happen to next, and knowing something exciting would happen, without having any idea what to expect at all; pretty masterful to pull that off.I thought it was 100 times better than The Revenant, and better than Star Wars.

This movie was brilliant.,"This movie was a strong commentary on the lives of the people in a racist and hateful society and it shows us who is still the most important of the people. You have a liberal bounty hunter, that once in the company of other whites used the ""n"" word as if it was the black bounty hunters name. How white women, the lowest, disgusting of white women are more important and valuable than all others, especially the two black hardworking women that were murdered. History tells us that disgusting white women have destroyed the lives of many, especially black people. The killing of the old man was brilliant, the message is: take your enemy down but use your head and not your anger or hate and he was taken down and it was beautiful. The murder of the workers and drivers was the most deceptive of actions, those killers came in smiling, laughing and making all relax in comfort, then they killed them all with shock on their faces, the enemy is often never seen coming until it is too late. The movie allows the disgusting women to be hung and I felt that she was hung for all the innocent, victimized people that was hung and her hanging allowed us to know that she was not special or worthy of all the lives she had taken. I loved it and I love that Lincoln was dismissed and reduced to a lie. My favorite movie of the year. Amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Underrated and one of Tarantino's best!,"Quentin Tarantino is my favorite screenwriter and is responsible for writing and directing my favorite movie, Pulp Fiction. I've loved almost all of his movies. I wasn't too big on Death Proof. So, naturally my expectations were high. The consensus with this movie is that it's one of Tarantino's weaker films and if you couldn't tell from my title, I can't disagree more.I love Inglourious Basterds and I love Django, but unpopular opinion: I think this movie is better than both of those. And perhaps an even more unpopular opinion: I think it's his second best, right behind Pulp Fiction. Love all of this movies, but I've watched this one and Pulp Fiction more times than any of his other films.The set up is fun. A bunch of people who hate each other for different personal reasons.Every single character feels fully-formed. I love how they're all awful people but they're all so interesting that you end up rooting for certain ones. There's even a point where you feel bad for Daisy, and that's just great writing right there.The setting is both beautiful and creepy.It's more vicious and dark compared to Basterds and Django.It's beautifully shot. The scenery they show us is just so breathtaking. Speaking of, you really got to appreciate how Tarantino is trying to keep old Hollywood alive by shooting the movie on film.The acting is absolutely superb. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of the best performances of her entire career.The comedy aspects are very funny!The Tarantino bloodshed is as enjoyable as always.Even though the movie is slowly paced, it never feels like a slog. If anything, it benefits the movie. It has a bunch of characters, an atmosphere, and a mystery to build up.The dialogue is very well-written. Not only did he do a good job capturing the vocabulary of the time period, but he was able to create tension with the dialogue alone and that is extremely difficult to do! Few writers can do that.You know you've done a great job when you have made a ""Whodunit"" that is no less entertaining on the second watch. I've seen this movie about a dozen times and I still find it as entertaining as I did when I watched it for the first time. I'm willing to bet I could watch it a million times and not feel bored.And last but certainly not least the score by Ennio Morricone... Holy. Crap. It just made everything super intense.I do take issue with the ending, though, which prevents me from giving it a perfect rating. I was asking myself, ""How did they get to this position?"" Or ""Why didn't you do this?"" But as you've noticed I gave this movie a 10/10. Because despite the fact that the ending could've used a rewrite I still like it the way it is. I owe that to the Tarantino carnage, the great dialogue, the amazing performances, and the characters that you either love, or love to hate.I guess I'll address the extended edition: I prefer the theatrical cut because it allows you to figure certain things out for yourself. That being said, the new additions are still fun to watch for reasons that at this point are obvious. So yeah, I recommend the extended edition, as well.Last thing, I cannot be the only one who finds it funny that that one song that didn't make it into The Thing made its way back to Kurt Russell? Kurt Russell at an isolated location in the middle of a snowy environment, being paranoid about everyone around him, and trying to figure out who the killer is, no less.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not the gr8-est, but I didn't h8 it","Of all the QT films I have seen I would have to rate (or should that be r8?) the Hateful Eight as the least effectual. It seems that Tarantino operates at the height of his game when he is making his OWN movies and not paying homage to an obsolete genre with a pastiche (read fake) style.Set in a post-civil war Wyoming the movie takes its time setting up the characters with a long prologue before finally arriving at the stagecoach outpost where our awful octet growl and point guns at each other for two hours. Tarantino never really seems to know what kind of movie he is making here, awkwardly fusing a western with a whodunnit, which would be fine under any other circumstances but he does it in such a cartoonish and immature way.Even with a 3-hour running time (depending on which version you're watching) there's not enough breathing room for these characters to all have equal development. Tim Roth can only bring his Oswaldo Mowbray to life with a silly accent, while Michael Madness as Joe Gage has nothing to do but squint and channel his inner Nick Nolte. Kurt Russell and Sam Jackson work great together though, while Jennifer Jason Leigh makes for a truly vile lady villain.Tarantino's super-duper indulgent 2.76:1 photography is almost entirely ineffectual for what is, essentially, a single-set stage play. The establishing shots are nice and all, but there's nothing here that could not be achieved with regular anamorphic Panavision. I saw a 70mm version of the movie and felt that the much wider screen only created problems. Pulling off a close-up in 2.35:1 is already hard to do, but here a close-up is nothing more than a very centered headshot with excessive picture information at the sides. This type of movie is completely unsuitable for the Super Panavision 70 format.I was excited to hear Ennio Morricone's score, especially since Tarantino has been reluctant to have (original) musical scores until this point, but it's basically just one melody played over and over, with the exception of one track I am sure was pulled from the score to The Thing. It was a track I always felt was John Barry-esque and easily identifiable. Hiring Morricone to do the score proves that Tarantino thinks he's making a 1960s spaghetti western when really he's just pretending to, a trait that doomed those utterly moronic Grindhouse movies a few years ago.I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was. I walked out of this mildly entertained with a large crowd of people who felt about the same. And why does Channing Tatum have to be in EV-ER-Y-THING? I so sick, sick, SICK to death of seeing him in movies. There is such a thing as overexposure, you know!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

not Tarantino's best,"The Hateful Eight is not one of QT's best films, but it's still pretty good. The direction, screenplay, and characters/acting are all great. Sam L. Jackson gave an amazing performance, his character was great. The film is a mystery, but it's a western at heart and it doesn't really work. It's a really good concept, but the mystery isn't built up all that well, until really late in the film and there's one layer mystery that I found to be kind of stupid and unnecessary. It ended up killing one of the characters that really should've stuck around, not a good decision. I feel like the story should've taken a much different direction at that point. I think the biggest issue is that the film doesn't decide to be a mystery until over an hour in. It is then where an actual plot comes into play. That first hour of the film should've been cut down to maybe 30 minutes, it would've made a better exposition. There were a bunch of other issues I had, but they're relatively minor and aren't worth mentioning. Overall, it's good, despite all its problems. I'd just expect a little better from Tarantino.

"The movie cracked me up with classic Tarantino style, but the length and the eccentricity of Channing Tatum kills it.","As many Tarantino's films, I love how there is no actual protagonists but just great actors stealing thunders from one another.

Besides, the other actors successfully creates that kinds of mysterious atmosphere in the first half of the movie, but Tatum just ruins it the moment he shows up. What is up with that pretty-boy, refreshing look? And please work on your speaking tone and accent, would you? How come your ""beloved"" sister is speaking in a strong southern accent and you're not? Enough with Tatum's acting, now it's time for the good part. Samuel L.

Tarantino at his finest again.,"Well I'll be double dog damnedIs it really the eighth film from Quentin Tarantino? I'm pretty sure he's done more than that or is saying the eighth film he's written and directed? Anyhow, I ain't gonna argue with the legendary QT.What I love so much about Tarantino's films is his style, his respect to the cinema a lot of us grew up with. I can imagine, quite like myself, Tarantino watching movies as a child, lost in wonderment with aspirations of making these very same films, but not to do them better, he loves these classic, iconic films that lay foundation of his inspiration. No, he's just a guy that loves the movies and set out to make good films just like them.So, his eighth film is the aptly named The Hateful Eight which is an amazing, encapsulating murder mystery reminding me very much of films like Clue and especially The Last Supper where the story's characters ultimately have a battle of wits until the bloody end.Set a few years after the American civil war, an unforgiving blizzard forces the assembly of eight drifters each with their own agenda and notorious history. The halfway shack that shelters them isn't big enough for their egos and their suspicions just squeezing in deceptions until the eventual burst.The cast is of the usual Tarantino family with a few new, but recognisable faces. Kurt Russell plays a bounty hunter known for keeping his bounties alive long enough to see them hang. He's hellbent on getting most-wanted but not so known outlaw, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the gallows in Red Rock, Wyoming.Samuel L. Jackson plays an ex-union Major-turned-bounty-hunter, Tim Roth a polite British hangman, Michael Madsen a quiet yet looming cowboy and Walton Goggins, who steals the show entirely, plays the unsuitable, supposedly newly elected sheriff of Red Rock. Goggins is the modern day Bill Paxton to me, never really get the lead roles but does an amazing job, this being his moment in my opinion.Bruce Dern returns plays a confederate General who strikes up an instant rapport with Jackson's Warren. A couple of newbies to Tarantino's world, Demián Bichir as the Mexican and Jennifer Jason Leigh who fits perfectly among the rest of the rabble.It's interesting and almost comical how everyone has mostly heard of one another, making the Wild West feel like an expansive small town with larger than character reputations. It's something Tarantino does so brilliantly, creating distinctive characters.As expected, the script is sharpshootingly good, full of insulting, derogatory slurs and loaded with expletives. There's more showdowns of tongues than shootouts, but what comes should surely quench anyone's blood thirst.I can't imagine how excited Tarantino must have been to have the maestro Ennio Morricone actually compose the score to this film as oppose to having his famous tracks used in many of Tarantino's precious films. He first western in 40yrs, It one-ups The Revenant in this respect though not taking anything away from Alvo Noto and the also legendary Ryuichi Sakamoto.The bloody special effects are gruesome with thanks to Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead. The set location and especially the costumes are flamboyant yet suitable for the film. To be dressed as a Tarantino character must be both fun and amazing.Tarantino's style is glorious as always, gladly still shooting with the ultra Panavision, anamorphic 70mm film which still, in my opinion, so stunning compared to digital. But the lighting, the close-ups and the entirely film is perfectly shot and seamlessly put together.I can see this very much as a play on Broadway or at the West End. It's theatrical brilliance. But, is it Tarantino's best work? Still not as good as Pulp Fiction, but it doesn't try to be.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 081% 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"When we look back, we will regret the waste of Tarantino's talent... unless","Another film that demonstrates how good Q could be IF ONLY he found a good collaborator. So much of this was good and so much better than the appalling self-indulgent nonsense that was Inglorious Bastards (sic). Set up was good, characters were fully (if clumsily) sketched out, script was great.. to a point. BUT... the violence and the monotonous single theme pitch.Key point - if everyone behaves like a psychopath, then everyone is A BAD GUY. Personally I think that trying to normalise killing someone is a terrible thing to do, and anyone who tries/ does kill someone is at least morally compromised... sadly (and this is not just a QT thing of course) this seems to STILL be a moot point, though way down from the late 90s high/low point. Oddly the thing I liked about Reservoir Dogs was that it made the point that violence always has consequences, not the opposite.In this film, the killing was gratuitous, frequent, and, most inexcusable of all, made the film worse.But the thing that made the film dull was the constant - and I mean constant - race references. I mean, seriously? Did they really not talk about ANYTHING else? I mean, not even misogyny - which, judging by this film was at least a constant...As per Django, the denouement was rubbish. Made no sense and I think was actually impossible. Gave the viewer the sense that they were running out of film...In short - enjoy the ride.

This film IS dialogue heavy.But the time is well spent hashing out the characters, and building the tension to a boiling point.The last chapter or two is the powder keg finally exploding. I see reviewers complaining that there aren't any characters to root for and that they are all loathsome and despicable. To this I simply want to direct them to....the TITLE OF THE FUCKING FILM!!! And people point out that cringe worthy scene in the snow w/Sam Jackson and the General's son as pointless., Again missing the point.Up to that point,the character of Marquise Warren WAS the one to rally behind as the sympathetic former Union soldier fighting racism.But after that HATEFUL act in the snow,he loses that sympathy and becomes as,once again,HATEFUL and worthy of condemnation as the rest. The cinematography and musical score rightfully get their due, but the direction and mainly the acting truly shine.It is awesome to see what good actors can do in an ensemble like this.Jennifer Jason Leigh got the Oscar nomination,but IMO ,was no better than the rest.Even the usually one trick (IMO) Kurt Russell tears up the scene.But like most things he is in,Goggins steals the show
This is a fun flick, if you take it for what it is, and don't go in expecting a traditional shoot em' up, all for one Western.These characters truly are HATEFUL!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino at His Finest,"This is a review of the 70mm Roadshow edition of ""The Hateful Eight"". Minor spoilers below.Quentin Tarantino, for a long time has been one of my favorite movie directors. Every time one his movies come out I jump at the chance to go see them. If you are not a fan of any of his previous works, then this review will not change your mind. However if you did enjoy every other movie that Tarantino has made, then hopeful this review will encourage you to go see ""The Hateful Eight"".The film opens with beautiful shots of mountain ranges and snow frosted areas. Then a stage coach is seen hurtling down the road at full speed. The opening sets the tone for the entire move because it is slow moving, yet you are fully engaged by the tension in the dialogue and the musical score.At first, the movie will be a different pace than other Tarantino movies. It does not jump straight into the action, the action has to be earned, and boy, do you get some action. The only downfall of that is, that the majority of the violence and blood is restrained to the last half of the movie, and was not equally separated between both parts. The violence in this movie is very similar to that in ""Django Unchained"", there are buckets of blood.Overall, the movie is very well acted and filmed, giving Samuel L. Jackson, and Walton Goggins the spotlight. The movie is a 10 out of 10. One of the best movies that has been released in quite some time. The actors shine through, and they are able to deceive you at every turn.My final point is to all of the other critics, who have said that the movie was too slow, or violent, or that the language is to vulgar. I have a question for you: Where the **** have you been? The majority of you say that you have loved Tarantino's previous films, yet you still deny this movie the credit it deserves. Quentin Tarantino movies are made of three things that the majority of you should have learned by now, and if you have not, then there is no reason for others to be seeing that you used to be a Tarantino fan because if you were then you would have understood why the movie is the way it is. The N-word was used excessively,but that is part of what makes ""The Hateful Eight"" great. Those three things about Quentin Tarantino movies will be listed below, but I would like to thank Quentin Tarantino, for making an outstanding movie.The three things that make a Tarantino movie-1. Dialogue 2.Over the top violence 3. SOCIALLY INAPROPRIATE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Masterpiece. (No spoilers.),"Quinton is a living legend in the film industry. As a prolific screenwriter he's contributed some of the best scripts Hollywood has seen over the last couple of decades.With a love for kung fu, classic westerns, and a healthy amount of gore He's been known to embellish in intense confrontations like the ones found in this film. He likes to be classy, but always at some point, reverts to his boyish love for chaos.Sometimes he does it to remind us of the brutality of the human conditionSometimes he just does it because the boy in him likes to watch heads explode in a ""gory watermelon like fashion.""We tend to love it either way he delivers it though.Usually It is all accompanied by a thought provoking dialog that does well to showcase the human condition in its many forms.This film is no exception.The latest fictional tale from Quinton takes place in the ""old mountainous west"" on the eve of a great blizzard around Christmas. The premise, is Kurt Russell is escorting a prisoner to her hanging for a ten thousand dollar reward, and in the last few miles of the stretch to Red Rock, begins to run into several strangers whom seek refuge from the cold of the storm.Kurt's healthy level of suspicion sets the stage for a wonderful mystery moving forward Especially when several strangers end up stranded at a cabin with him and his death row prisoner.It has an all star cast, but there really is no star of the film itself, mostly because many of the characters are given ample room to breathe and interact with one another.The dialogs between the characters really reflected the divided nature of a country after a civil war. It also does well to showcase America's long history of racism (much like ""DJango Unchained"" did.)But beyond all of that It was just a damn good thriller that weaved a wonderful web of mystery and suspicion. Dare I say... Very ""Reservoir Dogs"" like in nature.A lot of people like to see some gore when it comes to their Terantino films, but for me it was always about the interactions between the characters & how the story unfolded.This film doesn't fail in that regard one bit. I can say without a doubt that I was satisfied and even laughing a bit as the credits rolled.Regarding the gore It's no Kill Bill, but there are some extremely satisfying moments that deliver buckets of non-CGI props for us to twist in. There was a decapitation at one point and ""my eyes nearly bulged through my glasses as I started to giggle like a schoolgirl with glee.""Those moments weren't in short supply, they just weren't back-to-back ""like some viewers may prefer,"" and that's OK Just know that this isn't going to be one of those films. It's more refined than that Even in its brutality, it is obvious that Quinton is, even now, still evolving as a film maker and screen writer.The soundtrack is old school. Don't expect cutting edge synthesis or raging metal at any point of the story. Much like the movies Quinton grew up on, he wanted this one to fit right in with the classics, just Modernized for today's audience.I think he accomplishes this.The camera work is beautiful. The images and angles he manages to capture in this latest addition are outstanding. I especially loved how the storm looked behind any given character doing whatever ""whenever."" That feeling of ""old Wyoming in winter"" was beautifully captured. The sound design was great. When the blood came I felt the splats in my subs and the swishing of chunks properly distributed in the stereo stage.I think there was only one point in the film that I didn't feel good about it and even that particular moment/ scene served a purpose for the audience, so as uncomfortable as watching a particular scene was It truly depicted the cruelty of man back in those days, and made the conclusion of everything all the sweeter too.This is a masterpiece. Hands down beautiful.Not for your kidsBut a great way to spend an afternoon off of work.Professional Review Score: 8/10Didn't make me cry, and its not for all audiences, but it was still awesome enough to beat out the average Awesome I see on a monthly basis. Drawbacks for some will be the length, glorified racist perspectives from characters, and gore. I personally like the length and gore just fine though, and the racism, well... It exists. It REALLY existed after the Civil war too. I applaud Quinton for getting it right.Personal Review Score: 10/10This is a masterpiece. The script is beautiful. Samuel L Jackson tops his performance in Pulp Fiction here easily, and I absolutely love this film's ability to weave a great stage. The scenes are captured in style, the blood isn't modest yet very effective /realistic, and the mind games are perfect! Just perfect:)And there it is.No spoilers Now go watch it. You're gonna love this experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very enjoyable unpredictability,"If, like me, you generally prefer movies in which you can't guess what's going to happen next, you'll probably enjoy this one. Obviously Quentin Tarantino has a unique style of making movies and it once more shows in this one. In this movie, you're never really sure who is the good and who is the bad guy, leading to some changes of the view on the different characters. For me that resulted in a somewhat emotional uncertainty of what I would want to happen next, just to be surprised by a new piece of information/development that changes everything I believed to happen next. So overall, the unpredictability, the twists & turns as well as the way the story is told make this movie a very enjoyable one. On top of that: outstanding performance by Samuel L. Jackson and Tim Roth while some other actors remain a little dull. The reason I don't give 10 stars is that in an almost three hour long movie, I partially expected more character depth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hateful Eight (2015),"As soon as the opening credits began on Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight,"" I knew I was in for a unique cinematic experience. The credits themselves appear old-fashioned and the great Ennio Morricone's score is playing as they roll, the expansiveness and desolation of the snowy area is shown, and then all of a sudden, Samuel L. Jackson appears on screen, ""Got room for one more?"" He asks the stagecoach driver as he sits in the middle of the path covered in snow. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.""The Hateful Eight"" stars a lot of Tarantino alum including the aforementioned Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Kurt Russell, and a slew of others and is directed by the always interesting Quentin Tarantino. It centers around a group of people being stuck in a haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard in Wyoming, and when things go awry, suspicion grows and the whole thing turns into a version of ""Clue"" that few would expect to see coming. Much like Tarantino's other films, ""The Hateful Eight"" cherry picks items from movies past and uses them in his own unique ways, to everyone's benefit. Albeit this time, an original score was composed, not a foul move. Morricone's score was his first western score in some forty years, and it is a truly memorable one at that, one that surely matches the shifty-eyed characters and fits the suspicion element all too well.While Tarantino himself usually takes the spotlight from his actors with his dialogue and signature direction style, and sure this one may be no different, this time he has some hefty competition for the spotlight of this movie with one Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. As a movie fan, I've seen a lot of Jackson in my lifetime, and I do mean a lot, though never seemingly like this. A while back I recall watching ""Jackie Brown"" (another Tarantino contribution that also starred Jackson) with a friend of mine and he said to me during it, ""Samuel L. Jackson always seems to play the same sort of characters the same way in his movies, only slightly different sometimes,"" a valid statement. Though, that is not the same Jackson in ""The Hateful Eight,"" it is an ensemble cast but he is certainly the lead and leads this film he does. While what he says is usually riveting, it elevates to a level I was not prepared for, and the physical comedy and the delivering of his lines must be spoken of as part, be on the lookout for that monologue. Jackson isn't the only noteworthy performance, as it would be criminal to not include Kurt Russell's ""John Ruth"" and Jennifer Jason Leigh's ""Daisy Domergue.""Right on cue, Tarantino has written another dynamite script that has something for all film fans. Every moment of the runtime is spent contemplating, laughing, or studying these characters and their actions - past, present, and future, and that is a credit to serious writing. I've seen a whodunit, I've seen a western, and neither has hit the subtle comedic strides ""The Hateful Eight"" hit. He seemed to have combined this movie as a blend from some of his previous works, this movie reeks of the same ingredients of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a group of violent, untrusting individuals in an isolated area and ""Django Unchained,"" the Civil War era setting and the western feel.Much like a lot of westerns, Tarantino dedicates time to setting. We get several beautiful shots and pans of the landscape to solidify the isolation of the area we are put into, leaving us never to ask ""Why don't they just leave?"" It doesn't just end there. Once everyone has arrived at the haberdashery, Minnie's, it is such a claustrophobic area that we are shown very fluently, we know where everyone is, know where every item is (the fireplace, coffee pot, dinner table) and that only helps place us into the mystery and allows us to keep an eye on everyone, because if you're watching the movie too, you're suspicious.""The Hateful Eight"" contains a great deal. It contains more than just Tarantino fan service, the violence and witty dialogue, it contains a captivating mystery wrapped in a western shell. It isn't weighed down by genres, studio restrictions, or a time constraint that would not allow enough time to develop its angry individuals. This movie is a welcome addition to a great storyteller's filmography, and quite possibly my favorite film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Intense with a surprising plot,"The movie has a very slow pacing and takes its time with slow but very good written conversations. It took some time to really catch me but after a while it did. The plot is quite surprising and i really liked the ending. I dont know why but in this movie i did not like Samuel l Jacksons acting, in my opinion it did not really fit the vibe of the movie and was sometimes a little to much for me. What i really liked is the whole premise, the fact that almost the whole movie takes place in this one cabin with only a few characters was very interesting and something i have not seen so far. Overall its a very solid movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An interesting and Unexpected film. SPOILER FREE REVIEW,"I am not subtle in the fact that I'm no big fan of Quentin Tarantino. While I loved Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds, I despise every other one of his films. Baring that in mind, I went in to this film with the lowest of expectations (and also no idea what I was actually getting in to). So it came as quite a surprise to me, that at the end of the day I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It's almost three hours of character and violence exploration, and the movie holds on to you for every MINUTE of the movie. It holds off on having a lot of characters and makes sure you know every one of them, and for that this movie is in the high echelon of Tarantino's films. There are STAND OUT performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russel, and Walton Goggins. All of them hold on to you the entire time, and though you don't know who the killer is throughout, and you don't particularly trust anyone, you can't help but sympathize with each and every one of them.My only complaint for this movie is Tarantino's treatment of women in it. The main woman character, while played MASTERFULLY to the point you both hate her and pity her. Is brutally abused in this film, and most of the bad things that happen are directed towards her, which turned me away a bit at times.But all in all this movie is worth watching, even if you aren't a fan of Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good but not great,"All of Quentin Tarantino movies are fun to watch, and I can always feel his appreciation of filmmaking as a craft as well as his joy in film as pure entertainment. The setup to 'Hateful Eight' is fantastic, with beautiful outdoor shots in snow country, and an interesting concept, characters being added one by one as a bounty hunter stops to pick up those imperiled by an oncoming blizzard. Tarentino assembles a fine cast with Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others, and Bruce Dern turns in a great performance. There are some deep moments amidst the violence, Jackson saying in one scene that ""The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed"", and Tim Roth's character expressing the thin line justice walks in a speech ending with the line ""For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice"" in another. I liked how the stories behind each of the characters are gradually revealed, and how the story behind what happened earlier in the haberdashery that everyone is holed up in is told in a flashback chapter. In other words, there's a lot to like here. And yet. And yet. How the story plays out was somehow not completely satisfying, maybe because I felt like it lost focus, and fell back on extreme gore and graphic moments to try to carry the day. I was also not a huge fan of the ending. It's a good film for sure, but not great, or Tarantino's best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Laughs where there shouldn't be laughs,"Hateful Eight....bloody marvellous.. It could only be QT; complicated plot, interacting strangers and blood splatter. There are laughs where there shouldn't be laughs and actors acting their socks off. Loved every minute from the opening titles to the gory climax. SLJ plays a gritty , grisly , stranded stranger who joins others on an ill fated stagecoach ride. Kurt Russell reminds us just how good he still is, and JJL is a revelation . Every character brings intrigue to the table, each with their own agenda. This is an adult film and shocking at times. More than once, I thought how did he get away with that but the violence, although jarring, is always integral to the story. One of Quentin's best films....high praise in deed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Crime mystery set in snow storm in wilderness,"Quentin Tarantino has not ever been one of my favorite directors, nor storytellers. Admittedly though he has directed some very brave and edgy films that I do like. Among them are Django Unchained, Inglorious Basters and Reservoir Dogs.The story of Reservoir Dogs is set in mainly one place, a storehouse. The scenery is simple, dialogue is well-flowing, characters are well-developed and it could as well be a stage-drama. To tell the least, the plot line of The Hateful Eight is developed pretty much in the same way as in Reservoir Dogs. Men with names of colors are changed into one man of color: Samuel L. Jackson, and one with ethnicity: Demlan Bachir.Tarantino has his reputation on his side. Actors like viewers know at least a bit what to expect from a Tarantino-film. Everything is technically well done, and Morricone's score is as good as in any of those older western movies and The Untouchables (1987). Everything is just in the right place, everything is done in the manner of Tarantino.What escapes from the most reviewers is the fact that the film is labeled the film as crime mystery. What does it mean? After lengthy intro during which the characters are built, over 1,5 hours of running-time, there is a sudden kill and poisoning. And this is a starting point of a psychological crime drama set in the cabin in the wilderness. When you should start focusing on what was said during the film, who are these people who now accommodate the cabin. Whom you or the main characters should trust, and whom not.Structure of the film could have done in many other ways. But I believe Tarantino knew exactly how he would be doing the film: with a really long intro and a lot of talking during which most of the viewers get bored and miss hopefully what most of the talking was about. I would have preferred shorter introduction like most of the viewers, but I must say at the same time, once again Tarantino has done a great deal with characters and making a western movie that is not actually at all is and mainly is not a western movie.I understand the disappointment of many who do not like this kind of storytelling. I don't like it much either. Also over half of the running-time seems like meaningless dialogue until - this is in the very essence of cinema storytelling from which any director or screenwriter could learn from.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

""clever"" dialogs are not that clever and don't add nothing to the experience. 3/4 of the movie is just painfully boring, you have to wait a long time to see some nice gore scenes but its all predictable. did i say the plot is extremely poor? please do yourself a favor and watch it on your home because you'll be able to fast forward some unnecessary scenes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Fun Tarantino ride - not the greatest.,"Like I said, it's not the greatest ride from Tarantino, but still, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. The movie is basically about two bounty hunters who find shelter in a small haberdashery until morning, when snow stops falling. There, they find four guys who are hiding a secret. One of the bounty hunters has a criminal who is to be hanged. Through talking and talking and talking (with some action here and there) we find out a lot during the story. Like all other Tarantino movies, this one has signature witty dialogue Tarantino's known for. It's got a great story, has a great set of characters and dialogue, so what's wrong? What's wrong is that the film gets boring in the middle because it takes time to get the story right. The ending of the film is violent and gory, but not really satisfying. Asks a lot of questions, but answers none. That's what's wrong. This is one of the darkest Tarantino films yet, but still manages to get some really dark humor here and there. Samuel L. Jackson like always nails the role as a bounty hunter Marquis Warren. Kurt Russell is also great, but what surprised me most was Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her performance is energetic and fantastic. Final verdict - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Film Review: The Hateful Eight/,"Watching a Tarantino film is a cinematic experience, better yet, a right of movie-passage; an experience that may not be as recognizable or appreciated now by the vast majority, but can surely be pointed out and appreciated by a fine few who can find similarities and influences with some of the last great auteurs and great directors of the past. And yet, like his films, Tarantino intended to present his sly and ultra-violent eighth film in the most roadshow way possible; with an overture, intermission and in 70mm no less. Maybe your wondering, after eight films, has Tarantino out done himself, especially after the exceptional critical and commercial praise of Django Unchained, for which he won an Academy Award in the Original Screenplay category? The answer my friends is, as Samuel L. Jackson so coyly says within the first lines of the film, ""Got room for one more?"", cause Tarantino ain't going anywhere yet!Tarantino's newest film, The Hateful Eight is every bit as brilliant, violent, unapologetic and masterful than his last, plus some. Writing in a way that can only Tarantino can write, The Hateful Eight proves that the master scribbler has no intention of letting up, or letting lose of his racial, sexist and down-right offensive subject matter in his older age.But before we get into all that, lets take a little history lessonBack in 2014, the original script for the film leaked online, which gave Tarantino a very easy choice to make, he scrapped the project in pre-production altogether. Opting to make the film a novella instead, a cast was chosen to give a brief reading of the script in LA. The cast, who is almost identical to the final cast seen in the film, with the stark exception of Jennifer Jason Leigh, who replaced Amber Tamblyn in the read as Daisy Domergue, as well as the addition of Demián Bichir and a super secret role of Channing Tatum, The Hateful Eight saw the light after all. Thankfully, after a very successful and publicized read, and with the help of the convincing of good friend Samuel L. Jackson, a frequent collaborator of Tarantino, the writer extraordinaire re-wrote the first draft of the script, created two new alternative endings, and announced his plans to continue with The Hateful Eight as his next film. Alas, here I am today.The film, which circles mostly among eight main characters, tells the story of a hangman, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is notorious for claiming his earning with subject who are alive, and his seamlessly impossible quest of getting the wanted Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a woman convicted of murder, to the proper authorities for a hefty bounty. Unknown to him at the time on his way to Red Rocks, Colorado, Ruth's coach, steered by the steady O.B Jackson (James Parks), encounters one helluva winter storm. Untrusting of anyone and everyone, except O.B, the storm swallows the travelling companions of two men; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter, with some precious cargo of his own, and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), an ex Lost-Causer militiaman who is on his way to Red Rocks to claim his new badge as Sheriff and inevitably, issue both Ruth and Warren, their bounty prizes. Too many coincidences yet? Trust me, we are just getting started.As the two horseless men make their way on Ruth's coach, Ruth makes an alliance with Major Warren, to both protect their bounties from anyone threatening to take it away from them. While the three men bond in the most bizarre ways, Mannix, an ex Confederate, laughs in the face of Major Warren and his conquests during the Civil War, showing just how stormy the next chapters of this epic story will actually be. As the storm takes a turn for the worst, the coach and all its occupants are forced to seek refuge in Minnie's (Dana Gourrier) Haberdashery, a cozy and warm little stagecoach lodge the middle of nowhere.Once settled, paranoia levels are high while we are introduced to the rest of Tarantino's Hateful Eight. Among the new eight are; Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a quiet man who so happens to be at Minnie's on the quest to see his mother; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) an old Confederate General who is just being cozy playing chess; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the hangman responsible of the actual hanging of Daisy once at Red Rocks, and my personal favourite Bob The Mexican (Damián Bichir), the only person in charge of running Minnie's place while she is 'conveniently' away with her husband Sweet Dave (Gene Jones). Once the already inhabitant guests greet the new coach full of killers, bounty hunters and coachmen, the stage is set for one of the best whodunnits films in recent memory.Essentially, this is Tarantino's first attempt at a mystery film and without question, what a success it is. As expected, Tarantino, arguably, one of the best actor directors working today (and even possibly, of all-time), assembles a stellar cast full of vivid characters who, may not be are favourite group of individuals, ones we aren't suppose to like much, but end up loving, regardless of their intentions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A 3 hour movie that could have been 2,"Overall, not a bad movie.Had great characters, intense sequences (at times) and had your usual Tarantino quirkiness that you can't find in any other violent, Western movie. But my only complaint:HOLY SH*T, it was WAYYYY to long. There were many scenes that could have been cut down in length (scenes where the stage coach is just driving to the house, characters nailing the door in, dialogue scenes, etc)I give this movie a 8/10 for that reason alone.

Another great Quentin Tarantino flick!,"I really liked this movie, another great Quentin Tarantino flick! This is a great addition to his oeuvre.The story is awesome and the dialogues are great. Sometimes it's a little too long and it starts dragging, but then there is a twist and it captures me again. there isn't a lot of action, it feels kind of like a play, all the interesting stuff is in the interaction between the characters, just like on the stage. The characters are all Tarantino like, not realistic of course, just really interesting and fun. They fascinate and keep you on your toes, you never know who is telling the truth and who isn't. Sometimes there did seem to be a bit too many characters involved, and it was hard to keep them apart in the beginning, but the movie is so long that it gives you the time to get to know everyone a bit.A really captivating flick that keeps surprising you at every turn.

Tarantino's expression of self-love,"The movie had great moments, some interesting Tarantinoesque dialogues, and the visual cinematography was wonderful. For these reasons, I give it a 7. However, this movie is too long, had moments that felt out of place, and definitely had the potential to be a great film.What could have been a fantastic 2-hour movie was turned into a 167 minutes movie for very poor reasons. ""The Thing"", which Tarantino saw as the main influence for this movie, was capable of creating a similar atmosphere in 109 minutes. Was the Hateful Eight so special that it deserved a whole extra hour?I like Tarantino's style, and Kill Bill is one of my all-time favourite. The Hateful Hate felt like an exaggeration of that style, the worse being the random dialogues that never end (and at times, seemed to come from Tarantino instead of coming from the characters) and the beautiful and very long tracking shots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino delivers something old and something new - In a great way,"Quentin Tarantino is a film fan's filmmaker. He does what he does for no other reason than that he can, or that he wants to.Hateful Eight proves this and runs with it, and passes with flying colors.The best way I can describe the film is that its a combination of John Carpenter's 'The Thing' (not JUST because of Morricone's score or Kurt Russel) and 'Clue'. What we get is a film entirely about one stagecoach, one room, and the people that occupy it.The characters in the film are the Tarantino fair of being colorful and non- conventional, and of course, a ton of fun to watch. The acting and performances help as well, this is one of the best casts to grace a film this year. Kurt Russell is fantastic, Samuel Jackson delivers his best performance since Pulp Fiction, Tim Roth does a fine job, but the stand outs (other than Jackson who is near Oscar worthy) are Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins, who I wasn't expecting to hold a candle to the veterans of the cast. Goggins especially finally gets a film role where he can truly shine and will no doubt get him more well-deserved work.The story and characters seem to intertwine in ways you do expect and don't expect simultaneously. The direction and cinematography is spot on, as several hints and many different details allude to various character actions and motivations - and thats just on first viewing. QT proves he can work his film devices to the fullest potential since Pulp Fiction. And Morricone's score, as always, is beautiful, with even a nod to the score of 'The Thing' in the film.As far as problems or issues with structure, its all on how you enjoy these films. If you don't like Tarantino films, this film won't change your mind. It does fall into the conventional criticism that Tarantino doesn't really make films, he makes a collection of masterfully made scenes that may or may not hold together. Not to mention you can absolutely describe this film as various other film's by QT (even though thats evident in all his work, but this film feels like Reservoir Dogs meets Django Unchained with a twinge of Inglorious Basterds.) But here's the thing - Hateful Eight holds up together. It's fun, its dark, its dramatic, its hilarious, it's Hollywood filmmaking at its most charismatic and confident.I look forward to your Ninth, Tarantino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Tarantino, I love you!","I just want to thank Q. Tarantino for bringing theatre on screen and make a play possible. It's the most beautiful western I've ever seen.To all who didn't understand the movie, I suggest to start watching cinema finally not only crappy vampire stuff.I loved every second of this film. And already waiting for a new project of his. Also there is no doubt that this director always brings quality in Hollywood pop cinematography industry. The way bounty hunter portrayed and the criminals / amazing work, and how the story unfolds... It's always a pleasure to watch how elegant and easily Tarantino puts together grotesque, theatre, drama, crime and mystery, how character are involved and connected.

History did happen,"Loved it, the hateful 8 did its job! It delivered a great action/drama/thriller with all the satire and comedy you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. I have heard a lot of negativity about this movie a lot to do with the use of the 'N' word. While confronting at times this is a period piece. Set in post civil war America probably around the 1870's Slavery was still thing! African Americans were treated like second class citizens, that really happened. This movie is reflective of the era, it does no favours to sugar coat the past! yes there is a lot of racial commentary in this film but that was the way the world was back then. Anyway! the movie is great its Quentin Tarantino, so you know what you are going to get! a great cast with amazing dialogue! This movie is long but really enjoyable its a 'who done it' film 8 strangers in a cabin who is the bad guy? As a whole i don't think its Tarantino's best work but his 'not best work' is still a 9/10 in my opinion and a 8 on IMDb overall. So even when his isn't on his game he is amazing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great film 8! Underrated Tarantino film.,"Yes this movie is 3 hours long. It is a dialogue heavy movie. It's mostly about 8 unlikeable people trapped in one cabin. But it's so riveting that though I had my doubts at first, of course due to the reasons I mentioned already, I was completely blown away at how immersive the whole experience was.All the characters were so darn unlikeable but at the same time you're in awe of their acting skills as their respective acts are ever so convincing. The dialogues are fantastic and the screenplay is amazingly written. The cinematography is breathtaking despite only a handful of scenes being shot outdoors.I was hooked from the very start as there is tension throughout. Each and every scene is so intense and every actors' performance so damn good, be it John Ruth, the Hangman or Daisy Domergue, The sheriff, Major Smithers and ors. But it is obviously Major Marquis played by Samuel L Jackson that is The most interesting character. That guy has got it even today.Tarantino was and still is an effing genius. My only regret is not having watched it in the theatres. My only wish is to watch each of Tarantino's movies again, but at the cinema.One of the most underrated films and one of the best of Tarantino's works.Hateful 8? More like 'GreatFul 8 m8'! ;)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Surprisingly watchable,"As someone who's never truly liked a Tarantino movie after 'Pulp FIction,' I was amazed to have actually enjoyed this. While it starts out really slow, and I found myself thinking for the first hour that it was some failed sequel to 'Django Unchained' (which I was not a big fan of), the movie really picks up in the second half as it slowly begins to reveal to us where all these characters came from and why they all ended up in the mess that they're in.Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I always thought was a very talented actress, steals the show here. Her character, Daisy Domergue, is truly the most hateful of the eight. Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson true to form, and the other actors don't slouch either. The dialogue is well- written, and while the pacing sucks in the first half where Tarantino takes too long to set up the story, he's entirely forgiven when he produces a very watchable second half.If there's any serious criticism I can have is that by the time we reach the last twenty minutes, it does feel entirely like the ending of 'Reservoir Dogs'; but considering that this is a Tarantino movie, that's to be expected. I'm just glad he supplied the viewers with enough interesting characters, dialogue, and situations to make this, for me, one of his most watchable movies in over twenty years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Viva Tarantino, Viva Leone, Viva Morricone","Love it or hate it, it arguably is Tarantino's best work yet. Enio Morricone wrote the music, and Sergio Leone's influence in style and camera work is everywhere to be seen, but make no mistake, this 'is' a Tarantino movie. It is long (about three hours) with even an intermission! it can seem long-winded and slow, depending on your pre-conceived expectations, but to me there was not a dull moment. Acting is superb (mostly) - specially from Walton Goggins, Miss Leigh and of-course Samuel Jackson. Kurt Russel also did a wonderful job portraying John Ruth. Watch it and make your own determination, don't go to the theatre expecting it to be yet another western, indeed don't go with any expectations, just with an open mind and curiosity. I bet you won't consider your time wasted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Diabolic, ""but I still haven't done it yet!""...","* Free * spoiler // This is my first review on this site. I start from here cause I love Tarantino movies and I would often debate about his movies with friends in the past .. - A great Italian critic that gives its name to the famous dictionary Mereghetti, said of Tarantino, Pulp Fiction about ""Perfect game of joints, paradoxical dialogs and good actors direction, but do not ask real emotions: the second film, there is already a risk that Tarantino is too in love with himself."" - This film looks like a return to his first three films before Jackie Brown where cynicism was not lacking and totally devoid of romantic tones. You can not ask for, in my opinion, to Tarantino to make a traditional comedy, but I am sure that he is able to do it if only he wanted .. The dialogs are perfect, paced rhythm, a story a little kneaded from his previous films, but still credible, compelling, funny and with a certain suspense that reminds me of PF. Clear reminder of the Spaghetti Western of Leone, the ruthlessness of the films of Kurosawa and perhaps a look at Hitchcock. Maybe the biggest flaw of QT is that he may not have a hero to protect, but his eighth film will probably be an eulogy a little pleased with his genre but that critics in the future will recognize as unique .. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"This isn't Tarantino's best work, nor his most commercial, but is a great, twisty, suspenseful, hilarious film.","Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and i love all his movies, and the hateful 8 is no exception. Though there are a few things to note:Don't expect a Kill Bill, an Inglourious bastards or a Django, this is much more in line with Jackie Brown. Its 8 people in a room for 2 and a half hours. This doesn't mean that the film is less good, just that this is more about talk, mystery, suspense than adventure or action.This is his longest film yet, with nearly 3 hours. If you really love Tarantino, time will fly, if you're not his biggest fan you may feel the length a bit, though the film is climatic, is designed to be a crescendo, where things get more intense each minute until the third act where things just explode, revelations are made and twists and turns are the stars. There are a scene or two that feel unnecessary, mainly because they feel a bit repetitive, not offering nothing interesting or fresh.Many of his favorite actors are back, along with new additions like Channing Tatum and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The cast as you would expect, commits 300% to their roles, because its clear they love them, And with much reason, each character is more peculiar, inventive and interesting than the other. And make no mistake, they are the worst of the worst, there's no heroes, but you can find one that is less bad than the others. This is part of what i loved about the film, because as bad people they don't have limits, so they can do what they want, giving you one heck of a ride.While Tarantino is the master of dialogue, this isn't his best work, as you feel that this isn't the best he can do, though of course this still means that the dialogue is outstanding. There's many lines throughout the film that are really hilarious, and the conversations between the characters are amazing.This is not his most commercial film, not really, but i think it is his most straightforward one yet, either the story or dialogue. Anyone can enjoy this, and in fact i think this is also one o his most funny films, there's so much humour and moments that really make you laugh out loud.There's plenty of explicit violence, as usual, and if you think that he just cant come up with more inventive and fresh violence, you're wrong, because many of the best parts of the film are thanks to the violence.The cinematography is wonderful and the score is a killer, though the film doesn't use much of it.This isn't Tarantino's best work, nor the best he can do, but is a really great, hilarious film, filled with twists and turns and unforgettable moments, characters and performances. Its classic Tarantino, with everything you would expect from him. It's surprising all the way until the end, is really a great film, and you have everything to enjoy it, just don't expect this to be an action film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Impatient, IQ-deficient idjits hate The Hateful Eight","There are so many thinly rationalized negative reviews of this movie, it's no surprise Hollywood is going in the shitter to serve us clichéd turds and sequels upon sequels, dulling the senses, making as much money with as little risk as possible, and spitting in the face of originality and artistry.Furthermore, after Tarantino's ""gratuitously"" violent-interspersed-with-witty-dialog films have invited so many accusations of predictability, he serves up one that depends predominantly on what the actors are saying and saves the buckets of blood for the end, and y'all are still complaining. (""Gratuitously"" is in quotation marks because I don't agree with that claim, but this review is about The Hateful Eight, not QT.)I can see how this movie might be disappointing. Until you accept it for what it is, you wonder why you should find it interesting. It's different, and seems to move slowly, and the plot is shockingly simple. If you can lay all that as well as your expectations for a QT movie aside, these are the things to love about The Hateful Eight.The dialog, which again, is pretty much the entire movie, is brilliant. Hateful, but with just a touch of silliness that makes it all a comedy.The actors' performances were all amazing. I always love to see Tim Roth, but the star in this film was, in my opinion, Walton Groggins. Honorable mentions go to Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Samuel L. Jackson.That brings me to the characters. It's not called The Hateful Eight for no reason. These are eight people trapped in a room in the middle of a blizzard in post-Civil War America, and not one of them has characteristics which redeem them. These are hateful, ignorant people, and though SLJ's character is probably meant to be for the message of the film, there isn't really a protagonist, at least not in the traditional sense of being the character you root for.But if Jackson's Major Marquis Warren is the protagonist, it's only in order to focus the film onto a commentary of racial tension in the U.S., past and present. The n-word is naturally dropped over and over, and there are one bad and two worse things Maj. Warren does that he justifies with the race card. He serves as a late 1800's Malcolm X, someone whom white men should and do fear. I'm not saying it's right, merely that I'm not in a position to judge. Let's put it this way: I assume we've all heard that history is in the hands of the victors? So for example, freedom fighters who fail in their mission are labeled terrorists. This could have easily been true for the colonists had they lost the American Revolution, but they didn't and got to label the monarchy tyrannical. So, with that in mind, let's together realize that white people throughout history have always been the victors. After emancipation, even after Civil Rights, rich and therefore powerful white men have been able to put this spin on popular history that seems to apologize while also excusing their actions, precipitating further discrimination and simultaneously setting guidelines of behavior for future black Americans to follow. TH8 is definitely not MLK-political correctness-friendly. But that's the point, for MLK is a figure whom we pretend to learn about in public school as a pacifist activist (which is not at all oxymoronic, duh, don't ask questions) while largely if not completely ignoring Malcolm X. This movie is frank, and invites honest, painful discussion, something that is conspicuously absent surrounding the issues today.The least significant but still relevantly applause-worthy aspect of this film is how gorgeous it is. It's quite an amazing accomplishment considering most of it takes place in one room, but the visuals are stunning.Give this film a chance and just enjoy it for what it is. Or don't, cry about having your white privilege shoved in your face, and/or watch something with all action and no substance, which is just about every single other Hollywood movie.Disclaimer: I'm a white woman.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Absolute snoozefest,"With no exaggeration, this is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. Way, waaay too long for a film with such little plot to offer. 3 hours of watching a group of people sitting around in a cabin, having pointless conversations that go on forever and walking around in the snow while they wait for a blizzard to go away. That's legitamitely what this movie is about. Everything about this just feels absolutely tedious. I've seen slow films before but the extent of slowness that this film reaches is just ridiculous, you need serious caffeine to be able to stay awake through this. Trust me when I say THIS. MOVIE. IS. SLOW. Very, very, unbelievably slow. You might be better off watching paint drying instead",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Decent flick for Tarantino fans.,"As someone who watches movies just as much to enjoy art as to be entertained, I enjoyed this movie. My friends who are casual movie fans and who view movies much less critically than myself, did not. The film is basically a who-dun-it with very few set pieces that would work much better as a play.Where to begin. I'll just throw out some technical aspects of the film and their respective rating. Plot 6.5/10 Screenplay and dialogue (in true Tarantino fashion) 8.75/10 Cinematography 8/10. Acting 8.5/10 Pacing 5.5/10It was honestly one of Tarantino's worse films. Perhaps this is because it didn't feel like a movie, but a stage production.The dialogue is all top-notch and carried the rather weak plot and pacing. The movie ran about 30 minutes too long, and was even self- indulgent at times.There are highly political undertones throughout the film, and race is a major device used in the film that is set shortly after the civil war, so if that sort of thing upsets you, skip it.Although the main characters were fully developed, I found myself not caring about any of them. None of them were likable, or even remotely relatable. They were, however, interesting.This is my first review, so I know it's all over the place. But to sum it up--I'd only recommend this film to people who truly enjoy movies as art and story telling devices. Even then, I'd say skip it in theaters and watch it at home. I was let down overall with the film, however I still recognized that it was decently crafted and worth at least 6.5 stars. Not Tarantino's best, as it lacked the style of his earlier films and was way less compelling, but still worth watching on a rainy afternoon at home..",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A must-see for fans of the western genre,"The Hateful Eight is an amazing movie that no fan of the western genre (especially spaghetti westerns) should miss. The twist is that while everything is in the tone of a spaghetti western with intentionally clichéd characters like the silent cowboy, the bounty hunter, ""the Mexican"" and the grumpy old racist officer, they are all put in a claustrophobic setting reminiscent of The Thing. The pacing of the movie is also quite slow and deliberate, where nothing seems to happen for long stretches of time while still being wholly enjoyable to watch thanks to the cinematography and the atmosphere.Now there is a lot of criticism directed at this movie. The criticism of the movie's pace and gory content is a matter of taste and subjectively depends on one's take on standard Tarantino fare. While such criticism is justified, most complaints about the movie revolve around the fact that it is offensive and that it does not ""really have a message"" while dealing with complex social issues. Now the thing to keep in mind is that this movie deliberately features horrible and racist people, who act exactly like horrible and racist people would act in the 19th century in the Old West. There are three issues to consider here:is there something wrong with a movie featuring evil, horrible and intentionally shallow characters (meant to work as caricatures of standard western tropes)?if such characters are cast, is it wrong to expect that they should say offensive things and act in an offensive manner (and thus be in character)?should a movie dealing with social issues such as race and gender necessarily ""say"" something about it?The answer to all three of these questions is, of course, a big no. The best way to deal with a social issue in film is to show it, portray it for what it was. The idea with The Hateful Eight is that race relations in America were/are utterly messed up with no clear good and evil. We can see this in the ""oppressed"" female character also being racist, the black character who is the recipient of most insults in the movie also being a terrible person and in the sweet black lady running the shop also being racist (towards Mexicans). If one is necessarily looking for a concise ""message"" or a satisfying conclusion, it can be that the only two intelligent characters in the movie are the black character and the female character.So I believe most of the criticism at its purported offensiveness and pointlessness is flat out wrong because it all fits in the movie's own logic. The Hateful Eight is simply a great western movie and also a great murder mystery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Hateful Film,"Quentin Tarantino's latest project is as overdrawn as it is paper thin. Across his eclectic and at times hit or miss career he has stayed consistent with memorable dialogue, except of course for the abysmal Deathproof, yet here it seems aimless, unsure of where it's going and repetitive. How many times can one bare hearing a discussion around bad coffee or a broken door. This is the third installment of Tarantino's pseudo-historical film trilogy, and it hits a new low.The narrative circulates around a series of misfit, detestable characters all hold up in a cabin during a blizzard. Over the course of their time there we slowly learn more about them and see their distrust for each other grow as the violence escalates. Anyone familiar with Tarantino's work will see the similarity between this and his original film Reservoir Dogs, showing how far he has come on a technical level of filmmaking. Shot in 70mm, this is perhaps his most gorgeous film to date, the sparse landscape shots make use of the 70mm in a way that begs you to see more and escape the three hour confinement of the cabin. One can only hope Tarantino utilises 70mm again before his non-retirement in a narrative that better suits it, with a script that is more worthy of it.One of the highlights is the original score by Ennio Morricone, taking inspiration from his earlier work on 1982's The Thing (for obvious reasons that don't just include both films featuring Kurt Russell) this is some of his best work in years. Tarantino has often said how he and Morricone have wanted to collaborate; the results elevate the film, amplify the tension and setting to enhance the film as a whole. While it never reaches the highs of what inspired it, this is a score worthy of listening outside of the film itself, and that in many ways is the highest success a film score can achieve.A main and perhaps the most subjective criticism on the film is just how particularly repulsive the characters of this film are. While it is to be expected considering the amply named title, there is zero relatability because of it. From the very beginning you are hoping these character will just off themselves and be done with it, not just to wrap up the outrageously long runtime, but also for the good of humanity. While Tarantino's characters have never been praised for their good-naturedness, they are often multi-layered enough to engage with and relate too. The characters of Reservoir Dogs are a prime example of how Tarantino can write bad characters while they remain people we can understand. Here however we are left with a cold feeling of neutrality over the fate of these men, while performances are across the board great and committed, they are never likable. Not only are they unmemorable but you'll actively want to forget them.If Deathproof is Tarantino's worst, then this comes somewhere in the middle of his filmography. This isn't an actively bad film, Deathproof was utterly vacuous and without merit which would make this simply forgettable and derivative of his work. Tarantino is at risk of becoming a parody of himself; prepare to roll your eyes during the opening credits when 'The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino' comes into frame. The level of pretension and self-congratulation there alone is palpable. This isn't even taking into account a quick search through his career will reveal that this is far from an accurate statement. We paid twice for Kill Bill, its two films.This is disappointing, I wanted so much to enjoy this; I wanted to be able to defend it and say 'hey, it's great, it's like The Thing in Western times', but I can't. As a Quentin Tarantino film this doesn't completely fail, hard-core fans will enjoy this but many will see it as the tedious moral torpor it is. Regardless of how you may view Tarantino and this films questionable race and gender politics, this is a film I won't be returning to anytime soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Long but Entertaining,"The three hour running time is a bit much, but every shot is interesting in this marathon of a western. Quentin Tarantino uses his usual sarcastic language throughout, giving a great cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson great lines to spew out with sneering venom at each other. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh are particular standouts, and Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern make for the ensemble who shine brightly, and viciously reading Tarantino's badass vernacular which we have heard before. The story is the basic western one, with influences from Bonanza on the small screen to Sergio Leone's from the big screen; particularly ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; Tarantino's favorite movie. Major Warren hitches a ride with John Ruth(Russell) who is handcuffed to his $10,000 bounty, Daisy(Leigh), on their way to Red Rock and payment for delivery to the hangman. A blizzard forces them to stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, where the eight come together for intrigue and a bloody finale very similar to ""Reservoir Dog's"", Tarantino's directorial debut from 1993.

The Good...The Bad...and the Ugly,"1. THE GOOD: The cinematography which was completed in 60-70mm made for such a wonderful viewing experience for the audience that you have to watch the film simply for the luscious landscape and wide(er) screen vision that director Quentin Tarantino used with 60 year old camera lens to enhance the picture for his viewing audience. The abundance of so many quality actors in one film was especially a welcomed treat as well. Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir and Tim Roth all added to the films star quality.Consensus: I have not seen such fantastic picture quality in widescreen 70mm format since the 1968 film classic Ice Station Zebra. Additionally, Ennio Morricone won an Oscar for the film's music score which Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed.2. THE BAD: A lot of Samuel L Jackson's dialogue went on far longer than required as did some of the dialogue of the other co-stars. Samuel L Jackson played bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren.Consensus: The continued windy dialogue sequences caused the film to lose some of its intended suspense such that Ms. Shullivan turned to me half way through the film and asked how many chapters were in the film?3. THE UGLY: Kurt Russell played bounty hunter John Ruth, ""The Hangman"", and he was travelling by stagecoach to a town called Red Rock to deliver his captor, murderess Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who had a $10,000 bounty on her head wanted dead or alive. Although bounty hunter nicknamed The Hangman was known for bringing his captors in alive so that he could watch them hang he just about killed poor Daisy before he would reach Red Rock with his continued physical beatings with his fists, elbows, and the butt end of his gun leaning harshly into her bloodied face.Consensus: The de-humanizing of the only female star in the film captor Daisy Domergue set back the woman's movement 50 years. Although Jennifer Jason Leigh received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her captor's role Mrs. Shullivan and I both took offense to the unnecessary brutality and continued beatings she absorbed. Having beef stew thrown all over her face, receiving the butt end of a gun to bloody her face and forehead, punched repeatedly by both bounty hunters was another unnecessary blow (no pun intended) to all real battered women. I for one did not feel her continued bloodied face entitled her to an Oscar nomination as her speaking lines were limited, not warranted of an Oscar nomination, and not core to the films plot which was to determine who was the gunmen trying to free murderess Daisy Domergue? The film seemed more intended to appeal to some viewers sick desire of seeing men batter women resulting in blood all over an ugly women's face.I must say that I enjoyed Quentin's prior western entry Django Unchained much more for its complete story line and entertainment value than The Hateful Eight which was a tad bit longer than necessary but still good enough that I want to purchase a Blu Ray copy for future viewing as we love Quentin Tarantino's complete body of work.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"The Longest, but Perhaps Best-Told (not best) of Tarantino's Films","The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's latest play on genre, his first ""true"" western. Borrowing from classic Hollywood story-telling, and from Westerns in particular, The Hateful Eight has what might be called Tarantino's most mature and developed plot (though mature is not how I would describe the movie). This development comes at the cost of brevity, and this maturity comes at the cost of some of the fun that one expects from Tarantino, so how one views this film really will dependant on one's values as it concerns his films. It almost feels less like a Tarantino film, and more like a traditional film made with Tarantino's style. As well, the pacing in the film's first half is slower than his usual pace, but this is not wasted time, as the first half's scenes are still great, and the build-up really pays off in the second half. I for one (a big fan of his work), thought it was excellent, though it's lesser amount of fun does place it behind his very best work. The technical aspects are executed perfectly, and if you have the opportunity see it in 70mm. Glorious is exactly what it is, and the technology is excellently utilized. Not just beautiful in its stunning landscapes, the film uses the very wide aspect ratio in many two-shots and uses the space well in multiple planes in other shots to keep several objects on screen simultaneously. The acting was great by all in the relatively small cast, with no weak links. The musical score was great, as was the production design, which brought the film's primary locale to life. Slightly less entertaining, but more developed, than what I expect from a Tarantino film, The Hateful Eight may not be exactly what I was expecting when I walked in, but I left the theatre having seen a visual experience, had a lot of fun, and having seen a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
buckets of blood,"And we wonder why there are so many mass shootings in America!Tarantino takes the unlimited pursuit of freedom of expression beyond sanity in this brutal gorefest. No matter how many times Mr Obama gets up and says that the killing must stop, it will never end as long as this sort of stuff is produced as entertainment. In a normal, sane world, Tarantino would be identified as a psychopath for having written and produced such murderous mayhem, but America is not such a place. They lionize him and march him triumphantly down Hollywood Boulevard, with as good a chance as anyone of picking up a golden statue at the end of the route. The theatre should have provided vomit bags because there are so many anti-peristaltic scenes that it's inevitable that someone's gonna upchuck before the show is over. The strange thing is that there were NO gasps of revulsion from the audience through the whole length of the screening.Are we inured to such violence as a society?So why do I rate it a ten?Well, it is a perfect and excellent example of what is wrong with a society where guns and violence are glorified. Once you accept the film for what it is and get over the fact that you're actually watching it instead of volunteering at the food bank, you realize that it is tour de force of acting and production. All of the main characters are powerhouses of evil,with the secondary roles the personification of wholesomeness. Tarantino engineers a very clever juxtaposition of these human qualities with the way he structures the story, and the scriptwriting is just superb underneath the bloody and horrific mess. It is amazing that Mr T manages to weave some of the most politically incorrect language and culturally unacceptable behaviour into characters and make them almost endearing to the audience. Kurt Russell, Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Jennifer Jason Leigh give fantastic performances but everyone in the cast is excellent. If I ruled the world, stuff like this would never make the screen but I don't and so I have to understand that the aforementioned freedom of expression trumps everything else.

I really enjoyed this film and appreciated the masterful storytelling.First of all, I feel that Tarantino is an inspired genius whose storytelling tactics and cinematic approaches that defy mainstream filmmakers and movie goers.I am a huge fan of rare, cult, abstract, art house and exploitation films. Tarantino pays homage to these unique and misunderstood genres through his artistic creations.I had already seen Foxy Cleopatra, Enter the Ninja and every Sergio Leone spaghetti western before I even knew who Tarantino was in high school.If you don't recognize these titles, then you will not like Tarantino's films.The Hateful Eight's story seems to be written by a playwright who weaves together mysterious characters, surprising plot twists and conflicting Hitchockian Macguffins.This film is best for people who enjoy the surreal experience of sharp cinematography and a visually powerful story.I highly recommend this film and all of Tarantino's other successful films.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
delightful,"imagine the music of bullets in the desolate plains of Wyoming... the bloody smell of despair and bitter taste of hopelessness. I really don't understand the critics of this film. It is Tarantino's classic. too much violence ? really, cause this is the trademark of his films. The violence has to be final, irrevocably omnipresent and nonlinear. It is the same as in Pulp Fiction, there are only 2 squads of us : butchers and the victims. And even in Pulp Fiction there is no way to go beyond the Violence - except the spiritual Way which is only postulated - the miracle is required to change the Way of the World. This film is different - it is more real - as in Inglourious Bastards - the circle of Violence is closed. you can't escape from it. The innocent die and are forgotten. The butchers kill the innocent and than kill themselves in the rage of cruelty. I really liked this film - all characters are rotten and spoiled.

"Flawed, fun in places","If Quentin Tarantino has achieved anything in his love letters to the spaghetti western genre, it's his notable subtraction of the noodles from aforementioned dish, leaving decadent swaths of scarlet marinara sauce to be flung about the screen as blazing bullets rock various characters to their bones, sending blood all over the place in quantities that defy physics or biology. He did it with Django, and he does it again with The Hateful Eight, a somber, simmering snow opera that fell just south of winning me over entirely. Don't get me wrong: there's much merit to be found here, and as usual QT has a solid gold ear for dialogue that is as pleasing to the ear as Ennio Morricone's unusually restrained, palm sweating score. He also shows his uncanny knack for chasing awesome actors out of the woodwork and casting them in his films. In his attempts to resurrect 70mm panavision he has achieved undisputed success. I'm also a sucker for both Agatha Christie style mysteries and snowbound locations (and what locations!!), both of which are in abundance here. And yet.. something just didn't quite click for me, story wise. Perhaps it's the fact that trailers had worked my imagination up to impossible heights of intrigue that couldn't be brought to the table with this tale. In that regard, I suppose it's my own fault. In any case, the eventual revelations just didn't feel as profound and fitting after having sat through the endless, tantalizing set up. But oh, what a set up. QT deliberately marinates his characters in a stew of unease and malcontent, each player a grizzled picture of vague evil intent, firing missiles of distrust and loathing at one another until the ill will is as thick as the snow drifts they fight through. In the throes of a gathering blizzard, bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell in a sly nod of the head to beloved R.J. Macready, only saltier and far meaner) leads shackled prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh in the best performance of the film) to the town of Red Rock, to be hung. Along the way, and with much chatter, he picks up two stragglers: pissy fellow hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L.Jackson) and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). They arrive at Minnie's Haberdashery, an oasis in the sea of winter, where four other undesirables have already shacked up in refuge: Owaldo Mobrey (Tim Roth earns his keep and then some) a self proclaimed hangman with some serious pep in his step, crusty confederate Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), Bob the Mexican (Demian Bichir is restrained comic perfection) and dangerous looking cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen, that gravel voiced wildcat, is always awesome). They all hunker down to ride out the storm and quickly begin to realize that one or more amongst them isn't who they say they are, and there's devilry afoot. Sound intriguing? It did to me too, and I can't say much about what exactly let me down without giving stuff away, but it just felt like such a pedestrian knockoff of a second act after the absolute slow burning joy of a guessing game which preceded it. Maybe it's a bit like a Christmas present: you spend months in a giddy daze wondering what you'll get, you get there Christmas morning and there your present is: shiny, gleaming and filled with endless possibility, but unmistakably shaped by your specific anticipation of what lays within. You open your present... and there it is, mystery evaporated, no longer a present but an actual object, or in this case a story that you must wrestle with to appease the lingering wonder of what you expected, as opposed to what you got. I know it's too much to expect every film to be that perfect Christmas present that is as satisfying wrapped as unwrapped, but with QT's stuff I feel I always act that way a bit, having pictured my definitive version of the films before having seen them, and feelng somewhat underwhelmed. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it: It's chock full of macabre surprises, earnest performances and expectedly nasty violence. Jennifer Jason Leigh owns as Daisy, a frothing feral beast. Leigh has no shortage of courage in taking on courageous, unflattering roles, and she dives right into this one with fists and teeth clenched, eyes narrowed and a steely will to survive. It's truly a blessing to see her on the big screen again and I hope to see more in the future. There's one casting decision which almost ruined the last act for me. I won't spoil it here but the 'actor' in question is so unbelievably untalented and sticks out like ten sore thumbs in his ineptitude, really making me wonder about QT's sanity. The rest of the cast makes up for it in spades though, particularly Madsen, Roth and Russell. Goggins also gets loads to do and does it with grinning flair that would make Boyd Crowder proud. The cinematography by legendary Robert Richardson is staggeringly beautiful. The wintry Vistas sweep by in splendor, eventually moving inward to the firelit cabin where everything has a burnished, lived-in texture that's transfixing to look at. If only the story had the weight and impact I was expecting, I could have given this glowing accolades, but there's always next time. Gorgeous Tarantino outing with a cast that chomps at the bit relentlessly, and although it ultimately falls short, it's quite the piece of cinema all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Cinema at it's best,"In short,Tarantino has done it again. It's great to see Tarantino evolve over the years and polishing up his art. And art is it!If you like Tarantino, go watch it! Some of his ""fans"" claim to be disappointed by his 8th film, but I wonder if these people actually know what Tarantino is about.For me it's one of his better movies, ""Kill bill"" and ""From dusk till dawn"" could not interest me so much, but when this movie was over it only felt like a 2 hours, didn't lose my attention for a second.

Every other movie on planet Earth: Entertainment | Quentin Tarantino movie: Poetic Entertainment,"What is film if not a portal to another world, where rules are imagined by one master creator, with a point to escape from the only reality to another fantasy.Many critics deemed this film ""too long"". They would much rather stick to the 90 minutes prestige movies about wall street thieves, bankers, single-parent mothers, one-dimensional silly action packed scraps and PC 'for-the-sake-of-reputation' stories that the world is bandwagoning like Gastarbeiters on minimum wage.I like to see ""The Hateful Eight"" as a two act movie, where, in the first one Quentin Tarantino gets comfortable with his scribbling, and by scribbling, I mean amazing writing, in which characters talk and talk and talk and don't mistake it for boredom, one iota. It's captivating. But in the second... it explodes into hateful violence, where some of it were done just for the sake of it. That's how these characters are ruthless, selfish and in many ways unpredictable.The Ennio Morricone score jump starts the movie and one of the things that I love in a Tarantino movie are the opening credits. ""Little Green Bag"" reveals the Reservoir Dogs title, ""Misirlou"" reveals the Pulp Fiction title, ""Across 110th Street"" reveals Jackie Brown a-la ""The Graduate"", ""Bang Bang"" reveals Kill Bill, ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" reveals Inglorious Basterds (personally my favorite opening credits of a Tarantino film, and perhaps of all time), ""Django"" reveals Django and finally, Morricone doesn't blast with horns or loud string quartets, but slowly dissects the puzzle and invites you to see the violence that is to come. With big, bold, western yellow font and orange shadows: THE HATEFUL EIGHT.The film hasn't started and it's already Tarantino. It goes in the top 4 Tarantino films, most definitely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino Delivers Another Classic,"Do not believe this movie to be a typical western. This movie is something much more. The Hateful Eight, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, is unique and beautiful with its intense drama and overly clever dialogue, as well as its incredible original score by Ennio Morricone. The plot, somewhat reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs (another Tarantino classic), brings back the classic 'who done it?' scenario and ultimately Tarantino makes it his bitch. Walton Goggins, who plays Sheriff Chris Mannix and my favourite character in this movie, pulls out his best performance yet and one must still hate the character he portrays - out-performing an actor such as Samuel L. Jackson in the process. Nobody in this deserves to live but the ensemble of murderers come together and showcase so much true deceit, and raw emotion. And even though it is not considered an action movie The Hateful Eight still produces some of the most entertaining action sequences whether they're verbal or physical. Once again Quentin Tarantino creates yet another masterpiece and personally I believe this to be his best work yet, even better than Pulp Fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

As a Tarantino fan... This is disappointing.,"I like to read reviews that hold a certain weight to them. There are a lot of amateur critics in the world that seem to jump at any chance to skewer a director for their perceived failure. There are also a lot of people with bad movie taste that think they are the cream of the crop when rating movies for the wrong reasons.I'm not trying to group myself with any of these people... I'm simply here to tell you that I found the movie boring and the acting forced..Of course, I've seen a lot of great movies where the main actors depend on the success of the film to define their careers. What I'm seeing in this movie though, is a lot of established actors going through the motions to collect a paycheck and an equally established director lose sight of why he makes movies in the first place.I don't know what went wrong with the movie to tell you the truth. Maybe it was the geographical stagnation that displeased me. I'm used to seeing a lot of different settings in a Tarantino film. But this one just kind of, hovered in the same boring spot. The first Evil Dead movie did the same, but at least it went all out to distort the visual and auditory perception of the viewer, making every scene interesting.Unfortunately this movie focused on some sort of pre-Freudian intellectual dialogue that no one can relate to.I really had high hopes for this movie and hoped that it would be on the level of Inglorious Basterds or Kill Bill... But it was too slow, led by a lazy and boisterous Samuel L. Jackson and a robotic Walter Goggins.I wish that Tarantino just made the Vega Brothers movie instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A real treat and amazing script,"It's weird to see haters reviewing this with 1 star.

The story doesn't need to be overly complex but if you pay attention there are a ton of details to pick up on. Especially on a second viewing. There is violence but it's far from disgusting. It brings some exciting scenes to a one set film.I think this is one of Tarantino's best, similar to Reservoir Dogs.

Excessive but Not With Great Results....Still,"When all is said and done, this is really a murder mystery.

Also, the cargo includes a couple bounty hunters and a woman who is being taken to be hanged. There are four other characters who get into the act as well. Soon there is a lot of deep intellectual talk about justice and law and order from people who know violence as a constant companion. Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself as the principal figure (a black man who fought for the North in the Civil War). He says he has a valid letter from President Lincoln, complementing his service. The woman is a piece of work to say the least. She is vulgar and crude and gets her bell rung on more than one occasion by her captor (played by Kurt Russell, who does quite good John Wayne vocal impression). The acting is good and we are led all over the landscape, trying to figure where this is going to go.

Mixed Bag !!,"I'm a big fan of Tarantino's work and my favorite is Pulp Fiction.So after enjoying Inglorious Basterds and Django, I waited patiently for this movie. When I saw the trailer, my mouth was watering. And alas last weekend, I saw the film and my final says its a mixed bag.Frankly, I initially left the theatre happy and satisfied but as a week passed by I realized that I was also disappointed with movie and Tarantino's writing. I saw somewhere some potential being wasted.The plot of actually 9 and not 8 strangers all waiting in an inn for the blizzard to calm down is very delicious on paper. However, Tarantino takes a lot of time setting up the stage.The story is divided into 6 chapters and you will need patience to sit through chapter 1 to 3 because the story is not moving; its building up. And when chapter 4 starts, the movie picks up speed.So I was disappointed with the first 3 chapters because the dialogues are flat. It lacks the sharpness seen in Tarantino's movies. Its also a bit long and one will become restless. Some of the characters are interesting and some are not at all.Tarantino also throws in parts which focus on the white man vs, black man relationship in the US which is actually a pointer to the current challenges the US Society is facing.All the actors perform exceptionally well. However, the star of the movie is Jennifer Leigh. She is just brilliant and deserves an Oscar Nomination.And like his previous fiim, in this film to justice will be served in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Another classic from Tarantino,"I have waited to watch this movie for a long time. As I hail from India and as the Indian Censor Board is so concerned about the ""Indian culture"" being ""tainted"" by Hollywood movies that they don't release R-rated movies in India, so I had to wait because the name of the game here is PATIENCE.This is one of the best movies set in an indoor set-up. The movie is claustrophobic. Each person has a past and Tarantino makes you feel you are there right inside Minnie's Habadashery. It's almost a amalgamation of Reservoir Dogs and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's a FILM. A film which has been crafted with the care and respect with which movies should be made and I am always in awe that how confident Tarantino is that his concept of movies will always work, and it does. Nowadays movies have become short, to the point and in a way has shortened our tenacity to be patient but then comes Tarantino with a plot which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Well truth be said, the plot is very simple but it is the narration that keeps it interesting.The plot is that Sam L.Jackson is a retired war veteran turned bounty hunter who happens to come into the path of Kurt Russell who is taking a woman to hang. Due to a blizzard they have to make a pit stop at a inn so that they can wait till the blizzard passes by. At the inn waits 4 unknowns already, each of whose past is unknown. Sam and Kurt form a circle of trust as they start suspecting the four boarders in the inn.Everybody carries out their parts in the best manner but the whole movie mainly rests on the shoulders of Samuel L. Jackson. Watch the movie alone for a monologue by him. It is riveting. It made me crawl away from my laptop screen. I think Channing Tatum was a miscast in this perfectly made film. A better actor would have probably nailed the role within the given screen time.It is a Tarantino classic. If you have watched Tarantino's movies and are used to his style of movie making you are sure to love this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A perfect combination between Django unchained and Reservoir Dogs...,"The Hateful Eight is one of the best films that Tarantino has created and its strong and unique element is its script.The Hateful Eight boasts The best screenplay that Tarantino has written, persons who do not fully know Tarantino style probably the be something slow and heavy, but those who know completely this director is a pleasure to listen to each character, their conversations and his monologues.In general, all the actors are brilliant and no doubt Jennifer Jason Leigh will take a nomination Oscar for his brilliant performance (especially in the scene of his speech) The Hateful Eight is made in the style of Tarantino, in the time in which he was directing ""pulp Fiction"" and writing ""Kill Bill"", that is to say, the old school of Tarantino.It is also important to mention that it is the most bizarre Film Tarantino, here violence is more real and more raw and much more cruel than any other Tarantino film (Yes, surpasses even Kill Bill in the brutal), but violence is accompanied by incredibly humorous moments, a very black, but totally fun humor. The return of Ennio Morricone is masterful, epic, unique and amazing and surely takes Oscar for best original score.In conclusion, I would say: The Hateful Eight is one of the best films of Tarantino and one of the best this year, I'm completely sure that Tarantino will have a nomination Oscar for his incredible script, like Jennifer Jason Leigh for her incredible performance and the maestro Ennio Morricone for his incredible music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's bloody western chamber piece is more Agatha Christie than Sergio Leone or John Ford,"Terrific western from writer/director Quentin Tarantino is unexpectedly more Agatha Christie than John Ford. Bounty Hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth, played by the always wonderful and sadly underused Kurt Russell, is taking in wanted criminal Daisy Domergue, the also amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh, to hang. However, a blizzard forces them to hold up at a way station with a band of nefarious types, one or more of whom aren't who they say they are and are likely looking to free Daisy. In ""And Then There Were None"" fashion, character begin to get offed, and to reveal much more of the plot would ruin the fun of the film. Like most Tarantino films, this one is likely not going to be for all tastes, even if the film features a stellar cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson as a fellow bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tarantino even casts Matt Houston himself, Lee Horsley, as a stagecoach driver, great plotting, terrific suspense, shocking moments of violence, and as you would expect from a Tarantino film, some incredibly sharp dialogue. Comparing this film to Tarantino's other work, this one seems closest to ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the sense that it's a bunch of characters stuck in a confined space doing a lot of talking and tough guy posturing, leading up to a bloody climax. And boy it is a wildly bloody climax, courtesy of special effect maestro Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. But since Dogs, Tarantino has matured as a director and continues to top himself each time out, branching out and challenging himself with something new and different with each new film and ""The Hateful Eight"" is no different. Also of note, the film features composer Ennio Morricone's first western score in many years and also his first American film score in quite some time (his last was ""Ripley's Game"" in 2002). It's a strangely moody score when I was expecting a score filled with crazy stings and whistles, ALA Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci. Morricone's score is more along the lines of his score for John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" which this film actually uses some tracks from. But the highlight of nearly all of Tarantino's film is his dialogue and this film features more verbal sparring matches than any of his films, which is endlessly delightful. From the his first film, with Mr. White and Mr. Blond facing each other down (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?""), it was clear that Tarantino knew how to use dialogue to build tension, and his skills have only gotten better since then. The way characters play with one another, trying to outsmart and outwit one another is endlessly watchable. And upon a second viewing of the film and the dialogue can be reinterpreted and takes on new meaning once the audience knows character motivations and where the story is heading. Thematically, I think Tarantino has always played with genres but with this film is commenting on modern race relations through this tale of violent bounty hunters in a post-Civil War old west. It's the racial tensions following the Civil War that Tarantino uses to put the ugly views on race front and center that you can today hear on cable news or read online just about anytime you want. Of all his films, this one seems his most mature and I think arguable his best. Still, like most of his film, they are not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a film buff, Tarantino's film vocabulary that he infuses into each of his films is utterly intoxicating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Good,"The Hateful Eight is a dialogue driven film that is highly entertaining and enthralling enough. Of Tarantino's films, this ranks up there with the best, and in the recent years it is better than both Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained...by a mile, and they were pretty good. I guess the question isn't if this movie is or was good, but rather where it stands and ranks in Tarantino's best. I would put it just below Pulp Fiction, and just above Kill Bill Vol. 1, about tied with Jackie Brown, but surprisingly slightly better. It is definitely one of his best. Don't listen to the negative reviews. This is definitely a good film and I went in to watching it skeptical because I heard some criticism. One of the biggest was the length, but I actually didn't notice it really. It's long, but you just have to put up with it.

The Hateful Reviewers,"Hmm, I don't know what the people who have given this 1s and 2s were watching (or smoking), but 'The Hateful Eight' deserves at least half marks based on the dialogue, acting and cinematography alone, all of which were first class. To completely write a film off and give it 1 star because the story didn't meet your expectations is just stupid.Tarantino's latest film is predictably violent and, perhaps even more predictably, long. Most of this three hour movie is set in one location, and yet the dialogue and relationship between the characters is plenty enough to keep it entertaining. I've sat through films half the running time that felt longer than this.'The Hateful Eight' does too many things too well to be disregarded, as it has been by many.

Near perfection western noir,"As many others, I'm a big QT fan. Besides David Lynch and Kubrick, no one makes a movie more special. I'll easy rank HF8 among his top 3 best movies. What he experimented on in Inglorious Basterds, the chapters, he made to perfection in this. It's like watching a chamber play of whodonit, with the obvious Tarantino humour intact. The door which blows up, with everyone yelling how many planks you got to use to close it. ""Two nails isnt enough, you need THREE"". The big revelation isnt the movie's payoff. It's the small interactions. Like Walton Goggins snarly replies to Sam Jackson. Or specially the wonderfull Jennifer Jason Leigh as one bigmoathed, nasty gang leader. It turns the tables midways, becoming a kind of Hitchcocks ""Rope"", were Kurt Russell is suspicious of just about everyone. Great movie, except for one glaring mistake that irritated me. The light trough the tables. Yes, if you pay attention, Tarantino has made artificial light, like a stage play. And it feels like a very cheap way to make your attention turn to whatever Tarantino has up his sleeve next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino does it again,"I've never considered myself a Quentin Tarantino fanatic, but I have to admit that I find most of his films highly enjoyable and this one is no exception, undoubtedly a worthy addition to his illustrious catalogue.The movie starts and we are out in the wild. The scenery is hostile but nonetheless gorgeous in typical Western fashion. It's so well done you feel you'll start freezing at any moment. The opening scene already sets the tone: erratic characters, suspicion, secrets, dirty mouths and of course a gunfight is always round the corner.By the way, style over substance is a common criticism regarding Tarantino's work and while it's true The Hateful Eight is dazzlingly stylish, this doesn't detract from the story - quite the contrary, it makes for even more compelling storytelling. There are very few moments where the Tarantino touch would qualify as over the top or unnecessary.One defining feature of the movie is that more or less in its entirety takes place in one room, a risky choice on paper, which definitely works here, as it creates interesting dynamics between this group of seemingly random characters who are busy trying to survive the frost and solve an Agatha Christie type of mystery. It's fascinating watching the tension reach a boiliing point, a bloodbath waiting to happen.Every character has an interesting background on his own, but it's the interactions between them that elevate the movie to the next level. This is achieved mostly through dialogue, one of the movie's highlights. Punchlines are fyling left and right, people start ranting and raving out of nowhere, while the occasional socio-political commentary adds another element. There are also non-verbal details, amplified by the fabulous cast. Even though it's hard to sympathise with any of them - they are hateful, indeed - they are presented in a three dimensional way that invites you to see their point of view and try to understand their state of mind and guess their motives.Ennio Morricone delivers as usual, though the music is not one the first things that stand out, one could argue his presence is rather thin.The movie totally justifies its relatively long running time, as it flows effortlessly and doesn't drag at any point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"The best of Quentin Tarantino, THAT I HAVE SEEN.","""The Hateful Eight""*NO Spoilers*The Hateful Eight is one of those movies that is longer than you wish it was. But that does not necessarily mean that it's bad. The movie is divided in six chapters and the best ones are in the beginning and in the middle, which is not a bad choice, as you may think. Rather, it is good because it keeps you hooked!This movie took me by surprise. Reading the plot/premise and catching glimpses of this movie before watching it made me believe this is one of those movies that deal with a lot of action and violence. But, to my astonishment, it's not. A MAJOR part of this movie is drama. People talking, recounting stories, most of which has a purpose. Sometimes, it's to amuse us, while other times, it is stuff that makes sense in the end. MOSTLY, it's character development. And like the title suggests, none of the characters are lovable. And again, that's NOT a bad thing.The dialogue here is REALLY witty. It's attention grabbing, sometimes humorous and NOT AT ALL boring. I never felt sleepy, even though it was way past my bedtime by the time it ended. Not once!I say it's the best of Quentin Tarantino I have watched because I've see only a few of his movies.I watched Reservoir Dogs a few years ago, and I found it to be good. But being more than 2 decades old, it felt the same. And I've seen Pulp Fiction, which was again, an okay, worth watching movie. And that's about it when it comes to Tarantino's movies that I've watched. (I guess)THIS, on the other hand, is not only a good movie, it actually made me long for more, despite it's already long duration. I actually got so interested in the characters' lives, that I wanted more. It's one of those movies that if I come across on TV someday, I'm not going change the channel.The next Tarantino's flick I'm going to watch will be Django Unchained, because a friend of mine says, ""If you liked this, you'll LOVE that"".

Instead it's a good alternative for ValiumI've seen better ""Alias Smith and a Jones "" episodes. But because it's Tarantino, it's dawned over by the critics and his fans,who will never admit what a pile of tripe this movie is. Full of pretentious beauty shits and over written dialog that goes on forever. Why is it that some Directors get a pass on every thing they do, and their movies are judged on a different scale. If anyone else had made this boring pile of dreck, they would have been skewered.No wonder theaters didn't want to free up any screens for this.And the ending is lame as well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Spoiler free review, Hateful Eight","The Hateful Eight takes place about a decade or so after the civil war, and follows the story of John Ruth the hangman( played excellently by Kurt Russell). Where he captures a bounty worth 10,000 dollars( Daisy Domergue, played by Jenneifer Leigh) which was a large sum back in that day. On there journey to there destination they pick up mysterious passengers along the way, eventually a blizzard arrives causing there stage coach to go off course. Where they eventually end up in a cabin with more unfamiliar faces.We have been able to see Tarantino's fixating dialogue in movies such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and basically anything he has made; but this movie does it best. What you want is what you get with this movie, another Tarantino masterpiece. I absolutely loved the Hateful Eight. Aside from Star Wars, this is going to be the most fun you have in a movie in 2015. This movie is filled with substance and feeling that was basically oozing from the screen. This movie is extremely tension filled from beginning to end. This is all made possible by Tarantino's incredible screenplay, and its no wonder its nominated for best screenplay(Golden Globes). The entire movie you question who is good and who is bad, who is on who's side,which made it a mystery for the characters and the audience. It created so much tension, that I found my self clinching my fists throughout the entire second half of the film. Another thing that adds tension to this thriller is the original score done by the the famous Ennio Morricone.Lastly this film relies heavily on acting, since there is a lot of dialoug in this movie. And everyone does an incredible job in this movie. I would not be surprised if Jennifer Leigh is nominated for best actress, since she stole the show in this one. The Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece,this movie keeps you captivated for the entire 2 hour and 47 minute run time. If your looking for your usual Tarantino violence right off the bat, then your not going to find it here, not to say there is not plenty of violence in the second half of the movie.In the end I loved the Hateful Eight, Tarantino fans will love it, and even people that don't like his work will love it. The screenplay, the acting, the directing, the original score all make this one of the best movies of the year(easily top 5), and one of Tarantino's best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino has done it again !,"Tarantino movies are known for their gorgeous cinematography, rich dialogs, great soundtrack and... violence ! And I'm happy to say that his 8th movie delivers on all of these aspects ! I saw the digital version, which is slightly shorter than the 70mm version. Still, at almost 3 hours, this movie takes its time. But it allows the director to set the stage right and to introduce each character properly. And it also let us appreciate the superb Oscar-nominated cinematography and witty dialogs.Tarantino movies are a bit of an acquired taste and this one is no different. You have to let yourself immerse into its world. Sure, some establishing shots could have been cut shorter (I have a feeling this is due to the Ultra Panavision format) but I loved every single minute of it ! There are clear similarities between this movie and Reservoir Dogs : it takes place almost entirely inside a building (be it a haberdashery or an abandoned warehouse) and the story revolves around guessing who's not what he says he is. It's also a bit reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little N-words"" (also known under the more politically correct title ""And Then There Were None""). I found the pacing and timing to be perfect : the slow build up to the first death, the reveal of who's who and the final act are all perfectly executed and very satisfying ! One thing I didn't expect was how funny this movie would be ! I found myself laughing for a good part of it thanks to deliciously witty lines and well written dialogs. I had almost forgotten that, on top of being the coolest tough guy actor, Jackson is also a great comedian ! It truly is a delight to hear Tarantino's dialogs being expertly delivered by Jackson, it's like music to the ear. The rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either, with amazing performances all around. Goggins and Leigh are especially funny and seem to really inhabit their role. It's no wonder that Leigh has been nominated for best supporting actress at this year's Academy Award.As far as the level of violence is concerned, I'm pretty sure that some people will complain about it, just like any of Tarantino's previous works. Sure, it's a bit gratuitous, but at the same time, just like Kill Bill, it is so unrealistic and over-the-top that it becomes slapstick. I didn't feel that it glorified violence, it made it look silly.After seeing ""The Hateful Eight"", I wondered when was the last time that I got disappointed by a Tarantino flick ? And I came to the conclusion that it simply never happened ! I'm amazed to see that after 8 movies he still got that magic touch ! Tarantino definitively is one of the five best directors out there and probably my favorite.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the score was slightly underwhelming compared to Tarantino's usual masterful selection of relatively unknown tracks. I also found Madsen to look a bit tired, mumbling through his lines, and Bell's hyperactive nature seemed out of place in this movie.Regardless, compared to the dread that hits the silver screen every year (I'm looking at you, superheroes movies and cheap remakes !), this film is a masterpiece and deserves an exceptional rating. I've rated more than 1100 movies on IMDb, and this is the 7th time I give a perfect score : 10 out of 10 !",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Another unforgettable Quentin Tarantino masterpiece!,"The Hateful Eight tells a story set in the post Civil War era. On a cold & stormy winter day in Wyoming, a lone stagecoach is racing through the snow. The stagecoach's passengers are, a bounty hunter named Major Marquis Warren(Samuel L. Jackson), a hangman named John Ruth(Kurt Russell), Ruth's prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh) & a man named Sheriff Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins). As the blizzard gets worse, the stagecoach stops at Minnie's Haberdashery. Major Warren, Ruth, Domergue & Mannix decide to stay at Minnie's Haberdashery till the blizzard subsides & it's safe for them to continue their journey. While at the Haberdashery, they meet four more people who are also staying there, till the snow storm ends. As the hours go by, the atmosphere becomes tense & not everyone is who they say they are.The Hateful Eight is a mind blowing film! Director Quentin Tarantino proves yet again, that he makes some of the boldest, most original & best films in Hollywood. This film has elements of comedy, action & drama. It is also extremely thrilling & there is a little bit of suspense thrown in, too. What's really interesting is that, since all the characters in the film are questionable, you really can't guess the true motives of anybody. Basically, The Hateful Eight has all the ingredients that make Tarantino movies, unforgettable classics. I would recommend you to give this one a miss if, you hate violence with tons of gore. The music by Ennio Morricone is perfect & sets the tone for the film. The performances are the highlight of the film. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as Major Marquis Warren. Jackson's performance as the treacherous major, is flawless & one of his best performances on celluloid. Kurt Russell is brilliant as John Ruth. Jennifer Jason Leigh is another standout performer as Daisy Domergue. Leigh portrays everything her imprisoned character goes through, effortlessly. Walton Goggins is outstanding as Sheriff Chris Mannix. Demian Bichir is good as Bob. Tim Roth is spectacular as Oswaldo Mobray. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage. Bruce Dern is fantastic as General Sandy Smithers. James Parks is impressive as O.B Jackson. Last but definitely not the least, Channing Tatum is superb in his short yet significant role, as Jody. The supporting characters are effective as well. The Hateful Eight is a must watch for all Tarantino fans & everyone who wants to watch one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Big Tarantino movie fan but disappointed with this one,"Quinton took a fantastic two hour script and stretched it over three hours play time. It has a great plot, great acting, great cinematography and all the usual goodies and quirks you can expect from a Tarantino movie/plot. However the fact that this movie was made unnecessarily long made it quite torturous to watch. It does manage to keep you attention, however there are many moments during the film where the next scene can be predicted. At a point, it almost felt like I was watching a documentary. I am pretty sure if it was not a very famous director/writer making this movie, it would not have received all the positive reviews.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not typical Tarantino, but still good","It seems that a lot of the negative reviews here have a theme of people comparing 'Hateful Eight' to other Tarantino flicks. If you do that and expect the same sort of movies he made in his younger years, you will be disappointed. Tarantino is one of those filmmakers whose very name gives a certain level of expectation to the viewer before walking into a theater (same goes for Scorcese, Coppola, etc). If the preconception isn't lived up to, he's crucified out-of-hand for making useless garbage. That's really too bad. If you're truly a Tarantino fan, then you won't mind the lengthy dialog and anything else other reviewers have ranted against. I guess I'd say that if you liked 'Death Proof', you'll like 'Hateful Eight.' I very much enjoyed this film, and would definitely recommend it if you're able to disassociate it from the name and just watch the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"One, if not the best Tarantino movie","*Warning, my review may contain spoilers*The plot is quite simple : 9 ( not 8 but 9 ) guys in a remote cabin, trying to get a shelter during the blizzard. But, it's very efficient. It will certainly become a classic Tarantino.Most of the fans are hating this movie. I don't know : maybe it's much too clever. But you find gore, a good scenario, humor and lots of swear words.

Excitingly realized but lengthy drama,"Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is characteristically expansive and brutal, maintaining his trademark style. The film's setting and atmosphere, achieved through high-quality, thoughtful cinematography, live up to expectations. The limited yet well-considered selection of characters allows the audience to follow the plot relatively easily, despite the initial confusion that arises with the rapid introduction of several new characters.While the storyline serves to weave a coherent thread through the narrative, it ultimately fails to shine. This leads to my main criticism: the film's opening is excessively lengthy, providing little information while stretching the runtime with superfluous detailed shots. Although the pacing improves later, the total length of 2 hours and 47 minutes is excessive for what is ultimately a straightforward story. True to form, the film includes numerous brutal scenes, making it unsuitable for the faint-hearted.Unfortunately, the film's conclusion also fails to impress, leaving me rather disappointed. Despite this, ""The Hateful Eight"" is not a bad film; it's simply an average one. The movie's attempt to balance style with substance doesn't quite meet the high expectations set by Tarantino's previous works, making it a middling entry in his filmography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Take off the Tarantino-Obsessed hat,"3 Stars.... Based on the fact that roughly 2/3 of the film is spent 'painting the picture'. The last 20-25 mins when things start happening it's actually quite good. But the hours of nothing up to that point are wasted.I appreciate a beautifully well crafted film as much as the next person but this can't be at the expensive of entertainment.If everybody took off their Tarantino-loving Tarantino-obsessed hats they'd realise that this film is below average. If anybody else had brought it out it would not be receiving such glorious praise.Much of his work is overrated, but who cares, he's managed to carve himself out a good career from some poor work - plenty of schmucks put far too much faith in what 'professional' reviewers say.

"Vicious, Intense and even a little Cartoony","The Hateful 8 had a lot to live up to. Tarantino has been delivering what are considered to be some of the best Cult Classics for years. They're so pop culturally relevant that they have been and still frequently are quoted, parodied and loved by fans all over. Personally I find Django Unchained to easily be one of my all-time favourite movies ever. So it's safe to say there were high expectations, I'm happy to say that The Hateful Eight reached those expectations.THE HATEFUL EIGHT REVIEW – JACK FITZPATRICKTo the core; this IS a Tarantino film. From the intense moments juxtaposed by the light conversations of unique dialogue to the wide shot cinematography. The Hateful Eight delivers on just about every note. You know those moments in Quentin Tarantino films where the tension is building constantly and it just keeps going until the scene erupts into a violent mayhem; Scenes like the 20 minute conversation in the beginning of Inglorious Basterds and the friendly dinner conversation in candy land which soon turns chaotic from Django Unchained. Well, the entirety of the Hateful Eight is one of these scenes. Trapped in a claustrophobic environment, the film follows a group of people caught in a blizzard. The characters begin to unfold throughout the movie and we see that they aren't always who they say they are, and are all capable of committing acts of brutality.Throughout the film, the characters spend quality time with one another while the tension escalates and the suspicions rise. Nobody can be trusted, and everybody is in it for something. It's up to the viewer to decide who they trust and who they do not and the film doesn't take sides. Characters get their fair share of screen time and this is basically an extended take of fantastic actors bouncing off of one another as their characters, often chewing the scenery and making the film their own. This being said, I definitely was on Samuel L Jackson's character's side for a lot of it, he was just so undeniably cool throughout. But all of the characters had a moment to shine in, and as I said, it's really up to you as a viewer to decide who you like or who you trust – The two don't necessarily coincide. Tim Roth, Kurt Russel and best of all Samuel L Jackson are returning cast for Tarantino movies and do their other roles justice. However, all of the characters in the film are fantastically written and well thought out. They all have their own stories and motivations and even if we don't like them or wish them to lose, we still understand why they are there and are doing what they are doing. The characters make sense. The writing makes sense, and that's important. The majority of the film is set in an old, partly run down cabin in the middle of a blizzard. Visually though, the film manages to stray far off of boring. I won't pretend I know too much about the 70mm, I'm no expert on aspect ratio or really practical filming in general, however I do watch A LOT of movies and I can appreciate the wide angles exposing characters in the background and the clarity of the film, revealing the tiniest of details such as the dust and snow falling through the air within the cabin throughout the movie. Something I loved about the movie as I mentioned above is that you can see other characters throughout it even when they are not the key focus in that particular scene. The film feels much like a stage play in that way, and it ups the stakes as important things can be happening in the background at any moment and the actors have to stay in character for the majority of the film. The movie doesn't shy away from keeping the background characters and set from staying consistent and logically present. Another element that must be mentioned when talking about any Tarantino film, but especially this one in particular is the violence. And I just have to say 'wow,' because this is one violent movie. Easily Tarantino's most brutal film to date, even beating out such scenes as The crazy 88 fight of Kill Bill and the cinema massacre of Inglorious Basterds; The Hateful Eight certainly earned it's R18+ rating. The film makes even gun combat feel close and personal. I will not spoil anything but I will say that not everybody makes it out alive by the end of the film, and the moments of human deduction are glorious. (Dare I say GORE-ious? Nah, I probably shouldn't actually.) The movie is extremely long, but copes without feeling like it's dragging. The film starts off slow for sure, but this isn't a bad thing. It needs to – This makes where it's headed that much more impactive. That being said the dialogue keeps up and doesn't slow down, and we get a feel of who the characters are and what their relationships are like or might become right off the bat. It never feels boring and once it really 'gets into it' You can't look away. The pacing is absolutely perfect and there's never a dull moment. The momentum keeps everything going steadily – only thing is, the movie's a car headed for a brick wall, and we as an audience sit there sadistically waiting for it all to wildly explode.The Hateful Eight is Vicious, funny, intense and even a little cartoon-y all while managing to stay serious in tone and suspenseful throughout. Competing closely to The Revenant, I suspect this movie will land as one of my top 10 movies of 2016.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant Tarantino as he parodies himself.  Ignore the critics.,"In which Quentin Tarantino sticks two fingers up to the American film industry and thinks to himself; if there's nothing else left to parody it's time to parody myself.Tarantino's films have increasingly taken themselves less and less seriously. Look back through his seven previous movies and you'll see that he started with a pretty full on, totally original, but relatively serious 'take' on Mean Street type hit men, mafia stooges and mobsters with his only real moment of pure humour being the Stealer's Wheel 'ear scene' in Reservoir Dogs..Pulp Fiction was a full blown paean to, um, pulp fiction and rather than reaching for the humour button instead drew entirely on style.Jackie Brown was a stunning tribute to blaxploitation and pulp fiction of a more cerebral kind, drawing as it did on Elmore Leonard's superior crime noir and was an instant classic.But Kill Bill 1 & 2 started to see Tarantino play games with his audience. This time he sought out humour as he dialled up the violence to ridiculous, but glorious, proportions drawing from Manga, Kung Fu, Bruce Lee, and Monkey to delight all who sailed with him. Death Proof I'll have to comment on only from reviews I've read. It pastiched B movies and Grindhouse. His descent into levity was beginning in earnest.Inglorious Basterds (war films) continued that journey and it reached new highs with the remarkable performance of Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained; this time Westerns being the genre of choice.It's perhaps a surprise to see him tackle the same genre two movies running as Westerns are the source of The Hateful Eight's inspiration but, for me, it's actually Tarantino that is the inspiration, because he's made a conscious decision to rip the p*** out of himself in this wondrous three hour epic. Every excess that Tarantino has brought to our screens in the past is amplified in this shoot 'em up, completely joyous and utterly unpretentious homage to Quentin Tarantino.He lampoons himself by appearing as a voice over, very briefly, on two occasions, thereby giving us his 'Hitchcock Moment"" - another nod of reverence to a master of the big screen.But it's the killings (and there are many) that provide the greatest glee and give Tarantino the most fun. Buckets of blood mixed with suet and bits of bone spray liberally across the set, and regularly onto the magnificent countenance of Jennifer Jason Lee (an actress that's clearly up for the ride and vies with Samuel L. Jackson for star billing).Cowboys vomit gallons of gore in brilliant fountains of rouge and heads are dramatically obliterated with barely a by your leave.Even his cast is a parody of itself.Michael Madsen is back for the first time since being Mr Blonde, as is Tim Roth who was Mr Orange; Kurt Russell follows up his Death Proof appearance, Samuel L. steps out for the sixth time, Bruce Dern does a quick reappearance after Django, as does Walter Goggins who is terrific as the Sheriff.It's glorious (inglorious really). A pure romp. A very clever storyline, beautifully filmed, hilariously, and I mean laugh out loud hilariously, scripted and the ensemble cast is a pure delight.From the very first bar of Ennio Morricone's masterful score (in itself another parody) to the last note of the closing credits this is filmmaking at its most uninhibited, most irreverent (the n word appears many more times than any other white man could get away with) and most crafted.A triumph.I cannot wait for his forthcoming horror movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
an Excellent Movie for True Cinema Lovers (spoiler-free review),"The following review is 100% spoiler-free for those of you who are considering whether the movie is appropriate or not for yourself.Quentin Tarantino's the Hateful Eight is truly a piece of art. I have seen all of the films that Tarantino has directed (except for Jackie Brown), and this is definitely his 2nd or 3rd best (after Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).This movie was excellent from all aspects. The cast that Tarantino managed to gather for this one is superb. The cinematography is, as in all Tarantino movies, exceptional and some of the best I've seen in a long time. The plot in this film is, story-wise, quite simple, however, the way it plays out and the order in which the events unfold make for an excellent, unique western story.In the Hateful Eight, Tarantino captures his audience from the first shot shown on screen. Using rich dialogue and beautiful cinematography, somebody that truly appreciates film will find their eyes glued to the screen for the entire three hour runtime. Tarantino nailed the 70mm cinematography in this film. Since the aspect ratio on 70mm is huge (2.76:1), the camera can see much more than a normal 35mm camera can. The cinematography in this film was more than satisfying, with some unbelievable landscape shots, and very interesting shots from inside the main room from which the story is told, and from a horse carriage.So, why the bad reviews? If this is such a great film, then there should be much less people that disliked the movie. Well, first of all, this movie is extremely violent. In fact, it is probably Tarantino's first or second most violent film (after Kill Bill Vol. 1...and I'm pretty sure the Hateful Eight was actually more violent). In fact, the movie is so violent to the point where I felt that some of the violence was over-the-top, felt out of place, and decreased the quality of the movie (hence the 9/10). I will not go into detail on the violence, due to spoilers, however, if you can not stomach strong violence, then this movie is definitely not for you.Additionally, I realized that a lot of people in the reviews complained about how ""boring"" the movie was, and mentioned how they walked out of the movie in the middle. Well, I'd like to point out how absurd that is. The Hateful Eight is not your normal western or action movie, it is a one of a kind film. If you are going to watch this movie purely for the violence, or purely for the ""beautiful 70mm landscape shots"", then don't bother. And if you're complaining about the amount of over-the-top violence, well...it's Tarantino. And while I do admit that this movie was supremely violent, what do you expect? After all, it IS a Tarantino film. Anyways, a large portion of the film is a build-up, and is, of course, filled with Tarantino's excellent dialogue between the characters. So for those of you that walked out in the middle and complained about how ""boring"" the movie is...oh, well. I guess you don't have the time and patience to appreciate the skill that Tarantino has of toying around with words in between characters.To conclude, the Hateful Eight is an excellent movie, and, in my opinion, one of Tarantino's best. However, it is not a film for everyone. It is not an action movie or a classic western. While some beautiful 70mm landscape shots are included, most of the movie is not just beautiful shots of nature and mountains. Nevertheless, the cinematography is still excellent. It is also extremely violent, so if you can't stomach violence, then pass on this one. If you don't appreciate or don't mind for rich dialogue between characters and the unique way that Tarantino builds suspense, then it's probably not worth your time. However, if you are a Tarantino fan, or show a true appreciation for cinema, or even, if this movie just caught your attention and you think you'd like it (and you can handle violence, of course), then give it a try. Approach this movie with an open mind, and I assure you, you'll leave satisfied.9/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The film he wanted to produce...which is what you get,"So as I have sat through the others, and enjoyed as much as they made me enjoy. From the stolen .. sorry..reinterpreted story of Reservoir Dogs (and yes I know that is not his first film), right through to the h8ful Eight. It is what he wanted to produce. Don't come looking for tempo, deep story, guffaws or tears. You won't get it...You won't like it..so Don't do it. However, if you wish to regale at his known brat pack pulling out stellar performances, with gimmicky voice overs, excellent wardrobe and settings. But then again as others have mentioned, it is a theater piece set on screen. It works well, as a backdrop to the Tarantiniesque blood fest that ensues. I don't agree with critics saying that Tim Roth was a playing a 'pompous' character which would not have been correct for his social standing....ofc not, he was playing Tim Roth, and the rest did exactly the same. The film smacks of the usual clichéd moments and soundbites, the verbal jousts are evident and in abundance. They always seem to end with Mr Jackson shutting someones mouth in one way or another. So if you liked Django (and personally I preferred Django Unchained). Then go see the new brain splattering, eye candy from the master.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's most sophisticated move to date,"The most sophisticated Tarantino movie is a western version of a psychological thriller. With a very slow building up of tension. Tarantino plays with the audience, outstandingly mixing suspense and awe. The constrained setting - the whole movie unfolds in one room - make you think of Hitchcock's Lifeboat. But, it is the whole toolkit of the great British Master on display here. Think of the use of characterization,dialogue, camera position. Even the cameos trademark. And, most relevantly, the use of an entertaining story to observe and discuss society. Tarantino is the most Hitchcockian of contemporary directors. The Hateful Eight is a true pleasure to watch,It is easily the movie of 2015 which I enjoyed the most.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Thoroughly Enjoyed,"Keeping this as short as possible.I like to read books, and especially books with a good amount of dialogue too. That's what ""The Hateful Eight"" was, a book, but in movie form.The movie was split into chapters, like a book, and it progressed like a book. It's very dialogue driven, so don't expect guns blazing during every chapter of the movie. The thing I didn't expect out of this movie was the humor because there is a good amount of humor, which balances out with the seriousness of the plot.I would only recommend this movie to people who likes to read books, or people who likes dialogue as much as they like action. If you're not that person, I don't really recommend watching it because you'll probably get bored of the movie within the first 30 minutes like some of the other reviewers.Happy watching!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
There won't be many coming home,"Now, yours truly is and probably forever will remain a devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy. I'm a huge admirer of everything this man has done so far and I also honestly think that he's one of the very few filmmakers out there who has developed his very own, unique and inimitable style. Even if it wouldn't be hyped and anticipated months from beforehand all over the internet, you'd still be able to recognize QT's newest movie straight away. Why? Because there simply isn't another director who writes dialogues like he does. There isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for his/her films. There aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, atmosphere, dialogues, humor and excessive violence. There are very few directors that somehow bring out the best possible performances from their entire ensemble casts, etc.Still, it sometimes seems as if Tarantino's formerly worshiped trademarks are now turning against him. I have the impression that I read more and more hate-reviews every time he releases a new film, and all things that people used to love unanimously – like the dialogues – now seem to upset and irritate them. It's not because I'm a big QT fan that I'm not skeptical and, yes, admittedly even I would have preferred that ""The Hateful Eight"" was less talkative and at least 30-45 minutes shorter in running time. The film is great in terms of atmosphere, setting, character development and camera-work, but nearly two and a half hour of (primarily irrelevant) drivel and balderdash before anything exciting happens is a little bit too exaggerated; even for a master like Tarantino. And another point of criticism, personally I really missed the all-overpowering ""WOW""-sentiment, and that actually already was the case in ""Django Unchained"" as well. All of Tarantino's older movies, up until ""Inglorious Bastards"", were also astounding in terms of originality and imaginative plotting. ""The Hateful Eight"" is basically a very simplistic tale, a sort of whodunit in a stone-cold and unpleasant western environment. In spite of all of Sam Jackson's long monologues and Tim Roth's brilliant Hangman speech, the essence of the plot lies within the question ""who poisoned the coffee?""""The Hateful Eight"" contains almost too many highlights to list, and that's the most important conclusion of my viewing. The long and moody opening sequence, slowly turning around the deformed Christ statue, is pure art! In fact, the cinematography throughout the entire film is brilliant and chock-full of ingenious angles; outside in the excruciatingly cold Wyoming winter as well inside in the haberdashery. I think I covered the greatness of the dialogues already, and the violence featuring in the last half hour is also stupendous, with heads getting blown clean off and scumbags puking out all the blood in their bodies. In another interview I read that Tarantino listed two movies as his main inspiration, namely his own ""Reservoir Dogs"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". Those two are indeed well represented, but I would definitely add one other title, and I'm sure QT knows I'm right, and that's the obscure but raw and excessively violent Spanish/Italian western ""Cut-Throats Nine"". The original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone sent cold shivers down my spine, but there's another song on the soundtrack that even made me happier. All my life I've been a fan of Roy Orbison, but thanks to Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" I discovered a magnificent song of his that I never heard before. ""I won't be many coming home"" is a fantastic song and ideally fits the tone and content of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Duller than dull,"I'm a big fan of Tarantino but this film is very poor. Sadly, great music and great scenery were wasted on a dull movie with mundane dialogue and a poor story line.

Am amazed it has scored 8.1 as it is a complete waste of good actors.

You NEED to see THIS,"Tarantino's Hateful Eight is cinema of another time. Every big movie nowadays seems to follow the same boring and bland formula relying on CGI heavy environments and effects that looks bad half the time even though millions were spent on it. Movies now seem to take a directors name and slap it on the movie even though it looks like any other big budget movie around. This is NOT that.Hateful Eight is almost entirely in one single location, and for the runtime of this movie that is super impressive. Cinema is not flashing lights or big name actors, it is the Story that carries movies. This story is carried by the handcrafted dialogue of a cinematic genius, and will keep you watching. I tried to stop watching it half way through but I couldn't because I was glued to the screen. Hateful Eight's story is suspenseful and tells itself like an unraveling yarn. You do not know who to trust or to root for.Watch it if you want something different than the unoriginal movies you see today and want to see what TRUE cinema looks like.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Expertly crafted and highly immersive,"Once again, Tarantino proves just how brilliant of a director he is. Even though this movie is almost 3 hours long and mostly takes place in one room, there is not a single boring moment. The plot is seemingly very basic, but that allows Tarantino to take his story in any direction he wants, without making it messy. The pacing is great as well, but what really make this movie great are the characters and their conversations. Each and every character in this film has their own set of personality traits, and they all have a questionable moral compass. They all have stories to tell, and here lies the movies biggest strength in my opinion; The struggle of figuring out which stories are a lie, and which ones aren't. As a viewer, this creates a very captivating sense of not knowing where to place the characters. The performances also enhance the characters a lot, with basically every actor giving a fantastic performance. My favorites are probably Walton Goggins and Samuel L. Jackson, but you can make a case for almost everyone involved being the best actor in the movie. The climax is great, it's tensionfilled and almost poetic at times. Another thing this movie does expertly is utilizing its environments and locations. The vastness of the mountains, the claustrophobic feeling of the cabin, the freezing cold of the blizzard, it's all so immersive you almost feel the temperature change whenever someone goes outside or comes back inside. The score and sound design are also both fantastic, both adding to the uneasy feeling that something isn't right. My only issue with the movie is that the non-linear stuff isn't as well handled as in other Tarantino films, but that is a very minor complaint. Overall, this is an excellent, fun, deeply immersive experience that I definietly will watch again soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Glory Gory,"Sometime in the early 70s, a young Tarantino got to see a truly messed up blood-splatter festival in the form of a movie, forever traumatizing his creative consciousness, so that excessive violence became a key feature of his movie. This is once more the case here. And this, in my opinion, overall hurts the filmmaking creativity and qualitative narrative structure.The issue is that the violence is simply is meaningless. The over-the-top gore is not about historical authenticity, but only serves Tarantinos perverse mind. Some instances of violence, in my opinion, are truly appalling and discomforting. Others, however, are weirdly funny. But this is just concerning the individual moments. The deadly violence as a whole may be a moral message. As literally everyone dies, Tarantino might try to apply frontier justice to unmoral individuals.Probably the best part of the movie is the wicked smart, meticulous narrative structure which offers well-done twists.Furthermore, the premise is intriguing, basically being ""a bunch of nefarious guys in a room together"", as Tarantino put it. The notably slow-pace plot turns into a captivating whodunit. It's vivid fun to ascertain whether someone lies about their identity or not.The film is evidently dialogue and exposition heavy, but this is made supportable by the captivating, creative and humorous dialogue.The laudable cast does a solid job playing these unlikable characters. My favorites were Jackson and Roth.While obviously not an important or substantial aspect of movies quality, I did love the coziness coming of the blizzard setting. This is due to the fact, that this film was shot in Southwest Colorado. The latter is also the subject of noteworthy, mostly splendid cinematography. Filmed in 65 mm film with a widescreen ratio typically associated to the movies of the 1960s, Tarantino and his team aim to recreate the filmmaking splendor of some director's favorite movie. He also tries to do that with the late Morricones score. Although not his most memorable work, the score is still laudable. The track ""L'ultima diligenza di red rock"", however, is truly great.Overtly violent, slow-pace Western heightened by a good cast and technical splendor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hateful Eight (2015) Review - 8.5/10,"The Hateful Eight is one of Quentin Tarantino's most underrated films. Which is saying a lot because it was very well-received. With a star-studded cast, lots of gory action, and sweet Tarantino dialogue. One critique I hear people talk about when they're talking about this film is how long it is, which I can absolutely understand. But I think it works to the movie's favor, as the longer the movie goes on, the more tension builds up, which leads to an epic finale.

"boring,  pointless and disappointing","I was really looking forward to watch this movie after reading some good reviews and watching Django Unchained which was a great movie. What a disappointment! It's boring and filled with pointless dialogues. 3 hours of nothing.I was waiting that it will get better and will start to make sense after a while or at least start to be more entertaining, but even after 1,5 hours it was the same boring movie. Could not watch until the end. Complete waste of time. The only good thing about the movie was the scenery, costumes and the cast.

The Hateful Eight stands as another Tarantino masterpiece and is an absolute must-see,"I recently rewatched Tarantino's classic The Hateful Eight (2015) on Netflix. The storyline follows a bounty hunter traveling through the Rocky Mountains during a snowstorm and encountering individuals who pose a threat to his bounty. Despite setting parameters for their interactions, the journey becomes anything but peaceful.Directed and written by the iconic Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), the film stars Kurt Russell (Escape from New York), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Single White Female), Walton Goggins (Fallout), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), and Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs).The Hateful Eight is visually stunning, with captivating settings and a legendary soundtrack. The dialogue and acting are exceptionally brilliant, with a lingering sense of mystery throughout. Jennifer Jason Leigh delivers a standout performance, and the random acts of violence against her are executed with precision. Samuel L. Jackson's character is easy to root for, while Russell's character is appropriately annoying and adds tension. Memorable sequences include the North vs. South subplot and showdown, the vomit scene, and the intense ""liar"" conclusion.In conclusion, The Hateful Eight stands as another Tarantino masterpiece and is an absolute must-see. I would give it a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hateful Eight = a 7 in it's score,"This western drama is well acted, well directed & well quite interesting to watch so I recommend it worth a watch once. However the story which is acceptable to watch is a slow burn & not that memorable, but don't be put off totally as the quality acting of the characters given make this a solid 7 ( worth watching once ).I think the story could have been told in half the time & then another 50% of quality material could have been added, as there is so much more that could have been done with a movie this length set in that time period which could really have made this a much better movie & then maybe we would have enjoyed another.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Very entertaining, but certainly not Quentin's best work","First of all, I have to say this is one of the quite unique film genres, it has a western style and has a chapter-based, Tarantino style story. Many nostalgic thinkers will enjoy such films. I think it's ageless movies. I would be happy if other young directors develop such a way of making films.And I watched this movie several times before writing this review. I have a lot of respect for Quentin because he has come up with so many great scripts. And the story of 'The Hateful Eight' is also one of them. However, the way the characters are introduced and the hate relationships between them have been told a bit verbose, sometimes frustrating for viewers. This is also unavoidable in an original scenario. This is not a movie made from a novel. There are a few relationships between the characters that are described in an forced, unnatural way. And the story of these 8 people who hate each other is not happening as I thought. I think the psychological developments should be developed a little more deeply before the action scenes happen.In terms of costumes, visuals, production design working, and especially the music, those are the great things about this movie. The action scenes are great, they are full of dark humor, shocking and surprise. You can watch this movie with friends, and can skip the first half of the movie if you plan to watch it again. And I especially like Jennifer Jason Leigh, she makes me feel like I'm witnessing a real western bandit living 100 years ago lol.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Everyone has a bad day at the office, this is Tarantinos!","I'm a lover of all that is Tarantino and could not wait to see this movie. To me it felt like this..... Quintin Tarantino woke up one morning and needed some milk from the shop, on his way he bumped into Samuel l Jackson, the legendary kurt russel and a few other actors, kurt began telling quintin about a cabin he'd hired for the weekend and Samuel l Jackson had some fancy dress clothing in the boot of his car, with that quintin said ""hey let's make a shitty movie for a laugh"" They all drove up to the cabin and on the way quintin scribbled a script on some paper they acted it out while quintin filmed it on his phone, didn't bother editing, then they all had a few beers.This movie is terrible, and to the people who say, ""you need to understand it"" I completely understand the movie, it's just really, really bad.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino can (and has) done better than this.,"I finally managed to watch ""The Hateful Eight"". I pretty much hyped myself up for this film (after all, Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and screenwriters), and I even saw people saying that this is his best film since ""Pulp Fiction""... which is really saying a lot.Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of this film. I personally felt like Tarantino just tried to reimagine ""Reservoir Dogs"", but set it after the Civil War... and in the winter... and with racists... and a LOT less interesting.PROS:The acting in this movie was pretty great overall. I will never say anything bad about Samuel L. Jackson. If he's in a movie, I'm in. If he's in a Tarantino movie, I don't have a choice. And in this movie, he's great as always.I also really liked Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Their relationship was kinda funny to see, even though she hits her multiple times (trust me, she deserves it) and is handcuffed to her the whole movie.
Walton Coggins was also pretty interesting to see on-screen.As usual, the dialogue in the film was great. There was a lot of witty banter between characters that I thought was really interesting.CONS:This movie did not have to be as long as it was. It was 2 hours 28 minutes (I saw it on Netflix, so it didn't include the 15 minute intermission) long, and it unfortunately stretched its story thin throughout the film's runtime. And frankly, it kinda sucked.The overall twist was kinda lame and anticlimatic. Of course, I'm not going to spoil it for anybody who wants to watch it. All I'll say is that I didn't like it.Overall, this is the only Tarantino film I've watched (haven't seen ""Jackie Brown"" yet) that I would NOT like to watch another time. All of his other films are so much better than this.
If I had to rank his films from worst to best (excluding ""Jackie Brown"", ""Sin City"", and ""Death Proof""), it would be ""The Hateful Eight"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 2"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 1"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then ""Pulp Fiction"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

This is a perfect movie in my eyes and any score that is below a 5 is because it starts off slow and I'd like to see what they think is a 10. This is a very funny movie that gets better the more you watch. I wish I could watch for the first time again. This is Q's most thought out movie with tons of action and great dialogue.

A multifaceted western that struggles under the weight of its ambition,"Quentin Tarantino, the bold director behind masterpieces like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill,"" returns to the big screen with ""The Hateful Eight,"" a dark-toned western that doesn't fail to keep the viewer glued to the screen. However, despite its potential, the film suffers from some imperfections that limit its overall effectiveness. The film opens with a spectacular scene, a stagecoach racing through the snowy landscapes of Wyoming, introducing the viewer to a world of violence and deceit. Tarantino skillfully plays with the Christmas setting, using the snow not only as a visual backdrop but also as an element that contributes to the growing tension among the characters. One of the film's strengths lies in its tight dialogue and stellar performances by the cast, particularly Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Jackson, as Major Marquis Warren, dominates the scene with his magnetic presence and sharp language. Leigh, as the prisoner Daisy Domergue, perfectly embodies her femme fatale role, adding a dose of unpredictability to the plot. However, despite these strengths, the film suffers from an excessively verbose plot in the first half, with dialogues that sometimes seem more like a showcase of verbal skills than a way to advance the story. The decision to set much of the film inside a single location, Minnie's Haberdashery, may be seen as a bold move, but ultimately it feels restrictive and limits the sense of adventure expected from a western. Additionally, the film tends to lose momentum in its second half, with a pace that slackens and some plot twists that seem forced or unconvincing. Tarantino, known for his explosive and surprising endings, seems to struggle to find a satisfying conclusion for this complex story. Despite these criticisms, ""The Hateful Eight"" remains an engaging cinematic experience, full of moments of tension and dark humor. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack contributes to creating a sinister and claustrophobic atmosphere, while the magnificent cinematography captures the beauty and harshness of the snowy landscape. Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is a film that has its highs and lows. While it offers moments of pure brilliance and entertainment, it also suffers from an overly complex plot and a narrative structure that sometimes gets lost in the details. However, for fans of Tarantino's cinema and the western genre in general, it remains a must-see. So, if you're ready for a journey into the dark heart of the Wild West, get ready to face ""The Hateful Eight."" Just remember: in this journey, nothing is ever as it seems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Needlessly Divisive Gem,"The Hateful Eight is often billed as one of Quentin Tarantino's ""Worst Films"" due to its slow pace and lack of action scenes compared to his other works. I would argue that those are major misjudgments for a deceivingly well-written, acted, and produced movie. The skill with which Tarantino employs in crafting complex characters and their interactions shines through, as always. While I agree that The Hateful Eight is a slow burn, I fear that it may only face that criticism due to Tarantino's reputation for exciting, gory action, especially after following the likes of Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds. Overall this movie is a masterclass in character writing and interaction, beautifully shot and a wonderful addition to Tarantino's repertoire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Tarantino wallows in blood and carnage, and delivers the first disappointing movie of his career","Tarantino has always been known for his outlandish violence, his offensive dialogue, and his inappropriate story lines. However, like a true filmmaker, he has used these devices towards his own strengths, crafting nuanced and complex movies that just so happen to have a lot of blood. But with ""The Hateful Eight,"" fittingly, his eighth movie, Tarantino instead abandons these complexities, and instead gives us a fairly simple indulgence in violence and masochism.I won't summarize the plot, as we're on IMDb, and judging by how you're on the user reviews, you have a general idea of what the movie entails.THE GOODThe film is loaded with Tarantino's signature hypnotic dialogue, and the performances are all outstanding, chief among them being Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has been nominated for a Golden Globe for her venomous, hate-filled performance. The cinematography, at least for the first twenty minutes or so, is breathtaking in its gorgeous snowy vistas and the rough, mountainous terrain. Even when the film moves into the stagecoach, the film looks beautiful and fittingly claustrophobic, as the camera always seems to frame characters perfectly during rousing monologues.THE BADEven if the dialogue is your typical Tarantino fare, it seems like it could have used some editing this go round. Tarantino has always been one for indulgence, but this movie takes it to new, and often exhausting heights. This is a two hour movie stretched perilously over three, and the dialogue suffers for it. Characters babble on at times, and the same themes are rehashed throughout. While ""Django"" used racism towards thematic relevance and a social observation, ""Eight"" instead uses it as a means to reach the violence. It has no meaning, no gravitas, outside of being a means to an end.I also got the sense that this movie is violent simply for the sake of being violent. After bloated, almost boring hours of hearing these characters talk, the blood comes fast and hard, and it seems like Tarantino is simply using this movie as a statement. He's saying, ""Yes, I am violent. Just watch this."" The movie seems like an indulgence on his part. It often doesn't reach farther than being a blood-soaked romp.OVERALLIs it a bad movie? No, of course not. It's probably impossible for Tarantino to make an inherently bad movie at this point in his career. But what it is is an excuse for a proved, controversial director to pride himself on his excesses, whether it be through tiresome talking scenes, unneeded language, or excessive blood and carnage. It's Tarantino being Tarantino, and it's more than likely that his fans will lap it up. But for everyone else, the movie is an excuse for a director to pride himself on what he does, even if that means creating a movie without purpose or any sense of timing or humility.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"An amazing crime, mystery, drama","The hateful eight is another Quentin Tarantini film with great characters. I thought Quentin just made another western film with Samuel L. Jackson like Django, but it was delighted surprise when I found out that it was crime, drama, mystery after just watching Django.Samuel L. Jackson's character Major Marquis Warren is great as a war veteran bounty hunter, he isn't really a good guy but he has more of a villian personality but you still route for him because the real villian Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh gives off the vibe that makes every scene unsettling and tense. There is always a reason for her to be alive, starting with Kurt Russel's character John Ruth's code. Walter Coggins is great in this film as Sheriff Chris Mannix who is from the south and is the new sheriff of the town the main cast of characters is trying to get to. Overall this movie is amazing for a film that is 3 hours long. It has amazing characters, a great setting, and an amazing plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"On this site, you'll inevitably read reviews calling this movie long and boring, those reviews couldn't be more wrong. While I don't think this is Tarantino's best work (I place it 5th behind Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Django Unchained.)I do think this is a satisfying addition to the Tarantino catalog. There's not a ton of action, and you have to appreciate dialogue, but if you do, you're in for a treat, the dialogue is sharp, at times brilliant, and has a sharp comedic edge (this may be Tarantino's funniest work) The scenery is beautiful, and beautifully captured, the actors while intentionally being over the top at times are all stellar (Walton Goggins was especially good.) I definitely think it's worth a viewing in the theater (preferably in 70mm)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Class.,Absolutely enjoyed this film. I love a film that is compulsive and enjoyable and absorbing and the H8 is one of those films. As usual with Tarantino anything politically correct is thrown in the dustbin for starters. The dialogue is always a key to great story telling and QT does it effortless. The characters have great presence and strong individuality right down to the choreographed movements. This film is a great western a whodunit a thriller and pure comedy gold all rolled together in a film reefer. I won't spoil the film plot as you need to go and watch. Did I mention the gore? oh yes true to QT it has all the gore you need. The great thing about this film is I am still smiling this morning.,,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Good Film, but Tarantino's Weakest","The Hateful Eight is basically Reservoir Dogs in a Western setting, but it takes twice as long to tell the story. The reason for this is that it shows the back story of the situation in great detail unlike Reservoir Dogs. The first hour takes places outside the box and the rest of it in it.This first hour could have been taken out of the movie though or edited significantly. The dialogue in this first hour supplies a lot of back story for the main characters, but then they talk about this AGAIN and AGAIN as each main character introduces himself to the another new character. Hence, the movie could have just started with the characters in the box.I adore all of Quentin Tarantino's films, but I have to say The Hateful Eight is his weakest. Even though he is a master of building up suspense, the journey to the suspense takes way too long. (The payoff is great though.) The biggest detractor to The Hateful Eight is that it's not very fun. All of his previous pictures had moments of fun, whether through humor, the alluring dialogue, the style, or the action scenes. Here the tone is bleak throughout and the dialogue is very dry.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Violent Mystery,"Let's start with the good. The Hateful Eight is very entertaining. If you're a fan of Tarantino's style, not merely gory violence, then you will definitely like it at least. And for a three hour film it didn't feel long, or dragged out. When the credits rolled I was almost surprised that it was already over. Overall it is a good film, for the first half at least. After that is when we come to the bad.Roughly around the second third of the movie all the story that was previously built gets thrown out the window. It goes in a whole new direction and not for the better, because it feels like someone just got bored with making up a mystery so they abandoned everything. The movie feels almost unfinished, especially due to all the weird edits.Then of course there is the subject of violence towards its female character - Daisy. In the Kill Bill films most of the violence towards women was done by other women, it's all part of the same cartoonish world. But here, towards the end, it broke the illusion for me. It took me out of the film completely to see such violence done to a female character.This could have been among my favourite's of this year, but by the end it left a bad taste in my mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Another piece of Tarantino genius,"One of the greatest directors of our era, Quentin Tarantino, returned with an almost 3-hour film, without any big stars (but with many of his regulars) and much trouble during production. But he made it again.The Hateful Eight is perhaps the Tarantino film with the more mystery in it; for long enough during the film you don't know who is who and who does what, and there's even a scene when the great Samuel Jackson produces a Poirot-style speech trying to solve one of the plot's mysteries.As in every film Quentin made, the greatest part is the screenplay. Quick and witty dialogue, especially by Jackson and Kurt Russell, colorful, ambiguous characters, black humor, great use of actual events (this time, the American Civil War) and of course, suspense, mystery and masterful plot twists. Chronological order is not observed, typically for Tarantino, but this time it's necessary in order to deceit the viewer, as he aims to.The cast acts fine, with Jackson, Russell and Leigh performing at their best. Because of its similar scenery (19th century United States, with race relations an important factor), you can't help but compare the movie with Tarantino's latest Django Unchained (2012). The latter film had stars like Waltz and Di Caprio and much more action than this, but The Hateful Eight almost equals it with its mysterious plot and brilliantly claustrophobic directing by Tarantino, plus the wonderful score written by the great Ennio Morricone. I think Django was slightly better, but this one had significantly less potential to exploit.In conclusion, the film proves for one more time that this guy is a master behind the camera, and provides 165 minutes of suspense, intrigue and fun. It's a great movie to watch, not a masterpiece, but another piece of Tarantino genius. And for the die-hard Tarantino fans, they may observe that the style resembles the earliest films he made, such as Reservoir Dogs, with slapstick violence and no sympathetic characters. Not his best, but a true Tarantino movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Roadsow Experience? Great! The Movie? Ugh,"The experience that Tarantino tried to create by releasing the film as an event was great. The roadshow, overture, intermission, and 70mm were fantastic. While the experience was great, this is about the film. Why use a large format for a movie that mainly takes place in a single room? The format would have been perfect for the scenery that accompanied many of the outside scenes, but instead we were stuck in a bottle. Add to that the extremely gratuitous use of the n-word, and general absurdity of the plot, and Tarantino playing homage to himself, and I just didn't care for it. Be warned of a graphic description of forced sodomy that is over the top that left me wondering what is wrong with Tarantino that he would dream that up.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I understand why some hate it and why some love it,"I grew up watching westerners with my father, it was part of our bonding time, so whenever I see a western type of movie pop up, it immediately grabs my attention. Now keep in mind that i'm a young guy in my 20's so I will say that I do understand why most people disliked this movie.We are so used to shorts and with the emergence of very powerful TV Series at our fingertips on Netflix, with twists, turns and swerves at the end of every episode, we crave for something that will deliver the same amount of impact, complexity and visual effects that TV series rely on. That will not be found in abundance in this film, it is a very long movie with the first half dealing SOLELY with character creation and that is done through very dense and heavy dialogue scenes, it to me is the most refined Tarantino movie to date and I'm sure i'll have my critics on this but this is the one because it may not be his BEST TITLE, but the most artistic one for sure. Where some see dullness I see a stage for the art of dialogue.It is a movie you can watch many times over just to enjoy the way it was filmed, the dialogues between the characters, the one liners and overall feel through all the scenes. It was shot so well and the acting was so brilliant that you feel immersed by the universe, you can almost feel the shivering cold the characters are enduring and feel refreshed at the warmth of the freshly brewed hot coffee.I feel like younger people (under 30) will find this a boring creation for they were expecting the typical gory hack and slash scenes from Tarantino, which are present but nowhere as abundant as a few of his other titles.I was extremely excited when I found out Ennio Morricone performed the score for the movie but I have to admit that it felt a bit too modern for an old western movie, it somehow lacked the essence that he is known for.Overall, I recommend that you watch it as the masterpiece that it is, allow the movie to guide you into this adventure, do not take breaks or pauses, it does feel dense and heavy at times or as the younger generation would label it ""boring"", but bear with it and absorb as much as you can for it all has a certain meaning, even if not apparent at first.I am sure you will feel rewarded. I left the movie theater with a heavy heart for I did not wish it to end, by the end I was completely drawn in to their world, I have not watched a movie like this in decades and I truly hope more of this style will come to fruition, this was an incredible experience every film lover should experience at least once in their lifetimes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Tarantinos best since Pulp Fiction, but probably not for everyone","I personally don't understand the people calling this ""slow"" or ""boring"", did we see the same film? It's a suspense thriller kind of film with a who-done-it plot, it starts off slow but builds to a grand finale. It's an artistically very pure film, all shot in 70mm, and more akin to watching a play in a small theater than going to the movies. It's also about as far from The Avengers as you can get, and for me that's a good thing. Don't expect non-stop mindless action, but if you have a brain between your shoulders chances are you'll find yourself glued to the edge of your seat.It's not perfect. Some plot elements were added for that typical Tarantino off-kilter comical effect, but about half of them end up feeling a bit forced and staged rather than organic. I also feel that while the cast is excellent not all of them fit the setting or the tone of the story. The diversity between the on-screen characters is so great that you wonder if all of them really could exist in the same universe and at the same time, it feels like some of them are trying to do classical western while others are trying to do spaghetti western with hints of western satire. But maybe this was the effect Tarantino wanted? He does like to polarize and create tension between extremes whenever he can. I'm personally not convinced it actually adds to the film though.As for individual performances people have been praising Jackson, and he does indeed perform his usual Jackson repertoire to great effect. But for me the real star of the show is Kurt Russell, this may be the best performance of his entire career. He is absolutely fantastic as the practically minded frontier bounty hunter John Ruth. A real star performance that binds the movie together, and the frontier look suits him.All in all I highly recommend this film. It's a fine work by Tarantino, definitely one of his best. But it's also one of his more artistic films and set in a very morally grey world, don't expect non-stop mindless action and don't expect a clear sense of right and wrong. Do expect a thriller with a focus on narrative tension. If it sounds like your kind of film it probably is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
My first review on here...,"HI All. I have been using IMDb for many years, and I have been an actual registered member for a little over five. I usually do not write reviews because, truthfully, I'm not very good at it, and I'm so scared of accidentally spoiling something. However, I was so bummed to see so much hate for The Hateful Eight, I decided to leave a review.I love this movie. I think The Hateful Eight is awesome. It's my new favorite from Quentin Tarantino. I am not a movie critic or anything, and yes, I have seen his other work, and yes, I love all his other movies, even those movies he didn't direct. And yes, I still stand by this rating anyway, and by my declaration if it being my new #1.So what did I love without spoiling anything?First, I loved the set intimacy. You are spending three hours with eight or so fascinating characters trapped together in one central location. There is no escape. These people must face each other, interact with each other, and survive each other. And we get to watch. This all taking place during a blizzard. I find the weather to be a reflection of the characters. What might have once been romanticized as a beautiful setting is now simply dangerous- the frozen landscape is stark and barren, the bitter cold is cruel and painful, and the howling wind is loud, violent and overpowering throughout the film.Second, I love the acting. This is an impressive lineup of experienced actors and actresses. You have to give them credit because they are the ones carrying this movie. There is no major-over- the-top action scenes to hide behind, no sweeping landscapes to occupy the viewers attention. It's one room and a handful of diabolical characters and an unfolding story. Compliments to all of them.Many reviewers complained about the unlikable quality of these main characters, but that is what I loved most about this film. It is called The Hateful Eight for a reason - there are at least eight hateful people trapped together in/on this movie ""stage"". For a better understanding, imagine that the eight a-holes you hate most in the world were stuck together in a room. Then imagine what awful hilarity might ensue if you gave them all weapons and a reason to kill each other. This is the basic setting for this vengeance-style movie.Three. If you love Quentin Tarantino for the violence, then you will not be disappointed here. When it comes, it is explosive. I see many reviewers complaining that there is not enough action in this movie, but in this case, it works. I would say that, like sex, patience is key here. It is the buildup that makes the climax so exciting and gratifying. I think Samuel L. Jackson's character is warning viewers of this in the trailer: ""Let's Slow It Down, Let's Slow It Way Down."" However, I was not bored at all--not even for a moment. The climax is worth the wait.Anyway, I recommend that you go see the movie. Do not go with expectations of a classic Western with Cowboys and horses and Native Americans and gunfights among cactus-strewn sunsets; rather, go with the expectations of eight complicated Southern/Western characters that must survive a blizzard together, Quentin Tarantino style.10 out of 10 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An admirable addition to the canon.,"Nobody makes movies like Quentin Tarantino and I'm a huge fan of his work. This is the eighth film that he has both written and directed (one of the reasons for the title) and I've seen them all - I think ""Kill Bill"" (really two works) is my favourite - except ""Death Proof"" which I decided to miss out. Like his seventh film ""Django Unchained"", this is a western of sorts but, whereas the previous story was set just before the Civil War, this one is located in the period just after the war. In both cases, race is a major theme.In some senses, ""The Hateful Eight"" is like a Shakespearean tragedy: it is largely set in one location (a snow-bound cabin in the depths of Wyoming), there is lots of glorious dialogue delivered is slow, measured tones, the tension is relieved by a running joke (a door that needs nailing shut against the biting wind), and at the end the stage is littered with bodies. Tarantino is always ready to take his time and the narrative is built up and the characters introduced in a slow, even leisurely, style but, when the action comes, there is plenty of duplicity and revelation in a veritable blood-fest.In a fine cast with some of the director's favourite players, the eight of the title are portrayed by Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson as bounty hunters, Bruce Dern as a former civil war general, Walton Goggins as the sheriff of Red Rock, Tim Roth as the one Englishman, Michael Madden and Demián Bichir as mysterious strangers, and the hapless prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh who gets it in the face in more ways than one. If not Tarantino's finest work, this is an admirable addition to his canon.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Come on! Give Quentin a break - well worth a look,"I use IMDb a lot but for someone who sees around 200 movies a year I have written few reviews but when I do I always write the review before I look at what others have written. Then I look before I post. Now, having seen the slather of 'hateful' reviews I feel I must say more before posting. I think if any other director had made this movie the reviews would have been, in general, somewhat different. We should allow Quentin to make a non-Tarantino movie once in a while.This is what I want to say: In this latest offering from Quentin Tarantino I give Quentin 10/10 for story telling. No standard formulas for our Quentin; he unlearned them a long way back. For the movie as a whole I was hanging back from a 10 because a section of exposition in the early going was somewhat drawn out, a little slow, verging on becoming static (here I agree with the 'slow' verdicts). However the overall atmospherics, the dialogue, the directing, the camera work settled into a satisfying pace and I, for one, failed to pick the twists and turns and didn't find myself becoming bored at any point even though most of the movie was set in one room; kind of like a stage play, but that didn't bother me (I had the same sense of being trapped by the storm as the characters did). I do agree it could have been shortened a little. But, overall, I enjoyed the movie and so did my wife. When it was over I figured QT deserved the extra point for doing his civic duty, economy wise, by keeping the fake blood manufacturers in business. I suspect this is one of those movies that gets panned initially but 'matures' with reflection. Probably not quite another ""Django Unchained"" - but 10 out of 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A really enjoyable movie (spoiler),"Now, that's what I call a nail-biting movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire time. You watch intensely and you don't want to miss any syllable of what every one mutters.I normally don't like stories that go back in time in the middle of the plot. It's like the writers forgot to fill you in somewhere in the story telling and are trying to explain why. However, in this movie, Tarantino fills in the gaps in a very clever way that adds to the mystery. You sense that no one trusts anybody and you ask yourself how they are going to last a couple of days, waiting for the end of the storm, locked all together. You further sense the tension which is so thick that you can touch it. Even the ending chapter keeps you trying to guess how it will all end.This is a real masterpiece by Tarantino. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A 4 is very much justified,"This story is typical with the other Tarantino movies: Add a bland story line with lots of violence and blood, which men generally enjoy (I am a male) and therefore give Tarantino an Oscar.This movie is exactly like his others, think of it like Gran Torino, simple movie, lots of violence, great acting, great Directing, BUT pathetic storyline.The ""twist"" was like a murder investigation programme like Law & Order, the film had no leads, no 'Who done it?' moments, just some guy who happened to admit to the murder or some unrelated character who just happens to become important, who admits to the murder.Think of it like a Harry Potter sequel where Voldermort just happens to be resurrect him, or a new 'one ring' was created in Lord of the Rings.Enough ranting, 4 is very much justified.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hateful Eight - Movie Review,"Major Marquis Warren: ""Move a little strange, you're gonna get a bullet. Not a warning, not a question...A bullet!"".The story is about a blizzards strands together a group of bounty hunters and ne'er-do-wells in a Wyoming cabin. But the small group is about to face a trail of betrayal and deception - and survival is certainly not guaranteed.So I've finally got a chance to watch The Hateful Eight and I thought it was great. Mr. Tarantino has done it again everyone and while I don't think it's he's best one (In my opinion) but I would be lying to myself and to you if I didn't say I was entertained.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors working today and he hasn't lost his touch yet, because he's directing in this movie was both stylish and old school. What Tarantino dose so brilliantly well in his movies is not only the dialogue or the character's, but the influences from other movies that he loves, because he is one of the biggest movie buffs I've ever seen. In The Hateful Eight, Tarantino takes movies like: The Thing, Murder on the Orient Express and Clue, all in one movie but with a gory twist. Even with the trouble of making this movie (mostly the script being leaked online), Tarantino still manages to pull off one heck of a movie with top notch directing.There's a lot of big name actors in this movie and every single one of them shine in their roles. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins and Tim Roth were all phenomenal, but Samuel L. Jackson was freaking outstanding and completely stole the show. Now after thinking about it, every single character in this movie is a horrible person and just imagine how hard it would have been for any writer to make us find enjoyment in theses character's, but that's what Quentin Tarantino is always best at doing.Another thing that's worth bringing up is the score for this movie, as it's more than good, it's fantastic. Ennio Morricone is the master of music composers and he's score for this movie was freaking magnificent. After the movie was over I was humming the score, it was that good. I hope he wins Best Original Score at the Oscars, because he deserves it.The cinematography was amazing (whenever they're not in a room), it was engaging and the movie did grow on me after awhile.Now for the flaws: The character logic towards the end of the movie didn't really make that much sense to me, as it really detached from what the movie perfectly set up at the beginning, but that's just me.When Zoe Bell character says that Auckland is New Zealand's biggest city. Auckland didn't become New Zealand's largest city until the 1900s, surpassing Dunedin. There's many other historical errors in this movie.Overall The Hateful Eight is everything that you wanted in a Quentin Tarantino film. The dialogue was engaging, all of the performances were amazing and the score was just perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A brilliant movie,"It was an accident watching this movie,so basically I did not even know what this movie was about, who directed it and who acted it before I entered the cinema. I did not notice that this movie was gonna take me three hours to watch and I was starving because that was dinner time. BUT all I want to say is this movie is just so attractive that I can't help paying careful attention to every single scene of it.Besides the story, the way how it shoots is very impressive. The scene can be shown in beautiful ways and also appealing. There are many close-up lens, but all actors perform so well that their micro expressions make a huge contribution in this film as well.The Hateful Eight contains mixing features of other movies of QT, each one of them may not be outstanding but not a single on can be omitted. These features are like born together with the story, a bloody, barbarous but at the same time romantic and elegant story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Reservoir Dogs in the snow,"Tarantino has delivered yet another fast paced action movie, this time in the style of a modern Western set in the snowy mountains. It really echoed the film that made Tarantino famous - Reservoir Dogs. The main story is set in a bar, the crossroads of many a different characters fate in the style of a whodunnit but this time framed as a ""Who is the enemy"".What Tarantino does well it deliver a simple idea so effectively and Hateful Eight is no different. It keeps your attention, builds the suspense and has all the swear words and gore you can expect from a Tarantino film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Tarantino stage play,"Personally, I thought this movie was yet another Tarantino classic. The dialog is as crisp and clever and sprawling as it is in his other movies, and the characters are just a blast. Make no mistake -- this is a fun movie even at three hours. My entire family ventured out for the 70mm roadshow experience. While I enjoyed the movie, I have to admit that I didn't really see much of a difference in the 70mm presentation. I don't know if that's a product of having seen it on a less than optimal screen, or perhaps I just didn't see much of a difference. Certainly, it did not detract from the experience. If you like Tarantino's other films, you'll enjoy how this hearkens back to Reservoir Dogs in that the story is mostly contained in one location and therefore relies entirely on its excellent dialog and characters to unfold the story. Go see this. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
You got to love the actors and Sergio Leone's heritage,"We have here a bunch of very good players and a very interesting story though, at first glance, may seem boring. Personally, I'm not a fan of Samuel L. Jackson but, I admit, he's a talented actor. Kurt Russell makes here probably his best role. Similarly, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. With Bruce Dern, the situation is different, I saw him in much better and more consistent roles. Anyway, here he is OK. Two outstanding performances for me are Demián Bichir and, in particular, Walton Goggins. Last but not least, the best in the whole movie, the one who steal it, is Jennifer Jason Leigh, a super actress, exceptional in everything I saw her: ""Buried Alive"" (1990), by Frank Darabont, ""Single White Female"" (1992), by Barbet Schroeder, ""Short Cuts"" (1993), by Robert Altman, ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995), by Taylor Hackford, etc. The script, original and somehow Shakespearean is signed by the director, Mr. Quentin Tarantino. Anyway, we can still feel the spirit of Sergio Leone, he is present in many scenes. And, the musical alter-ego of Leone, Mr. Ennio Morricone, is signing the music, which is not as great as in the 60s but, anyway, still great. Try to see this in good conditions, not on You-tube, where the image is halved and unclear, or in a cinema with idiots who talk on cell phones, rustle bags, etc.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's Tribute to his own early days,"Watched The Hateful Eight. It's quite literally a combination of Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, and his most recent, Django, as it's set in a claustrophobic environment like Dogs and is a Western dealing with racism like Django and is a brutal bloodbath like both those films. It's truly an ugly film without any morals and this is a huge swing for Tarantino who tried to get all moral with his last few films. The acting is impressive throughout (Samuel L. Jackson is actually the lead character in this one) and the thin plot is forgivable because anyone who has followed Tarantino up until now knows the point is the great big monologue leading up to the sudden eruption of violence, and in this sense it certainly does not disappoint. I doubt this is going to score any Oscars because this time around it is truly a b-movie rather than a parody of one, but if you love Tarantino for his earliest work this one will seem like it should have been his third film, not his eighth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Only Tarantino Can Keep You Watching a 3 Hour Movie!,"When we sat in the theater, the mood was kind of the same with everyone in the audience...

But not this movie. Nope, Tarantino is pure genius when it comes to dialogue. This was a brilliant and entertaining film all the way through.

First of all I will say that I did enjoy this movie. I think Tarantino is a little overrated. I have liked his films, but I think sometimes he tries too hard and it shows. This one had a little of that in this but everything else made up for it. There are a few little issues I had with this though. First of all, I don't usually complain about the length of a movie unless its slow moving. While I won't say this was slow it could have been trimmed down quite a bit, some of the scenes went on a little long and some were repetitive.

Good awful movie don't believe the critics that say it isn't.,"I read the reviews on this movie and hoped it would be half as good as they said it was. Well, it wasn't, I didn't even stay till the end. It didn't hold my interest and all the great cinematography I was waiting to see never happened. It is nothing more than a rehash of every spaghetti western ever made. Just because it has an all-star cast doesn't automatically make a movie good, this is one of those examples.

"Welcome back, Quentin - definitely not for the masses!","If you do not love, but really love Tarantino, if you do not like most of his movies he made so far, then don't go to this one, neither. Don't waste your time! I mean most, because I was a bit afraid after Django Unchained, but now I know he's back. I saw too many bad reviews about this movie, I saw too many people offended that this is a bad western, and so on. Guys, this is a western as much as Kill Bill was a Chinese karate movie. Everything Tarantino does is actually a metaphor(e.g. the letter, the door). I loved the dialogs, which are very carefully chosen as usual, I loved the filming and the panoramic, btw well done sir, very well done! I loved the blizzard that explains you pretty clear, nobody is allowed to leave that chamber. Please do not compare the acting of characters with those from other classical western movies. It's not the case, and no, Samuel L. Jackson is not a wannabe Clint Eastwood, it's just Samuel L. Jackson from all Tarantino's movies.

Another Great Film by Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker who doesn't make the same movie twice but all of his movies have a feel to it, a signature theme. And this movie is right in his wheelhouse. Dialogue heavy, unique characters, revenge, redemption, and of course, F-bombs. Now while there are many fans of this style we get from every Tarantino film, myself included, there are also people who don't dig Tarantino and boy is this movie NOT for them.This movie is basically a cinematic play. 80% of the movie takes place in one room and through the dialogue we learn about the characters more than their actions. The characters themselves are perfectly drawn for the scenarios that this story puts them in. And the actors in these roles nail it all across the board. Samuel L. Jackson stood out to me the most. Obviously he and Tarantino have built up a strong rapport over the years but it hasn't been since Jackie Brown that Jackson led a film of QT's. He knocks it out the park and it's a shame he wasn't awarded with a nomination from the academy.Now when it comes to the story I was left a little underwhelmed. As you sit there trying to figure out who's really who and where their allegiances lie, the tension and mystery build very well. But the execution of the reveal is what disappointed me. It seemed like it would have been better to have the reveals come through the climax as opposed to cut back to the reveal then jump back to the climax. Overall I enjoyed the mystery of the movie but I kind of feel like Tarantino unnecessarily dumbed down the reveal.As for the technical aspects of this film, they are all top notch. Ennio Morricone's score captured the tone of this film perfectly, Robert Richardson's cinematography made you feel the cold of the blizzard. The editing was smooth. Costumes and sets looked awesome. While yes this is a 2 hour and 48 minute movie (over 3 hours in 70mm), the dialogue and editing make swift work of the movie. I was actually surprised when the last chapter title card came up.Being a huge fan of Tarantino, I can't call this his best work. Actually, I can't even go top 5 out of his 8 films. But that isn't to say this isn't a great movie, it is. I just feel that most of his other movies are better. But even an OK Tarantino movie is still a good movie overall, the guy is just that talented. I would recommend this to any Tarantino fan or film buff but this isn't for everyone. Not a great date movie but definitely enjoyable to the person who knows what they're getting from this movie. Good story, great characters, and lots of amazing dialogue.8 out of 10 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I'm positive I'm bored,"This movie should have been Tarantino's foray into horror. If only!! I know some fans will disagree, but this movie was incredibly boring. Good acting. Good film making. Dialogue is interesting. But what would have made this movie a complete change of pace is if all these dangerous characters meet up in the first hour and in the second hour they find out they are holed up in a place that has a bloody history, maybe a twisted haunting or maybe even some kind of wendigo or something sinister that makes itself known and how it tries to get in there at different times. Slowly they all go crazy during this ordeal. In between the horror and the suspense scenes you have your trademark Tarantino dialogue that sets these characters. Yeah. All that. As I was watching this movie I kept thinking, what if something was trying to get in? Something they had to keep out. Something more dangerous then all of them. Cause lets face it. There is nothing more dangerous then being bored. However that is merely a matter of opinion. The cold grizzled fact of the matter is that, The Revenant was a similar bleak mood in some ways, but far superior. Betwixt these two well made movies, go with Revenant. What is truly interesting is that rumor has it Tarantino got the idea for Hateful 8 from The Thing. Its a fascinating and brilliant idea that does not register the way I wanted it too. But I commend the man for his setups. He knows how to keep us in suspense. Tarantino is a master craftsman with an obvious love for his source material. Its just my opinion but Hateful 8 would have been the perfect opportunity to make a superior western horror movie. A nice cross genre art piece with his trademark style and vitality. I tried hard not to expect too much. I tried hard not to fall asleep. Worth your time if you are a die hard fan. But most die-hard fans will agree its not his best. I think its better if your holed up inside with a storm going on outside, as you curl up and watch it. Because those kind of situations seem to make a movie play out better. Kurt Russell, as always, is the real reason to watch.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Masterpiece,Wow I love this movie woooooooow wooooooooow r u kidding me this is a movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Old tricks from Mr. Tarantino,"In post-mortem, if we must find a fall guy for the calamitous upshot of Tarantino's latest gory saga THE HATEFUL EIGHT, which of the hateful one do you pick? Without too much struggle, I will say it is the bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Russell), who insists on taking his quarries alive to see them hang, even in the case of Daisy Domergue (Leigh), who is wanted dead or alive. If only he could ape the fashion of his fellow black hunter Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), the story would have ended in a more insipid but undeniably more efficient and casualty-less note.The truth is, sometimes, once a certain reputation has been established, to alter it may not be all that easy even if it means less trouble involved for pragmatic reasons, and surely, John Ruth doesn't care for the easiest way, he sticks to his gun until he meets his maker. Or the same thing can be referred to Mr. Tarantino himself, who has become overwrought to retain his brand of overripe violence and loquacious confidence, which obstructs his attempt of going further.Tarantino's script is also cagey about the backstory of Daisy, what she has done to make her a wanted outlaw worth 10,000$, a quite obvious concern no one cares to broach during their over- elaborate political and radical prattle, even gauging by her last name alone, Ruth or Warren should have gotten an inkling about what could happen en route to their destination, a town called Red Rock in Wyoming. That is unfortunately a scriptsmith's job to pre-empt these inauspicious after- thoughts from audience, which rarely happens in Tarantino's previous output.This one-day stretch story occurs in the same time frame of Tarantino's previous DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012), a few years after the American Civil War, but structurally much more stage- oriented, with the preponderance of the happenstances being hemmed inside a stagecoach lodge (imitate a big soundstage) due to a blizzard outside, it tellingly reminds us of RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a similar whodunit trope (initiated by Tarantino's own voice-over) also takes place just when all the political rebuke, repetitive woman-beating, racist teases and gross provocation start to pall. A tangible intensity duly engages when a flashback chapter narrates the horrid slaughter happened earlier at the exact place, we were all haplessly sitting in the darkness, waiting for the blood-spluttering brutality to pour out. Afterwards, it goes without saying, no one can come out of the shoot-out unscathed, and a frontier justice (deliberately elucidated by Tim Roth's Oswaldo Mobray with an unsubtle Christoph Waltz impression, earlier in the casual padding) symbolically settles the score in the money shot, to suggest after all, there are righteous heroes in this trigger- happy milieu crammed with hateful individuals.The film is shot in the rare Ultra Panavision 70 process, credits must be given to its cinematography for its sporadic but grandiose snowscape by DP Robert Richardson, while most indoor shots are fluidly choreographed and unobtrusively operative. Much kudos to Morricone's Oscar-winning score as well, palpitates closely with the film's mood swings and flares up when the visual grandeur emerges.Jennifer Jason Leigh finally joins the Oscar-calibre echelon after being the most overlooked actress (as for as Oscar is concerned) of her generation, her performance here is unabashedly attention- grabbing, even when she is sitting there wordless, motionless, often chained with Russell's Ruth, she is enigmatic to regard (stunning makeup work here too), although her Daisy turns out to be out-and-out evil, when the crunch hits, there is a wishful thinking that she might get her way, not because we are rooting for her, but her feral, blood-covered ferocity is such a zinger on the screen, especially for female characters. Among the rest seven, Samuel L. Jackson is finally first-billed in a Tarantino's picture after a collaboration stretching over two decades, his swagger and flair is undeniably fetching, his arch ambivalence hangs tough until he gets shot in the balls (his manhood bravado gets its comeuppance). Walton Goggins, plays Chris Mannix, the supposed new sheriff of Red Rock, unexpectedly becomes the most important asset in the third act, in spite of an almost farcical front in his greenness, while all the others are typical Tarantino pawns, including the secret hateful No. 9, Channing Tatum.For my money, THE HATEFUL EIGHT can still quench the thirst of Tarantino's devout cinephiles, since he knows exactly what they want, the excesses of unrepentant gore, piled-up body counts and the psychological maneuver, but if you are intrigued to see if he has learned any new tricks, the answer will be disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A bloody Tarantino Christmas' tale.,"Is there any best time of the year than Christmas for bed time stories? Hell no! So in ""The Hatefull Eight"" Mr. Tarantino decided to tell us his ones, with his own unique style. Prepare yourself to immerse in the most snowy experience of the old wild west, where the most brutal killers play at piano Silent Nights meanwhile Major Marquis Warren, an afroamerican bounty killer, tells his cruelest revenge story. Then anything can go wild much more than you think. Well, well, well gentlemen, after all this is Tarantino's vision of America: a nation with dangerous people, each one with his own sense of justice and revenge and armed with deadly guns. And when they met all together, blocked by a snow storm in a remote emporium among Wyoming mountains, Christmas can become their bloody ultimate experience. For the general audience it couldn't be the best Tarantino's Movie and a little bit boring, instead for Tarantino's fan,""The Hatefull Eight"" is an excellent cinematographic work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Utterly captivating but ultimately a bit hollow,"As always, Tarantino commands the viewer's attention effortlessly. Once again, there are brilliant characters, snappy dialogue, and violence almost elevated to an art form. It's buckets of fun.The ""hateful eight"" aren't good guys. There are two bounty hunters (Jackson, Russell), a criminal on her way to be hung (Jason Leigh), a new sheriff (Goggins), an elderly general who used to be a confederate (Dern), a hangman (Roth) and a 'cowboy' (Madsen). They're trapped in a cabin during a blizzard. And so the premise is, Kurt Russell's bounty hunter says: ""One of those men's not who he says he is"".It's a tantalizing mystery, a hook, and I would never spoil anything for anyone. Except to say I sort of expected...more. The entire film is captivating but the first half is perfection; the second half gets a bit messy. It's like an Agatha Christie book - a needlessly convoluted murder plot is revealed... when in fact the whole thing SURELY could've been done a little easier? It gets messy, and even though the last few scenes are a lot of blood-n-guts-y fun, I walked away feel a tiny bit short-changed. Tarantino's earlier two films, Django and Inglourious, always leave me feeling exhausted, elated, inspired, excited. This one left me a bit ... meh.Still, any Tarantino is better than none at all, and a 7/10 is hardly a bad review. It's hard trying to outdo yourself when you've set the bar too high. I still say this is a must-watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Beyond awful ~ possibly the worst excuse for a ""western"" I've ever had the misfortune to endure!","There are simply too many examples of poor film making in this overlong disaster. Other reviews have already pointed them out so I'll save your time. From beginning to end it is just an immense disappointment, especially to a life long devotee of classic Western films. I made the mistake of judging it in advance from the Samuel L. Jackson pictures and preview/trailer. That was my first mistake, the second was paying money for tickets to see this thing. My son walked out at about 30 minutes. I wish I had too! Go see the Revenant, or watch the Unforgiven again, both are Oscar material. The H8teful Eight is NOT! Of the 4 of us who went to see this not a single one of us liked it at all. Too much is often just too much, and in this sad case it really is!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's best film in years,"I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, although I appreciate his best work. The last film of his I felt achieved greatness was ""Jackie Brown"" (still his finest film), and the last ones I liked were the two ""Kill Bill"" films. I'm pleased to admit I found ""The Hateful Eight"" his best in years. It's not perfect (too long, and hampered by some unnecessary campiness where it should have stayed serious), but it's a powerful character-driven, small 'chamber film' (ironic, as it was filmed in 70mm Ultra Panavision, i.e., Cinerama) relating a western tale with eight certifiably hateful characters interacting with each other in verbal power plays like wicked game pieces.Most of its drama takes place in a stagecoach lodge called 'Minnie's Haberdashery' where they have taken refuge from a powerful blizzard (these indoor scenes having been filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles). The sequences not shot in the cabin were actually filmed on location in the beautiful Wilson Mesa area of the Colorado Rockies in extreme conditions of freezing wind and snow, and the stunning visuals, especially in 70mm, are gorgeous to behold. The film has a great cast: some Tarantino regulars, some new, with Kurt Russell as a bounty hunter carrying a handcuffed fugitive (Jennifer Jason Leigh at her filthiest) on the way to her hanging, but each of the eight has his or her own secrets and hidden agenda. Though violent at times beyond the pale (not a surprise for Tarantino!), it is a compelling drama throughout.Ultimately, it might have more style than substance (it seems rather shallow upon analysis), but its style and dramatic structure -- at times almost Shakespearean -- makes this a worthy cinematic experience, even when not seen in 70mm.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant vocabulary throughout the whole movie.,"How some people can give a bad review for The Hateful Eight is beyond my comprehension. First of all, everybody knows what kind of movies Quentin Tarantino makes, so if you don't like those I don't get why you even watch this one. Or you're a complete moron or you're a masochist. I love Tarantino's movies and that's what I also did also with The Hateful Eight. The vocabulary is just outstanding, wouldn't expect any lesser from Tarantino. It's just brilliant, like always. The cast is also excellent. Every single actor in this movie brings his own touch to the ambiance. It is maybe not his best movie but it is for sure way better then 95% of all other movies ever. Everything Tarantino does is just genius. If you don't think the same just stop watching his movies. It's that simple.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This movie was a truthful and raw depiction !,This movie was so truthful and raw!! You could really sense the hate that was built up back then! Samuel Jackson really exemplified superior acting in this film! The plot and story line was told extremely well! Good job Quentin!! All of the hateful and horrible have hateful horrible views and it's really an amazing thing to witness hours of Tarantino viewpoints. Quentin is brilliant and unstoppable. The director had his cast in mind that was gathered with perfect performances. Every character executed the roles and showed the hate of America. The hate stems all the way back and this movie depicts what was being taught for over 400 years and what has yet to be undone 150 years later.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's Best of the 2010s,"Django Unchained showed us that Quentin Tarantino is a chameleon of genres. He can go from a crime thriller to a crime thriller with multiple characters told unchronologically to a Blacksploitation film to a Kung Fu Revenge film to a Grindhouse flick to an awesome World War 2 Action film to a Southerner. Now we have a Tarantino Western with some of the most despicable people in the Tarantino universe. The Hateful Eight is an amalgamation of all of Tarantino's best work that creates one of the most epic westerns of all time. Not only an entertaining film but a great study into racial tension that seems all too true nowadays. Tarantino brings us the masterpiece that no one was expecting to be a masterpiece.The Hateful Eight stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walter Goggins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Demian Bichir, and Bruce Dern who are bounty hunters and crooks that are stuck in Minnie's Haberdashery for 2 days as a blizzard is happening. I don't want to give away anything from the plot but that's all you need to know about the movie. A lot of people are comparing this to Clue when really it's basically Reservoir Dogs in the Old West. Seeing as Reservoir Dogs is one of Quentin's best it definitely made the movie more interesting as I sat there watching the 70mm film. It's story is by far way more suspenseful than Reservoir Dogs and is quite possibly his best film he's done. For me, it's a close second with Inglorious Basterds being #1 for me. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and amazing. I quote more lines from this than any other Tarantino film. I love how Tarantino goes back to a more simplistic film. The movie is set 90% of the time at the Haberdashery and it lets the characters actions become more intense. It's storytelling at its best.Tarantino is a master director and has a style that thousands (such as myself) try to recreate. The Hateful Eight is filled with great dialogue that never made for a dull moment in the film. That's a huge compliment seeing as how this film was 3 hours and 7 minutes at my screening. The reason I say at my screening is that The Hateful Eight has something extremely special for the 70mm Roadshow. As an homage to movies of the 1960s it includes a 3 minute overture and a 15 minute intermission. I can only dream right now as to what a regular screening of the film compares to this roadshow version. But this is the version that's the way to go. A film such as this is so epic that it made me feel a fury of emotions. It made me laugh, it made me disgusted (in a good way), it made me think. Not many films have made me feel those emotions this year and luckily Tarantino is able to pull it off wonderfully.As per usual the entire cast of The Hateful Eight is perfect. Samuel L. Jackson is the standout of this film. He plays a Union Major turned Bounty Hunter that is easily his best Tarantino role since Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction. Other Tarantino alumni return such as Walter Goggins, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Zoe Bell that are fantastic but the true standout besides Sam Jackson is Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's been really impressing me this year with this being as good as her role in Anomalisa. This cast makes the film and keeps impressing me every time. Goggins is really the standout of this film and has great chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson's character.Now, I can't finish my review without talking about Ennio Morricone's amazing score for this film. It is one of his best scores and it feels amazing to see an Ennio Morricone scored western. He even uses an unused song for John Carpenter's The Thing that fits in fantastically with the rest of the movie. It's almost as good as The Ecstasy of Gold. Go check out the soundtrack for The Hateful Eight. Definitely worth the hear.The Hateful Eight is One of the Greatest Westerns of All Time. Tarantino can transbound genres with his style. The Hateful Eight is the most fun I've had in a theater since Star Wars The Force Awakens. See this as soon as possible. This and Carol are seriously the Top 2 movies you need to see this year. It's amazing directing, tight cast and unbelievable script make it worth the price of admission.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Intriguing, unique and detailed","Whereas the film has a slow start, it is totally worth it to sit through it. Tarantino has once again proved that his unique style of filming - with great focus on detail and with a lack of rush - can entertain, intrigue and capture viewers till the end. While some scenes tend to be way too bloody and brutal for my personal taste, the highly interesting plot makes up for this. The film makes you want to understand everything, making the film increasingly more interesting once the plot starts to develop. Furthermore, the setting and beautiful landscape deserve to be mentioned. I would have rated the film higher if the beginning would have had a slightly faster pace.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good Watch,"My expectations of this film wasn't met, although I'm not sure what I was expecting, it is a Mr Tarantino film after all! Some parts where too obvious and saw it coming a mile away BUT I did not expect the twist at the end! The 'black V white' as some has mentioned I don't agree with, there was nothing racist meant by this film, its simply creating atmosphere to pull you into the film on how things would have been back in those days. For me this made it more exciting! Compliments to Freeman for his superb acting with this role, he really made the whole film. Yeah there where some gory parts but its a Quentin Tarantino film! This is what he's good at and this is why we love him! Overall a good watch, would I watch it again? most definitely :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good movie,"I saw the film two days ago. My opinion is very positive. For me, it's better than Django or Inglorious Bastards.I think, the most people who don't like it are under 20 years old. They want action, fast sequences and a lot of shooting and stuff ...If you expect this, you will be disappointed.But if you expect a calm movie, with a lot of cool Tarantino-gangster-yap, and beautiful pictures ... you will like it.It's a little bit like reservoir dogs ... and I like this movie, too.If I have to make a list (And in reality I don't want to do that, because every movie of him is watchable) with the 8 best Tarantino movies, it would look like this:1. (best) Pulp Fiction 2. Reservoir Dogs 3. Kill Bill 1 + 2 4. The Hateful Eight 5. Django 6. Inglorious Bastards 7. Jackie Brown 8. Death Proof",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Entertaining as ever.,"The Hateful Eight had two big wins for me. First was that some of my favorite feature films have only a few locations across the entire picture and mainly focus on telling a great story. The usage of locations was likes a Reservoir Dogs to me. Another great comparison would be some of the best music in the world is simply. Simplicity in art is the absolute hardest. It is easier to keep adding and adding and adding, but to take away and focus on the core is incredibly hard. Quentin Tarantino is a master. Tarantino leveraged each location in the The Hateful Eight to the max, intertwined the story with the style I have become accustom to expect and gave us an absolute classic. The second win for me was of course, Samuel L Jackson's long dialogues. As expected, they were incredible!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Western or sorts, too long, talky, but still good","In the dead of winter with a snow blizzard coming up fast, Bounty Hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock for hanging. On the road, the stage coach meets up with another Bounty Hunter, Major Warren (Jackson) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new Sheriff in Red Rock. Of course, no one trusts anyone. They stop for shelter at Minnie's store where we see other characters of ill-repute. Why are they there? This can't be good.We just know all this will result in terrific shootings. Kind of reminded me of the Smoking Aces movie where there was a shootout within an elevator. So I bided my time. The problem here is that it takes too long to get to that point. John Ruth takes guns away from everyone (except from the Major) to insure his and Daisy's safety. In the meantime we get to hear everyone's story and this is where talky, talky, talky comes into play. All this could have been shortened without losing any of the story.I see you are looking for the twist. Well, here's the thing: about Chapter 4 or so we come to see what happened before the stage coach with John Ruth and company arrived at Minnie's store. Now the real story begins.Notables: Michael Mardsen as Joe Gage who says he is going home to see his mother; Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, the Hangman going to Red Rock; Bruce Dern as Confederate General Sandy Smithers going to Red Rock to see the grave of his son killed in the Civil War; James Parks as O.B . the stage coach driver; and Demian Bichir as Bob, the Mexican who tells everyone he is just minding the store for Minnie who left for a while. Channing Tatum as Jody: comes in really late. Can't say more.This can be considered a classic WESTERN WHO-DUN-IT and we follow Major Warren's logic and see that he makes a lot of sense. I know in the past I have always accused Samuel L. Jackson - many times – of playing a character who likes to pontificate. So true in here as well. But truth be told, he is extremely good at it. Kudos. You almost expect him to ask you ""what's in your wallet?"" from an ad he's in. Ha! The telling of the General's son who performed fellatio on the Major was quite unnecessary.The shootings are what we come to this movie to see. Hey, this is a Quinton Tarantino movie! Ever see a watermelon blown away by a shotgun? That is what you will see when shots are fired at the heads of some characters. The CGI is unforgiving and there will be blood everywhere.The cinematography is so good that you wished you could take a picture of some scenery, put a frame in it and hang it on a wall.Although this is quite talky for most of the movie, the acting and dialogues are spot on and quite engaging. It's just that too many characters have too much to say. Ha! (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Quentin Tarantino = Genius!,"I watched this movie for two nights in a row in a local theatre, and dare I say so, this movie is amazing. It has amazing cinematography, sparely but greatly utilized soundtrack, and features some of Tarantino's stellar actors, which all did a great job.The plot is very well made, some consider it slow, but I think Tarantino did a great job and one of his greatest strengths, the dialogue, is awesome in this movie. I liked how you could hear the blizzard the whole time, which affected the tension, which for me was unbearable at times and got me on the edge of my seat.It also gave you a bigger feel of isolation and danger characters were facing in that cabin, along with coldness of their own. I didn't have a problem with racial slurs, because this was a movie in which the plot was a while after the Civil war, and they were standard for that times.Actors did a great job. Kinda forgotten Kurt Russell gave a great performance as John Ruth, and Samuel L. Jackson gave one the best performances of his career as a Major Marquis Warren. People complain that he is the same in every movie, but I disagree. You could feel his badassery in this movie, as his character was not to be messed with. Jennifer Jason Leigh got an Oscar nod, I hated her character, but it was because she gave a great performance and she was evil to the bone.The other stellar actor of his(Michael Madsen and Tim Roth) also gave great and fresh performances. In Tim Roth's Oswald I felt vibe of Christoph Waltz from Inglorious Basterds, which is only a good thing. One of Tarantino's great strengths is how he utilizes his stellar actors and they all fit so well in his films.Overall, I personally think that this is one of Tarantino's best works, it is a true film and it shows how Tarantino is the master of filmmaking and the greatest director alive. He pulls out great performances, has a great dialogue, and the tension is built up so well that when it hits the fan, you are left guessing and shocked. This movie also had a great vibe of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in it, which is also very good.Overall, for me this work is underrated and one of his greatest works. I am looking forward to a new movie from Tarantino, amazing job QT! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"I like Tarantino's style and this movie oozes that style, so it was easy for me to like...","""The Hateful Eight"": At this point if you go into a Tarantino movie and aren't sure what to expect then you've probably never seen a Tarantino movie. You should usually expect a good time with some fun characters, a lot of vulgar language with some racial slurs and even a few big buckets of blood. That is exactly what I received with this only in gorgeous 70mm Cinema Scope. Seriously, the cinematography was great in this film. And yes, I saw it in the Road Show with my amazing girlfriend who was more than willing to drive me about an hour away to see it on the BIG screen. This was a really good movie, out of the Quentin Tarantino film roster; I wouldn't say that this was my favorite of his because I do have a couple of issues with some of the editing choices and odd narration inserts planted a couple times in the movie. I still was more than thrilled that I got the chance to see the movie. I love Tarantino as a director and writer; he's made some of my favorite films of all time, such as ""Jackie Brown"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Reservoir Dogs"". He's a talented guy that has done another amazing job on a movie here.The film is about a group of men and one woman locked up in a cabin together over a night, one of the men is bounty hunter holding a prisoner to be hung by the neck. He believes that one of the other men isn't who they say they are and there is a lot of mistrust between them, of course. Twists and turns and a hell of a lot of cool dialogue between the characters, we have our movie. I'm not going to get too much into the movie because I believe it is worth seeing in the theater, especially if you love Quentin Tarantino. Between his two westerns, I would put ""Django Unchained"" above this movie, but I still really dug this one. So if you have the chance, I strongly say go see this where it is playing the Road Show version of it because you get some extra footage not seen in the other version, the full scope of the environment with its fantastic cinematography, an opening overture, an intermission, and a cool little booklet that talks about the making of the film. That's my two cents on the subject anyhow, if you see this in a regular old theater I don't believe you'll feel disappointed by any means, I just believe that you'd be missing out on a really cool experience is all. Either way, go check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Hateful Eight was another entertaining Quentin Tarantino movie,"I've yet to see Reservoir Dogs but I've seen just most every other Quentin Tarantino movie after that so I wasn't surprised by the kind of dialogue he wrote, nor the way he arranges some scenes out of sequence. I was surprised to hear mostly original music by Ennio Morricone (which just won him a Golden Globe which Tarantino accepted). Some familiar players-Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson-abound. One not normally in a Tarantino flick-Jennifer Jason Leigh-really tears into her part here. The only other movie she was in I watched all the way through was Fast Times at Ridgemont High when I was a teen so this latest of hers really impressed me and I now wished she had won the Globe as well! The expected violence was pretty entertainingly weird which was how my movie theatre-working friend described it when it was nearly over, at least that's what I was thinking when he said weird during that and then told a fellow employee he enjoyed it when asked! Anyway, that's a high recommendation for The Hateful Eight. Note: This review is of the general release version which is not in 70mm and has no intermission, therefore some cuts. Oh, and there's a mention of my current hometown of Baton Rouge in this but not in a good way...",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A FANTASTIC SNOW-FILLED MURDER MYSTERY,"I loved it , now my best will always be ""Reservoir Dogs"" & that's his ""MASTERPIECE"" but oh my this was great fun!!!
I loved the long & slow relaxed storytelling & interesting & strange characters, i love Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson & Bruce Dern!!!
A fantastic superb cast of talent involved.
The Hateful 8 is a long wild ride through the thick snowy countryside & further, the cold atmosphere is exciting & fun & full of mystery!!!
The dialogue is excellent & smart as usual for the genius Tarantino & his mix of strange characters are given full room to breathe & play out.
The performances are great especially from Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson!!! Both are on top form & are fantastic on screen.
Yes Kurt Russell is excellent & Samuel L Jackson is excellent, these two performances are the best in the film in my opinion, but hell the cast is superb all around!!!At times this movie definitely feels like it's Going into the Horror genre & feels very ""Evil Dead"" at times when the stage is set up at the stagecoach stopover where different travellers are taking refuge from a major blizzard.
There's an exciting who's gonna turn on who feel to it & a sense of doom, each character is given room to shine & when it gets bloody it gets bloody, old school brutal violence explodes accross the screen.
I loved the beautiful cinematography & the old school music score, this is top notch film making by a master at his most relaxed & confident.This is basically in a way Tarantino's ""The Thing"" but set around Civil War times & without an Alien but the mood, look, Atmosphere, music & the presence of the legendary Kurt Russell is just like ""The Thing""

Not just a once or twice usage but a prolific use. A usage to the point I became very bothered.Look, I'm not so naive as to think that the N word wasn't used excessively and exclusively at the time period represented in this movie, but it is a movie. The writer, director or some other exec does have a say. I don't think it would be considered historically inaccurate to not use the N word; shoot, there were probably a dozen inaccuracies as it was.Then again Quentin Tarantino seems to have an infatuation with the N word. From his superfluous usage in Pulp Fiction to Django Unchained it is unsettling.Barring that entire discourse, the movie was decent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brutally Entertaining,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film involves eight strangers stuck in one cabin during a harsh blizzard. What could possibly go wrong? After his script leaked for this film in 2014, Tarantino decided to shelf the project indefinitely. I'm glad he changed his mind. The Hateful Eight is a brutally entertaining film that gives a gruesome look at racial tensions and life on the 19th century western frontier.Since The Hateful Eight is set in only a few locations, the characters and their interactions need to be interesting and entertaining. The eight strangers are all very different, featuring unique backstories and intriguing character qualities. The dialogue between the characters is appropriately hilarious and hard-hitting, whichever the particular moment is calling for. Playing detective and trying to decipher who is telling the truth makes for an active and engaging time at the movies. This quality of the movie felt very reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's first film.There are some very gory and shocking moments in The Hateful Eight, which many have come to expect from a Tarantino film. One of these shocking moments in particular makes me think very differently about Samuel L. Jackson. This very easily might be Tarantino's most violent film (that's saying something). Tarantino haters might argue his films are style over substance, but that is simply not the case with The Hateful Eight. The portrayal of how different races treated one another during the post-Civil War era and the sheer brutality on the western frontier more than justifies the onslaught of on screen violence.Another staple of a Tarantino film is a longer runtime, and that is still the case with The Hateful Eight. It's nearly 3 hours long, but due to the fast and dynamic dialogue and the mystery behind the eight strangers, the pacing works in the film's favor. Nothing about the film feels bloated or unnecessary to the core story being told.My favorite performance outside of Samuel L. Jackson's was Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue. She's absolutely hilarious and completely loses herself in the role. She was nominated for this supporting role at the Golden Globes, for which she is very deserving. There's one performance that I am still not sure how I feel about, but due to the 'spoilerish' nature of the role, I won't name a specific actor/actress. It was just weird and kind of out of left field (if you've seen the film you know exactly who I am talking about).The Hateful Eight is one of my favorite films of the year, from one of my very favorite directors. It's an entertaining ride from start to finish, filled with intrigue and features one of the best scripts of the year. A violent movie with a violent message, what better way to celebrate the new year?Check out this review and many more over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Has justice been done?,"Hateful Eight is less cheesy than ""Django"", but the movie has problems of its own. This time, Tarantino gives us a more solid Western but also, gives us a little nasty work (no pun indeed) For the first time, in a Tarantino movie, I found some dialogs very unnecessary and uninteresting especially in the first two acts. Conversations in Pulp Fiction, Basterds and even Death Proof were brilliant, moving and smart. To watch Kurt Russell years later as the main hero (or at least one of them) was pure joy, a nostalgia, especially for 90s kids, but since his character is not deep or dominant caused by Tarantino's lazy script, his effect on the screen doesn't continue long. The character cannot be an unforgettable character like some other Tarantino characters. Michael Madsen by his offbeat character, was entertaining, but a bad-ass character would fit him much better. Just to throw us a curve, Tarantino wastes him. The character's low key manners don't make the movie brilliant or something. Then another plot twist in the flashback sequence, then another plot twist etc. all those u- turns don't give you goosebumps. The star of the movie is Leigh like Waltz in ""Basterds"". It was not acting, something else. It was just crazy and it may get Merly Streep roll in her bed! Tim Roth is the movie's Christopher Waltz in ""Django"". As for Samuel L. Jackson, anything to say? He is extraordinary! Leigh and Jackson steal the show whenever they have that chance! Zoe Bell was disappointing in her role. I am terribly sorry. Channing Tatum was good and solid, but he needed more adequate screen time. The flashback sequence is terrifying, it reminds you Kill Bill, but the tone of this sequence doesn't have an integrity with the other chapters. It sounds like a short film itself. A really impressive and shocking short film, but inside the movie, it was little odd. By the way, some cruel and vicious acts of some characters have a difficulty in giving us a ""hateful"" effect against them because of their portrayal in the previous chapters. My ""hero"" of the movie was Daisy and I can understand ""this film has some misogynist"" criticisms, not because of those punches, but because of that disgusting final who may give you vomiting! In the movie "" Inglourious Basterds"", we love Shosanna and then we hate Shosanna and then again we love Shosanna, but later we hate Shosanna. It is like Mr. Tarantino has a confusion about some of his characters written by him. In ""Hateful Eight"", for example, there is a character that ninety nine percent of the people would hate or there is another character with some repulsive actions, but later, they become hero. Sorry, but what? In contrast with the hype, ""Hateful Eight"" is not a bloodbath like ""Django"" or ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" It is not an action movie also. Don't expect gunfights like ""Unforgiven"" or like some other Western classics. The cowboys in this movie use their brains rather than their guns, but it is not like a smart chess game between cowboys. Also, slow-mo effects lessen the effect of some action moments. The character Warren played by hilarious Jackson loses his charm after his confessions. As said before, Russell is just great, but his potential was wasted after a while, because of some plot twists. Finally, in the final moments, I don't believe that there is anything for catharsis or anything that would make you cheered up. After the end credits, I asked myself, has justice been done?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the worst movies I've ever seen. JUNK,"I don't even know where to begin, this movie is god damn awful on so many levels. The characters are annoying. The movie is too long for such a plot. I wasted 3 hours of my life I wish I could get back. Its straight out boring. The first 2 hours and 30 minutes in are extremely boring, I wanted to stop watching, and I got angry. But the last 30 minutes were decent. Thats why I give it 1 star. This has got to be one of the dumbest movie plots I have ever seen. And the scenery is dull, 1 third of the movie is basically shot in a carriage, and the rest is shot in a cabin. I would never EVER watch this movie again, and you'd have to pay ME to watch this again. This movie is a total abomination, I have no clue in hell how it has over an 8.0 rating.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of his best,"Don't listen to the other reviews, this was a great movie and exactly what should be expected based on what Tarantino said. The first half of the movie was all buildup with great dialogue and beautiful cinematography; the 70mm shots gave a great feel to talking scenes, bringing to life the dialogue, as promised. There is not as much action in the film as Django, Kill Bill, and Inglorious Basterds, and while I love that, it's nice to see him brining back the witty buildup his earlier films had. It was more like a play, similar to Resivoir Dogs, and I'm anticipating the stage version Tarantino said he's working on. If you are expecting an action packed Western like Django, you totally misread the hype Tarantino was building up for this film. It may be long and not 'flashy', but there is plenty of action in the words and the faces of the actors. Nothing was acted poorly in this film. This is the type of movie you have to pay attention to and appreciate it for what it is, don't get frustrated that it's not paced like his last three movies. No character is particularly likable, but they are all equally as intriguing and fun to listen to. And when the violence breaks out, he filmed it in a way I've never seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Quantin is great folks, don't let haters ruin this marvel piece of cinema","Please embrace the movie of once in a life time director.Quantin is great in this flick,marvelous 70mm long shots, but I had to review by seeing such hate from some stupid hate monger.

Autistic Reviewers Opinion of This Movie.,"The plot is simple and easy to follow in five chapters, we first meet Major Marquis Warren stranded with three dead bounties being transported to Red Rock and hitches a ride with the well-known bounty hunter John Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue who he plans to see hanged for her crimes in Red Rock. John is suspicious for anyone trying to steal Daisy for her substantial bounty from him, and along the trip they also meet Former Lost-Causer militiaman and the supposed new 'Sheriff' of Red Rock Chris Mannix who convinces John to hitch a ride to town in his coach. Having a wild blizzard fast approaching behind them, they stop for the night to get shelter from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, where other unknown lodgers reside from the blizzard; Bob (the caretaker of the Haberdashery while the owners are on leave), Oswaldo Mobray (the hangman of Red Rock), Joe Gage (a quiet cowboy on his way to his mother's) and Sanford Smithers (a former Confederate general of the Civil War). A suspicious Ruth disarms all but Warren, but it becomes a long night of suspicion, deception and whom to trust for all these eight strangers as who is really telling the truth.The first act of the film is more of a character build up, where the audience is introduced to the eight strangers where they state where they come from and what is their purpose to the plot. The casting here is well chosen, with Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madson, Demián Bichir and Bruce Dern each playing the leading 8 characters while there is a small supporting cast that handle themselves easily and don't overthrow the leads. The best performances are a tough to pick as all the leading cast gave solid performances, but I give high approvals to Jackson, Russell Leigh, Goggins and Roth for making their characters believable and kept it going throughout the five chapters. The second act of THE picks up more on the brutal, over the top and bloody violence that occurs in Tarantino's films while resolving the plot and getting closer to the climax that gets bold and suspenseful, the results are great but there are moments where it could you make you feel uneasy and quench in your seats. The plot overall is great and carries the spirit of a Western film and as well a stage play but on the screen, but it can be long and dull ride for those who hate dialogue driven films as the violence plays out more in Act 2 but I thought each of the characters were given solid moments of seriousness, establishment and at times humour when needed.The cinematography is as beautiful and detailed throughout like the recent acclaimed film 'The Revenant', having watched the 70mm print we can see that Tarantino's camera work captures not only the characters on-screen but the snowy and yet detailed environment of the mountain scenery and cabin location (as most of the film is set inside of the cabin after we are introduced to each of the eight characters). The music score here is composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone (known his musical scores for other westerns such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and other excerpts used in Tarantino's previous films) has composed an entire original score that mark not only new work in recent years but the very first film for Tarantino that uses an original score than having to used licensed music and scores from various films. The music plays out as mysterious, engaging and yet at times feels like a horror film but it suits to the film so well that it won not only a Golden Globe for Best Original Score but an Academy Award nomination in the upcoming 2016 Oscars (due for air on February 28th) alongside with nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).Overall, The Hateful Eight can be seen by some as the weakest work from Tarantino as Django, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and even Reservoir still have a huge following and acclaim from fans and citric alike or seen as a great form of film but not as strong as the previous films. I however think that this is a solid presentation that keeps me hooked with character development, plot and the Tarantino quality that I have known of and earns a spot on my list of top films for 2016, alongside The Revenant.4 ½ / 5 - Nick",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not quite on par with some of Tarantino's better movies, but still a worthy entry into his expanding filmography","The Hateful Eight is a Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. While it's not quite on par with some of his better movies, it's still a worthy entry into Tarantino's expanding filmography. It's filled with all the directorial trademarks one would expect from his movies.During the cold winter of Wyoming, some time after the American Civil War, a bounty hunter and his prisoner take shelter in a cabin with a group of strangers to avoid an oncoming blizzard. Throughout the course of the night, an awkward tension starts to build as it becomes evident that not everyone is who they claim to be.This film contains all of the typical Quentin Tarantino movie elements. It has brutal violence, dry one liners and some creative cinematography. Samuel L. Jackson once again gives a memorable and bad-ass performance, as do Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. My only real gripe with the film was that the pacing at the beginning was very slow. I guess it was to showcase the tense atmosphere building up, but I feel that this could have been accomplished through alternate means. Overall, if you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Great Dialogue has Disappeared,"While probably his most beautifully shot film, Hateful 8 comes off as his most lazy effort; until the recently released 'Once upon a Time...' - to which is a horrible film.The carriage scene, which seems to go on forever - is nothing but exposition.All of the dialogue after that, is nothing but 'A to B' dialogue.In a blind taste test, I would NEVER guess this to be a QT film, the writing is so bad.Littered with great actors, as always (outside of Tatum) - they simply have nothing to work with.Outside of his best cinematography - the only real jewel of this lazy effort is Jennifer Jason Leigh; who absolutely should have got the Oscar for her performance.A one time watch of 6; a rewatch value of 3.But I'm still giving it the 6 - because of JJL's Oscar worthy performance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Bear Trap,"For a man who's awfully fond of four letter words, 'hate' may be Quentin Tarantino's most appropriate in encapsulating his eighth (ha) feature film. Saddled with a production narrative of script leakage and bitterness that eerily mirrored its parable of backstabbing and deceit, Tarantino's second western (or third, if you count Kill Bill Vol. 2) stubbornly slogged through all foreseeable obstacles like its antiheroes trudging through the deepening snow, just in time to wink at its Christmas Day release by opening on a crucified Jesus buried by a blizzard. And, after all that, critic-baiting as its title may seem, the final experience of The Hateful Eight is begrudgingly hard to hate. Dear God does he make you wait for it, but that sonofagun Tarantino has done it again, doggonnit.This is not immediately apparent. As if extracting his own revenge for the burn of initial script theft, Tarantino stretches his fondness for listening to his characters eloquently prattle on about repetitive, subtext-riddled inanities to the breaking point, introducing his band of miscreants in so playfully lackadaisical a fashion it's excruciating. But then, right when the viewer would be thrown into a rage by one more pregnant pause as Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell wax poetic about Lincoln, in comes another basterd (Hater?), and the field of carefully played out character dynamics and social politics has the rug yanked out from under it again. It's a dangerous waiting game Tarantino plays, and those watching in the privacy of their own home will be sorely tempted to scornfully give up. Trust me: stick it out. It's worth it.But don't be hasty. One we hole up in Minnie's haberdashery to wait out the punishing blizzard (and Tarantino has great fun building this rich, almost theatrical set, including a recurring gag necessitating nailing the front door shut every time it's kicked down), there's more waiting to be done, albeit with almost palpably thick storm clouds of tension preparing to burst. Here, we're reminded of what the 'hateful' in the title is really about, as Tarantino digs deep into the political fallout of the Civil War and the storied racism it fostered (which, as Tarantino himself would cheerily remind you, remains poignantly topical today), with far less problematically bungled racial politics than Django Unchained, though nearly as uncomfortably racially slurry (historically accurate? Sure. Necessary? Hmm). This infuses the Agatha Christie/The Thing-in- the-old-west's potboiler tension with prescient motive: any number of the fiends stewing in the haberdashery could by lying or have it out for one another for any number of reasons. So we wait. For the entire. Length. Of. An. Average. Feature. Film. And then, the bear trap narrative snaps viciously into play, and we're reminded why we keep giving this preening basterd our money in the first place.Insanely over-the-top bloodbaths, fourth-wall poking flashbacks narrated by none other than a smirking QT himself (including a dastardly cheeky wink about the benefits of patience, that rotter), and a razor-sharp context finally, cathartically, making itself known, The Hateful Eight's second half payoff IS why you came. It's vintage Tarantino, savagely funny and operatically violent, and all the sillier by being bottled by the pristinely precise cinematography (between this and The Revenant, most of 2015's most beautiful images involve blizzards) and sound work, and punched up by the visceral power of Ennio Morricone's sparse, soulful dirge of an original(!) score. Naturally, it's hard to decide who to root for - everyone is pretty irredeemable for their own reasons - but Tarantino's whip-pan power plays gleefully force you to decide, then hate yourself for it, in a sadistically playful puppeteering act that plays out in really the only way it ever could. Remember that whole first act chat about legal justice vs. frontier justice you discounted as more killing time? Yeah. You will.Samuel L. Jackson has been waiting twenty years for a meaty Tarantino lead role (again: delayed gratification), but his first one here does not disappoint. Eschewing his normal shoutiness, Jackson finds the power in calmness as he methodically pokes each character around him into going to pieces and showing their hand, his magnetic, force-of-nature charisma put to magnanimous use. Kurt Russell is equally riveting, his sour resolve as mighty as his moustache as he attempts to beat meaning out of the standoff and his prisoner alike. As said bounty, Jennifer Jason Leigh is a firebrand, gargling pathos, blood, and gallows humour with venomous ambivalence, as she is subjected to almost every possible indignity imaginable in this surly boys club. Walton Goggins is similarly disgustingly likable as the purported sheriff of the upcoming town, as impossible to get a beat on as it is impossible to assess whether his sheriff story is utter bunk or not. The rest of the miscreants, all Tarantino vets, patiently (see?) await their moments to shine -though Tim Roth's effetely weaselly gentleman- hangman and Bruce Dern's indignantly racist Confederate general are highlights - while even newbie Channing Tatum spits Tarantino verbiage like the best of them in a cameo that suggests Tarantino must be a Gambit fan.But, as the rogues simmer on about something being rotten in the state of Wyoming, is it worth the wait (in more ways than one)? Ultimately yes, though even Tarantino deserves a knuckle-rap for indulging himself almost to the breaking point here, when the same effect could have been fostered with up to an hour lopped off. Unapologetically bloated as it is, The Hateful Eight gives you all of the Tarantino mayhem you want to those patient enough to ride out the calm before the storm. Hell, it's probably the only virtue he's ever advocated for, so maybe it should be commended. Still: pairing Quentin with an editor who forces him to keep his running time under 90 minutes? Ultimate frontier justice.{And, of course, how could this be rated anything but:}-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of Tarantinos greatest,"This is by far one of the greatest films of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen in the cinema ever. And could also quite possibly become one of my favourite movies after a couple of more watches. Everything seemed on point and I was sucked in from the very beginning to the very end. As a Tarantino fan and movie fan I felt like I completely got my moneys worth and I enjoyed every second of it. I felt like a kid in a sweet shop whilst watching.With all that said, if you are a Tarantino fan, or a general film goer, or whatever your situation and you don't like it, or in fact even hate it, then I understand and you like what you like. But I personally don't care what anybody says, I loved this movie a lot and I couldn't get enough of it. Even though this is Tarantinos second western movie it is no way the same as Django unchained as the playful silliness is less present to create a more tense environment. But the movie still has the traits of all Of Quentins previous films such as the tension, Drama, humour, the Graphic violence and colourful language.The thing I love about Quentin Tarantino is not only his appreciation and passion for all types of films (especially exploitation film) but the fact he has the confidence to make a 3 hour movie at the pace that it goes and feel that his characters, story, direction and everything that the cast and crew bring to the project will be enough. And so he should be confident, as he and everyone involved pull it off brilliantly. And what they deliver is way more than enough.The cinematography is done perfectly and it sucks you into the movie creating that Tarantino style feel. The Soundtrack worked really well at creating the films menacing mood. I especially loved the song at the beginning credits as I think it sums up the movie perfectly. The characters were all interesting and mysterious that I wanted to learn more and more about them. The acting was superb by everyone in the movie and everyone looked great at the parts they were playing. The costumes fitted what the characters looked and acted like which was great.The locations were atmospheric and truly represented the beauty of the old west. The main cabin location was amazingly designed, with lots of little details fitted in. The direction of every scene in my opinion was greatly executed. And the story is easy enough to follow as it is a western style who done it. The less you know about the story before watching, the better it is. Although I do think you can still enjoy this movie a lot even if you do know some important story points. The Tarantino style is very present in the movie which will please any fans of his.The Violence like any other Quentin Tarantino movie is very in your face, graphic and mature but is a lot of fun to watch. There are also a few twisted scenes which are funny but also uncomfortable. The language, also like any other Tarantino films is also quite offensive throughout. Many racial slurs are thrown about but are usually for comic effect and I don't think should be taken too seriously.There aren't really any big problems I had with the movie. But a few little ones are some slow motion shots which I didn't think were necessary. Also a couple of the songs felt forced into the movie but it didn't bother me too much. The biggest problem I think a fair amount of people will have is the pacing of the movie, as this movie is 3 hours of character interaction. But its got enough going on to keep your interest and the length of the movie allows for a lot of tension to build for when certain things later on happen. If you are a Tarantino fan then I don't think this will bother you, but if it does then fair enough.I had a blast watching this movie. The more I think about it, the more I love it and want to see it again. the only reason this movies isn't a 10 is because I feel ill have to watch it a couple more times in my opinion. I hope when it comes out on DVD, it'll be an extended 4 hour version as I just want to see more of it. Like I said at the beginning if you don't like it then that's fine. I don't think the movie is for everyone but It definitely was for me. What more can I say other than see for yourself if you haven't already and see if you love it too. Also if you can see it in 70mm then id suggest doing it as that's the intended viewing Tarantino intended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Violence with a Point,"Much more of cinema has been formed and informed through the context of war than we would like to admit. Especially in American cinema, many of our uniformly appreciated classics are bookmarked by events such as WWII (Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List), Vietnam (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Taxi Driver) and even the Civil War (The General, Gone with the Wind, Birth of a Nation). We as the audience (and creators) often brush over these events, excusing them as background and fodder. And why not? There's built-in conflict, villains, maybe even a battle or two; it all leads to high octane excitement sure to inspire so long as you don't think about it for too long. Quentin Tarantino however does not want his audience to ignore context to fit his narrative. He wants it upfront; in your face and made personal.Marquis Warren (Jackson) definitely takes it personally when he's confronted by demons from his past; namely General Sandy Smithers (Dern) and Chris Mannix (Goggins) both of whom served the Confederacy with pride. Warren makes his living as a bounty hunter along with John ""Hangman"" Ruth (Russell) who just so happens to stop his stagecoach and pick the stranded compatriot up. Meanwhile Ruth is carrying Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh), a villain on the way to the hangman's noose until a blizzard holds up everyone at Minnie's Haberdashery.Despite what the title suggests there are originally nine indwellers at the stagecoach depot, most of whom are not telling the whole truth about themselves and what brought them there. Despite this, the Civil War hangs over the single roomed hobble like the chilly air of a deadly winter tempest. Those who participated find themselves at odds right quick and antagonize each other to the point of eruption. In the middle of it all is the devious Daisy who squeals with glee after every confrontation. As the story progresses and alliances are made and broken in Lord of the Flies-like procession, what's made clear is there were good and bad people fighting on both sides of the Mason-Dixie divide.Quentin Tarantino has gotten a lot more political with age and maturity. While always fond of controversy, and speaking with a unique cinematic voice, those not inducted into the cult of Tarantino have dismissed him as kitsch. He has always been more concerned with film as a form than how that form can be utilized. Yet with Django Unchained (2012) and to a lesser extent Inglourious Basterds (2009), that kitschy, idiosyncratic voice suddenly had a little more to say than wax poetically about the cinematic art.Though Hateful Eight isn't without it's Tarantino-esque excesses, not the least of which is his film 65mm to 70mm Ultra-Panavision transfer, his roadshow and his 3+ hour screen time (including an overture and an intermission). His fetish for a bygone cinematic era he himself never lived through, would carry more weight if he knew how to utilize such throwback technology. It is said he came up with the idea to shoot with the Panavision 65mm Hand-held and Studio cameras after watching Ben-Hur (1959) a movie that spanned decades, filmed on multiple sets and captured a world of color and magic not seen on the big screen until Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Hateful Eight features the haberdashery, the stagecoach and a few wintry landscape shots of Telluride and surrounding area. The results are serviceable but nowhere near the grandeur of Doctor Zhivago (1965) as was Tarantino's intention. That said those who appreciate his style yet have no idea where it comes from may be blown away while I just found it adequate.The political issues brought up in Hateful Eight are surprisingly contemporary given the fact that all characters talk about the Civil War as if it just happened. This was done on purpose by the filmmakers and Tarantino himself who has been under fire for speaking out against police brutality. Before Tarantino was using his style for style's sake, now he's using it as a weapon. A weapon that demands we wake up to the forming fault-lines of our own society before we make the same mistakes as our forefathers. A weapon that implores us to take notice to war within the context of the story on full display. A weapon that tells onlookers to focus on the war within ourselves or else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The N word... wow so many times.,"To put it simply, I'm tired of all QT movies. He frequently drops the N word in every one of his movies. Reservoir Dogs had no black people in it but still the N word is used. Its overdone in this and even more so than Django. if you like this, then you're probably a bigot. I could only watch the first 2 minutes in which they said the N word like 10 times. I really don't see why that is necessary In every film he makes. I can understand movies like 20 years a slave, but damn they didn't even drop it that much in that movie either. he has been fell off. He's washed up and his movies are weak with 30 minute dialogues over cigarettes for lames that en joy that kind of thing. Regardless of how much money he has, he's still a fat man with a huge ugly face and forehead. Needs to fix that first, then his attitude. I only give it 1 star because Samuel L is in it. Other than that, whatever. life continues, and can't wait to see this director kick the bucket, if you know what I mean. I'll be laughing and doing cartwheels.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's 8th Is Brutal Fun,"I saw The Hateful Eight twice in theaters - once in the 70mm Roadshow and once in its wide release - and I thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Tarantino takes somewhat of a revisionist approach to his second try at the Western, exposing through his trademark dialogue and over-the- top violence how brutal, dark - and, well, hateful - the West was, especially post-Civil War. Eight vile characters are locked up together in a cabin during a blizzard, with somebody being not who they claim. The concept certainly takes inspiration from other claustrophobic mysteries and thrillers (John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" immediately comes to mind), and Tarantino uses this to create characters that are likable in their horribleness, as well as build up a tense mystery over about two hours before exploding into a wild final act. The ensemble cast is top-notch (Jennifer Jason Leigh probably takes the cake with her performance), the pacing is excellent, and the script is both sharply humorous and sometimes quite shocking. Though some may certainly be turned off by the excessive gore, language, and one very shocking scene in particular, I found it to be a wild and fun experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino Does it Again,"To get the full effect of the movie I would recommend that you see the 70mm roadshow version before it's too late. The overture and intermission (with somewhat of an entr'acte leading into act 2) along with the fact that the movie was filmed with the same lenses used to film Ben-Hur bring back a method of exhibition I was never able to experience before in my lifetime.I admit I have a bias towards Tarantino, but honestly there were only a few flaws in the film, unlike what all the haters are saying. So before I get into the positives I'm going to refute the negatives. I've read this film is too long and ""overwritten."" Incorrect. I can't speak for the digital version yet, but the intermission gives you a chance to breathe before watching the second half of the film. Also, it may have a long duration, but (to me at least) it didn't feel THAT long. The dialogue is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat since it gets very tense from time to time.Another claim is that the mystery is not clever. While I would say yes to this, I would respond by saying that as you're experiencing the movie you come to realize that it really isn't trying to be clever, especially with Chapter Five following the ""reveal"" at the end of Chapter Four. Tarantino may have described it is like an Agatha Christie story, but who said he was trying to make a mystery as fully fleshed out as her stories? This is one of the reasons that justifies why the mystery aspect of the movie didn't come across clearly in the trailers. Although, to be fair, the main plot of this movie is difficult to explain, but the trailer does its best with Kurt Russell's ""I'm taking this woman to hang"" segment. The main problem I have with this film is basically the same one I had with Reservoir Dogs: it is a movie specifically focused on an ensemble, yet some of the main ensemble do not receive as much screen time and character development as others.These flaws are minor, and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. If you're experiencing this movie with a multitude of Tarantino fans as I did you're going to laugh at all the right moments. This is actually one of the funniest Tarantino movies I have ever seen, delivering great comic bits even in the most dramatic and tense sequences of the movie. Tarantino should honestly be the name of a genre in itself since he combines the comic with the dramatic time and time again within his films.This film is bloody as can be expected. And while some will have to avert their eyes from what happens on the screen, it is once again violence that is more ridiculous than disturbing or upsetting. But don't get me wrong, if you're not used to Tarantino violence, this movie may scar you mentally.My favorite sequence in the film is what occurs just before intermission because it made my jaw drop. You want to love Marquis Warren (Jackson), but this truly is The Hateful Eight, and you will hate him at the conclusion of the first half.Overall this movie seems like 2 different movies, the first seeming longer since it needs to establish what is happening in the first 3 chapters. And the last three chapters seem to go by quickly with all the fun Tarantino traits packed into them - you know, like Tarantino making a ""cameo"" by narrating in a comic manner, a jump in chronology - revitalizing the good ol' days of Pulp Fiction - and all the blood, humor, and intensity you can ask for.Finally, this film is simply satisfying at its conclusion which always sells a movie in my book.

I thought it was a very entertaining,"{First review so its going to be short} So some scenes were over the top. But this movie was very good in my opinion. Samuel Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh,and Walton Goggins were all great. One of the best movies by Quentin Tarantino I've seen. The movie kept me in my seat all the way from start to finish. Some reviewers didn't like the humor or violence but look at most QT movies. Most are violent and humorous. So what did they expect going into this movie? I liked the fact that you didn't know if Samuel was lying about the letter or not.

Typical QT frustrating stuff,"As always, there's good stuff here from QT but yet again, his indiscipline and self-indulgence drag this down to a 7 for me.QT is an undoubtedly capable writer but he is constantly let down with both the editing and what seems to be weak direction with respect to forcing his actors to deliver in a particular manner.Top of that list, I'm afraid, is Samuel L. Jackson who despite a generally good performance here, looks and sounds like he's just stepped out of 90's Compton and while that's always a problem for me in all his roles, it's all the more jarring in a period setting like this where all the other actors are delivering appropriate accents and mannerisms.As for the other actors, they are uniformly terrific. Kurt Russell is always good value and I was delighted to see Bruce Dern here still showing he's got the acting chops and then some. Special mention should also go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who I thought led the bunch with QT quite clearly pushing her towards an Exorcist looking appearance - she was superb I thought and I could push her for a Best Supporting Actress nod here ...I gather there's some fuss about the usage of the 'N' word here and while I think that's certainly an issue in the past, I don't have any problems with it in this setting. It's just post-Civil War for crying out loud and given the characters, it would seem inappropriate for that word *not* to be flung around all the time. Unfortunately, the issue I do have with it, and the 'MF' word is that yet again, Samuel L. Jackson is involved and I'm starting to have problems remembering a film where he *didn't* fling those words around all the time and it has become very, very off-putting for me and absolutely stops me from seeing him as anything else but Samuel L. Jackson, the guy who will look and sound the same in every film and you can bet your bottom Dollar that he'll be saying 'N' and 'MF' a lot, even if a film is set in 11th Century England ...Clearly, the guy is doing well in terms of making money and getting into decent productions but I for one started avoiding his ""work"" some years ago because he ruins everything he's in for me - he's the black Keanu Reeves - I only managed to see this because of the amount of spare time I have over Xmas, otherwise I would have ducked it like all his other films ...All in all, this is worth a watch but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it ...Here's hoping that QT will, eventually, get a grip on himself and start making films that hit everyone in the right spot, not just himself and, presumably, his large gang of 20-something fans ...",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not Nearly Tarantino's Best, but Still Entertaining","While The Hateful Eight is nowhere near Tarantino's best work, it's still a very enjoyable piece of art. I think that's what Tarantino makes, works of art. Art is always up for interpretation and The Hateful Eight is really no different. Saying it's not his best work doesn't mean much considering he has made some of the most significant and influential films of the past 25 years. Even though I would probably rank it 6th among all of his films, there's plenty to love about the film.First and foremost, the performances are great, in particular Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson. Although I will say, Tim Roth's character had to be written for Christoph Waltz in mind because his character feels a lot like Waltz' character in Django or Inglorious Basterds. Tarantino's script is good but it doesn't leap off the pages like his other films do. I can't really see it having too many lines that are quoted for years to come like Django or Pulp Fiction. The rest of the eight (or really 9 people) that fill the cabin during a massive blizzard have some good moments, but no scene will really blow you away. Tarantino's ultra violent style is present, but the film's structure is much more in the vain of Reservoir Dogs than it is Django or Inglorious Basterds. I really expected this film to be a 3 hour version of the pub scene in Inglorious Basterds, and it wasn't. The tension just wasn't there. As much as I loved Ennio Morricone's score, it didn't really add to the film in the way I hoped.I'm not sure if it was a lack of development in the characters, (because you really only get to know half of them), or maybe it's just that my expectations were so high, but The Hateful Eight turned out to be a good but not great outing at the movies. Tarantino does however do a great job at setting the scene throughout the film in terms of the blizzard and freezing atmosphere the characters are surrounded in. So much so that the man sitting next to me mentioned to his friend that he was feeling cold just by watching the film.The film presents itself as a mystery in the same vein as Clue or even Murder by Death and it does have some surprises along the way where you find yourself guessing throughout. With that said, I'm not sure the result is worth the 3 hour wait. I'm not totally sure Tarantino needed to make it that long. The Hateful Eight is worth seeing though, but maybe it's a film you see at your house where you can pause it every chapter instead of one long viewing.+Tarantino setting the scene and scope of the film very well+Performances, particularly Jackson and Leigh+Morricone's fantastic score+Some surprises-Not as memorable as some of his other films-Length may not be warranted7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
magic....,"one of Tarantino's best movie... it builds up slowly... to arrive at a powerful end... this is why we love Tarantino.... I usually fall asleep watching a movie.... not this one.... each actor is precisely in the place he should be and we can watch a masterpiece slowly unravel before our eyes... I usually comment as I watch a movie... but during nearly 3 hours, I sat on the edge of my seat trying to absorb every little detail and make sense of the end. I usually know whats happening - or going to happen... not in this one... I heard Tarantino was making his last movie with this one... I hope not. I will go again and see it... probably 3 times before I have it all imprinted in my head. Magic... simply magic....",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"If I Received 100 Dollars When  the N-WORD was used $5,000 I would have .","The film was entertaining .And what made it a true Tarantino film was the humor ,Camera shots,the flash backs and the N-WORD .

Gasbag of a poor film,"Well that's 2 hours of my life I have lost forever. What a shocker. The script ( and there's plenty of it ) was just plain bad, not a memorable line in it. Just an excuse for QT to break the N word taboo. I expect he thought we would all gasp in shock but really everyone I was with just groaned with the lameness of it. And the blood and gore effects were just as bad as in Django, straight out of a low budget horror film, do your homework QT and try and get it right because realism is a lot more shocking than cartoon blood and gore. And the time line really was poorly thought out but I suppose that's Hollywood Film making... all up front with no thought to the finer details. No point mentioning the actors because other than Kurt Russell the rest were forgettable, even Samuel L Jackson played his standard character with no surprises.

Everybody saying it was boring... poor people..,"Reading a lot of reviews saying the movie was ""too long and boring"", ""too many dialogs"", ""almost no violence"" (excuse me?? The last third part of the movie compensates very well the gore part you ""missed for so long""). I have also listened people saying this bosh in the theater.. People is saying that they were ""fans"" of Tarantino's movies but that they hated this one. If you are saying that it is boring and that there are also too many dialogs, then maybe you have never seen a Tarantino movie, it takes is time, the style of the movie is iper-realistic, so why are you saying there are too many dialogs and the movie is boring? You are saying that because you are the classic middle-man who watches movies chatting with the phone on one hand, doing other things, and then pretending the movie is clear for you and that has moment of actions that will make you appreciate it as a kid that need films with explosion, shootings, stereotypical characters to compensate your uncultured mind. Really, tell me why you went to theater to see a Tarantino's movie if you never liked dialogs that takes their time, and if you never liked Tarantino's genre in general. I don't think that this is considered a review, hope it is published. Sorry for my English, really tried to write it in the best way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
People expect the wrong things,"I actually liked The Hateful Eight very much. I read some reviews here on IMDb, and as a fan of Tarantino's work, I was afraid to see the actual movie in the cinema. I expected to be disappointed..In some way I understand the hate from a lot of people, I admit, some parts of the movie are veeery long and yes, not all the dialogues are that interesting. But the movie is to damn good in cinematography, acting and the whole setting to give this movie so much hate!I am sure, if someone else, let's say a new director, someone we never heard of, delivered this movie, everybody would be really exited! It's because Tarantino made some kind of different movie, everybody is so disappointed..I really don't understand that people call them self a film 'fan' and dislike this movie so much. It's maybe not what they expected, but it's very good and still got the genius Tarantino's sense of humor in it! And also the 70mm anamorphic experience is sick!

Very Good but not top narration,"Briefly:Actors = excellent (it's always easier to deliver when you are directed by a master) Photography = fantastic Editing = very good Direction = possibly Tarantino's top (shot wise) Narration = not his best ever. Why?To be honest for a few minutes (during the second half of the Third Chapter) I was afraid Tarantino failed this film (in spite of a great beginning); he's an extraordinary screenwriter capable of giving his characters remarkable complexity, but it occurred to me he was going a bit too far on this occasion (a bit redundant dialogs to make the protagonists' nature fully emerge), and I even yawned a couple of times when the first hour was about to strike (my heavy dinner helped in that)!Luckily the second part has a completely different pace which helps the whole picture get a different perspective.There are a couple of narrative Voice Overs which I found pleonastic, however, this is a Great Movie.I still have to watch it 2/3 more times to be 100% sure about that.His only film comparable with this one is ''Inglorious Basterds'' but ''The Hateful Eight'' picks a different genre (Horror, besides Western).There are explicit references to ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (i.e. Cheyenne), but the western picture which inspired him the most is Sergio Corbucci's ''The Great Silence'' (1968).Western can be magic (whether it's Hawks, Ford, Leone, Peckinpah, Tarantino or Eastwood), no doubt about that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Creative but Limited Plot,"The plot is well outlined if you have seen the trailers for the movie. A blizzard keeps 8 dangerous characters in a cabin together during a Blizzard. All the characters have something in common which is their interest in a prisoner. The way it is filmed was quite remarkable. The scenery along with the props was well shot out.Quentin Tarantino really shows his skills at making a story in which every character has a purpose and every cause and effect makes sense. Just watch for the little things in the movie that the camera focuses on. Its one of those movies where every color and shot has a purpose.I guess the only issue I had with the film was that it was a three hour movie in a cabin with a very limited plot. There's only so many places that the plot could eventually turn. I'm not going to lie, though I had many interesting facial expressions while watching the movie, I was not impressed at the ending. My wife did not like the movie, and she gave me a dirty look every time there was a racial slur or guts getting blown apart everywhere. Though there may have been a lot of it, it didn't deter me from the artistic values of the film. Trust me, there is lot more violence and swearing in this film than any other film he has directed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Reservoir Dogs Part 2 ?,"I'm sure that I cannot be the only person that thought the recent Star Wars movie was very similar to the original Star Wars movie. This thought crossed my mind again when watching ""The Hateful Eight"". It reminded me a lot of Reservoir Dogs. Quite possibly my favourite Tarantino scene ever was the opening of Reservoir Dogs in the cafe. There are a few scenes in Hateful Eight which are somewhat similar to that scene in terms of dialogue and style. Obviously that can only be a good thing.Anyway although the Tarantino stories are very diverse you are more or less guaranteed a great script. The Hateful Eight is set in Winter and follows a bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russel) as he takes his captor Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) for reward. The cast are excellent and the movie is gripping throughout. Incidentally some people may think it's a bit short of action, but the action is in the words rather than the deeds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of Tarantino's better movies,"I'm not a Quentin Tarantino fan. His movies are self indulgent, appallingly overlong and despite the fact that they're what everyone complains about- style over substance- everyone seems to love them. Reservoir Dogs is a great film, but Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, while good films in many ways, were bloated, overdone epics of nothingness. The Hateful Eight, which is a stage play style murder mystery set in a cabin in America shortly after the Civil War. 8 unlikable characters, including a bounty hunter and his prisoner, are there and soon things get tense and the blood starts flowing. This seems to be dividing audiences quite a bit. For me, this is actually better than Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. With the amazing 70mm cinematography is amazing, and Tarantino shows he's a very good director as well as a good writer. This is a pretty dark movie, and it has various thought provoking themes which work well. The claustrophobic setting and tense murder mystery narrative make this feel more focused and suspenseful, unlike some of his other films which just rambled on all over the place.Acting is typically excellent, especially from Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and since this felt thematically deeper and far more tense than some of Tarantino's other films, I enjoyed this more. It was actually about something for once. I was interested in The Hateful Eight since it was mostly in one location and had a budget of $44 million. It looked more like Reservoir Dogs, so I thought I'd get on better with this one. I did, but I also thought Tarantino might restrain himself a bit here. Not so. This movie is nearly 3 hours long and before they get to the cabin, it's pretty desperate. It's as bloated and self indulgent as ever, although it uses its non linear storytelling well. At times ugly and often featuring rambling dialogue sequences which could be done in a few lines but instead go on and on, this struggles to maintain the energy of its best sequences. As for the violence? A bit exhausting and superfluous, but Tarantino knows how to do a shootout. A decent movie; outrageously overlong but it shows Tarantino being more arty and mature as a filmmaker and writer, so it should be relatively satisfying for most.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Another Home Run from Tarantino,"The Hateful Eight is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others. It really is a star filled cast.First of all props to Tarantino for releasing this film even after the script was leaked back in the day. Thank you for releasing this movie. I have to say, I applaud his efforts. I really do. He is really trying to pay homage to the westerns of the 1960's and just from the opening you get that feel. Everything from the locations to the shots makes this feel like a legitimate western. As much as I love Tarantino's previous film, Django Unchained, it didn't really feel like a western to me, but a really good Tarantino film. The Hateful Eight feels like a western. Something that really helps add to that feel is the score by Ennio Morricone, who composed the scores for many westerns back in the day, including The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.Now, did the movie HAVE to be released in 70mm? No, I don't think so, but the Roadshow showings this movie had and the effort Tarantino put into it makes me respect him even more because that's just the love he has for cinema. He makes every movie of his so cool, but it seems effortless and that's one of the many things I love about him as a filmmaker.Every performance in the film is spectacular, but I really particularly enjoyed the performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. They were great in the film. Some people I heard saying this movie was boring, which at least for me it really wasn't. The movie is 3 hours long, it did not feel that long, at all. I can see why people would find the lack of locations maybe boring for them, but really I find that lack of locations the reason why this movie succeeds for me. Most of the movie takes place in a cabin, which works great because you feel the isolation, you feel the tension building up to the climax of the film. The use of location was great, it actually felt cold as I sat in the theater and watched this. I love that they filmed in real snow, as well. Every single chapter in the film is great and the story does advance rather slowly, but this is a movie that relies on that tension that is a result from that slow pace and from the amazing dialogue.I found the cinematography great, the direction was great, the performances as well. There is to me but one, I don't want to call it a flaw, because it really isn't, but it's more of an observation, but I want to mention it. Without spoiling anything from Django Unchained, I want to relate something from that film to this one. You can say that the ""meat"" of the film in Django is everything that happens until the last few minutes of the film. And what happens at the end of Django (which is actually great, by the way) feels just like a cherry on top of the film. It doesn't really advance the plot anymore, but it gives the viewer a certain kind of satisfaction. The same goes for The Hateful Eight. You are constantly trying to figure out throughout the first chapters of the story, who the bad guy or guys is/are, and it's pretty cool, it's much like playing Clue with Tarantino characters and dialogue. So as the plot advances, you realize this person isn't the bad guy and then this person and so on, so you start discarding characters, but there is a point in the movie where just abruptly find out who the bad guys are and their real motivation. After that, in Tarantino fashion, you know what's coming. What happens next feels like the movie is almost over, but the movie gives the viewer a certain satisfaction. Now, like I said, this isn't really a complaint or a flaw but it's an observation in the last Tarantino films.There is a part of the movie where Daisy starts playing the guitar and singing a song, I loved every single thing about that. It was directed perfectly and the tension just starts building up. It's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.That being said, I loved the Hateful Eight. I am sure I even liked it more than Django. You can nitpick all you want and you may or may not like Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker, but you can't deny the fact that the man puts so much love and effort into his films. That has to add something to it. Like many Tarantino films, the Hateful Eight doesn't feel like a movie, it's an experience, kind of trip back in time to the great films and times of the past. The Hateful Eight is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Period Piece .... Ahead of its Hour; Psychosexual Inhibition vs. Quietistic Racial Prejudice,"I've read just about every 1 star review of this film. Beside noting that most of them are from accounts less than a month old (as of January 2016), even more notable is their dearth of insight whatsoever. ""Absolute garbage"" they exclaim. ""Smelly garbage"" they bellow from behind thumbed noses in single-paragraph adolescence.Even if you can't appreciate the subtler aspects of cinema, such as composition and use of color (no please, not the n****r word), surely these surly reviewers must've noted Tarantino's use of on-screen space, his blocking of actors, and the invisible in-character reactions they have to each small development. Easily more apparent; Quentin's film may be set at a single set, but it has more compositional variety than 19/20 movies made. Bar editing, composition is the most psychically evocative element of emotive visual storytelling. Quentin is a virtuoso in this department, never more palpably than with this film.Most drone on about how the smart introspective dialogue drones on. They must prefer the ear-drilling tunes of clunk like ""Directly under enemy scrotum"" from Transformers X, or perhaps even ""I like the way you die, boy"" from Tarantino's precedent masterpiece, which they can quote the next day at work even without context.Consider the verse ""Considering all the things I done for money, I ain't one to judge but...don't you feel just the least little bad about hangin' a woman?"" Chris Mannix. OR "" Ain't you got mixed emotions about bringin' a woman to a rope?"" Major Warren.Those two lines betray the deep, multi-layered irony in the final shot of the film.It's Tarantino inviting us to inspect the apparent misogyny the film is deceptively wrapped in. The responses to both characters, from two others (Ruth and Mobray) relay the head and tail of the same misogynistic beast; To Ruth, Domergue's lack of grace disqualifies her femininity as an emotive, self-restrictive tool. To Mobray, womanhood has no bearing on the gravity of an atrocity. She isn't a woman to Ruth, and Mobray couldn't care that she is. Mobray is the dispassionate of the two. But then again...there is no Mobray.The ""dispassion is the very essence of justice"" monologue is another twist of the contemplative knife; it's the verbal setup for eventual situational irony, a reciprocal of Pulp Fiction's ""Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fu*ked by anybody, except Mrs. Wallace."" It's a continuation of the subtle thematic lifeline that runs through Quentin's filmography: He creates the characters, they write themselves a plot, he writes the Story--and the three elements never align, into a contrived Third-Act eclipse.When a character gets his head bloodily brecciated, it's not only over-the-top Quentinry, it's a story-point. That's how elaborate the scheme is. The characters talk and talk and poeticize their pasts. Sure, it isn't as electric as Tarantino's former poesy (Come on, give the 1870s characters a break; they haven't heard 'Like a Virgin', been to Amsterdam or been in a pilot of Fox Force Five yet) but the film reaches a new laid back, naturalistic real-time feel to it. It's Quentin's coziest film yet.The ""beggin' for his life"" monologue by Major Warren, too, is full of ingenious touches; ""I grabbed me a handful of that black hair at the back of his head"" is double-edged. General Smithers as objectively observed has a (genetic or geriatric) white head of hair, so it's a two-way bet on whether his son would be or wouldn't be black-haired. Then, phenotypically, most male, Black humans don't have a handful of hair at the back of their heads, so that dips the icy pin further in some thematic racial poison. Plus, it's full of the fanciful tautologies Tarantino is famous for: ""When I knew me I had the son.....I knew me I was gon' have some fun."" Smile.To earn this monologue (and its aftermath), Smithers romanticizes his racism saying; ""I don't know that n*g*er, but I know he's a n*g*er; and that's all I need to know."" How many writers, from any epoch, in any medium, can pack so much character and so much of a character's world-view into such a neat, pithy epigram? A shortlist, with Tarantino close to its helm.Basterds and Django were satisfying, even at first-watch, because of how exuberantly executed they were. Second-watch proved the films more ruminative. With The Hateful Eight....its most thought-provoking meta-aspect is witnessing all the under-observed wrawling of witling naysayers: ""Ooh, it gave me crucifix-nightmares! Ultra-talky! Made me THROW UP! It's a snuff film!"" They've accrued a blunting critical irony now. To quote Major Warren: ""Hahaahahahaha, Whooo!""It's a sad moment for filmmaking that this masterly mood piece gets vituperated not out of objective outrage, but because The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino doesn't have the epic chic nor end with a fiery explosion in the tradition of his 6th and 7th. When my grandkids ask I'll tell them.... I'll tell them the story of how Grande Cinema died. It wasn't due to dumb directors telling silly effects-stories, no. It was a murder committed by impatient audiences.A warm kiss, and a loving 8/10 for The Hateful Eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino at the nth degree,"I watched The Hateful Eight the first day it came out, about a month ago, and I totally loved it! So I went back to the cinema a few days ago to have the pleasure to watch it a second time, and it was even better. Tarantino is my favourite director and every piece of film he puts his hands on ends up to be incredible. He truly loves cinema. He looks up for the best directors and studies their work in order to improve his. His passion to film and attention to details are outstanding. As Brad Pitt himself said in an homage to Quentin's Inglorious Basterds: ""(Tarantino) is a man who believes in the power of film. (...) He's a serious filmmaker, he's a unique voice for our time, he's a purist. (..) He's a joy to work for, he's a joy to work with and if you've happened to forgotten what you loved about movies in the first place I tell you you'll only have to spend a night with Quentin."" When Tarantino writes a screenplay he literally thinks about everything. He doesn't just write the story, he asks himself why a certain character is like that and what could make him/her interesting and why. He studies deeply each and every detail of someone's personality, he knows everything about them. Even the stunts, he wants them to act, to feel what the character is going through. And then there's the casting, he always pays incredible attention to the this part of the pre- production. He puts so much effort in searching the right actors because he knows that if he wants the script to come to life he needs the best ones (for the role). And indeed he always succeeds. But now let's come to The Hateful Eight. This film is a masterpiece. Shot entirely in two locations, as Tarantino himself said, ""is a theatrical play"". In fact he stated that one day he would love to bring it on stage. The development of the story is marvellous. The narrative of the film slowly takes you to a point where you find yourself immersed in a sea of questions and then cleverly answers them, of course in a pure Tarantino style. As always the film is divided in chapters, all but one in a chronological order. This film is Tarantino at the nth degree. It's purely based on dialogues, and boy he's the king of dialogues. I was indeed very surprised, and also quite disappointed, when I found out he wasn't been nominated for Writing — Original Screenplay. The directing is outstanding, as usual, and the cinematography in particular is wonderful. The music score by Ennio Morricone is extraordinary but it's not at all surprising knowing il maestro. The soundtrack is one of the few Oscar nominations the film has got. In my opinion it should win hands down even though, with 6 nominations, Morricone never won an Oscar (yeah, that's unbelievable!) if we exclude the honorary one given to him in 2007. Although his music is always wonderful, in this particular movie I think he did a seriously incredible work. I've heard many saying this film is not as good as the previous ones but I strongly disagree. First of all I don't think there's even one bad movie he made. Secondly you can't really compare Tarantino's movies because they're all so different one each other. I read people commenting that this is not even nearly as good as Django but, even considering they're both in the same period, Django and The Hateful Eight have nothing in common, so it's not really fair to compare them. I love both of them but, as previously said, they're very different. Tarantino stated that he's going to make only 10 movies in his life (this was the 8th) and after that he'd love to move to the theatrical field. This movie is a sort of transition between the two similar but with many differences worlds. His reason for doing so is that he wants to make only great movies. I like this. He's not someone who makes a movie a year so he can get as much money as possible, he thinks through his work, he studies it and only when it's perfect he finally makes and releases it. As we've seen with his last work. The Hateful Eight is done in 70mm Ultra Panavision, a format used extremely rarely in the industry and not used in decades because of its difficulties. But its wonderful result and Tarantino's love for film made him pursues this adventure and release a film that is a masterpiece! Am I sad that we only have 2 movies left from this genius? Yes, of course. And the worst thing is that when he'll move to theatre I won't be able to see it because I don't live in the US. But, as I said earlier, I love that he's not sold his soul for money but only for the beauty of film making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A fine road show picture,"This is a better film than I expected. It was as good as I hoped. While I won't call it a masterpiece, it is definitely a B+.Some think it drags. It does not. There are no long speeches and the dialogue is for the most part well-suited to the situation.The realism here is impressive as is the detail. It doesn't look cold. It was cold. The interior scenes were shot in the cold to maintain verisimilitude and I for one appreciated that.The character of John Ruth is melodramatic almost to the point of being cartoon-like. That is the one serious flaw I find with the writing. The narrative flashback to explain the setup is a bit out of place, but the choice not to begin at the beginning was the right one.See it in 70mm if you can. The high resolution is impressive, especially obvious when faces are in view.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A glorious bloodbath that celebrates the strengths of Tarantino and the incorruptible aesthetics of his films,"Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" has gone through hell and back again to get made, originally axed after Tarantino's distribution of the script to Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen led to one of the men leaking it onto the internet. After more-or-less throwing a tantrum over the entire event and shelving the project as a result, Tarantino, with massive fan support, per usual, decided to pursue turning the story into a film once again, and all seemed well until the film itself was leaked onto the internet just a few days before the release.The checkered history of the film's release before it was even able to be seen in a theater - where the film should ultimately be seen - is one of the strangest for a mainstream film in many years. In my opinion, however, it only adds to the craziness that is ""The Hateful Eight"" as a whole. At just under three hours (or just over, if you catch the 70mm/Ultra Panavision 70 version in over one-hundred theaters in America), Tarantino's sprawling epic is a smartly written mystery, largely acting as a stageplay about eccentric souls stuck inside a haberdashery in the midst of a relentless and frigid Wyoming blizzard.The film opens with Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a local bounty hunter, hitching a ride from a notorious bounty hunter named John Ruth (Kurt Russell), also known as ""The Hangman."" Ruth has a woman named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) shackled to his arm, as he plans to turn her in for the $10,000 bounty as soon as they get to a place called ""Red Rock."" Warren tags along in order to get to a place called Minnie's Haberdashery to wait out the blizzard before finally traveling to Red Rock. Along the way, the three pick up a man named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the new sheriff in town, and upon arriving at the haberdashery, the four are acquainted with another shady bunch of men, including a quirky Englishman (Tim Roth), a Mexican man (Demián Bichir), a ""cow puncher"" (Michael Madsen), and a largely quiet World War I veteran (Bruce Dern).""The Hateful Eight"" is undoubtedly my favorite Tarantino film since ""Death Proof"" (noticed I said ""favorite,"" not ""best""), even if we're only going to speak of the film's immaculate cinematography, done by frequent collaborator Robert Richardson. Speaking as someone who doesn't know a great deal of anamorphic aspect ratios or the core issues with film and digital media, I'll explain the effects of Ultra Panavision 70 in layman's terms. 70mm basically allows for extremely wide-widescreen shots, allowing for a grand scope to be seen. Where full-screen typically letterboxes the sides of a film and, in turn, cuts off the sides of the image and widescreen allows those formerly subtracted sides to be seen, Panavision allows for a much wider shot to include even more than a widescreen image ever could.As a result, the film looks like what a widescreen film used to look like on your old Television set, where the imagine is a long rectangle with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The decision for Tarantino and Richardson to shoot ""The Hateful Eight"" in this manner allows the luscious imagery of the snow-covered mountains in Wyoming to be shown with pristine detail and beauty. Even though more than half of the film takes place inside a haberdashery, Tarantino still manages to use 70mm to capture the details of characters' costumes, facial expressions, and backgrounds in a way that's simultaneously subtle and decorated.With that, ""The Hateful Eight"" is also a brilliant collection of seriously compelling performances, especially from Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell, both men giving very different performances. Jackson plays menacing but eloquent in a way that he hasn't quite done since ""Pulp Fiction,"" while Russell shows that working with Tarantino consistently brings out the best in him as an actor. Russell needs to fire on all cylinders here, occasionally having his character be more laidback and reasonable, despite largely acting as a blunt-force ready to bash Daisy's face in whenever she steps out of line. His performance here is a truly magnificent work of diverse acting abilities, and with Tarantino's liberal runtime, he's about to include and emphasize that kind of layered acting.Being a Tarantino film, you will inevitably get your accusations of homophobia, with one particular monologue by Samuel L. Jackson that does go a bit too far in terms of not being too funny or very relevant as much as it is for shock, racism, with Tarantino's excessive use of the n-word, and misogyny thanks to the only real female role in this film being a punching bag for the men (though Leigh does indeed get time for her and her character to shine). My biggest gripe with Tarantino's unchanging style is that the violence in the last act of the film takes away from the engaging setup and grace the first act really emphasized. The slowburn opening of the film really capitalized off of a premise that was going to take its time to move from character-to-character, but Tarantino seems to be unable to remedy or push his appetite for violence and bloodshed by the wayside by the conclusion of the film.""The Hateful Eight"" is still a devilishly interesting film; at nearly three hours, it's never boring and through terrific performances and seriously beautiful cinematography, reminds audiences why we love Tarantino for all that he can do and do so well. For as merciless and as violent as this film can be, it's also an undeniably great time and an aesthetic achievement for the director himself, which, in a day and age where Tarantino can pretty much say three words and make front page news, is about the most we can ask from him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
In need of a good re-edit,"Reservoir Dogs in the west, and half again as long, which means it's too long.""Was it entertaining?"" Yeah, but again, long.

"Suspenseful, unpredictable, hilarious, and shocking all at the same time. Anyone expecting something similar to 'Django' or 'Basterds' will be disappointed.","First of all, before you see this film, erase any expectations you may have in your head about what you're about to see. All you need to know is that this is a murder mystery disguised as a western and is a unique experience unlike any film you've seen in a very long time. This movie is obviously not for the squeamish or for those who like their films politically correct that ends with the hero riding off into the sunset.Suspenseful, unpredictable, hilarious, and shocking all at the same time; this movie challenges the audience in many ways. The much- discussed use of the 'n' word is here but QT uses it to establish the world that these characters live in. This film in many ways is a huge metaphor on race relations in America today especially with recent headlines concerning police brutality against black people. Also, this movie was purposefully made so that there is no ""moral center"" or clear cut ""good guy"". Every main character in this movie has a murky past that makes it hard for the audience to trust any of them. This is what differentiates this film over QT's earlier mainstream hits like ""Django Unchained"" or ""Inglorious Basterds"". As such, this might rub some viewers the wrong way who prefer their films to have a clearly defined ""good guy"" to root for.All of the actors here give incredible performances from A to Z. My only complaint is that it could have been shortened a bit. But overall, it's another solid creation by Tarantino that I believe will be more appreciated as time goes on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Average Eight,"Seriously i know Django (in parts) was silly but overall it was a fun little western that flowed nicely and was very fun to watch.But this?Imagine 8 Great actors sitting in a log cabin for 3 hours shooting the Shiite and this is basically all you get, the whole movie only has 30 Min's top of actual stuff going down which normally is a good thing in dialogue heavy movies such as this but this particular cut QT did is so overly long and BORING i could not bring myself not to get bored and nod offpeople will probably say i am a stupid millennial blah blah blah you hate QTNO I Don'tI like his movies hell i LOVE kill bill but this is just boring overly long tripe to be honest.Even IF he manage to get the movie down to 2 hours or so of running time there is still 90 minutes of worthless crap, people sitting around talking in character (barely, as much as i like Channing Tatum his character was pretty crap and his acting wasn't much better, fun cameo but thats about it)It feels like its part of a much larger movie that unfortunately just never ends up happening.Wheres the conclusion, They never get to red rock and they never leave that cabin the whole movie is boring anti climatic wreck that if ANYONE other than QT had made would have just been average but because its made by Quinten Cuckorino they love it.Go watch Django, The Revenant or something else that is actually good.8/10 but IF you manage to make it through without sleeping through the boring parts you might not like it, only reason i gave this 8/10 is for meme factors because its going to get spammed 10/10 by shills anywayThis is a long movie and it feels just as long, i want my 3 hours back QT.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A compelling narrative that relies on good story and quirky characters,"I was surprised by how entertaining this movie is, despite its long runtime. And what's best: no flamboyant displays of technique and large budget. A honest film, that relies on a compelling story and fine acting. The rather complex plot reveals itself as we watch the interactions between the quirky characters, accompanied by a sensible dose of humour. The overall look of the movie is of good taste, and the influence of old westerns is blatant right in the opening credits.The portrayal of violence is crude, that's true. That will be noticeable right in the first scenes. But, frankly, no one should expect something different from a Tarantino movie. No complex, multi-layered, thoughtful social critique here; just archetypal (almost bizarre) western characters doing what they do best. By the way, the cast choices seemed very appropriate. Samuel L. Jackson absolutely nails all the badassness, dark humour and integrity his character requires.I think that the director managed to showcase again distinctive elements of his work, making this a worthy watch. I must admit that some aspects of the gruesome plot left me a bit upset, but that does not diminish the quality of the film at all. Just remember: this is a Tarantino western.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Violently Yours,"The brutal depiction of violence in this western will definitely do your appetite no good. The unsightliness of the blood and gore is not for the squeamish . Tarantino leaves little to imagination as minute after minute the various shades of violence come into play . As far as acting is concerned, the cast has done a good job. The conversational sequences are fairly entertaining although not as witty as the ones in Pulfic or Ingbat. Still for the minimalist tone which the movie maintains the dialogue and screenplay is well written and presented.Walton Goggins (yes I had to check the cast and crew page to know his name) gives a stellar performance . For me , one of the better characters in the Tarantino franchise.There have been wayward allegations of misogyny against the movie. But in fairness, according to me this is one of the few , if not the first action thriller where women characters are treated on the same plane as men - be it in dialogue, depictions of violence or verbal abuse. The director has done well to erase the line between masculinity and femininity . Sex and gender play a very minor role in the character development in the movie , which is truly groundbreaking.If at all, I would be critical about the unapologetic exhibition of messy violence -both direct and anticipatory .I would have loved to rate this flick higher (and I may change the rating next year) but for now I feel it is a solid western thriller and can do with a decent 7 against its name.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Tarentino?,"Amazing acting, smart and interesting premise, a steady build, amazing score, good pacing, mystery a foot, powerful and climactic action, gore galore, amazing set design, wide shots with something in every corner.His movies often could be plays, this one more so than the rest in my opinion. It is dialogue heavy, but in the best way possible. There's almost nothing this movie doesn't have, it's pretty underrated in my opinion, as people seem to have less favorable opinions, but if you ask me, it might be his best. I look forward to more, hopefully there is more.

I would give it zero stars but that apparently isn't an option on this site. If you have a twisted sick mind and like blood and guts you might like it.

masterpiece,"First, if you're one of the few who say this movie is 'a waste of time' or 'plain boring' then please stop lying to yourselves.I watched this movie not long ago and I've got it say its pure class. Another one of Tarantino's greats. There is a slow build up but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, the build up is really good and intricate. The plot itself is really good and when it ties itself together your like 'ahhhh, this is something else'. It is a simple plot but portrayed in a complex and clever way. But don't expect gun fights, blood and gore every 10 minutes which is what we do with all of Tarantino's films.Acting: Amazing, which you can expect. The cast does a great job of keeping you engaged with the plot and keeps you interested throughout, which helps considering there are only 2 main sets so it may seem quite claustrophobic at times.At first it took me a while to get into it, with the build up and heavy dialogue, but now I look back on it and think what a great film it is. These days, directors and film makers are too scared to show what they want as it may not agree with society so they wouldn't dare put it into film, but this movie, Tarantino has been brave enough to do all this and create a great piece of art without offering any apologies. This film is humours, cold, mean and dark all at the same time, so I would defiantly give this film a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good for the good kind of viewers,"OK first the bad stuff. There are a lot of scenes to long for what you need (you see horses and cartwheels running for literally 10-15 min of the movie and the first 30-40 min could have been done in 15). Second, no characters to create bonds with, but that was made on purpose (I mean, the name of the movie is the HATEFUL eight). And third, you are not going to watch Toy Story, this is a movie with vulgarity (n**** word, swears, ...) and blood abuse. If you can't see that kind of movie that's okay but don't be the person that complain when they brought their kid to R rated movies.Now the good stuff! This is a movie with Agatha Christie's style, where you are looking for the unknown murderer. If you like that kind of movie, you will like it. This movie is made mostly in a single room and that fact make that room interesting for the movie (every places of every object, every character is important and I loved it!).

What Tarantino movie doesn't have a ton of guts and language? Beautiful cinematography and choreography. This film beats the great, yet confusing storyline of Pulp Fiction, the action packed revenge story of Django Unchained, and the horror classic, Deathproof.

The story itself isn't that memorable its the performances that outshine the script, the direction and storyline to the point where you could reasonably rewatch it (like I did) and actually have forgotten Channing Tatum had a role in the film, not because he he failed but because he did the character so well you actually forget who is doing it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A good movie,"The movie of course had a lot of beautiful scenery. The views with the hills must be appreciated, thus the first half of the movie might seem a bit slow, as it is filled with indescribable nature views, and not so much of the action. But as this is a Tarantino movie, all the blood comes at one point. It is beautiful and disgusting at the same moment. It might be fun and uncomfortable for the actors - to be soaked in artificial blood for half of the movie.I was totally surprised to see Channing Tatum in this movie as this name comes up only paired with a dance movie or a terrible comedy. He had a smart part, but this might lead him to some actual normal parts. Is this another try from Tarantino to save the guy just as Pulp fiction helped Bruce Willis?Any how, it might seem as a bit slower and more peaceful movie, in comparison to other movies, he has recently done. But is more straight forward shoot out at a cabin in the winter with bounty hunters and bad guys. Nothing surprising in here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
It's a Tarantino Western... Hooray!,"I'm a fairly big fan of Tarantino. I think the guy has a real knack for making good movies and writing GREAT scripts. None of his movies really push creative boundaries in plot or execution, but he's a wonderful craftsman who knows how to tell fantastic, often nonlinear stories. I like some of his movies more than others but he's never done anything I didn't enjoy. I'm pleased to say he continues this trend.This picture is full of smart and engaging dialogue, memorable performances, and interesting characters. There's plenty of room for imagination and it works to keep the audience immersed in the movie. Plus, considering it's three hours long, good writing is vital.This is likely Tarantino's most ambitious film. It has elements that are similar to his previous work such as Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, but he takes a risk in having 95% of the movie take place in a single room. That being said, the tedious scenery works perfectly. It adds a feeling of claustrophobia and forces the diversified characters, all acted extremely well, to interact with one another in fascinating ways. There are also moments of touching acceptance and camaraderie between two conflicting parties which adds a nice dash of humanity.My only gripe with this movie is how self-indulgent it felt. It was as if the director didn't even have to make a concerted effort to produce a solid film and everything fell into place. This is fine, and frequently less can be more, but I can't help but feel this movie falls into the shadow of Django Unchained. The final act is really macabre and excessive, but it's a fun venture in filmmaking even if it has considerably less substance than any other Tarantino material. The characters are good, as expected, but the plot isn't very strong and the motivations seem relatively weak. Quentin clearly has the ability to make compelling movies with somewhat predictable plot lines, but he didn't quite go as far as he could have with moving things forward or surprising the audience.Overall, this is Tarantino doing what he loves: making very effective movies. There's a lot of the tension and it never gets boring. Kurt Russell did a great job and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him on the big screen again. If you enjoy Quentin's work and what he tends to do, then you'll have a real good time with this one! However, for the love of God, keep the younger kids at home. The first act might lead you to believe this movie is far more subdued than it actually is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An addition to Tarantino's masterpieces,"Quentin Tarantino is once again responsible for another whodunit subgenre with as much gore, foul language and the n-word galore. These of course are the highlights of any Tarantino film. If you had been waiting for his latest cinematic tour-de-force, you will not be disappointed.The Hateful Eight is a situation film laden with heavy dialogue and tossing around of the n-word by Caucasian characters. It should in no way be looked at through that scope alone though, for the screenplay in general is neither politically correct nor apologetic. Tarantino sets up a simple plot with a lot of emphasis on dialogue and subplot while taking enough time to develop his ever malicious characters. There is seldom any good guy or bad guy in a Tarantino flick; the last man standing after an explicit bloodbath is usually the hero of the story.Fate forces eight strangers to share a cabin located on a mountain pass as a heavy blizzard licks the lands of post-civil war Wyoming. It all begins with a bounty hunter of the name John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is transporting Daisy Domergue; a fugitive to be hanged, crossing paths with another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) with no name aside from ""black fella"", ""the n-word"" etc. who is also on his way to the town of Red Rock to deliver his kill and collect bounty. The Hangman allows the stranded lad aboard his stagecoach and they make for Red Rock, prior to taking on another passenger who claims to be the town's newly appointed sheriff.As the blizzard grows on them however, they seek shelter in a cabin known as Minnie's Haberdashery. Here, they meet four lodgers of which Joe Gage, a cowboy, Bob, a Mexican, Oswald Mobray, another hangman and lastly a veteran of the battle of Baton Rouge. The tension is omnipresent, for each of these individuals knows better than to trust the next man.After someone only seen by Domergue poisons the coffee, the real confrontation begins between the eight rascals.If you've ever seen any Quentin Tarantino film, then you know that they heavily rely on dialogue, narration and retrospection. The Hateful Eight is no exception; we learn about the characters as they learn about each other, since they are usually brought together by fate. A great portion of the film takes place indoors and it is very talky as mentioned.One of most attractive aspects of the film however is the cinematography. Having been shot in 70 mm ultra-Panavision, the wide lenses capture the snow covered western landscape with sharp detail and a crisp color scheme topped with a warm overtone. The image is as large as should be. The cinematographer here is Bob Richardson and he brings as many wide shots as close ups to enhance the story.I don't understand people who still complain about Tarantino's art. Truly his films are protracted and the stories are extreme but that's only because he has reputation for greatness which allows studios to leave the final cut in his hands. I wouldn't say his latest project is a classic (in contrast with his other work) but it is definitely a masterpiece. The score is partially nonexistent and it works for the story while the acting is the real winner here.Although subpar to Tarantino's own standards,The Hateful Eight is an amusing exercise in vulgarity and gore -two recurrent themes in the director's body of work which are not always met with universal approval, and one of the immortal high points of modern cinema. Do not believe in the few who are bashing it, this film is mostly for the Tarantino fans who know what to expect from him while the rest will feel cheated as the end credits roll. Definitely go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Underrated and misunderstood by mainstreamers,"This is the one Tarantino-style movie I also like. It was a bit different than the others of Tarantino. But the movie felt like a stage play. You recognize a stay play by the way of acting and speaking their lines. Well, why not? It was great, something different. The long diaglogues are what probably the mainstreamers don´t like. People want fast-pacing movies, action after action, every 10 minutes, if it takes longer, than they get bored.The dialogues in the Hateful Eight are actually what a good movie makes. While listenting, you have the chance to listen and focus, to follow along, to remember what was said before and so on.I would not say that this movie is sophisticated.

Self-Indulgent But Fun,"Hateful Eight is an enjoyable film on several levels, but like Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds it's also very self-indulgent on Tarentino's part. It's not QUITE as self-indulgent as those movies, but it definitely tried my patience a couple times. When Tarentino made Django Unchained either he (or the people around him) were able to reign in his more ridiculous impulses which enabled him to craft a movie that told a story brilliantly and was still a lot of fun. That was a return to form and I was hoping Hateful Eight would be more like Django Unchained and less like Inglorious Basterds. In the end, it split the difference.Kurt Russel and Samuel L Jackson deliver amazing performances and are equal parts menacing and hilarious. Much like his first film, Reservoir Dogs, the story of Hateful Eight is a crime caper with one primary set; only this one takes place in the late 1800s. It's ironic that Tarentino tries to fill his movies with interesting / quirky characters and often focuses on them and their dialogue to a fault, when the best characters in this movie were the set (the ""Habberdashery"") and the blizzard raging outside. His non-human characters help set the mood perfectly and lend the film a feeling of authenticity while the human characters, however funny and impressive in their own right, often make the film feel ridiculous.The movie simmers for an hour and change before any real action takes place. I consider myself a pretty patient guy but the older I get and the more great works of film I'm exposed to, the more tired I grow of films that are needlessly wordy. The Hateful Eight contains too much exposition and you could easily cut a half hour from its running time and lose none of its impact. This is the ""self indulgence"" of Tarentino I mentioned earlier and it was so prominent in Inglorious Basterds that it literally put me to sleep the first time I saw it.The film is scored by the legendary Ennio Morricone and Tarentino tries to emulate the audio cues of old spaghetti westerns with various degrees of success. He also inserts a narrator a few times which was a bad decision that feels jarring and completely unnecessary.Despite its flaws, the film is a visual feast and I'm glad I saw it on the big screen. It's a movie with a straight forward plot and obvious themes that doesn't necessitate repeated viewings, so I doubt I'll watch it again unless I want to get another look at those beautiful landscapes and that amazing set.

Anyways, I just love the intelligence of this movie and the whodunnit element, which was extremely entertaining to watch. Also, the extended version, which is structered as a four-part miniseries is very good, and this movie probably would've worked better as a television series rather than a movie. Nonetheless, there's nothing but love for this movie in my heart, and it sadly will probably never get the recognition it deserves.8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An astonishing and mind-blowing film of intense characters and scenes.,"After watching ""The Hateful Eight"", I realized that I'd been open- mouthed during the whole film, and it was an amazing experience.From the overture to the end, Tarantino captures the beauty of intriguing shots and wonderful dialogs using simple but efficient ways. The screenplay keeps the flow of the film and it gives you a refreshing feeling.""The Hateful Eight"" is not like ""Django Unchained"", with the development of the history happening in opened scenes. This one is like Tarantino's first: ""Reservoir Dogs"". The evolution of the characters takes place in a room, a closed dirty room, and there are some flashbacks to understand the facts, just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"".

High 9/10,"The Hateful Eight - High 9/10This is one of the tightest scripts I have ever seen in a film, and it should be. This movie is basically a possible murder mystery film, so it needs to keep the tension. Quentin Tarantino is excellent at maintaining pressure, from the intro of Inglourious Basterds to Jules' ""what"" scene in Pulp Fiction. He basically made a horror film without the horror aspect. And the most fantastic thing is this movie keeps its tension in one location, a cabin. The benefit of just one area is that the audience memorizes the entire layout of the set, so it will have impact when something surprising happens.But with a tight script, it needs an excellent cast to project the script. And everyone fits right in. The cast steals the show in their own way, but Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson steal the moment every time. They both show power; Kurt's character John Ruth shows a more aggressive approach. Wherever he goes, he makes sure he is no one to mess with. While Samuel's character, Major Warren Marquis, is more meticulous and calculated. The other characters are terrific; Daisy is an unhinged, unpredictable woman, Chris seems like a happy-go-lucky fellow, Oswaldo the proper Englishman, and many more. Their performances are top-tier, fitting for a top-tier script. The dialogue is flawless; not a single word feels out of place, either telling a story or insulting one another. Just goes to show the intense details between the script and cast.This movie has an excellent western presence, better than Django Unchained cause that movie is more a period piece. While Hateful Eight is a full-on western. The tension of not trusting anybody, set pieces are well detailed, and of course, Ennio Morricone. The legendary composer himself scored this movie, and the score is just perfect. And, of course, this movie has that infamous Tarantino gore, so squibs galore are present in this film. This movie has a lot of excellent themes that relate to a lot of westerns. Every man for himself, lies, violence, and frontier justice.Overall, this is one of Tarantino's best, showing his ability to make a tight film that captures the pure attention of the audience. This movie's themes are worth exploring and deep but are presented entertainingly. My issue is once the secret is revealed in the film, the tension highly dissipates. But enough pressure is still present to keep you invested in the movie. Trust me when I say this, you would love The Hateful Eight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Classic Tarantino movie,"Find it a bit slow for half of the movie, but you can recognize a Tarantino movie since the start, this one is a kind of spaghetti western mixed with Japanese and bit of Chinese movie from the ""70's, with Ennio Morricone musics. As I said bit slow at the start with characters and story developing, after that it will explain itself ""Tarantino style"". I mean gore, splatter and blood everywhere until the end. As negative part is not as good like reservoir the dogs or pulp fiction.

Tarantinos Best Movie with pulp Fiction,I Don't Know why so many people dislike this movie because in my opinion it's the best Tarantino movie with pulp fiction. It never gets boring and it has good characters even though there is no classic villain like in Django or Inglourious Basterds. Samuel Jackson und Kurt Russel are as good as they have always been. But also Walton goggins was very good especially towards the end. The movie is very complex and you need to listen to the dialogs. The end is full of action and some unexpected things happen . As I already mentioned this movie is a masterpiece and with pulp fiction the best Tarantino movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not the same caliber as Django,"Tarantino renewed himself with Django Unchained, which all-in-all was an amazing movie, and all the main protagonists were highly interesting and amusing characters. With The Hateful Eight, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Roth, and Michael Madsen are basically remakes of characters from old Tarantino movies - now with cowboy outfits. If you close your eyes and listen to Jackson you would be inclined to think you were listening to Jules from Pulp Fiction... and Michael Madsen's cowboy is right outta Reservoir Dogs (his raised eyebrows, cool-look, was used up fifteen years ago). For me this pretty much ruined the movie - it seems as if Tarantino is just recycling old characters. Disappointing.The other main disappointment was the extremely slow progress. Close to three hours, primarily filled with too lengthy dialogue and too many filler shots - with occasional blasts of gore. The story is simply too boring and lacks enough ""story"" to engage for such a long flick.I get that Tarantino fans are all over this one with currently very generous review scores (probably ecstatic to see Jules again...) - but this one, unfortunately, is significantly weaker than greats such as Pulp Fiction and Django Unchanined. I guess we'll see average score come down to around a 7 in a while as the initial hysteria dies down. For me a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Movie That Theater Lovers Will Appreciate,"I can't imagine anyone who appreciates fine theater not liking The Hateful Eight. I even wonder if anyone who panned this movie has ever seen a top-level theater production of a drama. It has many elements of a great play, yet goes that extra mile in many ways because it's a movie. Essentially, it is one of those movies - like 12 Angry Men - that succeeds, and can be appreciated, as both a play and as a movie. But unlike 12 Angry Men, Tarantino takes more advantage of his movie being a movie, and really goes to town sometimes, as only Tarantino can do.Plays are about communication. And communication among the characters is at the core of The Hateful Eight. If watching a movie unfold based on what people say to one another is not as thrilling to you as action, you may find that this movie falls short. But there is plenty of action, just not boom boom boom like in some other Tarantino movies. And nobody can ""climax"" like Tarantino...in a play the climactic scenes have to be minimalistic compared to what can be done in movies, and the cinematic climaxes in The Hateful Eight are Tarantino-esque...need I say more?The Hateful Eight, like a fine play, is more thoughtful than the usual Tarantino flick. Tarantino has become a deeper thinker, more adept at imparting wisdom about humanity, about how minds work. He seems to have a deep understanding of his characters, considering that they're from another era and from a very different American subculture. That all of the main characters are pugnacious,abrasive,and deceptive, yet know how to conduct themselves in an eloquent way, demonstrates what kind of person Tarantino admires, at least as a movie character.Finally, a great stage drama is all about character development, and how characters develop from social interaction, which makes it the most human of all the arts. Modern American film often subordinates character development, instead focusing more on holding the attention and interest of a target audience, which is not the kind that goes to the theater. (Kind of a snobby comment I guess, but I'll stick to it.)The Hateful Eight succeeds as a stage drama, and does not succumb as a movie, in this way.I could go and on about how much I liked The Hateful Eight. I think it's Tarantino's best work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of Tarantino's better films,Let me explain why. The story is more engaging and interesting than other of Tarantino's films. It is very entertaining murder mystery full of gore.

"For Tarantino fans, this is one of his best. For others, maybe avoid","Quentin Tarantino is a hard man to like. His films are the very definition of R-rated. There are many who find his brand of gory violence and profanity extremely distasteful, offensive even. This must be taken into account before you watch The Hateful Eight.Personally I am a great fan of his work, and although I don't find him infallible, he has a very clear vision of exactly what he wants to show you and has a habit of getting the very best out of his cast. This is to be respected.With his eighth feature, Tarantino has created a masterful suspense whodunnit that harks back to Reservoir Dogs (1992) for inspiration, set almost entirely within one room over the course of nearly 3 hours.In the glorious opening act - taking up a full hour of screen time - we are introduced to a cast of larger than life characters, none of whom have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, but are so well fleshed out that you almost begin to like them (and pity them when they start getting bumped off). As things begin to unravel, you will find yourself studying their faces trying to suss them out, and who is (if there even is one) the true protagonist of the bunch. As the pressure cranks up, you may find yourself literally perspiring in anticipation of what is to come. I certainly did.The Hateful Eight does not shy away from extreme violence or language, and when it comes it flows. This will put many off and is understandable, but for those that love this particular brand of vodka, it's a joy to behold. I'm still smiling about it now.This is definitely Tarantino's most intimate film since Pulp Fiction (1994), and is epic in every sense of the word. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to see this. There are people who will say it is way too long and some of the plot elements have no real bearing on the story, but if you love this stuff already then you will find everything you need here.Best film of 2015? Hell yes. Will it make you enjoy Tarantino if you don't already? Hell no.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Highly Underrated,"Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a film that I could understand being misjudged. It is a slow burner, and even in that, nothing great happens throughout the movie. The screenplay is good, if not great, but even that does not shine. The characters are interesting, but not very deep.I think what makes this film so great is the sense of isolation, the claustrophobic feeling you get when you are stuck in a room with too many people for too long. The characters cannot help but interact with each other, and the personalities are forced out of people.I must also say that Kurt Russell's character is one of my favorites, as the bounty hunter determined to hand over personally his current bounty, for whom most of the story takes place.Really good movie.8 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I enjoyed this movie the way I enjoyed every other single Quentin Tarantino film. Yes there is some lows about this movie that really didn't interest me. The first act moves slower than his previous projects, which is one thing I can see people not liking it, but as the story goes on it gets more and more better and easier to watch. The pacing has some issues but besides that I found myself really entertained for the most part. There is some really good performances here and the cast is HEAVY. Don't listen to the bad reviews and haters, this movie will kept you entertained especially if you're a Tarantino fan like myself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Blood & Snow,"The newest installment in Tarantino's quick-witted and extremely bloody cinematic universe takes place just after the Civil War has ended during an exceptionally deadly blizzard. Bounty hunter 'Hangman' John Ruth (Russell) is transporting the deadly outlaw Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh) to be hanged for her crimes. When the approaching storm forces them to take cover at Minnie's Haberdashery a slew of colorful characters are introduced that may threaten Ruth's mission.Tarantino is no stranger to outrageous violence and all three hours and seven minutes of The Hateful Eight are full of it. Gun battles, poisonings and a few good old fashion punches to the nose are had by just about every ill-begotten character holed up at Minnie's. Not a single character can escape Tarantino's twisted view on reality, which makes for an extremely entertaining and fast paced three hour film.The outstanding cast includes Tarantino regulars such as Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen along with Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir and Oscar nominee Bruce Dern. Even with all this acting firepower on screen at the same time, the standout is Jason Leigh as the insanely sadistic, yet likable Domergue who is the only woman with a major role throughout the film.Tarantino created added interest in this film by also filming it in 70mm Panavision film stock and releasing two versions to cinemas. The Hateful Eight became the first movie to be fully filmed in Super Panavision 70 since the 1970's and joined a list which includes classics such as Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey.The violence is outrageous yet stylistic, nothing that viewers have not become accustomed to from a filmmaker that has spilled blood across the silver screen since Reservoir Dogs debuted over twenty years ago. Fans have also become accustomed to the faced-paced, expletive laden dialogue spouted by Tarantino's beloved characters. The Hateful Eight is an entertaining film for anyone who is not bothered by the content, but is even more so for anyone who is a fan of film history as Tarantino himself is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Extended Edition is a bit better! Overall, a grower and overlooked.","I went into this movie expecting a crazy thrillride with a bunch of Tarantino greats, and action packed shootouts. This is not that. This is a well paced arthouse movie, like Reservoir Dogs, or Dusk Till Dawn, or any good stage play, focused mainly on the dialogue/story telling and spurts of violence and surprises. If you like really dark comedy/gallow humor, you may love this movie, that was its best feature.This truly went from being my least favorite Tarantino movie, to one of my favorite movies after a rewatch recently. Especially the extended edition...which I have no idea why they cut some of these lines out, they are hilarious, catch this version if you can, it is a must. Same with the added scenes and flashback playout felt too add a lot to the feel of the movie.Yes, it did seem to drag a bit at the 3rd chapter, since we knew the twist at this point, but it was still cool to see, just didn't need to take so much time off. The violence was fine to me, it was riffing off The Thing and old brutal westerns (also Carrie?) which felt pretty obvious to me, but the violence on women was definitely hard to see (which had a purpose behind it)Basically, don't go in expecting Inglorious Basterds or Kill Bill, it's an artpiece of itself, going for something totally different for Tarantino, which is refreshing in retrospect. Think of the Coen Brothers doing True Grit. It's just a change in pace and you may appreciate it more with an open mindset.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Tarantino had fun and made it fun for us to watch. I wish one day he matures and gives us a good profound movie. Tarantino is a good director, no doubt he is very talented. But to be a great director, you need to be able to do it all: comedy, drama, Sci-Fi, ... (refer to Stanley Kubrick, Spielberg, Kurosawa, Wilder, Wyler, John Houston...)

It's more like a play.,"The genre of this movie is a mystery/thriller. It reveals itself at the end - like all mysteries and Thrillers tends to do, I suppose :) The ""Quentin Tarantino's dialog"" is definitely there...so,if you don't like it, I give you an advise...Don't go to see it.What I mean by this is that if you have felt until this day that there is too much dialog in Quentin's movies, oh boy, oh boy, this time ain't going to be a different kind of experience for you, cowboys and girls! On the contrary your going to HEAR a lot of it...but...the movie is a quite action-packed towards the end, because it has build up it's tension like a GOOD WESTERN usually does (e.g. Once Upon a Time in the West, Unforgiven)..And this movie takes a really long time to build up so you really have to enjoy watching this kind of movies - it isn't your regular average ""give-me-15 minutes-and- then-we-go"" -type of movie. Not a bit. Period. And it's violent. No question about it. And if you don't got the guts for violent, again, don't go to see it.Myself being a fan of Tarantino, I can easily see that this movie isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. If you compare it to the other movies by Q.T, I think it's the least mainstream movie of all Tarantino's movies until this day.I personally felt that the movie was good. Not great. I feel that Tarantino has done better movies (e.g. Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, even Django) but is it a bad movie ? No. It's just a little bit different kind of Tarantino movie and a very ambitious one if you think about the usual FORM of a story telling in a movie. It really is more like a play on screen - I personally felt that when judging the movie, I would give it a 3 and a half out of 5 stars, so to speak. The movie has a great feeling and it really does build up it's tension, which I personally loved, but surely, not every average-Joe will. But if you like Quentin's movies, why are you still here?

The Hateful Eight,"Tarantino is insane and I love it! Yet another instant classic! The film takes places during the 1800s in Wyoming in what turns out to be a awful winter store. A bounty hunter ends up giving a African American US soldier a ride with him and a prisoner to a close by cabin, where more people, who are strangers, are waiting. They offer food, shelter, coffee, alcohol, and good conversation. But it is not what it appears to be. It is much more sinister.

Good but Not Outstanding,"Right, I understand: a filmmaker cannot be expected to make a masterpiece every time he or she makes another movie. Though some have come close, it's basically impossible. It's unfair to hold those expectations for writers and directors.However, I can't help but feel that Tarantino has allowed himself to stay close to home. He doesn't roam free, trying new things, attempting a new style or genre. Sure, there is a new set of characters, a new setting, a new plot. But there numerous instances in the film that could be predicted because, well, it's Tarantino's style. He even uses most of the same actors he has used before. That can be fine, but now that this is his 8th film, I wished he deviated more from the style of his other films.That isn't to say it isn't good. It definitely is good. Many viewers remain interested in the story, and that is impressive considering the three-hour run-time. The acting is great, the cinematography is beautiful, there is suspense and mystery, and there are a lot of laughs. I was actually impressed with the number of laughs I had.Here's the plot: a bounty hunter is transporting a criminal to a small town. He meets another bounty hunter along the way, along with the sheriff of the town he's traveling to. They get caught in a storm and have to stay at a haberdashery. They planned to make a quick stop, but now they have to wait for the storm to pass. They meet a number of other travelers there, but soon everyone realizes they have a connection with each other. And their interests get in the way of each other's survival.It's been described as a violent Western version of Clue. I would say that is accurate. There a a bunch of ""a-ha"" moments for the characters, along with long sequences of explanations and discussions. This works sometimes, and other times it drags on.I read an article that stated Tarantino wants to make a horror film. A real horror film, one that intends to scare you. I would love to see this.Bottom line is that this film closely parallels the other films that Tarantino has made. If you like that, you'll love this film. If you are looking for something fresh, this won't deliver. I like Tarantino and enjoyed the film, but the issue I mentioned is the reason this movie is 7/10 instead of 10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Tests your patience, but all builds up to a satisfying pay-off","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn Wyoming, at the end of the Civil War, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is making his way across the snow drenched mountains with his charge Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is to be hanged. He runs into Major Marcus Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), with whom he strikes up an uneasy alliance, and they make their way to a secluded cabin. There, they encounter a whole host of colourful characters, including British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), surly cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), who just wants to get home for Christmas, and grouchy old confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern.) But their circumstances for being there may not be as innocent as it seems.I recently brought a box set of what are all presumably regarded as Tarantino's finest films, which, owning a lot of DVDs as I do, helps to condense space and make room for other titles to be added. Despite his highly acclaimed status in the film world, the man is highly selective, and in comparison with other contemporaries, has only really made a handful of films in a twenty five year career. This box set not only seemed to comprise presumably his finest films, but also seemed to serve as a summary of his defining years, when he established his style as a film-maker, before he took a break for a few years, and tried to make films on a grander, more ambitious scale.The Hateful Eight is the latest film made in a style that those familiar with Tarantino's films of more recent times will be familiar, and older devotees perhaps more weary of. The first hour/half hour or so gives off the impression of him paying homage to the films he was fond of in his youth, leaving a pretentious, self indulgent air that seems the staple-mark of his work of late. His trademark use of dialogue and exposition to establish a scene is in evidence, but does nothing to convey any sense of suspense or excitement. It really tests your patience like this for quite a while, but somehow if you bear with it, once the fingers start pointing and the guns start shooting, it does pay off, and becomes a lot more intelligent and intricate, building to an unexpected and highly satisfying climax.Cast wise, Tarantino favourite Jackson reliably takes centre stage again, eventually joined by other familiar QT faces Madsen and Roth, doing an obviously phony but enjoyably campy accentuated Brit voice. The 'comeback' stars, being another of the man's 'trademark' touches, would probably be Russell and Leigh. While these two fail to develop what could be deemed a 'double act', individually they each carry off the personas of two grumpy, hate filled individuals quite well. Towards the end, new face Channing Tatum even shows up to maybe give some appeal to a younger crowd.It really could have done with a more involving opening, which would usually spell the death knell for most films. QT really needs to try and connect once again with his original style of film making, where his short and sweet approach worked wonders whilst applying his trade mark use of dialogue and atmosphere. All you can do is test your endurance and stick around for the impressive and satisfying final round. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Classic Tarantino,"12 January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Hateful Eight. The latest eagerly awaited offering from Quentin Tarantino. That man is a genius. He gives us this film - which took more than thirty minutes to get going - it had a very small cast, little in the way of location with it all mainly being set inside the one log cabin, and a good helping of blood and gore, and you leave the cinema wondering exactly what it was all about. However, his genius lies in his casting, the script, which contained some excellent one liners and his sheer bloody mindedness with which he gets his story across. By the end of the film I was absolutely riveted and had no idea just exactly how things would turn out. A superb performance from Kurt Russell, great to see him on screen, I enjoyed watching the skills of Walton Goggins once again, and the unmistakable talent that is Samuel L.

This would have been a better movie if writer and director had not been the same person. That way the director would have been more critical of exceedingly long scenes and takes.

Good film ruined by poor writing,"This film has all the makings of an Oscar winning picture and would be brilliant if it weren't for the terrible script. The acting is of a very high caliber and Samuel L Jackson is brilliant, as per usual. The cinematography is breathtaking, as is the set and costume design. Furthermore, it is accompanied by a beautiful score. However, the script is a huge let down. In true Tarantino fashion, the script is very odd and over the top. The viewer is never sure whether the mood is intended to be serious or laughable. Most of the film is boring aside for a few highly graphic scenes. Much like Django Unchained, the film presents a deep and weighty subject matter illustrated through a lot of violence but is dealt with in a very laissez-faire attitude from the director. There are very few plot twists and most of them are pretty predictable. If it wasn't for everything that was right with this film, the writing and directing would have landed it a solid 1 or 2 rating from me.

The entire audience was rolling in laughter and applauding in the middle of the movie. Tarantino definitely does a great job at making a taboo subject hilarious. The only reasons I can think as to why someone would think this movie is BAD is-1: It's long. Yes The Hateful Eight is over three hours long. Kinda like Seven Samurai, the first half of the movie is pretty slow and contains a lot of build up (but is still very entertaining). Then the second half is just a sheer explosion of badassery. I believe the length is completely necessary, even after watching it a second time.2: It's visually disturbing. This is probably Tarantino's most violent film, so I can respect why some people may shy away when they see one's (INSERT BODY PART) get blown off. There's also some other disturbing parts, one in particular, that I don't want to spoil.That being said, I do believe this film was very unique and awesome. If you have a chance to watch it in 70mm do it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Decent but ultimately disappointing movie,"The movie starts out great with the classic Sergio Leone opening shot and the music from Ennio Morricone. Unfortunately the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the first 5 minutes, particularly not from the point where the movie takes place inside a haberdashery. The story feels like a mix of Reservoir dogs and a classic Sergio Leone western, but i'd rather watch Reservoir dogs or a Sergio Leone movie for the 20'th time than see this movie again.Most of the characters feel unnecessary and the normally good actors are given very little to work with. The most interesting characters are played by Kurt Russel and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Both give good performances but its not enough to carry the movie. Samuel Jackson plays the same character he always plays, and while he does a good job with it, i'm kinda tired of that character. The other supporting actors are given very little to work with and give mediocre performances for normally great actors. Tim Roth in particular overplays his character and you get the feeling the character was written for Christoph Waltz.Tarantino is known for his unique use of dialogue. However in this movie the dialogue is nothing special, and consists mostly of repeating the n-word until you get tired of listening to it.The story is OK, but offers no surprises.All in all its a decent movie, but quickly forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Bad stage play,"The problem when a director becomes too successful is that no one dare to say no to him.They let him ramble on with hours of pointless dialogue, violence and boring back stories. They let him put the actors in a room for almost three hours, saying lines that are totally uninteresting. And they expect the audience to eat it up.Just because it's QT who have done this, some fan boys, fan girls of the public and press will eat it up and praise it - just because it's done by QT. Any unknown writer/director and it would go straight to the DVD shelf. Well, bring a lot of caffeine and you might get through it. Or... just drink the coffee without the movie/stage play, and you will save both time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great Fun,"Personally I had a great time watching Hateful 8.Part western, part Agatha Christie whodunnit, the movie is best viewed as a graphic novel or as some have commented as a stage play.I think what surprised me the most was just how funny it was. Sure QT is no stranger to putting humour into his movies but I found myself chortling along to the vast majority of film.And the comedy fits and never detracts with what's going on on- screen or overshadow QT's dark views on race relations or lack thereof in the U.S's past and present.The performances are fantastic, especially those of Jackson and Goggins. The fact that Goggins in particular was not honoured or at least nominated at the Golden Globes is a real shame. His is a multi-layered performance of a character that enjoys one of the most interesting arcs of the film and Goggins plays it to a tee.My only quibble with it is that it lacked suspense, which is a fairly major thing when you're creating a mystery/thriller of this kind.Morricone's brilliant score set the tone of a dark fantasy thriller western (think High Plains Drifter) but the film never lives up to the promise.Other than that, it was a brilliant slow burn to a really fantastic blood soaked climax.I would say that while Inglorious and Django were more balanced films in terms of dialogue and action, Hateful was in its way a better movie because of the depth of the script.If you're looking for a thrill ride, this ain't it. If you want a brilliant crafted script with exceptional performances that actually makes you think then QT's latest is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
What I expected and a little more,"Being a fan of Tarantino movies I always said one has to appreciate his style to go see his work in the theater. I was disappointed by Django, but I loved Inglourious Basterds because I found more of his ideas and more of his way of telling a story in the last one. In my opinion, the beauty of his movies isn't the story, the action or even the violence. The story line is usually simple, the violence is almost always exaggerated. The one element that puts him aside and gives him the ""one and only"" thing is the way he directs the conversations, the speeches and more important how he chooses the actors for that. Not a mystery for me why he chooses to always have in his movies one or more ""buddies"" of his. The same thing with the Hateful 8: a simple story line with some action and R-rated images but the way the characters interact with each other, their stories, their accent and even the mimic of their faces is absolutely beautiful!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A long but clearly delivered mystery,"This film tells the story of two bounty hunters, a sheriff and a wanted woman who seek refuge from a harsh snowy winter in a haberdashery.

The pace is slow at times, but it helps to deliver the various twists and turns of the plot clearly. I also liked the fact that characters think aloud at times to explain the plot. As usual, the violence and gore is very graphic, to the point that it is over the top funny. Though ""The Hateful Eight"" did not keep me on edge or made me hold my breath, I did not feel that it was three hours long.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
good if you can wait,"First thing first, the cast is excellent, And I know that a lot of people will think that Channing Tattum has no place there but I did not recall him as bad and he has a too small role to make any difference in the movie. Now when it comes to Tarantino I think that the fact that he manages to shoot the majority of the film in a single room, without making you feel cramped, is quite exceptional and I love the way our characters presented the script. This acting makes you a lot of times to think you are watching a theater play. But after you admire these you start to see the big problem of the movie. The first three chapters are just boring. We spend our time watch them do nothing with only one good dialog, that makes our actors build their character, in each chapter. So in conclusion if you do not mind wait, or you even like this unique technique of slowly build the intense of the film then is great. I am not that patient and i find it too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino is at it yet again.,"As Kurt Russell's bounty hunter meets Samuel L. Jackson's ex-military man on the snowy road to Red Rock, he warns him to slowly move forward, ""molasses-like"". Which is the perfect description for Quentin Tarantino's eighth motion picture. This is arguably the filmmaker's most languid flick, and at 167 minutes (the 70mm extended version lasting 187 minutes and including an intermission) the theatrical cut of this leisurely-paced western, which largely takes place in one room and a stagecoach, is a slow burning treat to be sure. Those with a high tolerance threshold for Tarantino's trademark pretentiousness are likely to enjoy on a much deeper level, as he pushes his (once again eminently quotable) dialogue to controversy-sparking extremes in purposely protracted conversations. That these prolonged scenes never bore are testament not only to QT's innate ability for razor sharp and uniquely-delivered dialogue, but also to his unsurpassed skill for producing memorable characters both on paper and, through his keen eye for casting, on the screen. The pick of the bunch is a four-way tie: Russell's John ""the Hangman"" Ruth is both tender and tough, Jackson's Major Warren is endearing and vicious, Walton Goggin's Sheriff Mannix is excitable and wormy, and Jennifer Jason Leigh (nominated for an Oscar) is rough as guts and just a little deranged as captured crim Daisy Domergue. As a once-proposed sequel to Django Unchained there's a similarity in tone and atmosphere to QT's previous movie, which is a small shame considering the usually drastic changes in setting and genre we have come to expect movie-to-movie. It's hard to complain about that too much though, especially when we're treated to Robert Richardson's sumptuous cinematography of a blizzard-encountering post-Civil War Wyoming and Ennio Morricone's Golden Globe-winning score that harks back to his classic spaghetti western scores of the 1960s. Sitting in the bottom half of his ridiculously impressive and consistent body of work, The Hateful Eight isn't the film that will garner Tarantino new fans, yet for everyone else this just another reason why the ultra-talented filmmaker is one of the finest of his generation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Going back to the 1960's to go back to the 1860's,"When Tarantino's The Hateful Eight script leaked onto the internet a couple years back, he swore in the heat of his rage that he would deny his viewers the right to see it played out on film. I'm glad that he eventually came around and decided to create this remarkable cinematic experience.It was obvious from the very start of the film that Tarantino and co. were aiming to recreate the films of old, using the Ultra Panavision 70 camera to shoot ultra wide screen pictures, and using an overwhelmingly rich six track sound system to emulate the great western soundtracks of old. Ennio Marricone is back with the soundtrack for this film, and he delivers on a stronger note than his previous efforts with Tarantino. The sound and imagery immediately threw me back to an era of film that I was never alive to witness. If you have a theater anywhere near you that's playing this film in the original 70 mm print, I highly recommend seeing it that way over a scaled down digital version. The tools used to create this film truly enhance every other aspect.The film itself treads familiar ground for Tarantino, after mastering the old western aesthetic in Django, he uses it again to craft the charming little Minnie's Haberdashery in which most of the plot unfolds. The attention to detail in the inn is noteworthy; since about half of the tiny cabin can be seen in any given shot because of the wide camera lens, each item around the set adds some kind of artistic value to the setting as a whole. There are times in the story in which certain elements of the setting come into play in the most unexpected way. Without having to think too hard, I was enraptured by the plot and the acting of each of these Tarantino acting alumni (bar a couple new members). Each of the eight brought something completely different to the table, and delivered wholeheartedly. The limited space combined with the excellent script really brought this play-like film to life.Except for a couple of pacing issues, and some strange directorial decisions, I personally thought this was one of Tarantino's strongest efforts. He may claim that the script just writes itself, but the level of cinematic detail that his team produced for this movie is worth the price of admission. Block out a full day, time travel back to the 60's, find a theater that supports the 70mm film, and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
H8tefully Awesome,"I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie. I mean it's definitely the most non-Tarantino film by now, but later on you start to feel the vibe. Also the film is not focused so much on the story and development, but more like on the suspense and characters who are least to say interesting.It feels like The Thing but without the alien, a bit slower story development and fantastic Tarantino script and plot.Also the actors are doing a nice job portraying the characters(even Channing Tatum) and has some awesome scenes which will remain in history. Overall the movie worths for me more than 8,0 rating.(The score is perfect by the way,you will love it)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hatefully great,"You can imagine, what will happen when this once in a lifetime writer/director leaves us. It'll be a sad day, and with Tarantino, saying he might retire, after his tenth, that will hurt a bit. His latest pic, although you have to be patient, where some moments, might almost have you pulling your hair (believe me, it'll pay off later) is just another fine example of movie making and story telling which he does so well. The photography is fantastic, but it's Morricone's haunting opening score that will get you, for you know what's to follow are moments and characters of real unpleasantries. We're in the midst of a killer blizzard where hot shot bounty hunter, Russell, is escorting a soon to be dead hung woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh, superb) making a hell of a comeback, one of those actresses that never lacks. They have picked up a suspicious stray, Samuel L Jackson, a Major, where later, another guy, joins them (Walter Goggins) the new soon to be sheriff of Red Rock, which is very hard to digest, where for one thing, he never really shuts up, a sign of nervousness. Taking refuge at a lodge known as Minnie's haberdashery, also great you have a candy tooth, they meet a pack of other intriguing dudes (Roth, an English hangman) (Madsen, a mummy's boy, en route to visit his Mummy, giving off a much different character to a lot of other stuff he's done) and (a much old frail Dern, as an ex-confederate) who we kind of suspect are hiding a lot about their activities. This is what really makes it fun, but again, still, you'll need some waiting out, where you just get involved with the characters, amidst coffee drinking and stew eating. Then comes the violence, and it's very impactful, Django, taking a backseat to this, and shootouts, where Jackson in a flashback scenes, really shows the meaning of black power, where there's killer, revengeful moments between him and Dern. Jennifer and Samuel aren't the only ones to be commended on acting, where them just having accolades here is truly, unjust. Jennifer's great, though I have seen better performances from Jackson. Goggins is better, just darn great as the yacking, supposed, new Red Rock sheriff, with one of those standout performances (where did this actor come from), and like I said, Madsen's very different here, rolling with his character, the most intriguing out of them all. Roth, though delivering acting wise, is truly annoying in his over the top character, very much frighteningly similar to that particular annoying one, in Four Rooms, where here though, is purpose, as you'll see. Channing Tatum's performance is the weakest of the lot of course, coming in later, as you could say in a surprise visit. I'm glad I had a short amount of time, with this guy. When we go back earlier in the day to the sky blue outside Minnie's, Zoe Bell's Kiwi accent, again ruins the film, momentarily, period wise too. Yes there are surprise moments, but you can pretty much run down the plot, in simplistic terms as the story and motivations of our hanging out and waiting four, before Russell and co arrive. Russell's really good too. Again QT had done us solid. This is a film, like I said, you have to be patient and see it for what is, where second time, round, you enjoy it more, trust me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The script is well-written, the film is well-directed, and while it is certainly not is weakest effort, it is also far from Tarantino's best. He is a master of these kinds of bloody scenes and if you are not a fan of his films, then probably you gonna hate and this one. The first half is nearly perfect, and the second half gets a little repetitive, but still far from being boring.

Excellent Hollywood Western with lots of grit and surprises,"Loved the movie! It offers many of traditional Hollywood Western movies' best attributes, together with gritty realism and a great ""who done it"" plot!One historical quibble: reference is made to a Confederate Civil War POW camp in West Virginia. WV became a state separate from Virginia in 1863, at the height of the Civil War, precisely because western Virginians largely disagreed with secession and war. WV residents generally were quite poor, and owned few slaves, so they largely sided with the Union and, throughout the war, the state was a bastion of Lincoln's Armies, and, as such, never hosted a rebel-run POW camp.Otherwise, though, ""The Hateful Eight"" is a clever, thrilling and surprising ride. The characters, scenery and costumes are impressively accurate and surely conjure up a genuine ""Wild West"" feel. Led by Kurt Russell's toughest-of-the-tough bounty hunting gunslinger role, the cast is strong, convincing and entertaining.Finally, the plot is excellent, as it constantly shifts to new nuances, moving toward a wholly unknowable conclusion, with lots of great twists, turns and surprises along the way!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not ""Hate""ful 8, more like ""OK""ful 8","While this isn't a terrible movie, it is honestly the first time I've walked out of a Quentin Tarantino movie saying ""......eh"". After Django, you can't blame Quentin for wanting another western (I believe he's been wanting to make this movie for years now), but because of the new elements and success Django brought, Hateful 8 feels like it's too little too late. Again, this isn't a bad outcome. It's just not what you'd expect from Tarantino. I'll start with the good. The one thing all of Quentin's movies is dead on with is the dialogue. This script is awesome. The fact that you can put few actors in one or two settings and have them go back and forth for 2 ½ hours takes amounts of talent that people underestimate these days. That being said, that can't be the only aspect of your movie. The casting choice is questionable. The thing that made Django so great was that you were seeing great actors who had never had roles anything close to the ones in Django. In Hateful 8, you have a lot of the Tarantino alumni. None of these actors are awful in their role, but with as much dialogue as this movie has, you can't help but wonder who else could have been cast and really given the movie a new identity. Apart from Jenifer Jason Leigh (who is well deserving of her Golden Globe nomination) there's really no stand out characters. Now as I said before, the script is fantastic. However, dialogue can't be the only focus of a movie, especially these days. One thing Tarantino has molded himself into is directing violent and bloody action. We only receive a small taste of that in Hateful 8. Throughout the movie, you find yourself waiting for that sequence where all hell breaks loose, but it never comes. A one-time view of this movie is great. The humor is there. There's a few ""what the f***"" scenes that are very entertaining. The score sets the perfect tone (also very deserving of its nomination). But I have a hard time believing this will be a movie that I will ever take the time to watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Django Unchained meets Reservoir Dogs,"To start off, I will say I really liked this movie because I am a big Tarantino fan. It has every thing you might expect out of a Tarantino film, great dialogue, non linear chapters, copious amount of violence which is oddly funny at times, overthetop acting which goes with a movie of this type and of course has some epic scenes bearing Tarantino's stamp. The movie reminds me a lot of Reservoir Dogs (my favorite Tarantino film) i.e. there is just a single set and most of the events of the movie take place on it and the main theme of the film is a whodunit mystery. There some great outdoor scenes as well but I think they accounted for about twenty minutes or so in the three hour epic(yes it's that long). Speaking of long I must say the editing could have been better to make the film shorter and sharper. Also since there was just a single set, this won't be the premiere movie you think of when you think of Tarantino's visual mark, he had less to work with. Another criticism that may be made is that Tarantino took very less risk with the film, he is clearly in the safe Django Unchained mode of his last film and has arguably not innovated anything as far as this film is concerned, not that I mind it too much. Other stand out features include great music by legendary Ennio Morricone, all the Tarantino regulars and the newcomers are great as well but Samuel L Jackson is the standout and gives perhaps the best performance of his career since Pulp Fiction, and is the part of the best scene of the film and almost steals the entire show.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Stick of Dynamite with a long fuse.,"The Hateful Eight stars a brilliantly selected cast of character directed by the incomparable Quentin Tarantino. Kurt Russell plays John Ruth, a bounty hunter transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to hang, traveling via stagecoach thru the frozen tundra of frontier Wyoming. Along the way he encounters Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) another bounty hunter and Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). With a blizzard looming the stagecoach full holds up at a little country store with four other nefarious characters played by Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir. As the storm rages outside the remote cabin, inside we learn that everyone is not exactly who they claim to be as a last man standing show down plays out.There are very few directors these days whose new work excites as much as Quentin Tarantino. Since I first rented Pulp Fiction (1994), I have rushed out to see every new creative project. Produced, written by, directed by, I am strongly devoted to all things under the Tarantino Hollywood brand. So adjust your expectations of this review given the biased of the writer. All that being said, this film is very different than his last two films, Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012). Those films are similar in that they creatively play with history in period pieces using the violent art form that is Tarantino's style. Hateful 8, is more of a slow burn. The violence is still there, there are some gun shot wounds in this film that makes the violence in Pulp Fiction look like a paper cuts. But more time is taken, almost more than necessary to develop the characters. And at 3 hours and 7 minutes, I'm sure there is even more character exposition that landed on the cutting room floor to keep the film under 4 hours. There is a major sub plot that didn't settle well with me personally. In where the demise of a character's son is explained. And given the white dominated cast, the rampant use of the ""N word"" felt overused for shock value, more so than it did in all of Django.In a recent interview on the Howard Stern Show, Tarantino revealed the inspiration behind the Hateful Eight. Growing up he enjoyed most the western television shows and movies where a stranger comes into town. Little is know of the character but the plot unfolds as more is uncovered about the past of the outsider. His vision is, what if you had a movie made up of entirely of those types of characters. What I think he needed, all be it not necessarily his style, is to turn this into an HBO mini series. That would have given him time to fully stretch the legs of his creation. Instead we are left with a film that drags in places and rushes in others, requiring heavy-handed narration by Tarantino himself. Imagine if Vince Gilligan had tried to imagine Breaking Bad as a 3-hour film as apposed to a 62 episode series. As a die-hard fan I will say this film ranks slightly above Kill Bill 2 and Death Proof in the Tarantino catalogue. Not in the same league as Pulp Fiction, yet not his worst effort. Great effort was made to shoot the film in Panavision 70 Processing, creating beautiful epically framed shots. I appreciate his passion for the look of film over digital, but for what really? The shots early on of the stagecoach navigating the snowy terrain in the establishing shots look amazing. But most of the action of Hateful 8 feels like it could be adapted from a stage play. The cabin and the outside blizzard are brilliantly composed; you really feel the bone chilling cold winter. There is a deliberate mood and tone created here that few can create like Tarantino. Little is spared in attention to detail of the set design. Tarantino has just the right amount of fan boy friendly hidden treasures along the way. I will not spoil, but I look forward to re-watch the movie to catch them all. Tarantino has mentioned in interviews that he plans on taking his final directing curtain call before his audience demands for it. 10 films are all he currently plans on making. By his math, Hateful is appropriately the 8th. I assume he does not count directing collaborations like Four Rooms (1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996) and the Grindhouse (2007) double feature. I can go so far as to highly recommend Hateful 8 to devoted fans of Tarantino, but why preach to the choir. If you're a fan you've already laid speed tracks to the nearest theater to see it. For those not drinking the blood red Tarantino punch this film may not be for you. The pacing, language and violence may lose most mainstream audiences. So as much as Tarantino fought Disney for burying his film release under thousands more Star Wars showings. Star Wars will ultimately remain the more enjoyable film for most this holiday season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Not Tarantino's Best, But Still Good","I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, but this was not his best work. There is an high quality cast, nice cinematography, and Tarantino's directing. All of that definitely makes a good movie, but The Hateful Eight was missing Taratino's usual greatness.The story was good, but not great. I was expecting a big twist at some point that would leave me speechless. The twists were not as huge as I wanted and some of the exciting parts had too much predictability.The acting was actually pretty hit or miss. I thought Kurt Russell was miscast and didn't fit the feel. Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh were great and fit perfectly with the Tarantino style.What also played a factor in the entertainment was the length. Usually, the length of a Tarantino movie doesn't bother me because I am constantly on the edge of my seat. The Hateful Eight had a lot of dull runs and needless storytelling. I think shortening the movie would have been for the better in this case.The Hateful Eight isn't great, but still a very solid movie, 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"To know Tarantino, you must see this explosive oater.","""One of them fellas'll kill everybody in here..."" John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell)Quentin Tarantino movies, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, linger like pop culture artifacts long into the memories of geeks and movie lovers. The Hateful Eight will follow along those lines with its emphasis on light-hearted violence that supports themes of racism sexism, and nationalism, among others.""The Hangman"" bounty hunter John Ruth is transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged in Red Rock, and Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) has a couple of dead bodies to be transported in the same stage coach for collecting his bounty. Stuck at a way station in a Wyoming storm in post-Civil War, they and five other shady types spend two days sizing each other up and eliminating the bounty competition.Underneath the gruff exterior of each eccentric character is a point the gifted director is making: Daisy is a woman, most unusual to be hanged in any age, but just as unlikeable and ornery as any of the rotten men--a sure-fire comment on today's egalitarian military.Warren is regularly referred to as ""Nigger,"" reminding us that racism is both in our history over a hundred years ago and our present. Yet, he commands the stage as he demands respect even to claiming a personal letter from President Lincoln, a comment on the liberation of blacks long ago and the lingering combat with whites.Some will be put off by the pervasive violence. However, violence is a part of the Tarantino experience, a statement about the dangerous culture we live in and the need to trivialize it in order to defeat it.Besides, some of the film's humor comes from the unexpected mayhem and t casual way characters commit it (think Travolta and Jackson characters in Pulp Fiction). Fortunately most of the characters seem to deserve their fates, making the experience cathartic to some degree.Because much of the action takes place inside the station, Tarantino is able to compose his shots like a stage play in which the antagonists can face off against each other in the frame, whose 70 mm projection allows for serious space between to emphasize their individual isolation. That's not to say the director is negligent in his wide open shots outdoors--the snow covered landscape with the six horse stage coaches in the distance is thrillingly made for the 70 mm. A nomination should be forthcoming.Although The Hateful Eight is not my favorite Western, as The Magnificent Seven is, it ranks next to Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles and Tarantino's Django Unchained for tickling me about the genre I grew up on.""Now, what would make a man brave a blizzard and kill in cold blood?

Its quite violent and sadistic, but not without a point.People ask why people are still going on about racism in movies and showing all of this; it is because all of this racism still goes on to this day even if its not as apparent in our individual community.For some Quentin Tarintino fans, the movie may feel too slow especially for the first half. One thing Quentin Tarintino did in writing and directing this that I've rarely seen him do so well is make use of more subtle figures of speeches.Though there were very graphic parts as with all of his films. There were also parts where he implied things instead of just showing them which I felt added to the intensity of the plot.A lot of people used to Quentin Tarintino's previous films may find the slower parts of the movie a lot more boring. However, if you pay attention, the subtlety leading up to the heavy parts shown actually makes the movie.Quentin Tarintino just takes a different approach than he usually does. While some people probably felt bored or walked away or snored, they should have paid attention. I think a lot of people bored by their first watch of this movie should give it a second watch.Quentin Tarintino has never been the most subtle of directors. However, I am impressed by his use of juxtaposition and dramatic irony that I've never seen him personally use as well.You'll have to pardon me if I'm being vague as I write my reviews spoiler-less. I'm not pretending to be a professional, but I like to say something if I believe my side has not been told.This is a movie with layers of symbolism. Watching it a second and a third time, like Fight Club, you'll notice more and more interesting and subtle things about it.While I am not going to get into exact details, this movie is not only ballsy because of its content, but because Quentin Tarintino and some of the actors in the film stepped out of their comfort zone and performed amazingly.Quentin Tarintino should receive an Academy award for directing this film. I also believe that some of the actors at least deserve a nomination.The cinematography was more simple at first glance than his usual film, but simplicity that was put to great use.This movie still isn't a movie for the faint of heart. It talks about very tough issues that will offend a lot of people. The Hateful Eight is not only controversial in content, but in its unique delivery.I'm going to rate this a 9.5/10 and vote a 10 rounded up. There are VERY few movies including his that I would rate this high.People who are complaining about this movie that its too brutal should have watched Reservoir Dogs. To be honest, there wasn't a scene in this that compared to some scenes in Reservoir Dogs or some of his other films.The point is that Quentin Tarintino made something completely new. Its not his usual film, and it shows a maturing and developing director. The Hateful Eight makes me look forward to more experiments by Quentin Tarintino as its obvious that he is not creative in just one way.While the cast and director are obvious stars of the show. To someone who knows the industry a little bit (not a pro), I can also see that the co-directing is spot on. Its obvious that the director didn't slack and allow everything to be done in one shot.People love the TV show Gotham, yet the script in that show pales in comparison to The Hateful Eight. Despite the swearing, its not much more offensive than the content in Gotham or especially HBO shows like True Blood and alike.People seem to be judging this movie based on Quentin Tarintino's previous work. IF you go into watching this movie expecting his usual, don't. While he does stick to his roots, he does something new and great.People are often thinking that he tried to make another Django, but this is not at all the same.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Its a movie meant for adults, not kids. There's other movies made for kids like Star Wars. Adults are allowed to have their movies too.Watching the whole movie to the end and thinking hard about it, it makes some great points about politics, society and war. It may be hard to chew, but its real.This is one of Quentin Tarintino's best. I hope others enjoy it and give it a real chance like I did. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. As an amateur writer at best, this is mine.9-10/10: Rare Gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Blood Bath Dark Comedy Western,"Only Quentin Tarantino can write, direct, and structure a film in such a extraordinary way. This film like Inglorious Basterds exemplifies his film making style. I sense Quentin was inspired a lot by Sergio Leone. Ennio Morricone score is mandatory western. I was excited to see so many favorite actors from other Tarantino films. Bruce Dern is such living legend Western film icon. Unforgettable roles in Hang 'Em High, The Cowboys, Gunsmoke. He brings authenticity to any western. Kurt Russell is a natural actor who brings humor to the characters he plays. This film has so much of Quentin's sense of humor in it. I was laughing a lot during the film. There's a lot of dark hilarity in the film. Daisy Domergue is getting her teeth knocked out and I'm laughing. The vomiting scene had me laughing so hard. It reminded of a scene in The Thing. Quentin has a very similar sense of humor as John Carpenter.They unknowingly bring humor into a film which like minded people get. I love the fact they make movies for themselves and just so happen it appeals to a lot of other people. I rate this film a ten because it' perfect enough that I'll watch it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A fulfilling movie experience,"This is a piece of cinema that probably no-one but Tarantino could have pulled off in a way that holds your attention unflinchingly for the entire duration. If like me, you're a fan of both a good western and rich, superbly written dialogue, you can't but like The Hateful Eight.As other reviewers have pointed out, it could easily be a stage play from the point where they arrive at 'Minnie's Haberdashery'. This doesn't detract from it however, as Tarantino keeps the story moving at pace, breaking it up with his 'chapters' technique. And he inserts narration at specific points in the process to make sure you don't get lost in the various interconnected subplots and background stories.With dialogue of this quality, you almost eat every word that comes out of each characters mouth. On top of your popcorn, soda and chocolate, it all makes for a very fulfilling movie experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Favorite movie this year for sure. Heh Channing Tatum making lame appearances with legends like Tim Roth, Kurt Rusell and Samuel Jackson. For me it might even end up in my top all time favorites as Tarantino's other movies are there also, like Inglorious and Django.

A Film for Cinema Buffs and Tarantino Fans Alike,"For those confused about what all the major publications are saying about Quentin Tarantino's latest flick: don't pay attention to anything they say.Tarantino is known to stir the pot with his films and this might be his most bold film to date. There is graphic violence, albeit not immediately so be patient and don't complain that someone's head doesn't get blown off in the first 30 minutes. The ""n"" word and ""b"" word are both used a lot, so if you can't handle that don't even bother watching it. As a black man and someone who hates misogyny, I found this film not offensive. All the language and bad treatment towards women was contextual and expand your mind if you don't see it the same way.No matter what you think about the film's content, everyone will probably admit that the cinematography is flawless. Tarantino didn't make this using 70mm for nothing and even at points where the film moves slow, it's still a delight to look at.I'm not going to go into detail about the plot because you probably already know it and it's best to go into this film without much insight into what possibly might happen. It's basically 8 strangers staying in a cabin together, all criminals in some way who don't trust each other. Tarantino builds tension throughout and even though there's not violence every 10 minutes at any moment you feel like something serious could go down. The storyline is pretty crazy, there's enough twists and unpredictability to keep a cinema buff or Tarantino fan at the edge of their seat.The acting is great. Jackson is great as usual, Tarantino vets Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen are solid. Walton Goggins was the breakout performer to me as a lot of the dark humor comes from his lines, I hope to see him get some award recognition for his role. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I don't think I knew from anything besides Fast Times prior to this film deserves her Golden Globe nod. You genuinely hate her character, but you still understand her motivations and it doesn't prevent you from enjoying her great acting skills. Channing Tatum was solid in his first film role as a villain and fellow newcomer Demian Bichir was a surprise (loved him on FX's The Bridge!).Things do get really ugly, really fast but the film's 2 hour and 47 min run time (3 hours for the Roadshow version!) does require patience. There are a few moments where the dialogue gets a little dull, but Tarantino is a wise man who knows how to keep his audience wrapped in his film. Just go in expecting a Tarantino film and an excellent Tarantino film you'll receive. As of now it's my favorite film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"a bit uneven, but even a medicre Tarantino still quite good","I think Tarantino made the best from the script he could. Great characters and great cinematography, though I would have liked Moricone to write more music. The decision to add additional songs wasn't that god. The pace is a bit uneven, as in Deathproof. The first half has a great build up. Sure its just talking, maybe a bit too long, but its a really nice introduction of the characters. Second part is like a bloody remake of reservoir dogs. Everyone shoots everyone and then all are creeping in their blood. Whats missing is this typical Tarantino twist. Sure we have the felatio and the surprise from beneath, but thats not enough for a 3 hours movie. It could have been better and Tarantino showed in his other movies that he can be more creative. This is a homage film. Off tarantinos 8 movies I would count this on place 6, just behind Jackie Brown and in front of reservoir dogs. Fans will like it and shall watch it on the big screen in cinema. Those who aren't into Tarantino might find it a bit boring.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Classic Tarantino,"I liked THE HATEFUL EIGHT. It's another great Tarantino movie with weird characters, crazy conversations and excessive violence. Just what I expected. There's nothing really to complain about. The movie has an interesting plot with some twists and turns, great cinematography, and a masterful score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The whole cast— led by Samual L. Jackson and including a number of Tarantino regulars like Michael Madsen and Tim Roth—is very convincing and could hardly be better. Kurt Russell as bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and Jennifer Jason Leigh as his captive Daisy Domergue are the real surprises in the cast, though, and they have some of the best scenes in the movie.I personally think THE HATEFUL EIGHT is Tarantino's finest movie in the last ten years. That is not to say that his other movies from this period—Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds, and Death Proof—were not good because they were for the most part, but THE HATEFUL EIGHT just feels very complete and more elaborate than the previous few movies. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is definitely one of the best westerns in years and one of my favorite movies of 2015.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Overall: 7/10Tarantino can be great at his best, btu I have no patience for him at his worst, so I was not sure what to expect from this film.A large part of what I noticed and liked was not actually directly attributable to QT. The legendary Ennio Morricone's Gothic-tinged score. Robert Richardson's excellent cinematography - both in sumptuous landscape photography during the external scenes and he unusual but effective use of extremely wide angle shots in the interior sections. The superb environment that is the Millie's Haberdashery set, dressed to the nines and oozing period atmosphere, into which a large part of the film's narrative comfortably nestles.Quentin can certainly take direct credit for the script, which bears his distinctive fingerprints all over it. The sharp repartee is there in spades, but what impressed me is how much exposition it concealed. Often the baiting and backbiting between the strangers gathered at this isolated waystation allowed one of them to take up the task of explaining a plot detail for us without it seeming like an infodump.It helps that many of the cast are Tarantino regulars, and veteran actors to boot. They know exactly where they stand with him, and have the experience to work out the kind of territory into which they have been placed. So, it is no slight on them to say that a lot of them are over-acting their pants off. This is just that kind of movie, and smart performers play up to it. They probably had a lot of fun, in fact. There is a knowing archness to the production, a little like a Wes Anderson film. It is also quite stagey, but in a good way - I admire the craft it takes to bring a drama to life using a very limited number of locations and angles.The length of the film is a problem, though. At 2 hours and 48 minutes, it is not quite epic, but I still found that it tried my stamina. The problem is not that it contains unnecessary scenes; I cannot honestly say that I spotted any scene that did not need to be there. Instead, I would say that many - perhaps even most - scenes went on too long. He's done it before with Death Proof, although in that case he had the excuse that it was padded out from the intended segment of the larger Grindhouse project. Here, I cannot see that he had any such prior circumstances to blame. It just seems like self-indulgence, a weakness to which he has always been vulnerable.The irony is that QT very vocally admires, imitates and celebrates a range of sub-genres and categories whose characteristics are formed by their limitations, either in terms of budget or outside interference by studios or censors. Given the kind of creative freedom he has, they would never be stooping to some of the measures in which he appears to revel.The Hateful Eight is an enjoyable film, well-made and successfully delivered, and nothing else matters anywhere near as much as that. I think better, more disciplined editing could have resulted in a shorter, tighter, better version, but then again that was never going to happen, because it's Tarantino. That's not what he does. This is what he does.For my full review, see my independent film weblog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Awful,"I give it a two for the scenery, sets, costumes, lighting and photography. Tarantino used the UltraPanavision format to good effect, and the results are on the screen (I saw the 70mm film version).That said, the dialogue is comic-book level, the characters are cardboard props with no development whatsoever, the plot is rice paper-thin, the violence is beyond extreme for no good reason, and it is too long by at least an hour (more like an hour and a half, given the lack of a compelling plot). I don't want to judge the actors, as the cartoonish performances may be the result of having nothing worthwhile with which to work. A nihilistic, masturbatory exercise by someone whose entire worldview is informed by film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Can't hate it! It was great!! A wonderful cinematic experience!,"I can't blame the world for being on a thin line with Quentin Tarantino. It can be a turn off when people act like he is God's gift to cinema. At the same time, I love everything that this man puts forward, which includes the Hateful Eight.Tarantino dares to go old school cinema on us. Not just with the 70mm Ultravision, which made for a beautiful motion picture. Tarantino always crafts an impressive story, but I'm equally impressed by the images I saw. It was a gorgeous western.Tarantino went bold by having this movie go over three hours, and even bolder adding in the golden age movie experience of having an overture before the film and during intermission (although, my bladder does thanks him for that). He took a risk alienating his audience like he did with Grindhouse, but the overture did help to allow the music to set the tone The Hateful Eight,And the music was the best part of the movie. It was haunting and sinister and a gave a feel of the old 60s westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West.You go to a Tarantino movie to see a good unique story with amazing dialog (and a lot of white folks using that word with ease). It's raunchy smart and witty and that's what we get here. Plus you get the dialog being spit out by some amazing actors like Tarantino regular, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Madsen who by now knows what the filmmaker wants so much they probability don't bother reading the scripts.The regular crew is joined by Kurt Russell who may not need as much of a career boost this year as I'm sure Hateful Eight will give him, unlike Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays the only woman in the cast.It's long and slow and basically eight people talking to one another for over three hours, Yet I'd be a hater if I denied that in the hands of any other filmmakers, this would have led to pure boredom. Instead, it's was a great film to watch and I deeply enjoyed myself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Execllent movie - intense and provocative.,"Sometimes it seems like this movie is a spoof on westerns. But it isn't. In fact, it's not even a western. True, the story is set in the It contains the cultural trappings of the old west - stagecoach, remote and desolate landscape, horses. But it's about people, namely the people depicted in this movie. They are complex and their actions intense. Thus, this is an intense movie. The story is actor-driven. This means that if the acting is not excellent, the story will fail as a work of drama. In this case, the acting is excellent and often superb. There are eight principal characters in the story. Each character has a story. Each is trying to survive and get over on the other. To find out more details, one must watch the movie. Samuel L. Jackson delivers another dominating performance. However, Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is a show stealer. She holds her own in what is otherwise a male-dominated story. The rest of cast is excellent too.

Excellent Tarantino once again!,"This is obviously hate it or love it movie. For me it's one of the best Tarantino's pieces. He managed to place an intriguing story in utterly unattractive surroundings and very limited stage. Some said here in reviews that the film is boring and for me it is totally opposite, I enjoyed every minute of the unfolding story. Again some says that characters are not interesting. Totally wrong, every single one of them has a story behind him. Highly amusing and unexpected dialogues are another mark of good Tarantino film and this one is high in list regarding that. I personally found Kill Bill dreadfully boring and couldn't even watch part two to the end but this one would gladly watch again.

Bluffs and Tall Tales,"It's these questions that create an omnipresent atmosphere of bluffs and tall tales—heightened by, but not limited to, the slow-simmering, closed environment—where the door is literally nailed shut, and we're stuck with these characters just as much as they're stuck with each other. Unfortunately, the majority of this Western ensemble aren't terribly interesting or memorable, with even less being particularly likable. Who says you can't be hateful and decent? That said, ""The Hangman"" was still the most compelling and important player in regards to his unemotional sense of justice, which comes back around in one of Tarantino's bloodiest climaxes yet whilst pronouncing the film's already caffeinated screwball elements. None of that final act, however, or the film for that matter, would have been as erratic without Leigh's surprisingly delectable performance. Initially mum and marred, the actress still manages to convey a distinct arrogance whether she's spitting on Warren's letter or silently miming her own hanging. Yet, it's that aforementioned three-fourths point, aptly titled ""Domergue's Got a Secret,"" where the film and Leigh's performance really begin to sizzle. Picking up an acoustic guitar, an unexpected, though cynically-motivated tenderness emits during a brief tune, before the actress finally unveils the latent insanity–erupting in full and foul form, and, in my books, takes the cake for best supporting actress of 2015.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/07/the-hateful-eight-review-indie-adam/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Tarantino was always best at Dialogue,"Hateful Eight is like a cross between Django Unchained and Tarantino's breakout Reservoir Dogs. It takes that Western setting and heavy undercurrents of racial tension, and sticks it, with all it's characters, in one confined space and drives it with dialogue and character. It's slow going to begin with, so I can't stress this focus on dialogue enough. The first gunshot isn't until the halfway point of the movie. Before that we follow the stagecoach as it races a blizzard and picks up lone strangers. Even once we reach the cabin that it all takes place in, the dialogue maintains it's centre stage to build up the characters and display the in-built tensions between them.But when it comes to Tarantino, this focus on dialogue and character is absolutely not a criticism. Ever since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's strength as a filmmaker has been with writing dialogue and directing actors to get the best delivery of it. Hateful Eight is, once again, no exception. While there's no action per se, the conversations between characters are interesting enough, and heaped with enough suspense straight out the box, that you don't need gun fights and blood every ten minutes. What a lot of it boils down to is the aftermath of the civil war, as characters from each side find themselves sharing a room with the opposition, and all are not happy about it.There's an eclectic array of characters on display here, which is another of Tarantino's strengths, but this is also where the film begins to falter. The leading man is arguably Samuel L. Jackson's Major Warren, who plays the black guy trying to make it in a white man's world. Such are his methods of survival in this outnumbered situation that he's not entirely the most trustworthy character, which can make him hard to root for at times. Fortunately, everyone else is just as despicable, or worse. Kurt Russell is John Ruth, a bounty hunter who parades the title ""The Hangman"" as he always make sure his bounties are returned alive ready for hanging. He doesn't have all too much respect for women, although he has the most respect for Major Warren than anyone else in the movie, and he's paranoid to the smallest detail. Jennifer Jason Leigh hams it up completely as Ruth's bounty; Daisy Domergue. She's rude and uncaring, and Leigh obviously had a lot of fun playing the part.Tim Roth brings in a fantastic performance as Oswaldo Mobray, the English Hangman of the town, but beyond his fairly neutral stance in the confrontations, there isn't really much character there. The same of which can be said of Michael Madsen's Joe Gage who is completely void of any character or presence. We're given no insight into him at all and Madsen just lazes and mumbles through the role, as if he doesn't really want to be there. Bruce Dern, however, brings spirits back up (or down) as General Smithers who fought against Major Warren in the civil war. This conflict is the root of the biggest racial tension in the group, but there's definitely more at play bubbling beneath the surface.Once the action does kick in in the third act, Hateful Eight becomes possibly Tarantino's bloodiest movie yet, which is saying a lot. I haven't seen Django in a while, with it's pools of blood at the end, but Hateful Eight just felt bloodier. I'm not even sure that's a claim I can attribute to visuals, as it even sounds bloody as various characters squelch in their own plasma. A couple of characters violently vomit blood, a couple get their heads completely obliterated, almost everyone gets drenched in it, be it their own or someone else's. By the time the credits role, there's just blood everywhere.Finally, the 70mm. I didn't watch it in a special 70mm cinema (at least, I don't think I did), but the picture was noticeably wider than usual. 70mm is usually used for vast and beautiful landscapes and settings, which makes it feel like an odd choice for a movie that spends 75% of it's time in one confined space. And yet, the extra widescreen is used to it's maximum capability. On more than a couple of occasions, characters are seen facing off against one another from opposite ends of the room, and with the 70mm adding that extra bit of width, you can see them both at either end. Make the screen any narrower and you would have absolutely cut one of them out. The extra width here is used less for the landscapes (although there are plenty in the opening moments), but more for capturing the whole breadth of the Habdashery and all it's dwellers.To close, Hateful Eight is far from Tarantino's best movie, no denying that. It's slow going for a lot of the movie, a lot of the dialogue could have been trimmed further, and a number of characters could have done with a little more work. It's also Tarantino's most straight forward in terms of plot (although there are a couple of twists here and there, and even until it's final moments, you're not entirely sure who'll make it out alive), and it's themes are often retreads of what he's done before (in fact, Hateful Eight often feels like a pseudo-sequel to Django Unchained). However it maintains it's entertainment value, and it's shortcomings are more than balanced by his trademark brilliance elsewhere. It looks great and it sounds great, and I guarantee you'll be on the edge of your seat by the third act. I give Hateful Eight a somewhat fitting 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Another solid film from Quentin Tarantino,"Out of his entire career, there is only one QT film I cannot bare to watch. Which is Sad because it had one of my favorite actors, Kurt Russell and we all know that film is Death Proof.Fast forward 8 years and QT brings back Kurt for a frozen tale of who done it and what happens when you place 8 folks with differing personalities into the small confines of a haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard.Well scripted dialogue, great performances from Goggins, Russell and Jackson make this frozen tale worth repeated viewings.While I know it is not a direct sequel I view it as a loose sequel to Django of tales about the wild west and south.My only complaint, keeping this fil from getting a perfect 10 was the waste of the 70mm film system.

Achieves Greatness but falls short of Excellence.,"The 8th film from director Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"", is a murder-mystery-western film about eight strangers stuck together in a lodge during a fierce blizzard while one or more is hiding a deadly secret.I must say, this film was up to my expectations and then some. Considering I was expecting one of Tarantino's weakest films, given some of the backlash it received,but I was pleasantly surprised. I could see it being in my Top 5 favorites of Tarantino's, ranked somewhere lower than ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Inglorious Bastards"", but higher than ""Kill Bill"", ""Django Unchained"", and ""Death Proof"". It is told in a play-esque format - with chapters and an intermission crafting the narrative structure as well as narration and long sequences of backstories, lies, confrontations and exchanges of conversation. This may be unappealing for some, but I found it charming as well as admirable of Tarantino to rely upon the strength of his cast rather than overblown action. Plus, it pays off, as the performances and the eventual action build in quality with each chapter.The acting was both versatile and memorable, with standout performances from Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. Russell brings an intimidating, aggressive but strangely enjoyable personality to his role as John ""The Hangman"" Ruth while Goggins is both the funniest and most likable character, Chris Mannix, in the film. Leigh earns her Oscar nod in her supporting role as Daisy Domergue, who I found myself both hating and sympathizing with at once. Jackson steals the show, however, as Major Warren, a cold-hearted but irresistibly interesting bounty hunter that showcases Jackson's best talent in years.Tim Roth is another standout in a cartoonish, but despicable supporting role as Englishman Oswaldo Mobray, whose exaggerated accent and mannerisms make him both unsettling and hilarious. Michael Madsen as Joe Gage, Bruce Dern as Sanford Smithers and Demian Bichir as Senor Bob are all great in their roles, as well.All these characters fit the ""Hateful"" aspect but have moments of shining, likable personality. It's this conflict of flaws and strengths that make the characters the best part of the film. My allegiances switched commonly through the film, which was both more real and more gritty in it's tonal appeal. Russell as Ruth is abusive and antagonistic but later shows feelings and compassion towards both his own emotions and his allies. Jackson's Warren is a twisted, almost sickeningly evil, at times, man but has motives that make him understandable and ""root- able"" for. Goggins' Mannix is dim-witted, crass and biased against African Americans but has a good heart and an admirable loyalty to allies, and Leigh's Domergue is a lying, manipulative, conniving woman that still has a sympathetic side and an almost seductive (through her determination and fast talk) appeal to her. Dern's Smithers is a committer of war crimes but still holds a place in his son, Bichir's ""Bob"" is obviously hiding a diabolical secret but is still good mannered (and a talented pianist) Madsen's Gage is confrontational but is admirably defense of Daisy's safety, and Roth's old-fashioned, gentleman like behavior almost overshadows his blood-thirsty ways.However, there are flaws present. A few scenes of predictably yet unsettling Tarantino-esque graphic content come across as borderline unnecessary and the pacing could be considered a tad off, as the whole first two ""chapters"" of the film are rather dragged out. These flaws are forgivable, but due to them, it makes holds back the film from truly being a 10/10.That said, I found great acting, great dialogue and even better cinematography in ""The Hateful Eight"". The 70mm Ultra-Panivision looks great, bringing out nuances and details in both the outdoor environments and the indoor set of the lodge our characters find themselves in. Ennio Morricone's score is also great, as it builds both suspicious suspense as well as a deeply troubling atmosphere that keeps you on your toes for each tension-fueled moment of paranoia and confrontations.Visceral, tight and suspenseful, Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is an all round great movie that is undercut by both unnecessary controversy (This movie is not racist or misogynist - I can't stand those who have labeled it as such.) as well as legitimate flaws.

It was notable on its release in the UK that the Cineworld chain (of which my local cinema is one) were not allowed to show the film, so I had to travel further afield to see it, which made the showing somewhat more of an event. Though I remember being a little underwhelmed at the time, watching now for what I think is the 3rd time - there was an awful lot to enjoy in the dialogue and story.Two bounty hunters, Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) and John Ruth (Kurt Russell) meet on a snowy Wyoming Road and agree to travel together to Minny's Haberdashery, a trading post and rest spot, to wait out the blizzard. Ruth is transporting a prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be tried in a nearby town. They arrive at the cabin and find it already inhabited by a collection of colourful characters who may not all be what they seem.I feel like ""The Hateful Eight"" is one of those moves that benefits from repeat viewings once you know the plot. Once everyone's real agendas are revealed you can enjoy the dialogue and interplay between the characters as Tarantino is back to his scripting best here, maybe not quite to the heights of ""Pulp Fiction"" but right up there. Better than in either ""Basterds"" or ""Hollywood"" the blending of Tarantino's dialogue, time jumping plot preferences and the Grindhouse violence work together to create a story, rather than one aspect undermining the rest.It's probably his best-looking film too, with wide vistas of the mountain ranges and snow swamped passes and finally landing that full Morricone score that he has wanted for so long.So, what are my conclusions from this retrospective look at Quentin Tarantino's films? That not every film is the classic that I thought it was perhaps, that some of the films I thought I liked a lot were a little underwhelming, and some of those considered ""minor"" efforts were better than I thought they were. He's still the most ""event"" film director on the planet and it's hard to find too many of his rivals with a career as complete as his. I'll see you for film 10 at some point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A little different than classic Tarintino movies, but if u like any of his previous work you should enjoy this one as well.","The Hateful Eight was another hit in my book. It was a great movie because I enjoy the direction Tarantino takes, ( in all his movies). If u thought D'hang Unchained was a good movie you will enjoy this as well. As for all the bad reviews I've seen before I watched it, I would say those people DON'T WATCH QUINTON Tarantino MOVIES. It was slow going at first, but it has one heck of a build, and when blood does let loose it is not nearly as gory as ALL other Tarantino movies. This story is actually more of a ""murder mystery"" as opposed to the usual ""vengeance"" theme, which I think is a nice change of pace. It also focuses the people viewed one another in the old west; lots of trust issues. Nice job Quinton! 👍",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Tarantino's worst film, but still watchable","I did laugh a handful of times. There was also some decent dialogue other than the witty banter but only some. Compared to Quentin's other films, The Hateful Eight was mindless. I wonder if the leaked script had something to do with this mediocre writing effort. And when I say mediocre, I mean mediocre when compared to Quentin's other films.The violence felt gratuitous and so totally unnecessary. None of the characters were really on screen long enough to like or hate for that matter...and so don't expect to root for or against anyone in this film.On the bright side, I thought this film was excellently directed. The old Tarantino formula returns here, and I always enjoyed his stage play style of film-directing.Overall a 6/10. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be watching this one again. Then again, I always say that about Tarantino films and I always wind up watching them again!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Another Masterpiece From Quentin Tarantino,"If you are a person who watch movies the right way and get deep into it. You will love this piece of art. Ignore the haters who find it boring. It is not boring once you get into it. The dialogue, the set up, the characters and the acting is just amazing. Every character is just perfectly performed by each actor. If you like Dark, violent, depressing, mysterious movies with twists and turns making up a beautiful piece of art, This is what you need to watch. Quentin did it again. This movie got too much hate, i just don't know why. Maybe because he used the ""n"" word too many times again? Well it is a movie and if you got no problem listening to some ""n"" word in ""movies"" then you will probably love this. Watch it. Love it. Review it to tell the haters goodbye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Five-Word Review: Compelling, Tense, Exquisite, Wonderfully Acted","The eight Tarantino film is another Western, this one set after Django Unchained in a snowy cabin in Wyoming. Eight people, including bounty hunters, a sheriff, a hangman, and an old general, find themselves locked up together with tensions rising and violence looming.The Hateful Eight is premium Tarantino. It's got every trademark and subtle touch that you'd associate with the writer/director: bloody violence, extended scenes of hard-boiled, effortlessly compelling dialogue, fantastic tension, and Samuel L. Jackson, to name but a few. And talking of Jackson, this is probably his best role since Pulp Fiction, with some glorious monologues and an intriguing character background perfect for the actor's commanding screen presence. The widely-praised Jennifer Jason Leigh is superb, too, whilst Kurt Russell is fantastic as a John Wayne/Jeff Bridges hybrid. A delightful dandy performance from Tim Roth and Walton Goggins' comedic Southern persona round out a flawless cast.Every single scene is just amazing to watch, even when all the characters are doing is sitting in a wagon idly talking, and this is clearly Tarantino's strength. The plot is finely crafted, with a genuinely intriguing mystery playing out as the enthralling story develops. The setting of a cramped space hearkens back to Reservoir Dogs, and the spellbinding suspense is on a level with that, especially as all the characters are so well-fleshed-out due to the brilliant script.It's hard to praise The Hateful Eight enough as it's clearly a passion project for Tarantino, right down to the outstandingly scene-setting Ennio Morricone score. I really wish I'd been able to see the full Roadshow version complete with overture and intermission.The fact that this is Tarantino's fifth-best film is more a testament to the quality of Django, Basterds, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs than a slight towards this. There's a feeling that it may not stay so long in the memory as the others, and it has an occasional tendency to prioritise violence and gore. Still, it's a must- watch for any Tarantino fan and one of the best films of 2015. 89/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Really good movie,"I can't judge if this is one of the best Tarantino's movies, but it's a really good movie with really well done and worked dialogs.Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.The eight main characters are really well built, slowly.The film is too well crafted to get the really low scores, the cinematography is too good, the acting too high caliber, the direction too solid, the score too nice, and the flick too engaging for such ratings.That could be bad for you if you don't like long movies, because this movie is almost 3 hours long.It's a really intelligent movie and you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Refined Tarantino,"A refined Quentin Tarantino in a long film of three hours. One of the brightest plots I've ever seen. It's quite slow, though; you have to be patient for about an hour and a half, but I think it is a necessary slowness, to weave all the tension and plot for the grand finale from the half of the movie onward. And it's not necessary to say that the grand finale is dyed in all the blood that Tarantino loves and a little more. I was surprised it didn't make the nomination for best director or best original screenplay. From all the movies I've seen of 2015, for me this movie was definitely the one with the best direction. Jennifer Jason Leigh got a deserved Oscar for her magnificent performance as an actress in a supporting role.https://www.facebook.com/crymovies/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Western Pulp Fiction with a bit of Reservoir Dogs thrown in.,"It's clearly a Quentin Tarantino movie thru and thru. But how this movie is getting such high ratings is beyond me. And I'm a huge fan of his movies. But....It just felt like he just reused a lot gimmicks from a lot of his previous movies. Like Pulp Fiction, it's played in chapters and they are mixed up a bit. And like Reservoir Dogs, majority of the movie plays out in one main room.A lot of the actors who have played in previous Quentin movies simply play western versions of what they played before. Samuel L. Jackson was Jules all over again. Michael Madsen was Budd. Etc. It's not that the acting was bad, but every actor played their part exactly as you expect they would.The ending is what you'd expect from a Quentin movie, complete chaos. The one good part of the movie, is after it's over you can spend hours discussing what happened after the credits rolled. Who might of lived and who probably died.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Western-Mystery through Tarantino's unique sensibility,"That Hateful Eight strikes me as fundamentally a gritty, '60s-style western with mystery elements, a lot of conversation, and a fair amount of nastiness.For maybe the first two-thirds, H8 is a talky Western populated by intriguing but unlikable people. There is clearly something going on beneath the service, but it's unclear what, or which characters might not be what they seem. Some here call this a murder mystery, which is wrong, or at least only right to the extent that you could describe this as a ""period drama."" You could call it that, and I could see why you would, but it's still ultimately wrong.The cast is excellent, particularly Samuel L. Jackson as a tough bounty hunter and Jennifer Jason Leigh (giving her best performance in years) as a decidedly ornery criminal.There is a lot of talking in this movie, and while it's generally interesting there's probably too much of it. Still, while the movie's pace is a bit slow, it never flags.The last part contains the brutality Tarantino is so enamored of. It's both gory and emotionally disturbing, which I guess is what people want from his films, or, at least, what he wants to give them, most of the time.I've never cared for hyper violence, I'm not generally into Westerns, and Tarantino is a director I sometimes like but have yet to love. With all that said, the movie of the first two-thirds I would probably give an 8 but the increasing unpleasantness often felt both a bit gratuitous and, more importantly, not entirely in keeping with most of the movie. It's as thought Tarantino was torn between wanting to create a character study and wanting to create a Tarantino gore fest and finally decided to just go ahead and do them both.Overall, I'd recommend this if you can deal with the gore and unpleasantness, because it is well written, directed, and acted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Wonderfull,"Mammoth film that demonstrates how you can make an old-fashioned western without using huge open spaces but being able to set it all in a single room stuffing it with plot full of twists and scenes full of tension and entertainment.However, the film differs greatly from others of this genre for its innovative way of telling a story that is actually very banal.The soundtrack is also masterful and perfectly frames all the events of this film.The beauty of this story is that it all seems very disconnected to the point of reconnecting in the final in a very nice way even if slightly banal, but that doesn't take away from the beauty of the plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Classic Tarentino, uncompromising yet brilliant","Tarentino continued on the 19th century theme from Django, albeit a different setting and theme, it didn't disappoint.The film focuses around eight characters stuck up in a stagecoach lodge during a Blizzard. The characters are all different, yet given the racial tensions, and the dust of the civil war having just settled, Tarentino utilises key historical events as the backbone of the conflict.It's the initial exchanges between ""The Bounty Hunter"" (SLJ), ""The Hangman"" Russell, and the quite exceptional Jennifer Jason Leigh as ""The Prisoner"" that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Jackson's character tells Russell's he's penpals with Abraham Lincoln, much like if one said they were facebook friends with Obama, you'd probably offer them a ride on your stagecoach. But this is a different era, and the setting is perfectly isolated enough for each character to be truly vulnerable. Everyone has a story, and given the moral ambiguity surrounding each one, the audience and characters alike can't quite tell who's telling the truth.The film is predominantly focused around the dialogue, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces. There isn't a protagonist, only eight villains. And with eight villains, comes the infamous violence and murdering, which, of course you'd probably have come to expect by now.The suspense is maintained throughout and Tarentino's character development is unparalleled by any other director or writer.It's probably a bit too long, yet it's still of incredible quality. There's a touch of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction also, which bodes well with the cult following Tarentino has created. And as Tarentino often does, he stayed true to his following, as well as himself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Pretty Much Everything About This Works,"One of the best looking of Tarantino's films, everything about this is beautiful to look at. The staging of cramped interiors and sweeping vistas alike is striking and involving, all in service of character and plot. The theatricality of the whole thing could easily become irritating or aimless, but the performances - with the possible exception of Tim Roth - really make it work. I should find it too long, because like almost all his films it objectively is too long - but I do like this film very much. It all hands together so well, the characters are utterly beguiling and the plot spools at just the right pace. He just really needs to stop casting himself in even the smallest of parts in his films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The characters keep you interested,"The Hateful Eight is a film about a Bounty Hunter named John taking a woman, named crazy Daisy, to Red Rock to be hung for a count of murder. Along the way on the stage coach, he collects Warren and Chris Manix as they have requested a ride. A blizzard prevails and they all take refuge at Minnie's haberdashery. Here they meet 4 other men whose intentions are not clear.The cinematography, score, acting, set design, costume design and story are all very stand out qualities of the filmThe cinematography captures Wyoming as brutally cold, beautiful and unforgiving.The score really compliments the film well, particularly the 'L'Ultima Diligenza di Red Rock' - the opening song at the start of film. The score adds to a brooding sense of tension and mystery to the filmThe acting is great in this film. I particularly liked John Ruth and Warren's characters. John Ruth does a very convincing job of playing the pissed off Bounty Hunter role and has a great sense of threat to every character he affiliates with. Warren plays a convincing job as an escaped slave who is trying to make an earning off of Bounty's. He compliments Ruth's unwillingness to trust the others well. All the actors play convincing role as tough Western characters and none felt out of place.The set design is convincing and makes you believe this event indeed took place in Western times after the Civil war. The haberdashery looks like a primitive western structure that supplies all the basic utilities for survival, including all the other structures adjacent to it. The stage coach looks like something straight out of the west, which also contributes to a sense of believability to the plot.The costume design is perhaps what gives the film a true sense of the era they were achieving. I particularly liked Ruth's and Warren's outfits. Ruth's overall look was perfect, having an iconic looking Western moustache, slicked back long thick greying hair, a large animal fur coat, a striped vest, a white shirt, an animal fur ushanka-like hat and cowboy boots. I also really liked Marquis Warren's black tiller hat and his yellow and black jacket. These outfits gave a really authentic feel to these two characters.The story is interesting and really keeps you wondering 'who-dunnit' and what will make of some of these characters. There's also a lot of mysteries that keep you wondering what happened.The downsides of this film is the pacing is really slow, and you'll find yourself losing attention during long scenes of dialogue. There is not really too much pay off either after long tense scenes and even the whole climax in general doesn't really hit as expected. Although, all the other qualities of the film make this a solid contender in Tarantino's repertoire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino has absolutely forgotten how to tell a story,"Imagine this - a Tarantino fan is asked to write an eight hour season of a TV show, set in a log cabin for budget purposes.They write it, paying homage to Tarantino films in a few different ways, casting some of his usual players.

Yet, it doesn't have any of the verve or quotability of an actual Tarantino project.You eventually end up buying the DVD set of this series in a supermarket bargain bin.

So, during the first chapter, I spends lots of time watching them chatting, having no clue what's happening while not knowing how long this movie will be. Simply put, I was bored.Second, I got confused from time to time when the introduction of narrator came in from the background. As the story goes in Minnie's, thing became clearer for the audience.

I cannot believe I almost skipped this gem.,"Good movies are an exception nowadays; in my humble opinion of course. So many films are a bus-ticket-big story full of plot-holes and incoherences serving as an excuse for loosely linking action, special effects and general showing-off. None of it here. If the above is your kind of movie : move along. You'll feel bored. I also assume most of the bad reviews are from that kind of public. (After all, there is no accounting for taste)The movie, served by the music of Master Morricone, is a perfect homage to the spaghetti-western, but also its own beast. Visually, the snowy outdoors are beautiful; the costumes are very nice and the decors nicely detailed. The dialogs and interactions, delivered by very good actors, are well-written and add color and depth to the characters. Tarantino shines particularly at this. The story, simple and complex at the same time, unravels at a very nice and well-mastered pace. I could not, like I'm sadly used to, guess instantly what would happen and when.

Torture to watch!,"The opening scene for a few moments seemed dramatic and impressive, but after the first minute I was convinced it was taken on a sound stage.

The first thing that hit me was how inane the dialogue was; right from the start, and how wooden it sounded. Literally wooden. It had no plausible purpose. The entire opening dialogs sounded hollow and fake, like shot on a sound stage. Everything seemed fake: the dialogue, the scenery, the snow. But the worst was the acting . . . amateur like a high school play where actors read from a teleprompter. The initial plot(that's all I saw) was implausible. The plot was fake. The snow was clearly fake. The actors sat in it, wallowed in it, and fluffed it as if it were warm and fuzzy. Finally, at the 30 minute mark, I ran for the exit, and a tick refund.

Westerns meet Cluedo in another masteriece by Tarantino,"This movie displays everything I love about Tarantino and his films. It has an original story, colorful characters, unique settings, fiery dialogue, character development, flawless direction and screenplay, unique style and violence and an epic soundtrack.Tarantino is able to get amazing performances from his actors, and this movie shows that. This movie focuses heavily on character development and interaction, and due to the phenomenal performances and dialogue, I did not get bored for even a second, since the dialogue hooked me in. Tarantino has created unique characters, and the casting is on-point, all the actors which were chosen for their respective roles gave an exceptional performance. The chemistry of the cast works really well. All the characters are really complex and they live up to the title, each character is just as ""hateful"" as the next one.The setting and basic plot line might be a bit similar to Reservoir Dogs, but the movie plays out way differently than it, and is much more fun than it. The movie has a mystery element to it, while Reservoir Dogs didn't. The movie uses paranoia and fear as a plot device, and it will leave the audience on the edge of their seats as they try to figure out who is the real culprit.Quentin Tarantino has proved once again as to why he is one of the most respected directors in the industry. He has this unique way of story- telling, and has this over-the-top style which just makes his movies very interesting. The dialogue is on point, and crafted with sophistication and beauty.Tarantino's choice to film in 70mm was great, since the use of 70mm gives you a literal wider look at the setting. It really brings out everything in detail and makes each frame a work of art. You feel as if you are inside Minnie's Haberdashery with all these people. The 70mm also captures the snowy landscapes in its natural grand beauty.Even with all the mystery elements, there is still a lot of humour (most of it dark humour, of course), and it feels that each character is having a lot of fun with their characters, and that is one of the many reasons the movie is great.The movie might be long for some people, but if you come to think about it, there is really nothing you can cut from the movie since each scene is equally important. If you don't like the movie because you thought it was dragging on, it is just that you don't like long movies, there was nothing wrong with the film itself.If the violence, and other sinister and sadistic elements in the film are too much for you and you can't handle the movie, that is perfectly understandable. Often Tarantino movies are too much for people because of their talkativeness, violence, sinister and sadistic elements, and they could be too much to take in. But if you like well-written, directed, complex films with character interaction and development, or you are just a movie or Tarantino fan, you will love this movie.The soundtrack of the movie dances along beautifully with the movie. Morricone's score and the other songs used by Tarantino really set the mood for the movie, and give you a rush. The overture (and most of the tracks) fit the movies paranoid feel so well, that if you play the track during dinner with your family, you will not be able to help yourself but eye everyone on the table suspiciously.Every performance stood out very much in the movies and all of them were amazing, but the ones I liked the most were Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins. Don't get me wrong, everyone did really good.If you like a good murder mystery, or a well-directed, complex film (or if you are a Tarantino fan), you would love this movie. I loved it very much. If you get the chance, watch it in 70mm!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's new Movie:Kill Everyone Part 8,"Hateful Eight Hateful Eight is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Jenifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russel, Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Micheal Madson along with Channing Tatum and Damian Bicher.In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive?FINALLY! My most anticipated movie of the year, made by my favorite screenwriter, who made my personal favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, is out and I got to see it in all its 70 mm roadshow glory on the day of its release. Luckily, my expectations were met with one of Tarantino's best works.Tarantino dominates the spaghetti western genre, by surrounding a simple story with his trademark wit, energy, and skillful twists. He mixes gore with gaiety creating a genre bender like no other. With that said, Tarantino also allows his characters to develop over the course of this movie, thus creating a well-rounded emotional core.What may very well be the best part of this movie is the banter between the characters. Since all the gruesome action starts more than half way through the movie, it is truly amazing how engaged and invested I was in the story, not at all anxious to get to the ""meat."" This is thanks to a handful of brilliant performances and the hilarious banter and monologues between them.Though this may be true after the intermission, half way mark, ended, we, the audience, were treated to some of the most thrilling action sequences of the year, with a phenomenal score playing in the background. We are also treated to some ridiculously devilish twists that were foreshadowed in seemingly irrelevant scenes. There, really, is only one problem with these late game twists. This problem is since they appear so late into the movie, it makes the plot feel really convoluted. Though this isn't always the case, it does occur more times than it normally should.The aforementioned acting in this movie was close to flawless, in particular, Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Samuel L. Jackson is, for the most part, known for his epic one liners and his aggressive line delivery, not necessarily his acting chops. Well, he proves his worth by delivering a pitch perfect performance as Major Marquis Warren. Perfectly balancing his character's virtues and vices with a surprising amount of humor and finesse, he creates a truly compelling antihero and deserves a nod for it.Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the best gives the best performance of her career as prisoner, Daisy Domergue. Embodying a character so different from anyone else in the cast, Leigh manages to take on one of the harder roles in a movie full of hard roles and I believe that, with her recent Globe nomination, she will take home best supporting actress. Although these two fine performers are the stand outs, the entire cast pulls off wonders with their respective roles. Tim Roth is back working with Tarantino, and is clearly happy doing it. Kurt Russel delivers a very nuanced (a word I never thought I'd use in a Tarantino Western) performance as Hangman Ruth. Bruce Dern is very good as is Damien Bicher. Walton Goggins is absolutely brilliant as Sheriff Mannix, delivering an extremely intriguing and over all hilarious performance.Hateful Eight is a macabre black comedy like no other with a keen blend of banter, monologues, action, and masterful performances from its talented cast. Hateful Eight gets an A or a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino is back folks.. that's all you need to know,"Quentin Tarantino is among the finest of filmmakers working today, i would go as far as to say Tarantino is the best director of all time. I will keep the description of this film vague because i went in vague and i was hugely surprised at the outcome. We follow two bounty hunters played by Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell who meet by chance during a blizzard. We also have Jennifer Jason Leigh who is a prisoner that is being taken to her death to be hung. They take refuge in a cabin whilst the blizzard dies out with 6 other strangers. So you now have these 8 characters and we are left to unravel the mystery within.Do not go into this film expecting a fast paced western, in fact don't even go in expecting to see something similar to Django Unchained because this is very different. As a fan of Tarantino i knew that we would be given a lot of dialogue, the dialogue here is so captivating that it puts you right in this time period with these characters. But when something happens.. oh boy it becomes a tense thrillride. There is one scene in particular towards the end, where i literally rose to the end of my seat because i had no clue as to who was going to make it out alive. I like films where you don't know what is around the corner and where you have to keep guessing even when a scene is happening. The Hateful 8 is no exception.What i also like is where you have a cast of characters that you at times want to root for, but who are also unlikable. Literally none of the characters we face are likable.. they have all done terrible things. Kurt Russell in this film is a mega douche but does his job so well and Jennifer Jason Leigh is a character who you really want to dislike but can't. It was nice to see Samuel L Jackson in this film as the main character, if there were a ""hero"" it would be him, but he has still done things that are terrible. Tim Roth for me was a real standout, he is the most likable, but is so shady at the same time.In the end, what can i say, it's Tarantino. He takes these situations and throws us right into the mix. It was captivating, fun and gruesome. The last act is pure Tarantino blood and guts carnage, but for all the right reasons. The soundtrack was one of the best I've heard in recent years, especially the opening track which continues throughout the film and you can see where 70mm film is used because it also has a very unique look about it. It proved itself as the best film of 2015 next to the Force Awakens and i highly recommend anyone who loves film see it.

Middle of the Road for QT,"8 is a good movie that fails to deliver its brooding, tense promise.QT sets the scene in a movie possibly better than anyone and he does it again in this movie.Yes its dialogue heavy but that's normal for QT, where it fails with 8 is that the dialogue sets up to this monumental event that never really arrives.Worth watching for sure but temper your expectations :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best films in the last 5 years,"Great casting some great performances. Jennifer Jason Leigh & Kurt Russell in particular. You either love Tarantino or you hate him, personally i love the touches that show life in Movieland should not always be perfect, sometimes the damn door is just wrecked and wont close, and sometimes old hard cases need to put their glasses on before reading a letter that moves them to tears just before they beat up on someone. Leigh is brilliant and her character has you on a journey from, who is she, to a total loss of any respect or sympathy for her character to the point where you think she had it coming to her, Leigh somehow carries it off perfectly. Some Oscar performances, however judging from some of the other reviews on here there are plenty of haters, to whom all i can say sometimes you need time to tell a good story. For example the scene where the Jackson character is revealed as the teller of tall tales, the facial expressions of Russell without saying a word could have books on psychology written about them, now that is what i call acting, personally for me the time flew past, and i have watched it again and again, enjoying it each time.Omg just had to add after last night Golden Globes no wins virtually no nominations. I have to say when people finally get it this will be the film most remembered from 2015.A classic to me anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Too many poor reviews! Acting alone is fantastic.,"This is my first review on IMDb, I've done so purely because of some of the poor reviews I've read so far. I've seen a few 1/10 reviews which is a joke. Even if you didn't like the film, the acting alone would make it 5/10.So glad i went to see The Hateful Eight on the big screen, trust me, you want to see it at the cinema. For me it was breathtaking. When outside of the shack, the scenery is mesmerising. When inside, the big screen holds the tension and the dialogue perfectly. Of course its a Tarantino film, so when there's blood its even more shocking when its big. I really can't understand some people who are slating this film, obviously A) you don't understand what Tarantino has done with his last 3 films, and you still bleat on about Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction. B) You think all Westerns are about gunfights and tumbleweed. C) You haven't read anything about this film what so ever. Tarantino said his inspirations for this film were Reservoir Dogs and The Thing, Spot on. Right up there with Django and Inglorious. The only shame is Tarantino says he is only going to make 2 more films.Kurt Russell is fantastic as The Hangman, Samuel L Jackson as the cool, calm & calculated Marquis Warren, But Jeniffer Jason Leigh steals the show as Daisy Domergue. However ALL of the supporting cast are amazing, even Michael Madsen who is one of my favourites, hasn't been in anything for awhile, reduced to Big Brother, is brilliant as Joe Gage and has elements of Mr Blonde about him.If you haven't guessed, Quentin Tarantino likes a bit of dialogue in his films, and this is full of it, but for me the dialogue is exactly what the film needs, John Ruth questions everyone trying to find their back story and who could possibly be in cahoots with the handcuffed Domergue. Also the whole cinema was chuckling at Chris Maddix and his exasperated one liners! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tries hard being the ala-Christie mystery thriller,"""A bunch of travelers inhibited by a blizzard, seek refuge at a lone cabin - 'Minnie's Haberdashery'.
Little did they know how everyone there has a motive to fulfill.""The synopsis of this movie on paper does come across as a cinematic adaptation of any classic Agatha Christie novel, and is indeed intended to execute by Tarantino the way one would expect him to. It is a follow up of 'Django Unchained', set few years after the Civil War. The spoilsport is the editing, that perpetually gets the narrative freezing like the temperature outside the cabin, wasting a lot of time and the acting capabilities of its charismatic cast.Relying heavily on a one man show by Tarantino's favorite Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers his best act post Pulp Fiction, this 'Who did it?' thriller spends little time in developing the characters to get me guessing the wrong doer. It rather gets repetitive and too indulgent perpetually to serve no purpose. The redeemer is its third act, delivering the signature neat Tarantino violence, but waiting a long 150 minutes for it to happen becomes boring, especially while revisiting the movie. It sometimes gets me wondering that the movie and its action could have ended straight, if the initial conversion were :Major Marquis Warren - ""Got room for one more?""
John Ruth - ""No.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Horrible Shat,"Worst piece of garbage I have seen in many years. I cannot fathom why anyone would rate this movie higher than 1. Note - I have loved most of Tarantino's work. I believe people like this move because it allows them to vicariously live through these characters. The movie is infused with socially taboo/raw elements: racism, misogyny, torture, anti-social behavior, psychotic behavior etc. Hateful Eight is aptly named...these folks are evil or self-serving at best, with no respect for life. As the story goes, it is a collage of epithets, brute force actions, and stereotyping. Lacking is a coherent message...it is really in the end, shock porn.

"""The Hateful Eight"" is vintage Tarantino, but more grounded and accessible than most of his films.","Sometimes the experience of seeing a movie is best described as an ""event"". I'm not talking about the massive crowds or fans wearing costumes to the theater, ala ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". I'm talking about a filmmaker designing everything concerning his movie to be special. Love him or hate him, this is exactly what Quentin Tarantino did with ""The Hateful Eight"" (R, 2:47). This project was so special to him that when a draft of the script leaked out, he announced that he'd write the story as a novel, but not make it into a film, changing his mind only after an L.A. reading of the draft script went extremely well and Tarantino was convinced by Samuel L. Jackson himself. When the writer-director-producer got production back on track, he seemed to embrace the credo ""Go big or go home."" Tarantino shot the movie with old-style 70mm film stock and made sure that 100 theaters in 46 cities across the U.S. had or reinstalled old-school movie projectors that could show the film as intended. The December 25, 2015 release in those cities was a ""roadshow presentation"", a release template rarely used since the 1960s. This roadshow involved the distribution of souvenir programs about the movie, showing a somewhat longer version of the film (187 minutes, including an overture and an intermission) and shown, of course, ""in Ultra Panavision 70""! If you weren't able to get to a roadshow presentation of the film, you can still appreciate its stunning western vistas on screen in a somewhat abbreviated 167 minute version, complete with new (and some older, previously unused) music by the legendary Ennio Morricone, scoring his first western in 40 years! Of course, all this begs the question of whether this film is worthy of all these special production and release arrangements The film is divided into six ""chapters"", each beginning with a black title card with white letters, as it tells the story of eight mysterious characters trapped by a blizzard in 1870s Wyoming. As the movie opens, bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is riding in a stagecoach, chained to Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), on whose head is a $10,000 price tag. Ruth likes to bring in his human prizes alive so he can give the local hangman some business – and watch them hang. Fellow bounty hunter, Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), does things quite differently.When Ruth's stage comes upon Warren standing in the road beside three corpses, Warren asks the driver, O.B. Jackson (James Parks), if he has ""room for one more"", O.B. defers to Ruth who recognizes Warren and welcomes him, along with his ""luggage"". A short time later, they come across another man on foot, with a blizzard approaching. Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) says that his horse broke a leg as he was riding to Red Rock to be sworn in as the new sheriff. Ruth doubts that story and Warren isn't happy that Mannix turns out to be an unrepentant Confederate, but Mannix convinces the men to allow him to ride with them.With the winter weather worsening, the stage stops at Minnie's Haberdashery where the passengers and their driver can rest and get something to eat and drink while they wait out the storm. There are four other men inside Minnie's – Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), British gentleman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who introduces himself as a traveling hangman, quiet cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and ""Bob the Mexican"" (Demián Bichir) who explains that Minnie left him in charge of the haberdashery while she went to visit her mother. Ruth is uncomfortable with these strangers and is concerned about someone trying to prevent him from getting to Red Rock and collecting his bounty on Domergue. He expresses his instinct that at least one of Minnie's guests ""is not who he says he is"".Ruth's not wrong. The questions for us, as audience members, are figuring out who – and how many of these characters are misrepresenting themselves – and why. We try to figure out the answers as we watch the people on screen doing the same thing – and trying to get along well enough to survive the storm, in spite of their conflicting agendas and prejudices. Then, just when things inside that cold cabin really start to heat up, Tarantino pulls the bear skin rug out from underneath everyone. After Chapters One through Four tell us a chronological story, Chapter Five show us what happened early that day, then the Last Chapter picks up the action where we left it – for the intense and predictably violent conclusion.""The Hateful Eight"" is vintage Tarantino, but more accessible than most of his films. For example, like his previous film, 2012's ""Django Unchained"", this one takes place in the 19th century, deals with the ugly results of slavery, gives the black man a chance for some payback and even incorporates the character of a well-spoken European gentleman. Unlike most of Tarantino's films, however, almost all of the violence is saved for the last half of the film (but when it starts, it's as bloody as you'd expect), and this movie tells a story that's more linear than ""Pulp Fiction"" and based on a scenario that's more realistic than ""Inglourious Basterds"". The screenplay is smart and has some funny moments. The dialog is a pleasure to hear (if you're not bothered by Tarantino's well-known liberal use of profanity, including the n-word). The film's excellent performances sell the story – and entertain wonderfully. All this, topped off with Morricone's magnificent score, the spectacular scenery and cinematography which captures it, make this film an experience – nay, an event not to be missed.

"Tarantino's relentlessly gripping ""whodunnit"" is gloriously gory","Fans of Tarantino will have become accustomed to high-octane, bloody killing spree's in his works such as KILL BILL, DJANGO: UNCHAINED and PULP FICTION, however, THE HATEFUL EIGHT sings a very different tune. It gradually lures you in and isn't particularly violent at all, for the most part, but just when you're sitting comfortably enough, the fountains of blood pour into the frame to give this film a true Tarantino feel.Mightily suspenseful, beautifully scripted, exceptionally acted and with an outrageous amount of entertainment, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is a true Tarantino classic.

Jackson was the best in the movie but in my opinion it is Walton Goggins, he was really funny and unexpected which made me enjoyed him the best.We can't forget the music which was tremendous but I blame Tarantino for not using it more, it only appeared in very few scene.I enjoyed the movie and my rating is 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Django Redux,"Although I appreciate Tarantino's recycled Pulp Fiction genre of non-linear storytelling, I've avoided some films because of their gratuitous violence.However, I LOVED Django Unchained. So, given the hype about the Hateful Eight, award nominations and all, I was excited to see it. As the yawns set in, all I thought is how recycled the characters from Django were. Tim Roth as Christoph Waltz, Samuel Jackson as Jamie Foxx, the oppressed, yet outwitting winner of battles, racially and otherwise.Yes, Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance was entertaining as was Kurt Russell's, seeing them both stretch their comfort zones. But, for me, that didn't compensate for what seemed like a longer, contrived, reiterated version of Django with a few changes in weather and peripheral characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Suspense and rich dialogue,"The Hateful Eight is a wild ride through the snow-blanketed landscape of the Old West and features an incredible ensemble cast, including Walton Goggins, who absolutely steals the show. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, the film is loaded with suspense and rich dialogue. It's a classic whodunit wrapped in a harsh winter tale, where eight strangers find themselves trapped in a cabin during a blizzard. Goggins plays the character Chris Mannix, a bounty hunter who becomes embroiled in the tense dynamics of the group. His performance is both charismatic and unpredictable, bringing an edge to every scene he's in. You never really know if he's a friend or foe, and that tension keeps you glued to your seat! The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score, done by Ennio Morricone, adds a haunting atmosphere that enhances the film's intensity. Tarantino's signature style of dialogue is present, creating memorable exchanges that really highlight the characters' complex relationships. While the movie can be quite slow at times, the build-up is worth it for the explosive climax. If you're a fan of Tarantino's style or just love a good mystery filled with dark humor and unexpected twists, it is definitely worth a watch.

Quentin meets Sergio and Ingemar,"Imagine if 3 great directors (Tarantino, Leone and Bergman decided to pick and choose from their well known themes to create a Western version of a Russian wooden doll. Within are smaller dolls each one with a different yet similar twist to the story.While the choice of music was somewhat plodding (except during the credits by Roy Orbison), both the interior of the way station and the exterior snowy blizzard outside add to the tension and dialog of the actors. I can quite imagine this being presented on stage with little loss of momentum in the story line.The introduction scenes are straight out of a Sergio Leone classic. Almost expected Eastwood appearing as in Pale Rider with religious icons surrounding his appearance. Instead Samuel Jackson reprises his swagger and style made famous in Pulp Fiction and Snakes on a Plane. If you like this, then Hateful Eight is your glass of whiskey.Jason Leigh knocks it out of the park. I have not seen such abuse of a woman on screen treated with such indifference by the males in the story. Yet her ability to balance catty wit with female physical pain is like watching a train collision in slow motion.Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern play themselves adding some but not much color to the plot . Kurt Russell however, exposes a few old tricks that make his the most memorable role. Both Jackson and Russell get to spar with some delicious dialog that makes you pause.The story, once unfolded to the last doll is a bit thin. Tarantino covers up this deficiency with his usual bloody scenes of gore, which I think is his one weakness as a director. Every actor gets to play some form of wounded human - guns, knives, bottles - the usual stuff.The writing is excellent though the N word gets to replace the F word in every scene. Not sure if that was an important motif to get the point across of the denigration of black Americans during and after the civil war. A little overdone but provides fodder for Samuel to strut his excellent delivery style. His face alone in one scene, silent and watching, is something most actors cannot repeat.This is a film you need to watch twice. First time to see the story unfold. The second time to pick one or two actors and focus on how they play their roles. In my opinion, this film was much better than the Revenant due to the acting, which rescues the film's meager story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Almost there,"It has everything that a Tarantino movie should have but still falls a little short of being called his masterpiece. I think the over-emphasis on the three act structure failed it. For example in his other similar venture, Django Unchained there is obviously a three act structure but each act also has its own three acts. The first act has acts of Django being freed, learning the trades of Bounty hunter and the eventual killing of Brittle brothers but in the hateful eight the entire first act and even till the end of second act, all the time is spent on just dialogues which of course heightens tensions but without the audience having much empathy about any of the characters , how is that tension supposed to keep us on edge ? Till now the critic was on the basis of writing view-point. Taking about the cinematography there is nothing that I could point out which fell short. The decision to shoot the whole movie with Ultra Panavision works wonders and the use of split diopter all around the movie justifies the depth of every scene as we constantly need to focus on action of some character and reaction of other. The ace of this movie is of course the score, continously highlighting and building to the eventual bloody end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Quinton Tarantino strikes, once again!","It hasn't been a long time since Tarantino's first try on the western genre: ""Django unchained "", which was by all means the most financially successful picture this director has ever created and it's once more a huge stamp in his neat directorial career, nobody can deny that Quinton Tarantino is one of Hollywood's most creative and immaculate directors, and ""the hateful eight"" does nothing but to approve. It is by far one of the best written, directed and screen played spaghetti westerns of all time and it's another flash of the old Tarantino 's story over action. As obscure and flagrantly dazzling as every one of his movies are , Tarantino confines this masterpiece in a ""reservoir dogs"" like setting , only that it is set in a post- civil war united states .In a time of hatred , racism and blood lust, black bounty hunter and ex- major Marquis Warren, played by the amazing actor Samuel. l. Jackson, finds himself trapped by a blizzard in a shack with a curious group of people among which stands Kurt Russel as John Ruth ""the hangman"", a brute for whom Mr. Russel was naturally fit, tasked to escort a convicted female to a nearby town to be executed, only to be interrupted by a unprecedented blizzard that leaves him to accompany the major and another unexpected guest to their safe haven. In this tensioned atmosphere stands out a man of a familiar personality someone whose character is charmingly witty ,extremely skillful yet apparently dangerous, seemingly unusual to such an excruciatingly calm set. As a matter of fact, anyone who'd watched ""the inglorious bastards"" would think he's kind of a western version of Christopher waltz's unforgettable ""Hans Landa"" ,many people would even say that the persona itself, actually played by the brilliant Tim Roth, is nothing but a lazy copy of the German icon, which is kind of true seeing that Oswaldo Mobrey is nothing more than a polished adapted version of a Nazy officer, is it really that bad to renovate such a memorable personage in a new fresh landscape and with a new actor whose talent is nothing less than his predecessor. In my opinion, it's certainly a hard task that only reveals the brilliancy of the writer that is Mr. Tarantino. As expected from this surprisingly infamous director, this picture has it sufficing share of twist reveals and top-notch action. I can promise you the same way I do for every Tarantino movie (maybe apart from death proof) that this picture is a must see, it's a visionary gem that despite the decor monotony will always keep you on the edge of your seat.

Everything You Would Expect From A Three Hour Tarantino Western. Bring A Pillow.,"Can one actor really stand out in a crowd if every actor has a part of equal importance? Here is the main problem with this film - Tarantino cannot self-edit at this point in his career.If this film would have been a first-effort by an up-and-coming writer/director, it would have been cut to 90 minutes... Many of the lengthy scenes traveling through snow, planting spikes in snow, tracking blood in snow, etc. would have been removed or reduced to transitions... The dialog would have been cut down for 'lesser characters' (of coarse, the young writer/director would have needed to decide which characters to cut down, which Tarantino would never do)... There would have been less gore, blood, vomit, etc... And, these changes would have made a better movie.There were many great performances in this film, but they all get watered down in the 'grandeur' that is Tarantino's version of an epic western. When it ends, most viewers will be tired of watching 'The Hateful Eight', and educated viewers will wish more of the special 70 mm film would have been left on the cutting room floor.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"All the signature marks of a Tarantino film, well crafted.","Some of us, I guess, consider Tarantino films a guilty pleasure, although there must be quite a few of us judging by the box office receipts that his films collect, to say nothing of the accolades, and the ""A list"" of actors who people them. Always, by more conservative viewers, considered slightly ""over the edge"" in terms of violence, sexual innuendo, and bad language, (as in his prolific use of the ""N"" word), his films are nevertheless very entertaining, and this one is no exception. Its primary appeal is in the casting of a group of very good actors who carry off their roles with exceptional skill. The plot and the dialogue are likewise imaginative, and come, again, from the apparently fertile brain of its director, who also wrote the script. Sam Jackson, as always, is a stand out, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh in her Academy Award nominated role as the quirky outlaw Daisy. But I have to say that Walter Goggins kinda steals the movie. He and Jackson, who shared the screen in Django Unchained, are a potent combination, and Goggins has grown into an actor of wide range, and considerable appeal. I confess that early on I dismissed Tarantino too lightly, but have come to consider his films highly accomplished entertainments.

"Underrated, one of Tarantino's best","Quentin Tarantino's ninth film (eighth if you count Kill Bill as one film) involves eight strangers who seek refuge in a stagecoach stopover called 'Minnie's Haberdashery' due to an incoming blizzard. There is a series of very tense long scenes, a ton of dialogue and a fair share of plot twists towards the end.As a big fan of Tarantino (being a producer of short films myself), his latest work struck me as one of his best. I was surprised however, when I found out that a lot of people disliked it, saying it was too similar to his other works, unoriginal or boring. Sure, the shots are typically very long and the scenes are quite drawn out, but as this is meant to be a Western, that is to be expected. The long scenes may be annoying for some, but they help build up the tension and had me on-edge for the entire film. Furthermore, it is most certainly not unoriginal. In fact, I think it's one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. The plot is not something I've ever seen before, and it is definitely not a rip-off of any of his other films.The score, the first complete movie score by Ennio Morricone in 35 years(!) is perfect and sets the scene brilliantly. The acting is also spot-on, with Kurt Russel delivering a great comeback in the role of John Ruth, Samuel Jackson impressing as Major Warren and Walton Goggins doing a superb accent in the role of Sheriff Chris Mannix. The plot is also great (as mentioned earlier) and I would be lying if I said that I anticipated any of the plot twists.All in all, another brilliant film by Tarantino with a flawless plot, brilliant cinematography, great acting and an epic score.

"Engaging, but self-aggrandizing","I think I would have enjoyed The Hateful Eight more if Quentin Tarantino would have stopped taking victory laps throughout the movie. I liked the story, but I felt like the film is trying to show off how artistic and shocking it could be at every turn, and constantly patting itself on the back. It's a bit gruesome for my tastes, but I did appreciate the acting, the score and the cinematography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Extremely Underrated,"I saw this movie on Xfinity for free. I was debating on whether I should watch it or not, because many people said it was not that good, and rather long. I decided to give it a shot, and if it did not capture my attention then I'd turn it off (as I did not pay any money). Within the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. This has that classic Tarantino feel, but is milder than most of his recent films. As I was watching this, I thought it felt like a mix between a western, a game of Clue, Reservoir Dogs, and The Thing. Afterwards, I found these were the inspirations for this movie, which wasn't surprising. Grant it, this idea is not completely original, but puts a great spin on the classic ""The Butler Did It"" story. I really don't understand the disapproval this movie received. I put it ahead of Django, and would maybe go as far as saying this is my favorite Tarantino film (behind maybe Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs). I think people have come to expect Tarantino movies as gore fests, like with Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, and Django. This certainly has some great violence, but it is more of a character development story, and a guessing game. I could see why people would say its boring. But if you enjoy great dialogue and tension, this is possibly Tarantino's best. The acting was phenomenal from everyone. There's a reason Tarantino uses the same actors in many of his movies, and that reason is evident here. Tarantino clearly has a feel for his actors, and they have a feel for him. it works flawlessly every single time. The movie is three hours long, and quite frankly it did not seem that long. I was upset when it ended. Overall, you need to give this movie a chance. Go into it, knowing it's not a constant gore fest, and I think you will appreciate it much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I didn't care about any of them eight hateful guys and that was the only problem.,"The Hateful Eight.In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters.Obviously, this is a very good movie but I ended up disappointed somehow.It's a slow burning thriller, you can't know what is going to happen next, very hard to predict as a western movie should be and as a Tarantino movie should be most particularly.The atmosphere was there, those snowy scenes were great with those beautiful soundtracks and the cinematography was just wonderful.Nothing bad about directing, it's a masterclass from the man himself Quentin.I really enjoyed the dialogs either, they were mostly well-written and funny especially Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins, those were the funniest but the best performance here is by far 's.I have to mention that I really didn't care about any of them eight hateful guys, I didn't know much about them to care so that was a thing that bordered me and I tried to enjoy the thing and the mystery and I did but not quietly like I wanted.Once again this is a good movie, a very well-made western and I wish I could love it a bit more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Don't believe the hype,"This movie has too good of actors and cinematography as well as a beautiful landscape to be as absolutely boring and linear as it was. The movie moves so slow that its hard to pay attention through the whole thing, the only thing that kept me in it was the acting, but great acting in no way makes up for the awful plot. Its almost as if Tarantino tried to remake ""Clue: The Western"" except it was so boring for 2 hours of the 2 hours and 47 minutes of the movie, that I really didn't care who did what by then of it. If you want to watch the movie but don't have a lot of time, skip to the last 47 minutes and you will know enough and get most of the excitement to enjoy the film. As I said, the only reason I am giving this a 4 out of 10 is because the acting really was done very well and the shots and music were also done very well but it does not make up of an awful plot. This is just my opinion though, if you are into slower, non-gripping (uninteresting or boring) who-dun-it films then this will be for you. P.S. For a Tarantino movie, it was lacking in the violence, excitement and blood for the overall film. But it was classical humorous at times.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Tarantino does mystery with western trappings,"Following 2012's ""Django Unchained"", Quentin Tarantino once again returned to the American west for his next feature, ""The Hateful Eight"". With a title reminiscent of ""The Magnificent Seven"", you might expect a rip-roaring yarn chock full of action. However, the movie actually owes much more to mystery novels by the likes of Agatha Christie than it does to traditional Hollywood westerns. The narrative even follows a literary structure which includes some narration from Tarantino himself.The titular eight are a group of nefarious individuals brought together in a cabin by a snowstorm. Two of the most prominent of these are a bounty hunter and his notorious prisoner who carries a price of $10,000 on her head. It isn't long before suspicions arise that one or more of the others might have a stake in seeing that this prisoner doesn't get brought to justice. There are shades of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in this setup, which probably isn't just a coincidence.Despite being more of a mystery than a western, ""The Hateful Eight"" is nevertheless a more traditional Hollywood depiction of the west than ""Django Unchained"". That being said, the snowbound setting and the strong mystery angle give the movie a unique flavour. I can't really think of any other western quite like this. Tarantino's script has his trademark mix of violence and impeccable dialogue which in this case is in service of a well constructed mystery plot. The movie is dialogue heavy due to the confined setting limiting the amount of action taking place but it does move along fairly briskly. Still, the extended length (nearly three hours) will likely try the patience of some viewers.As always, the casting is excellent. Several vets from past Tarantino movies returned here including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins and Bruce Dern. That's a great starting point and then you throw in Jennifer Jason Leigh, who ended up getting an Oscar nomination for what is arguably the movie's most memorable performance. To me, the movie harks back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" by having a relatively small cast strutting their stuff in a confined setting.Tarantino's direction is flawless, as usual. That being said, he somewhat confusingly decided to go through the considerable effort of using 70mm photography for this picture, which was mostly wasted on an interior set. That approach would have been better suited to ""Django Unchained"", which had more varied environments. Be that as it may, the visuals are consistently attractive. However, they're overshadowed by Ennio Morricone's moody score, which is one of the movie's strongest points (and also the winner of an Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA).Ultimately, ""The Hateful Eight"" doesn't quite stack up to Tarantino's best efforts but it's still a good movie. It contains some interesting commentary on race relations along with a subversion of typical feminist tropes whereby in this case we're treated to a strong female villain instead of a hero. I'm not sure how well it stands up to repeated viewings because of the whole mystery angle but it's intricate enough that you probably won't remember all the twists and turns of the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A very Tarantino movie,"Although it does take a bit to get rolling, it´s not boring at any point. If you´re into Tarantino movies, this one should definetly be on your watchlist.It´s fun, bloody, and surprisingly loaded full of action and mystery.You´ll have a hard time actually liking any of the characters, but they are nothing less of intruiging in their roles.Another thing which stands out to me is, that most of the movie is set in one room only. While this could lead to repetitiveness, it actually serves for a couple of great running gags and funny moments, and it gives the setting a bit of a contrasting cozy feeling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
No likable characters.,"Maybe that's the point. I do like the film and the extended Netflix version. Best looking film in years. Best directed and acted. My stars go toward that the most. I just didn't care what happened to anybody. Once we were halfway through the story. Again, maybe that was the point. In that respect it succeeded. I felt it tiring mostly. That with such a melancholy ending. It was HATEFUL. For that it is a quality film for what it was meant to be I think. Not the most entertaining Tarantino film. One of the best directed and best looking films every made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino being himself. Just as he should,"A lot of the criticism aimed at this film seems to be based on the fact that it's long, tedious and relies too much on dialogue. But that's the thing about Tarantino - his films have always been wordy and dialogue-heavy. Think of all the non-stop banter in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, all the verbal flourishes in Inglorious Basterds and even Kill Bill. That's what makes him special. His writing is just as showy and over-the-top as his sense of humour and action sequences, that's what sets him apart from the rest of the crowd.The Hateful Eight has dialogue in spades, but not for a single moment did I find it boring or redundant. Excessive, certainly, but that's the whole point. I felt that it was used masterfully in order to build character and maintain suspense. By the end of the picture my feelings for the characters were so contradictory that it took about too days to process them. And when it comes to writing and acting, I consider this effect a job exceptionally well done.As for the generous 3+ hour screen time, it seems a bit misguided to bash a film for it in the day and age when people have no problem binging through a season or two of TV in a single night. What would happen if The Hateful Eight was 1.5 or 2 hours long? Could it tell the same story in an efficient manner? Most definitely. But is filmmaking really only about efficiency? Would it have the same sense of time and place, the same sense of character and isolation? I seriously doubt it.The only thing that stuck out for me was that the acting looked a bit stiff in the first chapter, but that's pretty much it. Everything else - the cinematography, the pacing, the story, Morricone's soundtrack - was spot on. All things considered, this is definitely one of my favorite Tarantino films out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino is as skillful as he is sadistic,"In the wild west shortly after the U.S. Civil War, an oddball gang of characters end up sharing space in a stagecoach lodge during a wicked Wyoming blizzard. They include bounty hunters, a wanted murderer, an alleged sheriff, an alleged hangman, a former Confederate general, and other mysterious guests who arise suspicion. The movie is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.In regard to movie storytelling and execution, I have little doubt that Tarantino is a genius. I also have little doubt that he is a sadist.His films can end up with different results depending on how much the mean-spirited violence overwhelms his brilliance. When the violence was minimal (that is, in Tarantino terms), the brilliance clearly won out with the creation of such great films as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", and ""Django Unchained"".Then, there were the two movies in the ""Kill Bill"" series where the violence was often sickening and overwhelming. This situation recurs in ""The Hateful Eight"".Firstly, the pluses of which there are many:With the aid of music by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Robert Richardson, Tarantino succeeds in evoking a hell-on-earth created by its inhabitants.Storywise, there are many moments of mystery, plot twists, suspense, and extended moments of tense dialogue. While Tarantino's stories are always filled with violence, they are always engaging. And most of all, compared to many other screenwriters, his stories are always understandable. They can be complex without being confusing.There are two frequents sources of criticism about this movie but I will actually come to the movie's defense. One is that the movie is too long especially in the middle. I agree that it could have been shortened but the tension was always present in the middle scene leading the viewer to believe (rightly so) that this was only a build-up.The other criticism was against the inclusion of a scene that is a flashback. I felt this scene added to the film's impact. It helped solve the mystery of the backgrounds of some of the characters. It also allowed us to see other characters who had previously been spoken of only in reference. The best part of the scene is that it provided us with kind and friendly characters who interacted well with others. This was a welcome respite from the uniformly vile characters that infested the movie's first half.And the acting is great. Standout performances come from Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Bruce Dern.It's in the end when things get overly brutal and mean-spirited especially the fate of one character who had already been subject to an excess of degradation. The act itself and the image of its aftermath were hard to get out of my mind well after the movie's end. I guess it's now time for a schlocky rom-com to rebalance my senses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A zero plot makes this just a retirement check for them?...maybe.Inglorious Basterds and Pulp Fiction were Tarantino masterpieces by comparison!

Interesting Quentin Style Movie..

Ignore the Hate! This Film is one of Tarantino's Best...,"The Hateful Eight is the eighth entry of film through the ultimate writer and director, Quentin Tarantino. He has stated that he will only be making 2 more films, which in a total becomes 10 films throughout his wondrous career. It is so sad and relieving to believe only 2 more films will be inclined from the fantastic writer and director Quentin Tarantino. Because this film is a welcome addition to fans of himself and to the beloved audiences that makes it one of the finest western films of the decade.The Hateful Eight starts with John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) comfortably travelling inside a wagon led by horses heading their way to the path of Red Rock, a small village which John Ruth is a bounty hunter and he's requirement is to capture Daisy Domergue and hang her in the town to get paid. On their path stands Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson) who is another bounty hunter but is black. His request for the long ride with them is because of an awful, deleterious snow blizzard. On their way meets another character, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of the town 'Red Rock'. Arriving their way, from the heavy blizzard that stands to disturb their way they decide to seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. Already, there are in total of 4 people waiting inside the Haberdashery as they claim that Minnie has been gone for a week to visit her mother for Christmas. While committing to stay for a few nights, a disastrous murder happens between the night by a coffee and between the hateful eight's, they seek to discover the incident and who the criminal is amongst them.This might be similar to an older film and a popularized board game both named 'Clue'. Aside from the minor detailed plots, it doubtlessly borrows similar elements of its original concept. One might say, it is a direct plagiarism, but for the defense, I'd like to put as inspirational. The impression might be familiar but it is the story and the characters that make it very different from the inspired source material and other mainstream thriller films. A clear example may be, the collision between Major Marquis and the residence who were already resting in the haberdashery, the hilarious chemistry between John Ruth and Daisy. Another might be, a sequence in which Major Marquis explains the death of General Sandy Smithers' (Bruce Dern) son which remained a mysterious clue but now revealed from the dirty, deceitful mouth of Major Marquis. This 10-minute sequence is an aspect that decorated the film over up, and still remains to be memorable and highly impressive that made my first knuckle tight, and the sense of dread that made it authentically disturbing to view.The cast of The Hateful Eight is undeniably fabulous. These actors and actresses deduce like they are fully committed to their roles in the film. To begin, interesting characters have been shown off to the screen as the film slowly reveals each of the characters which are utterly different in most other western or typical mainstream movies. As undoubtedly these characters are enjoyable, the acting of performance that is given by each make it more stimulating and enchanting. A prime example I would use would be, Samuel L Jackson as Major Marquis Warren. He is strikingly amusing and courageous as a dangerous and clever bounty hunter. He has a sense, in which is dread whenever he beings making movements and when he starts opening his mouth to speak. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that it is his best performance since the 1994's Pulp Fiction.Like all Tarantino films, all of his films are unduly bloody violent. He is a director who doesn't care about the age conscious and continues fully with the bloody violence that everyone could possibly imagine. Mainstream films, tend to hide violent acts of scenes and blood for disturbance but it may make the viewing bored and clichéd. However, Tarantino just shows the violent scene of violence that may be disturbing but totally fun and interesting. The film doesn't go for Tarantino violence for the first and second act. When the third act hits, it changes the plate and switches into an R-rated Clue version which was a total blast.The film's running time is 167 mins which are close to 3 hours maximum. This is undeniably a huge number for a film to the tide, but from the immensely interesting characters, the absurdity bloody violence and the marvelous dialogue which Tarantino's professional writing shines the most makes the 3 hours run time fill like 30 minutes. A flaw that could be mentioned is, because of the long run time, sometimes the main story drags into nothing and appears at the main points usually at the third or final act of the film which most Tarantino films tend to have an issue.Ennio Morricone's score feels like the perfect music composing for a stage play that shifts the tones correctly according to the sense of dread of the scenes. The cinematography and the Ultra Panavision 70 mm camera is stunningly gorgeous, as it takes wide shots, that makes it a perfect vision for a stage play as well.As a conclusion, Tarantino has made yet another sequestered masterpiece from himself. Like all Tarantino films, The Hateful Eight is funny, scary, alluring, dreadful and every time a new case or an unexpected condition occurs that makes the audience thought to provoke and entertained of what it accomplished.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hat trick,"When we first see Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds, the lengthy Alpine scene is a joy - but also reminds you how little real adult cinema there is. And without Tarantino, the Disneyfication of mainstream film would not stop.This time, he takes his usual patience to build up the Western but it is immediately apparent that film is also puzzle, maybe whodunnit. So from the outset we are expecting the plot to resolve surprisingly, and it does.If you are familiar with Tarantino, then this film delivers in spades, but it has surprisingly even less concessions to a modern cinema audience than his previous two films.The film is both slow and yet Beat Takeshi like in its outbursts of violence. The film is long, and does not truly kick in for an hour. The use of the N-word is excessive and purely for texture which is what gets Tarantino into so much hot water.But Tarantino has a discipline that keeps the film incredibly tight, which keeps you fully emerged in his world, reminding you that good filmmakers use the time they have effectively.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Impressive,"I've waited a long time before I watched this movie. It was clear to me that this would be heavier stuff, not so light-footed like Pulp. In this case I wait until I'm in a certain mood, a moment, where also Viscontis Damned', Herzogs Aguirre' or 'Apocalypse' would be fine. And now after watching 8' I have to say, yes this moving picture is also about the damned and it's drawn perfectly and consistently. It is definitely entertaining, disturbing and shocking at the same time and never boring or implausible. For me that's pure art.Perhaps there are some in the US they don't like the picture because it's about dark facts of a supposedly great era in history. I recently read about the Trail Of Tears, the Seminoles, the role of Afroamerican People in that conflict and later in the civil war. Yes that's not all glorious events and I can understand some people don't like to be remembered. I had that feeling while watching Inglorious', because my Grandfather was a German Soldier. And even I know he hated the Nazis (he helped Jews to escape in his trucks) I had some difficulties to accept how partially stupid the Germans where shown in Bastards'. But - who could blame anybody to do so?!There are countless other massacres in human history and nobody knows if we really will not experience something terrible again. Fear and hate are spreading out all over the world like never before the last 70 years.There is this wooden Jesus statue in the movie and I guess that's not a coincidence.

Epically easy to watch,"Tarantino is one of the best movie makers in modern times, showing again in The Hateful Eight his ability to bring audiences a unique viewing experience, through his artful style of making the most simplistic of moments feel unusually necessary and near impossible to look away from.Much of its meaty run time is set in a cabin in the snow-covered wilderness, involving a motley crew of unsavouries and even though it sometimes feels like watching a stage play, the clever use of limited space and interesting characters is commendable and something not many directors can pull off. As the title would suggest, the 'eight' don't particularly like each other and the events that transpire have a tantalising mix of suspicions, humour and violence. Jennifer Jason Leigh is so likeable as Daisy Domergue, her colourful charm had me laughing on many occasions, and Kurt Russell as the hangman is a standout. I would have liked the nitty gritty to arrive a bit earlier than it did, especially when you consider the almost three hour span, but thankfully it's Tarantino at the helm and maybe he's just showing off a tad in proving that he can keep an audience interested longer than most.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Same Problem As Firefly,"Bad marketing. The problem with the series Firefly was NBC advertised it as a comedy, when what it was is a Sci-fi series with a lot of comedic relief.

The people who would love this are Murder Mystery folk, like me, and not generally Tarrintino fans, which I'm not. And most QT fans told me to pass. I loved Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but I'm not what you would call an QT fan. I find the way he tells story somewhat lazy, and his fetish with rape is not my cup of tea, no offense to QT fans, I 'm just not into QT's 'style' of filmmaking because there is way too much unnecessary rape and gratuitous gore, but I love the Hatful Eight because it not's really a Tarrintino film, it more of Columbo / Agatha Christi film with a Tarrintino twist.Loved it, just wish I would have known 9 years ago what it was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Ignore The Haters. Watch The Hateful,"I seriously do not understand what the people who have given this film a low score want from a film. I realise that you will never please everyone but to give this film a score of 1 seriously??? Its not only ridiculous but its also misleading to the people who use these reviews to decide whether to watch a film or not. Personally I think it is one of Tarantino's best films and would agree with most of the high scoring reviews who have written why it is such a great film far better than I ever could. I loved the way it was shot, the high calibre acting, the clever dialogue, the cast not to mention the story itself. It's all great but with the highly different reviews on here, the only way you'll know for sure is by watching it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The masterpeace,"All of you who have given less than 8 stars obviously have not understood the film. The film is absolutely masterpeace! I can watch over and over again. Each scene is supported by fabulous details, each dialogue has a purpose! This film is made for real film lovers, for intelligent people who understand art! Theater brought to the big screen! And the sound of blizzard on the other side of the door is an amazing detail, which proves Tarantino excellence. Personally, I enjoyed every second of it and never wanted to end. The first time I watched film was at the premiere, and after almost a year I enjoyed as the first time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"For so long, too tedious and way too little - then somehow WAY TOO MUCH.","This is a weird movie. It starts out tediously slow, building to a climax that makes the slow part worth it. That being said, the final minutes are way way way too much. The payoff is both worth it and far from worth it. Leading up to it, the whole thing is like a bloody stage play. The characters are definitely interesting and the performances are aces, but I can't help but feel off about the whole situation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"6 Stars, But Only For the Musical Score.","Unlike Quentin Tarantino the legendary film musical score composer Ennio Morricone didn't try to repeat himself. On the contrary, he did seek to avoid it, and even if this film's director hopefully didn't expect another timeless stroke of new inventional genius like in Sergio Leone's masterpiece, the iconic The Good The Bad And The Ugly, he probably didn't quite expect what he got, regardless. However, The Hateful Eight is far from a masterpiece, and not even a fully fitting musical score from the very best can make Tarantino's study of western clichés, and his signature hyper violent final into a great film. Nevertheless, just listening to the Maestro's music is much more interesting. Still, I wish that Ennio Morricone would get his well deserved Oscar for Cinema Paradiso instead, like he should.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
terrible - for a Tarantino movie,"this is a movie which i can't recommend to my buddies. after a hour of viewing i was not sure what i should think about.i thought it will be a movie like desperado's, less talking, more action.after the 2 hour i was sure what kind of movie it is. a remake of ""Murder by Death"". a movie from the late 70s.nothing new ... but boring ...Jennifer Jason Leigh does a great job, i have seen her the last time in eXistenZ. S.L.Jackson was also very good. The playtime was too long for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Tarantino Movie,"The movie equivalent of the phrase ""The Tarantino Movie"" is definitely this movie. If you have to be boring, it's a movie that can lock you on the screen because of the great acting and scene shooting.This movie, which you can watch in the same house (or even in the room) for 3 hours without getting bored, is divided into chapters. Although it seems like it will start slowly and continue slowly, with the advantage of being shot in a single location, details are scattered all over the film. Cinema buffs should definitely watch the movie more than once. Scene shots cannot be scored out of 10. It could simply be called the ""Tarantino"" level instead.The movie is still not spectacular, but decorated with such good acting. Samuel L Jackson's acting, which never fell below a certain level, became the star of the movie for me. Even though the fact that the actors go back and forth between spontaneity and insanity is a bit annoying, it's a good movie in my mind thanks to the good actors.Although I think the script is insufficient, 3 hours has been made not boring in terms of art design and stage quality. However, this does not change the fact that the subject of the movie is too short for 3 hours. Although I think it is not boring, I must admit that I watched it at 2x speed.The movie is above average, but not a masterpiece. Although you don't think it's a waste of time, if you like the concept, you can even enjoy it more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A for dialog, F for Filming Locations","""The Hateful Eight,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, presents a unique challenge and aesthetic by confining its action predominantly within a single location - a remote cabin during a blizzard. This approach is reminiscent of Tarantino's earlier work, such as ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which similarly unfolds almost entirely within a warehouse. While this confined setting can intensify the tension and focus on character dynamics, it also poses risks of monotony if not executed effectively.Tarantino's decision to limit the film's scope to one location has drawn criticism regarding its potential implications on his directorial choices. Some may argue that confining the narrative to a single cabin could signify a lack of ambition or creativity in terms of visual storytelling. Instead of exploring diverse settings, Tarantino relies heavily on dialogue and character interactions to drive the narrative forward. This approach could be interpreted as a shortcut, opting for the relative ease of filming in one location rather than the challenges of multiple locales.In spite of the boring one-dimensional setting of this movie, the dialogue is sharp, provocative, and laden with tension, showcasing Tarantino's ability to create compelling narratives through conversation alone. The characters' interactions, fueled by mistrust and hidden agendas, play out like a tense chess match, keeping the audience engaged despite the limited physical space. But for a budget of 44 million I expected more!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tarantino's murder mystery-like western epic.,"""The Hateful Eight"" is Quentin Tarantino's western epic of several strangers together stranded in a cold cabin in the middle of Wyoming. As the tale gradually unfolds, each character reveals their past and anterior motives while the audiences continues guessing who's who.The film understandably takes its time in establishing each character's personality and flavor to the mix. This makes practically every character feel essential to the story while still maintaining the pacing of the engrossing plot of delivering a prisoner to a nearby town to be hung. While the film may feel strangely different than what most are expecting due to its unlikely story structure and unusually long first act. The payoff at the end is well worth the wait.Tarantino's decision to film on location and film on actual film stock created a beautiful, almost classic looking western feel to the movie. The visual landscape is breathtaking and combined with gorgeous cinematography, this may be one of the most beautiful looking films in the year of 2015.With the exception of one or two scenes, the film is paced brilliantly. Making the three hour runtime feel like a breeze. The mood and tension and sense of paranoia feels reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing.""Unfortunately, the film does get bogged down near the end with a lot of unnecessary graphic violence and gore which adds a shock value that sometimes takes away from certain plot elements. Normally this isn't a problem but it was slightly overdone in this picture.At the end of the day though, this is a highly recommended Tarantino picture and one to genuinely study for quite some time. It's ambitious and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Bloody but Unbowed,"If there was one thing you should know about The Hateful Eight it is that the violence is tame, by modern standards, and Quentin Tarantino does not revel in it as Angelina Jolie seems to have reveled in the torture of the movie Unbroken. The violence is entirely driven by the plot and there is no more nor less than what the plot demands. That said, the plot and all of the plot twists clearly were written to maximize the blood. So, is the plot worth 168 minutes of your time? The plot? No. The acting, yes.The plot suffers from being somewhat contrived. The dialogue is clearly anachronistic especially if you seen any accurate post-civil war movies. As examples the word ""blacks"" would not have been used then. Negros, in polite conversation, darkies, or ""Niggers"" as is sometimes used in the movie. The use, by one of the characters, of the word ""dispassionate"" to describe himself also seemed forced, and out of place. As others have pointed out, the portion which is narrated also detracts from your involvement in the action.There are also some points no one has mentioned but might be noticed by one who is familiar with music: How does a piano stay in tune in a very cold cabin? It doesn't, or course. With all the things they had at their disposal why should they have been incapable of building a door latch with the wood they had? The pacing also suffers at points but the photography, the film score, and the acting are unimpeachable. So the movie is good enough to hold your interest, good enough to see and good enough (barely) for the rating I have given it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
decent movie,"This is full of blood scenes from the beginning.As it is reaching the highlight,there are much more that kind movie.To me,it is not good.I think the directer created it just for fun.Without this reason,I can't imagine why.To be honest,I wanted to watch the Taranteno's thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Wildly entertaining thanks to the screenplay, but not the finest of Tarantino's work.","The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's eighth film (considering Kill Bill Vo. 1 and Vol. 2 as a single film). As expected, this is a highly dialogue driven movie, especially the first half of the movie. You can feel the tension in the air, given the backdrop. It takes place sometime after the American Civil War, hence the insecurities. I've got to applaud the director for the first half of the movie. It's directed superbly and acted out superbly. It's probably one of those films in which nothing nerve wrecking happens, yet it keeps you on the edge of your seat (I'm simply speaking of the first half). As the second half unfolds, you see this movie turning into a classic crime drama, with thousands of questions in your mind. And mind you, classic in the more traditional sense. But that is not necessarily a good thing. As a short story, that would have been great. It seems to lose its focus, especially in the last two chapters. I wasn't a big fan of the 'explanation' to what the hell was happening. It just stuck onto the norms of similar films. Disregarding the actual plot, this is a wildly entertaining movie. The ensemble cast is great, the cinematography is top notch and the conversations between the characters are intense. Disliking each and every character is a special thing about The Hateful Eight. Some would find the movie wildly entertaining (myself included) but not the best. Others would see this as an instant classic and one of Tarantino's best. Just a matter of personal opinion. But we can all agree upon the classic screenplay in the first half and the gorgeous cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
